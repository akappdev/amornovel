So he was annoyed when he heard the crash of something falling over in the chart room. For heaven\u2019s sake , he thought darkly, scrawling orders for one of the seven patients he\u2019d admitted that evening, just put the charts back in their rows, you guys. Don\u2019t play keep-away with them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in there?\u201dShari , one of the RN floats, asked without looking up from restocking the meds cabinet.</p><p>\u201cThe guys have too much time on their hands,\u201d Jared said, writing NO NARCOTICS!!!!!!! in Mrs.</p> <p>O\u2019Leary\u2019s chart and underlining it twice. Mrs. O\u2019Leary (\u201cLike the lady with the cow, honey.\u201d) was a frequent visitor to the ER. To all the Emergency Rooms in the city, actually. She was in her late forties, impeccably groomed, ridiculously rich and hopelessly hooked on Demerol. Jared had been trying to get her into a drug treatment program for two years, to no avail. Mrs. O\u2019Leary thought drug addicts were smelly street people, not grande dames of society who contributed five figures to charity every year.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t blame them for horsing around. Third shift can be a snoozer.\u201d He glanced at his watch\u2014three in the morning, groan\u2014and swallowed a yawn.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should threaten to sic the A.A. on them,\u201dShari joked.</p><p>Jared snorted. He didn\u2019t believe in Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, a balanced federal budget, or vigilantes who ran around at night righting wrongs. The newspapers had been whispering about the A.A.\u2019s activities for almost a decade.</p><p>\u201cAt least the clerks aren\u2019t pulling this crap during first shift,\u201dShari added, shoving a hank of her strawberry-blonde hair out of her eyes.</p> <p>Jared was about to answer her when there was a dull thump. The sharp crack of someone slamming against the window brought him to his feet. He moved past an open-mouthedShari , headed for the chart room at a dead run and fairly leapt through the doorway, ready to start chewing some ass...or kicking some.</p><p>Instead, he stood there with his mouth open. Nothing he\u2019d seen in his years as an E.R. resident prepared him for the sight of a startlingly beautiful woman engaged in a vicious hand-to-hand battle with the largest man he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>And winning.</p><p>She was stunning. Petite\u2014her assailant was well over a foot taller\u2014and delicately built, with small hands and feet. Her white-blonde hair was skinned back into a French knot at the nape of her neck. She looked like a princess, one who could pour tea or break your nose, depending on how you addressed her. She was dressed in dark colors\u2014black turtleneck, black leggings, dark shoes\u2014which accentuated her fair skin and hair. Exertion had brought a delicate flush to her features.</p><p>Her assailant wasn\u2019t nearly so attractive\u2014dirty blonde hair shaved close to his skull, thick black eyebrows that met in the center of his forehead, fists the size of bowling balls, a nose that had been broken at least twice. Thick lips skinned back from his teeth as he snarled wordlessly at the woman and sent a punch whistling toward her wide-eyed face.</p><p>Jared opened his mouth to shout a warning... and the woman deftly blocked the punch, twisted the man around without letting go of his arm and slammed him, face down, on the table. Jared winced at the \u2018pop\u2019</p> <p>the man\u2019s shoulder made coming out of its socket.</p><p>The man howled curses, which were abruptly cut off as the woman grabbed a fold of skin at the nape of his neck and slammed his head into the table.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cLook out,\u201d Jared said, finally able to articulate. The woman\u2019s head snapped up and she stared at him.</p><p>For a long, electric moment, their eyes met and Jared had the absurd thought that she could see all the way down into his soul. Her mouth popped open in a small \u2018o\u2019 and she gasped, a quick intake of breath that made her breasts (high and firm, his mind reported happily) heave.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. She had the look of a doe trapped in the headlights, which was ridiculous\u2014what could he, mild-mannered physician and volleyball player\u2014do to her, kick-ass princess?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to rescue you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched at that and she sidled toward him, then dashed past him as he came forward to meet her, turning left out the door. He could hear her running lightly and damned quickly.</p> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d he yelled and took off after her. Blessed\u2014or cursed\u2014with a Texan-sized curiosity bump, he had to catch her. She could tell him why there had been a fight, who the unconscious man was, her name, and if she was free for dinner any night this week. This year. She was the most intriguing woman\u2014certainly the most beautiful\u2014he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t say \u2018he\u2019d ever met\u2019 because they hadn\u2019t exactly been properly introduced. A fact he intended to remedy, post-haste. Part of him wondered what he was doing, chasing a stranger around hospital hallways in the wee hours of the morning. Another part of him urged him to run faster .</p><p>He caught sight of her just before she darted around a corner and forced himself to put on speed. Come on, Dean, you wimp , he thought contemptuously. You\u2019ve got to be a head taller at least\u2014certainly your legs are longer. Catch up! And, on the heels of that: Where the hell is Security? For that matter, where the hell is anybody?</p><p>Speaking of dead ends, he just about had her cornered in one; she\u2019d zigged when she should have zagged and there was no door at the end of this hallway, just a window, too far above her head to climb out. She was facing him, trapped with her back against the wall, when he jogged around the corner.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d he panted, slowing his pace. \u201cAre you okay? Did that guy hurt you? Before you hurt him, I mean?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes, which had been narrowed to blue slits studying him, now widened in surprise. He was hopelessly dazzled and gave in to the feeling\u2014he was a long way between girlfriends and she really was spectacular. Had he thought her eyes were an ordinary blue? Coming closer, he could see they were the color of the sky on a cloudless day, pure and perfect.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re hurt,\u201d he said, trying not to wheeze, \u201cI\u2019d be glad to take a look at it for you. It\u2019s the least I can do, since you got me out of finishing my chart work...dull stuff, believe me.\u201d</p><p>He heard himself babbling and told himself to shut up. She said nothing, just kept studying him. He noticed she wasn\u2019t even out of breath. Kicking ass must keep her cardiovascular system in top form , he thought.</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you okay? Is there anything I can do? If you\u2019re in some kind of trouble, I can call a shelter, find you a safe place to stay.\u201d</p><p>Still she said nothing, but her lips twitched, as if fighting a smile. He wasn\u2019t sure what the joke was, but took a cautious step forward. \u201cEverything\u2019s all right,\u201d he soothed, as if calming a wild doe, \u201cnow if I can just get you to come with me, I mean without rearranging my kidneys first, we\u2019ll find an exam room, make sure you\u2019re okay and then we can talk about the trouble you\u2019re in. Whatever it is, I bet we can fix it if we put our heads together.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth and he waited eagerly, then they both heard the noise of pounding feet. Well, well</p><p>, he thought tiredly, what do you know\u2014Security finally woke up from ye olde one a.m. snoozefest.</p><p>Whatever she had been about to say was forgotten as she reached up, just barely catching the bottom edge of the window. The hospital\u2019s windows were old\u2014no wire mesh\u2014and deep-set. He watched with utter astonishment as she grabbed hold of the ledge and flipped her legs up and over her head, her boots smashing through the glass and the rest of her following through.</p><p>He figured it was a good thing they were in the lowest level of the hospital, because he had the feeling she would have gone through that window even if they\u2019d been ten stories up. He wondered if the boots she wore had protected her from lacerations. Given the woman\u2019s incredible speed and luck, he assumed they had.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was nice meeting you,\u201d he said numbly and was nearly run over as two security guards came thundering around the corner. \u201cShe went thataway,\u201d he added, pointed to the shattered window. \u201cAnd don\u2019t even try, she\u2019s long gone. Come on, I\u2019ll show you where the other one is.\u201d</p><p>The guards had a thousand questions. Jared couldn\u2019t tell them much and what he could tell them\u2014the woman won, the woman was incredibly tough but seemed strangely vulnerable, the woman had eyes like the sky, the woman was going to be the mother of his children\u2014he prudently kept to himself.</p><p>\u201cYou said the other one was in here, Dr. Dean?\u201d one of the guards asked and that was when Jared saw the woman\u2019s assailant was gone. The only thing left of him was a small puddle of blood on the table, presumably from a nosebleed. \u201cFan out,\u201d the guard said to the others, \u201che can\u2019t have gone far, not after Dr. Dean bashed him around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Jared began and then shut up. He didn\u2019t want to get the woman in more trouble, so he\u2019d take the blame for KO\u2019ing the bad guy. It hadn\u2019t been the first time people had taken in his size and assumed he was capable of violence. And he had been, in his youth\u2014certainly he\u2019d been in more of his share of after-school scuffles. But years of stitching up victims, of probing for bullets and setting smashed limbs, had made him lose his taste for it. \u201cUh...actually, I should get back to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a description for us, doc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Nosebleed? Sure. About six-five, two hundred fifty pounds, shaved blonde hair, one black eyebrow, one dislocated shoulder, one broken nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d the guard asked, stepping close to Jared and sniffing him. This might have been intended to be a subtle move on the guard\u2019s part, except the man had a deviated septum and Jared could hear the shrill whistling intake when the man inhaled. \u201cBroken nose, one eyebrow, we\u2019ll get right on it. You have anything to drink before you came on-shift?\u201d Sniff-sniff. Whistle-whistle.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Jared snapped. \u201cI gave up booze when I took up heroin. Seriously, I haven\u2019t had a drop. The bad guy really did look like some sort of mutated freak of nature. Now go get him!\u201d Before he catches up with what\u2019s-her-name, he added silently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The guards went, save for one who stayed behind to make sure Jared did his part of the dreary paperwork. Jared obediently followed him to the Security Office to fill out a report.</p><p>For the rest of his shift, he couldn\u2019t help looking over his shoulder and peeking around corners, as if the woman might have come back. Ridiculous thought...but Jared kept an eye out, regardless.</p><p>He wondered who she was.</p> <p>It took Kara an hour to stop trembling. Every time she started to calm down, the thought... Jesus! He almost had her! ...would cycle back into her brain and she\u2019d get the shakes again.</p><p>Carlotti, who\u2019d been an utter creep since he was ten (and possibly before that) had chased her around like a dog, cornered her and likely would have killed her (after having a little fun at first, the raping swine) if she hadn\u2019t gotten the drop on him.</p><p>She had spotted him before she was even all the way through the door of the club and immediately turned and walked out. She started running when she heard him scrambling behind her and the chase was on.</p><p>Now, in the privacy of her apartment, she collapsed on her thirty-dollar thrift shop couch (tastefully upholstered in puke orange) and relived the chase. Carlotti was big, but fast...and driven. If fear had been the fuel for her legs, hatred was his.</p><p>Screw up one lousy drug shipment for the guy by siccing the Man on him, she thought morosely and that five years ago! And he\u2019s still holding a grudge, still wants to kill me. Guy\u2019s watched a few too many Godfather movies .</p> <p>That was Carlotti\u2019s problem\u2014one of his problems, anyway\u2014he fancied himself a Corleone, when in reality he was a Clouseau. Everyone on the wrong side of the law knew the mob wasn\u2019t the all-seeing, vengeance-taking organization depicted in the movies. And as for \u201corganized crime\u201d\u2014ha! It wasn\u2019t organized at all. A few groups of loosely connected dealers, that was all. Sometimes they were successful in contracting crime to the local talent...most times, not.</p><p>These days, the Mob was a lot more interested in legitimate business: video arcades, karaoke bars, and beauty salons. It was absolutely ridiculous how much a thriving salon could make in a fiscal year, especially if they also handled manicures. Lucrative and infinitely less dangerous.</p><p>Only the real idiots stayed in the drug trade, she knew. Too much heat, the Feds had no tolerance for it and the fall was long if you got pinched. Carlotti, of course, was a real idiot and thus he fancied himself a Mob Drug Lord. And, as a faithful disciple of mob movie fiction, he was still after her. As he\u2019d proved tonight.</p><p>Shivering a little, she got up off the couch and headed for her mini-bathroom. No shower, a cracked tub and a rust-stained sink...the room was so small, when she sat on the toilet her knees touched the wall. It didn\u2019t matter. It was hers and she liked to think of it as a fox den, a haven from predators.</p><p>She sat down on the rim of the tub and started to fill it with warm water\u2014after tonight, she needed to get Carlotti\u2019s stink off her\u2014and thought about the idiot. She\u2019d run for the hospital, naively thinking he wouldn\u2019t follow her to a well-lit, populated building. She hadn\u2019t counted on how deserted a hospital would be at three a.m. He\u2019d finally cornered her and found out that a thief was never more dangerous than when her back was to the wall.</p><p>And the doctor who had seen everything\u2014what was that about? He\u2019d watched her, tried to warn her and she could still feel the heat of his dark gaze. If she closed her eyes she could still see him: so broad-shouldered he nearly filled the doorway, with lush dark hair and the blackest eyes, strong, long-fingered hands...and a grin like lightning, a grin that lit up his whole face.</p> <p>He\u2019d chased her, but, to her surprise, not to hurt her or turn her in. To ask if she was all right. To ask if she needed a safe place to stay. She must have stared at him for an hour, or so it seemed. Who knows what she might have said\u2014or done\u2014if Security hadn\u2019t showed up. His gaze had been so curiously intense and his smile...his marvelous smile...</p><p>A sudden thought made her straighten up so quickly she nearly tumbled into the tub. The doctor had seen Carlotti. And could testify against him. If the D.A. found out, he\u2019d subpoena the doc in a nanosecond. The doc couldn\u2019t testify to much, but anything was a start\u2014didn\u2019t Capone go down for tax evasion? The D.A. would be glad to get Carlotti on trespassing and attempted assault, if only so he could introduce his suspicions to a judge.</p><p>If word got out that there was one eyewitness, others would certainly follow...the D.A. could build a case from whispers. God knew they did it all the time. And Carlotti\u2019s worst fear was doing time. When he was thirteen, he\u2019d killed a witness to his shoplifting, just to avoid being shipped back to Juvie.</p><p>The doctor was in very real danger. Carlotti had to shut him up, the sooner the better. The psycho wouldn\u2019t have to worry about her\u2014the D.A. was at least as interested in putting her behind bars as he was in Carlotti\u2014but he had to worry about the doctor. He probably had men working on the problem already.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d she sighed and got up to make the first of several cups of coffee.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>The next night, Jared was still thinking about the woman and still mentally yelling at himself to forget about her. You\u2019ll never see her again , he told himself, followed by, also, the whole thing was probably a hallucination brought on by too much paperwork. Proof that spending too much time on chartwork is bad for you. Trouble was, he couldn\u2019t get her out of his mind. Even now, when he was supposed to be snoozing in the third floor on-call room, he was tossing and turning on the narrow bunk, fantasizing about what\u2019s-her-name instead of getting the sleep he needed.</p><p>He\u2019d asked around, but no one knew of a beautiful blonde goddess who ran like a deer and punched like a middleweight champion. Some of the nurses had suggested it was time he started dating again. One of the orderlies told him once he got more sleep, the hallucinations would stop. That was the trouble with being the hospital wiseass...when you had a serious problem, no one believed it.</p> <p>Tap-tap.</p><p>Hell, it wasn\u2019t like he was hard up for female companionship. He worked with at least ten female docs and three times that many nurses. Not to mention x-ray techs, the lab ladies, the social workers...heck, wasn\u2019t the hospital chaplain a woman? One of the benefits of being an E.R. doc was that he got to visit all the wards, got to meet all the\u2014</p><p>Tap-tap.</p><p>\u2014staff outside his department and he should just\u2014</p><p>Tap-tap-tap.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d he muttered, getting up and crossing the room. He had a flashback to one of his literature classes. \u201cWho is that tapping, tapping at my chamber door?\u201d he boomed, pulling back the curtain and expecting to see...he wasn\u2019t sure. A branch, rasping across the glass? A pigeon? Instead, he found himself gazing into a face ten inches from his own. \u201cAaiiggh!\u201d</p><p>It was her. Crouched on the ledge, perfectly balanced on the balls of her feet, she had one small fist raised, doubtless ready to knock again. When she saw him, she gestured patiently to the lock. He dimly noticed she was dressed like a normal person instead of a burglar\u2014navy leggings and a matching turtleneck\u2014and wondered why she wasn\u2019t shivering with cold.</p><p>He groped for the latch, dry-mouthed with fear for her. They were three stories up! If she should lose her balance...if a gust of wind should come up...the latch finally yielded to his fumbling fingers and he wrenched the window open, grabbing for her. She leaned back, out of the reach of his arms and his heart stopped\u2014actually stopped, ka-THUD!\u2014in his chest. He backpedaled away from the window. \u201cOkay, okay, sorry, didn\u2019t mean to startle you now would you please get your ass in here ?\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows at him and complied, swinging one leg over the ledge and stepping down into the room. He collapsed on the cot, clutching his chest. \u201cCould you please not ever ever do that again?\u201d</p><p>he gasped. \u201cChrist! My heart! What\u2019s going on? How\u2019d you get up there? Did the nurses lock all the entrances again? They do that when they\u2019re overworked...\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuoth the raven, nevermore,\u201d she said and helped herself to a cup of coffee from the pot set up next to the window. At his surprised gape, she smiled a little and tapped her ear. \u201cThin glass. I heard you through the window. \u2018While I pondered, nearly napping, suddenly there came a rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\u2019 I think that\u2019s how it goes. Also, the man you saw me bludgeon into unconsciousness dropped a dime on you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDropped a dime. Rolled you over. Put you out. Phoned you in. Wants to clock you. Wants to drop you. Made arrangements to have you killed, pronto. Sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d he said numbly.</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d she said patiently, \u201cis there sugar?\u201d</p><p>He pointed to the last locker on the left and thought to warn her too late. When she opened it (first wrapping her sleeve around her hand, he noticed), several hundred tea bags, salt packets and sugar cubes tumbled out, free of their overstuffed, poorly stacked boxes. She quickly stepped back; avoiding the rain of sweetener, then bent, picked a cube off the floor, blew on it and dropped it into her cup. She shoved the locker door with her knee until it grudgingly shut, trapping a dozen or so tea bags and sugar packets in the bottom with a grinding sound that set his teeth on edge.</p><p>She went to the door, thumbed the lock with her sleeve, then came back and sat down at the table opposite the cot. She took a tentative sip of her coffee and then another, not so tentative. He was impressed\u2014the hospital coffee tasted like primeval mud. \u201cSo that\u2019s the scoop,\u201d she said casually.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here to kill me?\u201d he asked, trying to keep up with the twists and turns of the last forty seconds.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the hitman? Hitperson?\u201d Who knocked for entry? he added silently.</p><p>\u201cMe? Do wet work?\u201d She threw her head back and pealed laughter at the ceiling. She had, he noticed admiringly, a great laugh. Her hair was plaited in a long blonde braid, halfway down her back. He wondered what it would look like unbound and spread across his pillow. \u201cOh, that\u2019s very funny, Dr. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I\u2019ve got a million of \u2018em.\u201d Pause. \u201cHow did you know my name?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. It was a nice smile, warm, with no condescension. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard to find out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked boldly. He should have been nervous about the locked door, about the threat to his life. He wasn\u2019t. Instead, he was delighted at the chance to talk to her, after a day of thinking about her and wondering how she was...who she was.</p><p>\u201cKara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s gorgeous,\u201d he informed her, \u201cand I, of course, am unsurprised. You\u2019re so pretty! And so deadly,\u201d he added with relish, \u201cyou\u2019re like one of those flowers that people can\u2019t resist picking and then\u2014bam! Big-time rash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, \u201cI think.\u201d She blushed, which gave her high color and made her eyes bluer. He stared, besotted. He didn\u2019t think women blushed anymore. He didn\u2019t think women who beat up thugs blushed at all. He was very much afraid his mouth was hanging open and unable to do a thing about it.</p><p>\u201cDr. Dean\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014I\u2019m not sure you understand the seriousness of the situation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong, tall and ugly is out to get me,\u201d he said, sitting down opposite her. He shoved a pile of charts aside; several clattered to the floor and she watched them fall, bemused. \u201cBut since you\u2019re not the hitman, I\u2019m not too worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m your self-appointed bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, then I\u2019m not worried at all,\u201d he said with feigned carelessness, while his brain chewed that one... bodyguard? ...over.</p><p>\u201cYou could take on an assassin with one hand while writing a grocery list with the other. You\u2019re certainly a match for whoever that guy sends after me. So, do I pay you? Should we even be talking about money? What\u2019s the etiquette here?\u201d</p> <p>She blinked. \u201cUh...that won\u2019t be necessary. Dr. Dean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014may I say, you\u2019re taking this remarkably well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork in an E.R. for a year,\u201d he said, suddenly grim. \u201cYou learn to recover your equilibrium pretty damned quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cSo now what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you don\u2019t get killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, what happens now? What do we do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to sic the cops on the bad guy, right? Do we\u2014er\u2014drop a dime on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo cops!\u201d she said, startling him. She hadn\u2019t been this rattled when Ugo had been trying to smash her face in. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep you out of trouble until this blows over. End of plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlows over?\u201d he practically shouted. \u201cI have to\u2014 we have to put our lives on hold until ole\u2019 One Eyebrow goes away? Forgive me, but I thought you were a little more pro-active than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut when the law is involved, I can\u2019t be as pro-active as I\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...aren\u2019t you in trouble, too? Won\u2019t Jerkoff try to kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s been trying,\u201d she said casually, as if a large, frightening, ugly man trying to kill her was of as much consequence as a threatened spring shower. \u201cFor years. He\u2019ll never get me. Too dumb. Too slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo lame a bad guy, sounds like,\u201d he muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s almost embarrassing to be on his shit list.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cThis is serious. You\u2019re a sitting duck because you\u2019re different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean because I have two eyebrows?\u201d</p><p>She giggled into her cup and he was absurdly pleased with himself. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re a citizen. A taxpayer, one of the good guys. Not like Carlotti.\u201d</p><p>He pounced. \u201cNot like you?\u201d</p><p>The smile vanished, poof! \u201cYou ask a lot of questions, Dr. Dean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared. And you\u2019re still in trouble from this guy, same as I am. Who\u2019s going to look out for you? I mean, if you get sick or hit by a car or have chest pains, I\u2019m your man, but if a hit squad starts shooting at you to shut you up, I\u2019ll be the one cowering in the corner with my hands over my ears.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and tried to hide it, but he saw it and grinned back at her. \u201cCarlotti knows he has nothing to fear from me in court,\u201d she explained, getting up to refill her cup. She disdained the sugar locker and drank it black, making an appreciative face. He couldn\u2019t believe it\u2014of all the things to happen this evening, beautiful Kara enjoying the hospital\u2019s interpretation of coffee was the strangest. \u201cI can\u2019t testify against him.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t elaborate, but Jared was able to figure that one out. There were only two reasons not to testify against anyone: fear\u2014which Kara didn\u2019t seem to know the meaning of\u2014and having something to hide. You didn\u2019t testify for the D.A. if the D.A. had something on you as well.</p><p>He wondered what she had done.</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s go see the D.A.,\u201d he said, seizing the bull by the horns.</p><p>\u201cYou may, if you like,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cbut you\u2019ll go alone and I would prefer to wait and see what happens.\u201d</p><p>Which meant she knew a lot more than she was telling. He had the feeling if he insisted on seeing the D.A.; he\u2019d for a fact never see her again.</p><p>He instantly decided that was an unacceptable course of action. Screw the risk to his personal health!</p><p>He had to get to know this woman.</p><p>\u201cSo...what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wait until Carlotti is arrested. It shouldn\u2019t be long. A lot of people are looking for him.\u201d She said that with cool relish and he made a mental note to never get on her bad side. \u201cWhen he\u2019s arrested, you\u2019re out of danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he have hench-thugs who could still get me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIn theory. But they won\u2019t make a move without him breathing in their ears. You can see the D.A.\u2014his name is Thomas Wechter, by the way, second floor of the courthouse, take a left past the water fountain\u2014and tell him your story, tell him you\u2019re willing to testify, ask to see the rest of his case. If he has one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d he asked, trying once again, even though he knew it was useless. The same tenacity that made other doctors literally pull him off a DOA wouldn\u2019t let him back away from this. \u201cYou were wronged by Carstupidi. You should testify that he tried to kill you! I mean, Jesus\u2014that big bully, if you hadn\u2019t cleaned his clock, I would have.\u201d</p><p>She snorted and he raised an eyebrow at her. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI was just picturing you and Carlotti\u2014but you were talking about the D.A. I can\u2019t testify. It\u2019s all up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d he asked boldly, sure she\u2019d rebuff him, or deny fear. Instead, she just gave him a level look.</p><p>\u201cNothing I could explain to you,\u201d she said quietly, then got up, poured the rest of her coffee down the sink and walked to the window. She took the cup with her, he noticed. After a moment, he got it: she was so paranoid, she wouldn\u2019t take a chance on leaving fingerprints behind. Interesting. \u201cSee you around, Dr. Dean. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d She stepped up to the windowsill.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jared ,\u201d he yelled, darting after her, \u201cand use the door , for God\u2019s sake! Look, it\u2019s right here.\u201d He rattled the doorknob invitingly; she ignored him. \u201cI can walk you to the main entrance. Ha! Some bodyguard!\u201d he practically screamed and that got her attention; she paused and turned, looking at him over her shoulder, one foot already on the ledge. \u201cLeaving me here to rot! I\u2019m easy pickings for Carlotti\u2019s henchmorons.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cHardly. I\u2019ll be close. Good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d But the window closed firmly and when he darted to it to look out, it was so dark he couldn\u2019t see her anymore.</p><p>Ten hours later, he let himself into his apartment. A long shift, but a busy and rewarding one...only one death and that one a DNR, an eighty-seven year old woman who had been praying for death for the better part of a year, according to her calmly tearful daughter. Tough, but it could have been so much worse. Was so much worse, frequently.</p><p>He often wondered how he had ended up where he was\u2014a physician, someone who dealt with death every day. In school he\u2019d been an amiable goof-off, the class clown, never taking anything or anyone seriously. Strange that he had been drawn to a career that was, at times, absolutely the furthest thing from humorous.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he\u2019d lost someone close to him, had been marked forever by the death of a parent or close friend. Hell, he\u2019d never had so much as a pet die on him. But in college he\u2019d taken an EMT course and as part of the training he had to volunteer at a busy metro hospital.</p><p>Looking at the suffering around him, he watched the doctors and nurses ease that suffering, pull off miracle cures, reunite families. He remembered thinking, That looks a helluva lot more satisfying than working in an office or going out to L.A. to do stand-up. Making people laugh is one thing. Giving them their lives back is another. He had gone home that night and applied to five pre-med programs.</p><p>His father, seeing his slack-ass son filling out college applications instead of watching Friends re-runs, had nearly wept with relief.</p><p>He was walking past the couch, intent on the kitchen and a sandwich, when he saw Kara was deeply asleep on his couch, curled under a yellow fleece throw. He nearly walked into the end table.</p><p>He turned around, tiptoed back to his front door and examined the lock. Absolutely no signs of tampering. Then he walked to the windows, which were all locked on the inside. The woman was a marvel, a ghost, a\u2014a rich woman if she ever decided to use her powers to aid the forces of evil.</p><p>He went to stand over her again, wanting to talk to her, but also wanting to let her sleep. If she had stayed close, as she said she would\u2014and he didn\u2019t think she would lie to him\u2014she\u2019d had a long day, most of it probably spent huddled on ledges. She hadn\u2019t heard him come in through the door and he hadn\u2019t been taking particular care to be quiet. Clearly she was exhausted. He would let her sleep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Except...</p><p>Except her hair, in the faint gleam from the streetlight, was muted gold, the color of nuggets brought up from the river, gleaming dully and worth thousands. It was the first time he\u2019d seen it down and he itched to touch, caress...</p><p>He reached out a trembling hand and stroked her hair where it curved along her skull, realizing with happy dismay that he was falling in love with a woman he knew nothing about, not even her last name.</p> <p>It was his last happy thought for a while. She came awake like a cat in the dark: one minute dead to the world, the next utterly alert. Her hand came up, seized his wrist in a grip slightly less breakable than handcuffs and pulled. Hard. He rocketed toward her and somehow\u2014he didn\u2019t think this was possible to do from a prone position\u2014she flipped him over the end of the couch. She didn\u2019t let go of his wrist and a split-second later he was on his butt in the dust and she was looking down at him from the back of the couch, still holding his wrist, which started to throb from the pressure.</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d she complained, letting go. \u201cDon\u2019t scare me like that.\u201d</p><p>He could feel his eyes bulge. \u201cDon\u2019t scare you ?\u201d he croaked, climbing slowly to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who broke in, dammit! Jesus Christ, I come into my apartment\u2014 my apartment\u2014and here you are, dead to the world, a\u2014a breaker and enterer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t break,\u201d she said reasonably. \u201cJust entered.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014then you wake up and kick my ass. Who scared who?\u201d He finished standing and was pleasantly surprised to find his legs were supporting him. His heart rate felt quite high\u2014like about six hundred.</p> <p>\u201cSome bodyguard!\u201d</p><p>She snorted, then the snort turned into a laugh. She choked off the sound almost at once and looked at him, stone-faced. \u201cI apologize for startling you. Something woke me up\u2014\u201d</p><p>He coughed, knowing his pawing her hair had been what awakened her and unwilling to impart this information at the moment.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and then I saw a large man\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA large, incredibly handsome, virile man,\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>\u201c\u2014leaning over me and I acted instinctively. How\u2019s the wrist? Good thing I didn\u2019t break it on the way down,\u201d she added thoughtfully.</p> <p>\u201cYes, that is a good thing, I retract my whining, instead I\u2019ll count my blessings. You could have broken my arm, caved in my skull, reached into my chest and pulled out my still-beating heart and showed it to me.\u201d</p><p>She looked away. \u201cErr...I\u2019m not quite that bad. You have...\u201d She eyed him as he hustled toward the kitchen, remembering he hadn\u2019t eaten in seven hours. \u201c...admirable equilibrium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what all my bodyguards say,\u201d he replied affably over his shoulder. \u201cHow about some breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be lovely,\u201d she admitted, carefully folding the blanket she had been using. She placed it gently at the end of the couch and followed him into the kitchen. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind my coming here.</p><p>I didn\u2019t hurt your lock\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d he assured her. \u201cYou can come over anytime. Do you want a key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not necessary,\u201d she said with a straight face.</p><p>\u201cI know that. But maybe it\u2019ll be a little faster than picking my lock every...no?\u201d he said as she shook her head. \u201cHo, boy. That\u2019s some childhood you must have had.\u201d</p> <p>She changed the subject...but later, when he thought about the conversation, he realized she hadn\u2019t changed it at all. \u201cHow is the little boy?\u201d</p><p>He looked up from removing ingredients from the refrigerator. \u201cLittle boy?\u201d</p><p>She perched on a stool beside the counter. \u201cHe came in the E.R. with multiple stab wounds. Dark hair, about seven years old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. He was stable when I left. Amazingly, the bastard who did the cutting managed to miss virtually every major organ and blood vessel. His mother\u2019s boyfriend,\u201d Jared added, whipping eggs in a stainless steel bowl. \u201cCarved the kid up when Mama left him. In Cleopatra\u2019s time, they used strangulation as the death penalty. Kind of makes you long for the good old days, huh?\u201d</p><p>She nodded seriously, though he had\u2014he thought he had\u2014been joking. Dark humor, the kind he took refuge in when terrible things happened to little kids. To anyone. \u201cSomeone should kill the boyfriend,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cThat kind never stops.\u201d She drummed her fingers on the counter, thinking.</p><p>\u201cNow wait a minute,\u201d he protested. \u201cI can see you trying to fit killing the boyfriend into your busy schedule\u2014between bodyguarding me and grocery shopping and single-handedly cracking every safe on the block\u2014and you\u2019ve got to forget it. If you killed everybody you thought deserved it, you\u2019d never be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think someone who stabs a little boy five times deserves to be removed from the planet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s not our call.\u201d</p><p>She snorted, such an incongruous sound with her delicate exterior that he nearly laughed out loud.</p><p>\u201cSpoken like a true sheep.\u201d</p><p>He grated cheese irritably. \u201cWhat, because I don\u2019t go around like Vince the Vigilante, I\u2019m a sheep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said patiently, \u201cyou\u2019re a sheep because you don\u2019t right wrongs.\u201d</p><p>He slammed the bowl on the counter and leaned across it, until his face was two inches from hers. \u201cI had that child\u2019s blood up to my elbows,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me I don\u2019t right wrongs.\u201d He leaned back, forcing his temper down. \u201cAnd how\u2019d you know about the kid, anyway? I didn\u2019t see you in the E.R. all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, just use the door once in a while so I can see you coming and going.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t smile, just looked at him with serious eyes. \u201cYou know what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, whittling away at a shallot until it was a delicate pile of white and green shavings. \u201cI know and I accept with thanks. For the record, I run into plenty of people whose lungs I\u2019d like to remove without benefit of anesthesia. But if I concentrated on that, I couldn\u2019t do my job. Saving lives is more important to me than avenging them.\u201d</p><p>She shifted on her stool, causing the white t-shirt she wore to mold to her breasts for a moment. He looked away before he accidentally cut off his thumb. \u201cThat sounds nice. You\u2019re great at your job, I could tell. The nurses,\u201d she added dryly, \u201cseem especially impressed with your...hands.\u201d</p><p>He waved the knife at her. \u201cGo on,\u201d he said modestly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said go on. Do they talk about how tall I am, how handsome, how smart, how I\u2019m the most fascinating man they\u2019ve ever known, the finest doctor, the best volleyball player?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey talk about how it\u2019s been a while since you were caught in the meds closet with one of the orthopedic surgeons.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cOne time! It was only one time. I was young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve grown decades since then in wisdom. What else do you want in your omelet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019re having. Don\u2019t change the subject. Are you still seeing her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no.\u201d He poured two large glasses of milk. \u201cShe used me to get even with her fianc\u00e9. A ten minute grope in the closet and she was off to confess her infidelity and demand he start paying attention to her\u2014uh\u2014needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he said gloomily, sliding the raw egg mixture into the pan. \u201cAnd somehow I ended up with this ridiculous stud reputation. Most of the women who come on to me are looking for a no-commitment-quickie and the ones I\u2019d like to get to know think I\u2019m a pig and won\u2019t have anything to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d she said and he jerked his head up at her tone. She hadn\u2019t sounded sympathetic.</p><p>She\u2019d sounded almost...pleased?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I deserve,\u201d he sighed, \u201cfor giving in to her womanly wiles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your wiles? More milk, please,\u201d she added when he opened the fridge to put the carton away.</p><p>\u201cI am wile-less. And you never answered my question\u2014how\u2019d you know about the boy? And the orthopedic surgeon, for that matter,\u201d he added under his breath.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an inner-city emergency room,\u201d she pointed out, looking on with interest as he slid a perfect omelet onto her plate. \u201cI could walk in on my hands and the only one to notice would be the triage nurse and the only thing she\u2019d want to know was my insurance number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d he asked, beginning to cook his own omelet.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked with her mouth full.</p><p>\u201cWalk on your hands?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, dabbed her lips (full and pouty, his mind reported uselessly), grinned at him, then arched backward on her stool. In a moment her head and torso had disappeared and he could see her legs receding as she carefully walked away from him on her hands.</p><p>He applauded. She came back to her feet, slightly flushed and looking pleased and took her seat, rubbing her hands on her thighs. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing,\u201d he said admiringly. \u201cYou can do everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t like me if you really knew me,\u201d she said, then pressed her lips together so hard they went white. He had the feeling she wasn\u2019t in the habit of making candid comments to near-strangers.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not to like?\u201d he said, trying to sound casual, to cover up the bald truth in his question.</p><p>She shook her head at him and finished her omelet in silence. \u201cWonderful,\u201d she said, pushing the empty plate away. \u201cThe best breakfast I ever had. Where did you learn to cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad was a chef.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe and my mom retired and moved to North Carolina. Now they golf and wear ugly clothes and make fun of the tourists. It\u2019s a shameful thing, I\u2019ve been searching for a cure for them. Where are your folks?\u201d</p><p>He rinsed the plates in silence, sure she wouldn\u2019t answer him.</p><p>\u201cDead,\u201d she said finally. \u201cThey died when I was just a kid. I went to a foster family the week after they died and when my foster mother broke my arm I ran away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he said softly. He crossed the room, wanting to take her into his arms, not sure how to bridge the sudden gulf between them. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I remember my parents. You don\u2019t miss what you never had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong, gorgeous. That\u2019s the stuff you miss most of all.\u201d And carefully, so carefully, he put his arms around her and drew her close.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she said, staring at his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWant to bet?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth was a dream, the nicest dream he\u2019d ever had, all sweet lips and lush softness. She pressed against him and he felt her breasts flatten slightly against his chest, felt her arms come around him, felt her mouth bloom beneath his. She sighed into his mouth and he shuddered, balling his hands into fists so he wouldn\u2019t tear off her clothes and take her on the kitchen tile, which hadn\u2019t been mopped since he was a med student. He heard her make a sound, some sound, a cross between a growl and a whimper and heard himself groan in response. Then she came to herself\u2014or perhaps came away from herself, back to the cool exterior she liked to show the world\u2014and stiffened and took her arms away and pushed him back.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, not very, but not interested in gaining a black eye either, \u201cbut you\u2019re so beautiful and\u2014and good, I can\u2019t resist you.\u201d</p><p>She looked startled, then sad. \u201cI\u2019m not good. I\u2019m bad. You should keep it in mind, Jared.\u201d She touched her mouth, then looked at him with something like wonder.</p><p>\u201cAnybody who has Carlotti for an enemy\u2014who would protect a stranger from her enemy\u2014isn\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done...terrible things. You wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me,\u201d he urged softly. He took a step toward her and she skittered back, nearly tripping over the stool to keep away from him. He was struck once again by the combination of power and vulnerability.</p><p>She could snap his spine like a breadstick, he was sure. And yet, she was afraid of his touch. \u201cOr not,\u201d</p> <p>he joked, hoping to lighten the mood. \u201cHey, I\u2019ve done terrible things, too. In med school one time, I brought my cadaver to breakfast at the local Denny\u2019s. Man,\u201d he said nostalgically, \u201cthe food inspector sure got pissed. On the bright side, my cadaver was a cheap date.\u201d</p><p>She giggled, then choked off the sound and looked at him severely. \u201cNo more of that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m here to keep you safe for a few days, not to play wifey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play wifey,\u201d he said promptly, \u201cmarry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, ha.\u201d</p><p>He decided not to mention the fact that he wasn\u2019t kidding. \u201cSo now what happens?\u201d he asked.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>Good question, Kara thought, once again stretched out on the couch. She had decided to look after Dr.</p><p>Dean\u2014Jared\u2014for a very simple reason and her conscience had nothing to do with it. He had chased her not to hurt her or turn her in, but to ask if she was all right. That was when she realized Carlotti would come after him. That was why she was here. Jared\u2019s stunning good looks, great sense of humor and outstanding dedication to helping others had nothing to do with it. There were plenty of good looking men in the world. Gorgeous, dark-haired men with a lightning smile. With a sense of common decency that was as much a part of him as his white coat and stethoscope. Phenomenal at healing and cooking, stitching head gashes with the same hands that whipped up a perfectly fluffy omelet. Dr. Dean was nothing special. Not him.</p> <p>That surgeon, she thought with disgust. The bimbo who used him and dumped him. He\u2019s too good for someone that idiotic.</p><p>She slammed the pillow over her head, muffling a groan. And if he\u2019s too good for a surgeon, she reminded herself savagely, he\u2019s a damn sight too good for you, silly bitch .</p><p>So the question remained: now what happens?</p><p>Sleep. Then lunch. He hadn\u2019t wanted to go to bed; he\u2019d wanted to keep talking to her. She first thought it might have been because he was interested in knowing her as a person, but that was too conceited to be considered for more than a moment. No, she was interesting to him, like a virus was interesting, if dangerous. He knew she could shake up his nice little life and so he was drawn to her, the way the new kids at Juvie were drawn to the ones who graduated to robbery and murder.</p><p>So he\u2019d kept after her, talking to her and asking questions and telling her about himself and when she reminded him he hadn\u2019t slept in twenty hours, he had looked stubborn and shrugged and asked her what her earliest memory was, because his was of his dad chopping onions while onion-tears streamed down his face and ever since then he\u2019d felt kind of funny about onions, they were \u201cthe meanest vegetable\u201d.</p><p>Tomatoes were the nicest, so round and sweet and juicy, they were\u2014</p><p>She interrupted him, he argued, they bargained. He agreed to sleep for a few hours if she would let him take her to lunch when he woke. To which she agreed, looking forward to the lunch and mad at herself for looking forward to it.</p><p>He had given her a longing look over his shoulder as he trudged to his solitary bed and she\u2019d been ridiculously tempted to follow him and undress him and find out if he was as good at other things as he was as kissing.</p><p>But that was madness, pure and simple and she wasn\u2019t about to open herself up to a citizen, someone who didn\u2019t know the first thing about survival or what she had been through. Someone who would be shocked and horrified at what she did. Someone who would wait around long enough for her to love him, then abandon her once she depended on him.</p><p>Dr. Jared Dean was the best kisser in the world. And she didn\u2019t intend to find out anything beyond that.</p><p>It was no use. He couldn't sleep. He pulled his pillow from beneath his head and punched it. It was too hot-- he was too hot\u2014and Kara was too close.</p><p>The more he tried to ignore the fact that The Delectable One was sleeping just a few feet away, the randier he got. It wasn't fair...why couldn't his bodyguard be dull and ugly? Uncomplicated and bow-legged?</p><p>It's just because you're in a dry spell, he told himself. When was the last time you got horizontal with anybody? The last time you got some nooky, they were still debating whether Gore or Bush had won the election. Right? So just...put her out of your mind.</p><p>Right. Sure. Piece of cake. Ha!</p><p>As if in response to his frustration, his door creaked open with ominous slowness. Jared clutched the blanket beneath his chin and stared at the large, menacing silhouette framed in the doorway. He was a fan of horror movies, so he knew he was about to be stalked, chased, then cut in half with a table saw, only to be saved at the last minute so he could appear in the sequel. A bad sequel.</p><p>\"Leave me alone,\" he said to the approaching silhouette. \"Go find Jennifer Love Hewitt.\"</p><p>The silhouette stopped short of his bed. His curtains were wide open, and as the moon came out from behind the clouds he saw it was Kara. Her silhouette was menacingly huge because she was wearing an armadillo suit.</p><p>\"That's a new look for you,\" he observed.</p><p>\"God, I want you,\" she replied, approaching so quickly her armadillo tail knocked everything off his bedside table. \"You're all I can think about, Jared.\"</p><p>\"That's nice. Really! Uh. What are you doing?\"</p><p>She was unscrewing the jar she was holding. Then she tossed the lid behind her where it hit the floor with a clatter. She reached into the jar with her armadillo paw and extracted something small. Which she flung at him.</p><p>Jared felt the pickle slice hit his forehead with a wet smack. \"Pickled vegetables make me sooooo horny,\" she whispered. She then upended the jar all over herself. Pickle juice rained down on his floor...and her armadillo suit. She writhed and moaned within the dill scented shower.</p><p>\"On any other day, I would find this extremely weird.\" In fact, he felt pretty sanguine about what was happening. \"However, it's been one of those days, so nothing surprises me.\"</p><p>He heard a purring sound as she unzipped her armadillo suit and stepped out of it. For a moment she was naked in the moonlight, her skin almost alabaster in the eerie lighting. Then she pounced on him. Her breasts brushed his chin as she leaned forward and sucked the pickle off his forehead. He heard her crunch, gulp, then felt her tongue as it slid back and forth across his forehead.</p><p>\"Ummmm,\" she moaned, \"Vlassic.\"</p><p>\"Uh...Kara...are you on any medication that you want to\u2014?\"</p><p>\"Shut up and take me,\" she commanded, her breath redolent with dill. \"Take me like you know I want to be taken.\"</p><p>\"Okay...but I'll have to stop and fill up my gas tank, first.\"</p><p>\"Stop that. There's something you should know.\"</p><p>\"I can't imagine what the hell it could be,\" he said, with perfect truth.</p><p>\"When I eat pickles...afterwards, I must always wash them down with your dick.\"</p><p>\"Wha\u2014aigh!\" Shockingly, she reached back and grabbed him. Even more shocking, he was as firm as a crisp pickle.</p><p>Quick as a fish, she whipped around and dived for his dick like a gull diving for a herring. Instantly her warm, wet mouth was on him, while he was face-to-face, so to speak, with her delectable ass. It looked good enough to eat. He leaned forward and gently bit down on the plump, smooth flesh.</p><p>She hummed in response, which sent glorious vibrations through his dick, vibrations he felt all the way up to his eyeballs.</p><p>Her head was pistoning up and down like that stupid woodpecker toy he had as a kid. And speaking of peckers, his was so hard he felt like it had to be three feet long. Her lips surrounded him, her teeth scraped him\u2014very, very gently!\u2014and he groaned around a mouthful of her ass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a 'pop!' as she pulled her mouth free of him. Then she whipped back around, straddling him.</p><p>She laced her fingers behind his neck and jerked him into a sitting position. \"I want you,\" she growled, sounding uncommonly like the kid from The Exorcist . She smelled strongly of pickles. Her breasts pressed against his chest.</p><p>\"That's swell,\" he said, \"because I want you, too, but maybe we could slow down a little\u2014\"</p> <p>\"Less talk,\" she murmured. \"More fucking.\"</p><p>\"Okey dokey.\"</p><p>She seized him, accidentally catching several pubic hairs. He let out a yelp, but by then she was stuffing him inside her. She rode him enthusiastically, squealing happily every time she impaled herself. Her breasts bobbed. Pickle juice dripped from her shoulders. He held onto the side of the bed for dear life as his orgasm thundered closer, closer...</p><p>She twisted, jerked, bounced. He started to come at the exact moment her momentum pushed him from the bed. He slammed into the\u2014</p><p>\u2014the\u2014</p> <p>Floor.</p><p>Jared jerked awake, staring at the ceiling. The armadillo suit was gone. So was the lingering odor of pickles and, of course, Kara. He had semen on his stomach and one fuck of a headache.</p><p>\"Jesus Christ,\" he gasped, then started the long climb back into bed.</p><p>The 'thump' of Jared flailing his way off the bed inserted itself into Kara's dream as his bedroom door slamming open.</p><p>She sat up on the couch and saw him walking softly toward her, splendidly naked. His shoulders were broad and his chest was lightly furred with crisp black hair, hair that tapered down past his belly button into his lush pubic hair. His sex jutted toward her. He wasn't smiling.</p><p>She saw, with no real surprise, that she was naked, too.</p> <p>\"Come closer,\" he said, even as he did so himself, and then he was standing before her, his hand on the back of her neck, urging her forward. \"Touch me.\"</p><p>\"I\u2014\"</p><p>\"With your mouth, Kara. Touch me with your mouth. I want you to, and you want you to.\"</p><p>\"It's a secret.\" The wanting. The craving.</p><p>\"I won't tell.\" The pressure on the back of her neck increased, and she opened her lips and took him.</p><p>His long, rolling purr of satisfaction kindled her own excitement.</p><p>His palms were on either side of her face as he rocked his hips against her mouth. Then he pulled away and knelt between her legs. He spread her thighs wide and pushed her back, then pulled her legs across his. His hands were busy at the small of her back, pulling her toward him, and she felt him enter her with sweet and delicious slowness.</p><p>She tried to bring her arms around him but, strangely, couldn't move them an inch. She was pushed back so far, her legs were so wide. He crouched and rode her, rode her. It was hard to get a breath. It was hard to even want to.</p> <p>\"When I'm done,\" he said, perfectly calm, \"I'll leave.\"</p><p>\"Yes, that's\u2014\"</p><p>\"\u2014what people do, yes. I know. You didn't think you could have a normal life with me, did you?\"</p><p>\"Why can't I?\"</p><p>\"Why should you?\" He pulled out and, with savage swiftness, flipped her over. Shoved her, hard. She grabbed wildly for the couch, and found herself bent over the armrest. Felt him grip her ass, part her cheeks, and brutally shove himself inside her.. Red agony slashed across her vision as he shoved and withdrew and pushed some more. His fingers dug into her flesh, marking it, and she squirmed to get away. To her extreme humiliation, beneath the pain she could sense something else begin to stir.</p><p>\"Say it.\"</p><p>She said nothing. He shoved , harder than he ever had, so hard she could almost feel his cock in the back of her throat. His fingers were busy between her legs, pinching the tender lips, pulling on them. He withdrew almost all the way and she went limp, thinking he was done, and then he rammed himself into her again. She made a sound between a moan and a scream.</p><p>\"Say it or I'll stop.\"</p><p>Everything was tightening, was getting hotter, and it hurt, God it hurt, but it felt embarrassingly marvelous, too, and he couldn't stop before she found her climax, he couldn't: \"Everybody leaves.\"</p><p>\"Good. Yes. Everybody leaves.\" Although his brutal thrusting didn't stop, his fingers between her thighs became gentle, toyed with her throbbing clit, swept over it, squeezed it, rubbed, rubbed, rubbed...</p><p>Things went dark, very dark around the edges as her orgasm screamed through her. She lay across the arm rest for a moment, gasping, then turned over.</p><p>He was gone.</p><p>The next morning, Jared and Kara managed to get up, refresh themselves, have a pleasant conversation, and leave together without actually making eye contact.</p><p>Jared crept around the apartment feeling guilty, and nearly screamed when he opened the fridge and saw the jar of pickles on the second shelf.</p><p>For her part, Kara was mortified. She prayed Jared couldn't read her expression. She didn't like pain, she had never liked pain, so what was with that dream? In real life, if Jared ever tried such a thing, she'd break his arm in two places.</p><p>Right?</p><p>After driving downtown to find a restaurant, they'd parked the car and walked, enjoying the unseasonably warm weather. Indian summer had been going on for more than a month. Chicago in October , Kara mused. You gotta love it .</p><p>Jared stopped in his tracks so suddenly, she went two steps past him before realizing he wasn\u2019t walking.</p><p>\u201cYou want to eat here?\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Kara turned to look at him. \u201cYou said I could choose. If you don\u2019t like sushi, they have other things. You can have a steak, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>The man looked decidedly nervous; she wondered what was up. Jared seemed singularly unconcerned about his life being in danger, but ill at ease when confronted with the prospect of a Japanese restaurant.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He was looking through the front window, shading his eyes and squinting. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s working right now. We can go in.\u201d</p><p>He pulled open the door to Ish , a trendy sushi restaurant with a terrible name and astonishing food. He held the door for her and, with a wary look inside, she went in. The interior, like every Japanese restaurant she had ever been in, was understated and completely different from the outside. The building housing this restaurant was gray cement, the entrance to the restaurant shaded with a dirty green awning.</p><p>Inside, however, the carpet was pearl gray and immaculate, plain ink prints decorated the walls, the tables were low and the wood had been rubbed to a mellow glow. Muted music tinkled over the speakers, waitresses wearing beautiful kimonos shuffled quietly to and fro and the air smelled of soup and delicate Japanese spices.</p><p>Kara took an appreciative breath while they waited for a table. She loved the way the Japanese did things, their understated efficiency, the beauty of their food presentation, their droll humor and could have eaten sushi three times daily. Too bad Jared looked ready to jump out of his skin. She could sense no danger to him here, but resolved to keep her eyes open.</p><p>The hostess stepped toward them, dressed in a sapphire blue kimono embroidered with white seagull silhouettes. She bowed a greeting, then asked them pleasantly if they wanted smoking or non.</p><p>\u201cNon,\u201d they said in unison, then followed her to a table by the window.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Kara said, \u201cbut we\u2019d prefer a table at the back of the room, if you please.\u201d</p><p>The hostess apologized and led them to a booth in the back. When she was gone, while they were wiping their faces with the hot, damp washcloths she had left them, Jared said, \u201cYou don\u2019t want me sitting by the window, huh?\u201d</p><p>Kara shrugged. \u201cForce of habit. Listen, you\u2019re making me nervous. What\u2019s the problem? Why don\u2019t you like this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love this place,\u201d he assured her. \u201cThe food is fabulous, the service is great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story. Never mind. What are you having?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, a voice boomed, \u201cAh, Dr. Dean!\u201d and Jared sighed.</p><p>\u201cBusted,\u201d he muttered, just before a middle-aged Japanese man rushed to their table. The man was wiry and looked strong. His head was so bald and shiny Kara itched to touch it, to see if it felt as smooth as it looked.</p><p>\u201cHello, hello! So nice to see you again and you\u2019ve brought a lovely lady friend, too, how wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIshiguro, this is Kara. Kara, this is the owner, Ishiguro. Listen, pal,\u201d Jared said to the beaming man,</p><p>\u201clet\u2019s not do this, okay?\u201d</p><p>Kara edged closer to the edge of the booth, ready to pound the man into jelly if he so much as twitched a trigger finger. Jared promptly stuck his foot up onto her seat, barring her way.</p><p>Ishiguro quit smiling and looked stubborn. He snapped his fingers and a waitress appeared, bowing to him and then to Jared and Kara. \u201cThese are my friends,\u201d he said, \u201cand they must have anything they want. Bring appetizers. Dr. Dean is partial to seafood.\u201d</p><p>The waitress bowed again and practically sprinted to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIshiguro,\u201d Jared said warningly.</p><p>The man rapped something sharp in Japanese and Jared shut up. Ishiguro turned to Kara and said, \u201cDo you know the story of how the wonderful Dr. Dean saved my only son from hideous death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably would have been able to cough it up on his own,\u201d Jared mumbled.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me,\u201d Kara said politely.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal,\u201d Jared protested.</p><p>Ishiguro ignored him. \u201cThere he was, my poor Yoshi, gagging and turning blue and staggering and we pounded on his back and prayed an ambulance would come, when Dr. Dean leaped from his chair, over the table\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not .\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and with a squeeze of his mighty arms\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014forced the offending fish from my son\u2019s throat. Ah! He breathed, he lived, he is first in his class at Harvard Business, he is married and his lovely wife is pregnant with my first grandchild.\u201d Ishiguro stopped and looked at Jared admiringly. \u201cAll because of Dr. Dean. So.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kara looked at Jared. \u201cI\u2019m betting lunch is on the house.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded unhappily. \u201cCome on, Ish, you\u2019ve given me enough free meals, you\u2019ve probably cost yourself a thousand bucks in food...I was glad to help, but I was only doing my job, you don\u2019t need to keep giving me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ishiguro held up a hand imperiously. When he spoke, his voice was very mild, but his gaze was arctic.</p> <p>\u201cAre you suggesting my son\u2019s life is not worth some raw fish and rice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting there is no debt between us?\u201d</p><p>Jared sighed. Kara smiled. \u201cGive it up, Jared. Besides, you\u2019re insulting our host.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lady is wise,\u201d Ishiguro declared, just as the waitress reappeared, carrying a large tray crowded with enticing dishes.</p> <p>Ishiguro placed the food himself, clucking over them like a hen with two chicks, making sure the temperature of the food was exactly right...Kara waited for him to tie a napkin around Jared\u2019s neck and start hand-feeding him, but he didn\u2019t go that far. And then, finally, he left them to their food.</p><p>Kara had to laugh. Poor Jared looked so embarrassed, she almost felt sorry for him. \u201cNo wonder you didn\u2019t want to come in here,\u201d she said, digging into her chawanmushi, a delicately flavored custard crammed with seafood and mushrooms.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just the fuss he makes,\u201d Jared confessed in a low voice. \u201cI swear, he loses money every time I come in. Then, I avoid the place for a few months and his feelings are hurt...it\u2019s kind of a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will teach you to save lives, you bastard,\u201d she said solemnly and they both laughed.</p><p>They had barely begun their meal when Jared\u2019s pager went off. He sighed, swallowed and unclipped his pager for a quick glance. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go back to the hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me call you a cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d she said, tossing her napkin on the table.</p> <p>\u201cNo, Kara, stay here and enjoy the food, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a date, Jared,\u201d she reminded him coolly, though she\u2019d had trouble remembering that fact herself. \u201cI\u2019m sticking close for the next few days. Besides, it\u2019s not hard to get your pager number. For all you know, this is a trick. I\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p>He looked pleased. She had no idea why. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll call us both a cab.\u201d They stood and, as Ishiguro approached, he waved his pager at the restaurant owner. \u201cGotta run, Ish. Everything was fabulous. I\u2019m sorry we couldn\u2019t finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite all right, Dr. Dean. I hope you\u2019ll stop back later for dinner.\u201d He shook Jared\u2019s hand, then beamed with surprised delight when Kara bowed. She did it out of a perverse, continual need to prove her late sensei, a man similar to Ishiguro in looks but quite dissimilar in temperament\u2014wrong. He\u2019d told her once, when she was very small, that Americans bowed like cows danced. She\u2019d spent as much time trying to perfect her bow as she had trying to perfect her defensive techniques.</p><p>Ishiguro, smiling, returned her bow and they left.</p><p>At the hospital, she watched Jared work and was impressed all over again. He was deft, compassionate, constantly smiling and, if he felt it was appropriate, gently teasing. The patients seemed to adore him.</p><p>Certainly the nurses were fond of him. She bristled as more than one nurse \u201caccidentally\u201d brushed by Jared, touched his arm, laughed a bit too loudly at his jokes. Then she scolded herself for bristling.</p><p>Calling Jared back to the hospital had not been a trick. Still, Kara kept a wary eye out. She hadn\u2019t heard any word on the street about Carlotti, which was good news, so far. Carlotti was like a freight train...slow to get going, almost unstoppable once he reached full speed. When things started to happen, they would happen fast. For now, she and Jared could enjoy the calm before the storm.</p> <p>Hunger gnawed at her, but she ignored the sensation. It was too bad their lunch had been interrupted, but they could grab a bite when Jared was finished his work. She certainly wasn\u2019t planning to leave him alone while she stuffed her face.</p><p>She saw he was looking for her and stepped up behind him, tapping his shoulder. He turned and blinked with surprise when he saw it was her. \u201cHow do you do that?\u201d he said, half complaining, half admiring.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking all over for you and I never see you unless you want me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInner city Emergency Room,\u201d she reminded him, \u201cremember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Don\u2019t walk on your hands to prove your point, I get it. And I\u2019m starving . Want to grab some supper?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the clock and saw with a start that she had been watching and admiring and thinking about him for close to five hours. It felt like five minutes.</p><p>She nodded and he reached for her hand, unthinking. She stiffened for a moment, then let him hold her hand. His fingers were warm and\u2014odd!\u2014she felt their warmth all the way down to her toes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to wait so long,\u201d he was saying, \u201cI finished as quickly as I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d she said and pulled her hand away.</p><p>No doubt about it. Dr. Dean was dangerous. She was used to physical danger, used to the worry of some street-snitch giving her up to the cops, used to gang toughs trying to take down A.A. as some sort of stupid initiation rite, but she had no idea how to deal with emotional danger. No idea how to stop herself from liking a man. She wondered for the first time if she was protecting him because it would thwart her enemy, or because she couldn\u2019t bear to see him hurt.</p><p>Supper was delightful. Jared noticed Kara ordered everything he did and wasn\u2019t sure why. Was it a sign of respect, or a lack of imagination?</p><p>He asked her. She made an exasperated sound and salted her fries. \u201cNice question. Lack of imagination, of course...the truth is, since you won\u2019t let me pay my way, I didn\u2019t want to bankrupt you by ordering three steak dinners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I could be rich,\u201d he said, watching her long fingers as they curved around her burger and lifted it to her mouth. \u201cFilthy, disgustingly rich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re eating at Denny\u2019s?\u201d She took a bite, chewed, swallowed, then said with finality, \u201cYou\u2019re not rich at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you\u2014oh, cripes. You cracked the hospital personnel files, didn\u2019t you?\u201d He let his head fall into his hands. \u201cDid you leave any of the benefits staff conscious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of them around at 2:00 a.m.\u201d Then, almost anxiously, she added, \u201cI wasn\u2019t snooping.</p><p>I wanted to find out about you before I decided to get further involved. And by the way, did you know a good secretary makes more than you do in this city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie. A mediocre secretary makes more than I do. Doctors don\u2019t make the bucks until they\u2019ve been in the field for a while. Hell, six years ago I was still in med school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking your cadavers out to lunch,\u201d she added, smiling at him.</p><p>\u201cIt helped pass the time,\u201d he said modestly. He stretched in the booth, glancing around the restaurant. It was a typical Denny\u2019s, only a third full this time of the evening and around them the muted clink of silverware on plates mingled with customer chatter.</p><p>It was a relief to be relaxed with Kara. He could look into her blue eyes without fantasizing about knocking their Fiesta burgers to the floor and taking her on the table while the waitress gaped and asked if they wanted anything else to drink. They could have a normal conversation. Well, as normal a conversation about her cracking the hospital\u2019s confidential files could be.</p><p>Their thwarted lunch and the hours in the E.R. had helped. The nap she\u2019d talked him into last night had also helped. But the raging hard-on he woke with had not. Neither had that weird ass dream. Perhaps knowing Kara was in the next room, barely twenty feet away, made the stiffness between his legs demand urgent attention. Maybe it was the fact that he had thought of nothing and no one else for the past three days.</p><p>He had stumbled to the shower, still half-asleep and beneath the warm spray replayed their first (and, since he was keeping score, their only) kiss, only this time instead of pushing him away she had been pulling at his clothes. In his mind, her slender fingers tugged at his belt buckle, slipped his zipper down, her small, hot hand eased into his boxers and clasped him, caressed him while she whispered in his ear exactly what she expected him to do to her the moment she was finished with him.</p><p>He had climaxed so hard his knees had buckled. Only then did he notice the water had turned cold.</p><p>With a yelp, he had leaped past the curtain, standing on the bathroom carpet shivering, freezing, feeling more than a little foolish...but temporarily sated.</p><p>Now, finally, her power over him had eased. Here they were, having a conversation about med school cadavers like two ordinary people and he was fine. Sure, a mob boss had put a contract on his life and Kara was the only thing between him and a baseball bat lobotomy, but the fact remained, all was well with the world.</p><p>\u201cI really think we should get married someday,\u201d he said and nearly bit his tongue.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cAlways joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, that\u2019s me, Joke Central.\u201d Cripes, what was wrong with him? He was sated, her hold over him was purely physical and she had no power over him, dammit, so what was wrong? She\u2019d turned his life upside down in less than a week, he didn\u2019t know anything about her, but she was all he could think about, dream about.</p><p>He mentally shook himself, then looked at her to ask if she wanted dessert and that was when she did it again. Her gaze flicked past him, to the front door and then back to him. Her expression was neutral; if she had been any other woman he wouldn\u2019t have been alarmed. But Kara, he was beginning to realize, hid strong emotions\u2014fear, anger, passion\u2014behind an icy mask and he didn\u2019t like the way she kept glancing over his shoulder.</p><p>He turned and saw nothing out of the ordinary. Some new customers, but it was getting close to dinnertime and that was to be expected. He turned back to ask Kara what was going on, only to realize with a start that she had already gotten up and was strolling unhurriedly toward the front door. At her place was thirty dollars in cash. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait!\u201d he said, grabbing her money off the table and digging frantically for his wallet. \u201cI said this was on me, remember?\u201d He opened his wallet to find a movie ticket stub and two quarters peeping up at him.</p><p>Dammit! No time to get cash yesterday and he\u2019d been planning to pay for lunch with a credit card. With a muffled curse, he tossed her money back on the table and started after her.</p><p>He caught up with her as she was entering a dingy park across the street. The park was so small it was hardly the width of a city street, with a pitiful swing set and a teeter-totter that looked like it could deal death to unwary toddlers. The sodden sandbox was full of mud and a squatting cat, doing what Jared didn\u2019t want to think about. But the park, he saw with alarm, had one advantage for an ambush: trees pressed in closely on all sides but one and hardly anyone could see them from the street.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell is going\u2014\u201d was as far as he got before Kara seized his arm, kicked over a park bench and forced him behind it.</p><p>\u201cStay down,\u201d she said firmly, \u201cand out of the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I, your dog? You\u2019re not the boss of me. I\u2014\u201d He trailed off as Kara spun to deal with the accountants who had been following them.</p><p>He recognized the men. They had been, he realized, the last customers to take seats in the restaurant.</p><p>They must have followed him and Kara right out the door into the park. There were three, all average-looking men with ordinary builds, nice suits and expensive haircuts. Before he could figure out just when Kara had gone crazy and started attacking business executives, he noticed the one closest to her had his hand stiffened in a wicked looking chop. Kara ducked under the blow and kicked the man high up on the ribs. Jared winced as the evil accountant bent, whooshing for breath and cradling his side.</p> <p>The second one groped in his pocket and whipped out a pen...but it wasn\u2019t a pen, it was a three-foot long antenna that whistled through the air like a blade. Kara reached out, almost casually and at the same time she caught the guy\u2019s wrist, she brought her knee crashing into his groin. But the third one was flanking her, moving past Kara\u2019s sight line and awfully close to Dr. Jared Dean, E.R. resident and pissed-off would-be boyfriend. The creep was going to bushwhack his Kara?</p><p>\u201cMistake!\u201d he yelled, as he shoved the park bench over. It caught bad guy #3 just behind the knees, effectively tumbling him face-first to the damp ground. Jared pounced and in mid-air imagined himself landing on the bad guy\u2019s back, forcing the air out of his lungs and reigning triumphant.</p><p>Instead, the man flipped over quick as a snake and as Jared\u2019s knees thudded to the ground on either side of Kara\u2019s assailant, a walloping pain exploded in Jared\u2019s nose.</p><p>He clapped both hands to his face, tasting blood and wondering dazedly when the bad guy had had time to throw a punch. As the man reared to a sitting position, Jared brought his head forth in a crude but effective head-butt. Now , he thought with grim humor, there\u2019s two of us holding our faces and thinking about throwing up.</p><p>Hard fingers seized his ear and hauled him straight up. \u201cPutz!\u201d Kara hissed, just before she kicked Jared\u2019s bad guy in the chin, snapping his head back into the dirt. Jared looked around blearily and noted with no real surprise that Kara\u2019s two assailants were down for the count.</p><p>\u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d he asked thickly, then spat to clear his throat. \u201cAnd let go of my ear, willya?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did you ever get your medical license if you can\u2019t. Follow. Directions.\u201d Without a look at the unconscious men, she was marching Jared out of the park, across the street, back to his apartment. She never let go of his ear. She never stopped scolding him in a furious whisper. Finally, he reached up and pried her fingers loose.</p><p>\u201cBack off, blondie,\u201d he said crossly. \u201cIf you expect me to cower behind a damned bench while you get set upon, you need some new medication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect you to do as you\u2019re told,\u201d she growled. They were now standing outside his apartment door and Jared fumbled tiredly for his keys. Before he could produce them Kara yanked at her sleeve, produced two thin blades and in about six seconds had his front door unlocked. He realized dazedly that it took him longer to unlock the door with a key than it took her to pick the lock. Three cheers , he thought, for American ingenuity.</p><p>She marched him inside, toward the bathroom. \u201cI can\u2019t adequately protect you if you insist on throwing yourself in the path of danger. What\u2019s the matter with you? Any five year-old knows enough to keep his head down and let the other person take the lumps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull shit,\u201d he replied politely. He found himself leaning against the sink while she ran warm water in the basin, found a washcloth and gently pressed it to his nose and mouth. The tender motion was a puzzling conflict to her tight-lipped expression, narrowed eyes, and sharp words.</p><p>\u201cWhere I come from, you don\u2019t let the lady take the lumps. Jeez, what kind of household did you grow up in, any\u2014\u201d He made himself stop talking and stared at her. She was tending to his face and wouldn\u2019t look at him and no wonder...Kara hadn\u2019t exactly been brought up in the be-kind-to-children-and-animals mode.</p><p>\u201cPutz,\u201d she said again and he silently agreed.</p><p>A long moment passed, then he caught her wrists and gently took the washcloth away from her. \u201cI can do that. And quit manhandling me, will you? Don\u2019t make me kick your ass.\u201d</p> <p>She snorted and he continued. \u201cListen. I get that you\u2019re truly angry with me. I couldn\u2019t figure out why until right now\u2014you truly feel it\u2019s your job to get hurt and mine to stay safe?\u201d She said nothing. \u201cThe thing is, I see us as more of a team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not a team. I\u2019m never in a team,\u201d she said fiercely and tried to take the washcloth away from him. He held it high above her head, out of reach.</p><p>\u201cStop me if you\u2019ve heard this before, but bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t keep you safe if you\u2019re not going to listen,\u201d she said flatly. She gave him a disgusted look as he dangled the washcloth out of her reach, as if saying: You don\u2019t really think I\u2019m going to jump for that, do you?</p><p>\u201cWell, I won\u2019t stay safe if it means you\u2019ll get hurt. Period. The end. The fat lady singeth.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cYou're an idiot.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at her and sponged the rest of the drying blood off his face. The nosebleed had stopped a few minutes ago, luckily. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you get pounded, ergo I\u2019m an idiot? What, you\u2019ve never hung around with one of the good guys before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never hung around with a moron before,\u201d she muttered, looking away.</p><p>He caught her chin and gently forced her to look at him. \u201cIn all the excitement,\u201d he said mildly, but his heart was starting to pound, \u201cI forgot to thank you for kicking some major ass on my behalf.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward to kiss her and to his amazement and pleasure she met him more than halfway. She tenderly licked his sore upper lip, then her tongue slipped past his teeth and suddenly he was tasting her, devouring her, holding her tightly against his chest and kissing her with all the passion and excitement she had called up in him from the moment he first saw her.</p><p>Jared, who\u2019d been sure the infatuation was one-sided, thrilled to feel Kara\u2019s hands slip under his shirt, her fingers brushing across his nipples and sliding through his chest hair.</p><p>He cupped her skull in his hands tenderly, carefully, as if holding a Faberge egg, precious and priceless.</p><p>He pulled at the clip keeping her hair up. Suddenly the rich blonde waves were tumbling past his hands.</p><p>He groaned and buried his face in her hair.</p><p>\u201cOh we can\u2019t,\u201d she said in one breath, then nipped at his ear with her small teeth.</p><p>\u201cWe hardly know each other,\u201d he agreed with a groan and kissed her throat. He brought his hands down to her waist, across her taut stomach and up under her t-shirt. He closed his eyes and rubbed his face against her hair like a cat, for Jared Dean was a pure sensualist and nothing was more delightful to him than the feel and smell of a woman\u2019s skin and hair.</p><p>He explored her body as a blind man would, bringing his palms across the muscles in her abdomen, sliding up, marveling at the sleek power contained in her body. He found her bra and\u2014joy!\u2014realized the clasp was in front; with one sure tug the fabric parted and her breasts were in his hands. He groaned again at the sheer joy of it, of her. Firm and sweet and fitting exactly into his palms, he caressed the tender undersides with his knuckles, then brought his thumbs to her nipples. She moaned and pressed against him as he stroked the stiff peaks then kissed him so hard his lips flattened against his teeth. He had time for a dazed thought\u2014did I ever think this woman was a cool one?\u2014before she was tugging at his shirt so hard, he could hear the buttons popping off and clattering on the bathroom tile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, you\u2019re strong, rip our clothes off, rip all of our clothes off,\u201d he mumbled in delirious joy,</p><p>\u201ctake me, I\u2019m yours,\u201d and her soft laughter brought a silly, pleased grin to his face.</p><p>She started to lean forward to kiss his now-bared chest, but he stopped her long enough to pull her shirt over her head. Her bra straps were sliding off both shoulders but he couldn\u2019t take the time to help her out of it; he was transfixed by the perfection of her upper body. Slim, yet sleekly muscled, with proud, high breasts, her nipples were the dark pink of prairie roses and he would have gladly traded his medical license for a taste. Praise all the gods who ever were, he didn\u2019t have to. He kissed one, then licked, then sucked, pressing the nipple to the roof of his mouth and tightening his grip at her sigh.</p><p>His arms were around her waist then slid lower to cup her firm buttocks and pull her gently against his groin. She pushed back and he loosened his grip at once, but to his delight, she wasn\u2019t pulling away, just trying to get more room...it was then that he noticed his nimble-fingered Kara had gotten his fly unbuttoned and his zipper down without him noticing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then her fingers were curving around his shaft, gripping him with cool and delicious friction and he had time for one distracting thought\u2014God, don\u2019t let this be another fantasy\u2014before gladly giving in to the sensation. Kara\u2019s fingers, which slipped past locks and dealt blows hard enough to fell grown men, were the sweetest of dreams as she caressed, stroked, squeezed.</p><p>\u201cOhKaraGod,\u201d he gasped, then brought her breasts together and ran his tongue along her cleavage as her breathing grew harsh and her fingers ran across his now-slippery tip. He groaned and managed to stop himself from squeezing the pale globes until he marked her with his fingers. He wanted to mark her.</p><p>He wanted to kiss and suck every inch of her body, leave a ring of hickeys around her throat like a necklace, wanted to write his name on her forehead with a laundry marker, wanted to marry her so she would be his forever and he hers. Instead, he stopped himself from squeezing and attacked the button fly of her jeans. Being a fumble-fingered physician, his technique wasn\u2019t nearly as stealthy as hers. She didn\u2019t, thank God, seem to mind.</p> <p>\u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so good\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know who was saying what, didn\u2019t care, it didn\u2019t matter. The only things in the world were her breath, her skin, her face, her sweet, courageous self.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to\u2014got to send him a thank you note,\u201d he managed, then kissed her again.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d She said the word into his mouth, then lightly bit his lower lip and squeezed his throbbing dick with perfectly even pressure from each finger, stopping just short of pain, making him want to beg her to do that again. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Who indeed? What the hell had he been talking about? Oh, yeah... \u201cCarlotti. One Eyebrow. The wonderful thug who brought you into my life. I\u2019ll send him flowers. Wash his car for a year. Something.\u201d</p> <p>He felt the change in her at once. One instant she was warm and willing and had her hands all over him.</p><p>The next, she was letting go, looking at him with eyes full of fright, then, in the next instant, eyes that showed nothing except cool waiting.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough of that,\u201d she said calmly and gently pushed him back.</p><p>\u201cGuh,\u201d he said, conscious of the fact that most of the blood his brain used was currently residing in his dick and, as such, he was definitely having trouble keeping up. \u201cWha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about that. We shouldn\u2019t mix business with...ah...other things. Why don\u2019t you zip up and join me in the living room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we have sex on the bathroom floor instead?\u201d he asked in what he hoped was a reasonable tone, but what he was afraid sounded dangerously low and rough with lust. He felt growing anger and stomped on it. No meant no, of course, but he could easily strangle her right now. Had he ever been so aroused? Not since the night he lost his virginity...and maybe not even then.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kitchen floor? The living room? The fire escape? The hallway? The corner diner? Where?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet dressed,\u201d she said, not unkindly and left the room.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. The thought thundered through her brain, even as she cupped her breasts, even as she ached for more of Jared\u2019s mouth and hands. She had nearly let him take her. \u2018Let him\u2019\u2014ha! She had nearly raped him in his own damned bathroom, that was how badly she wanted him. He was all that was good and she was exactly the opposite and why, oh why couldn\u2019t she keep that in mind?</p><p>Kara fastened her bra, pulled her shirt back over her head and sat down on the couch, dreading the moment Jared would come out of the bathroom. She\u2019d abused him dreadfully, bringing them both to the edge then backing off and walking out without so much as a \u201csorry, I\u2019m not that kind of girl\u201d. She wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if he\u2019d wanted to slap her. She was so disgusted with herself she would have stood still for it.</p><p>But only once.</p><p>She tried to pull her hair into a ponytail with trembling fingers, then remembered the clip was still in the bathroom and gave up. \u201cRemember the rules,\u201d she said softly, trying to soothe herself, calm herself. Her voice sounded hoarse and she cleared her throat and went on silently, trying for calm. Usually she didn\u2019t have to try. People you care for die or leave. So it\u2019s better\u2014safer\u2014to never show true feelings.</p><p>Don\u2019t get close. Don\u2019t get personal. You stupid cow.</p><p>Scolding herself usually made her smile. Not this time. She had used Jared badly and owed him an explanation she would never let him hear: that she was powerfully drawn to him, that she would take a knife in the kidney before seeing him hurt, that she wished they could be together. Might as well wish she wasn\u2019t a carbon-based life form...</p><p>Jared walked into the room and tossed her hair clip at her, gently underhand. At least he hadn\u2019t fired it at her face with all his strength. She caught the clip and immediately pushed her hair up into it. She couldn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my breath, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Startled, she looked up and opened her mouth to reply. Might have known he\u2019d turn it into a joke , she thought ruefully and, on the heels of that, You\u2019re not worthy to be sitting on his couch, much less putting your hands on his body, so keep it in mind, okay, doll?</p><p>He held up his hands. Skilled hands, healer\u2019s hands. Lover\u2019s hands. She tried not to stare at his fingers.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, you can tell me. I won\u2019t be mad, I promise. Too many onions on my burger, right? I can take it.\u201d He grinned at her, that crooked smile she was starting to love.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. She looked up at him helplessly. \u201cI don\u2019t have an explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, I do.\u201d He flopped down beside her and put his feet on the coffee table with a satisfying thump. She wanted to snuggle into him, the warmth of his body. Instead, she stared at the carpet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re secretly in love with me and couldn\u2019t help yourself. Or, you\u2019ve been heavily medicated for some time and need new drugs. Or you lost a bet. Or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very nice,\u201d she interrupted, patting his thigh and then snatching her hand away. His thigh was long and heavily muscled; she wondered what he did to stay in shape. She wondered what he would think if she kissed him where her hand had just been. \u201cBut you\u2019re not for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for you? What, like I\u2019m something you\u2019d pick up at Macy\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Macy\u2019s,\u201d she said, hating her cool tone but helpless to stop. \u201cMaybe Kmart.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows arched. \u201cMee-yeow! Hey, don\u2019t take it out on me because you\u2019re sexually frustrated, sweetie. I was all set to tango... you were the one who called time out. Aarrggh!\u201d He clutched his head, writhing. Alarmed, she reached for him, then forced her hand to drop back to her lap.</p><p>He looked up and speared her with his direct gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight. Listen, I only kissed you because I couldn\u2019t stand being near you and not touching you. And because I really did want to thank you for taking care of the bad guys in the park. That\u2019s twice you\u2019ve saved my butt. You barely know me and you keep putting yourself in danger for me. It\u2019s maddening, but sexy as hell.\u201d He picked up her hand and she let him, afraid to speak, afraid to return the pressure of his fingers. \u201cWhy are you doing this?</p><p>Why me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I do,\u201d he said with maddening assurance. \u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re good, you couldn\u2019t stand to see someone in trouble and had to help. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>She flung off his hand and jumped up. \u201cI\u2019m not good!\u201d she practically shouted. \u201cI\u2019m as far from good as someone like you could imagine.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows arched. \u201cSomeone like me?\u201d</p><p>She ignored the interruption. \u201cI\u2019m helping you because you\u2019ve got a nice body and great eyes, okay?</p><p>I\u2019m in it for purely selfish reasons, I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m planning on shoring up your gratitude and trading it for sex, I\u2014stop laughing .\u201d</p><p>He had actually fallen off the couch, was holding his stomach and giggling like an idiot. He choked off his mirth, grinned up at her and said, \u201cSure you are. That\u2019s why you bolted out of my bathroom like your hair was on fire. Fess up, Kara. Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very good question,\u201d she grumbled and stepped over him to leave. Damned if she was going to tell him a thing. Not that she had been planning to. But if she had been (and she had not been), she wouldn\u2019t now. No way. The man turned everything into a joke. She couldn\u2019t bear it if he turned her life into a punch line. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Don\u2019t leave your apartment until I come back.\u201d</p><p>He rolled over, cat-quick and grabbed her lower leg. Her progress toward the door slowed dramatically as she found herself lugging his two hundred pounds. \u201cNo you don\u2019t,\u201d he grunted. \u201cYou\u2019re not doing one of your Batman-type fadeouts. We\u2019re going to have a real talk like two people in a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\u2014not\u2014in\u2014a\u2014relationship.\u201d She braced herself and pulled, with no luck. He was stuck to her leg like a lamprey. She had no leverage. She could have loosened his grip any number of ways\u2014kicking him in the eye would be a good start\u2014but couldn\u2019t bring herself to hurt him. Not physically, anyway.</p><p>\u201cLet go\u2014before I\u2014put you\u2014in\u2014traction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call that bluff, thanks. Bodyguards don\u2019t whup their clients. Besides, we both know you\u2019re crazy about me.\u201d He chortled over what he probably assumed was a gross exaggeration. \u201cNow talk! Who are you? Why are you here? When are you going to marry me?\u201d</p><p>She stopped pulling and looked down at him. He was sprawled behind her, holding onto her calf with white knuckles, looking up at her with touching sincerity. \u201cStop joking.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI think you\u2019re fabulous. I want to be with you all the time. You\u2019re beautiful and smart and tough and vulnerable and sweet and a fantastic kisser and you have the prettiest breasts I\u2019ve ever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it! You don\u2019t know me, you don\u2019t know anything about me now let me go .\u201d</p><p>He did and slowly got to his feet. But she had lost the urge to flee. \u201cThere\u2019s something else I know about you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re scared shitless, but I\u2019ll be damned if I know what could scare you .\u201d</p> <p>Complete rejection for a start. Being left alone...again. She pushed the thought away. \u201cJared, I\u2019ve told you this before. If you knew me, knew who I really was\u2014what I\u2019ve done, the things I\u2019ve\u2014you wouldn\u2019t like me. You wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere near me.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cSometimes I can\u2019t stand to be in my own skin.\u201d</p><p>He yawned. She gaped. \u201cYeah, yeah, you\u2019re a real badass, worse than Manson and Bundy put together.\u201d</p><p>Shocked, she opened her mouth to say...what, she didn\u2019t know, but he never gave her a chance. \u201cHey, you don\u2019t have to tell me a damned thing about yourself if you don\u2019t want to. Like you\u2019ve said, this is business, right? That\u2019s assuming you don\u2019t have feelings for me. Which I would have believed before you let me put my hands all over your luscious bod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t faking, any more than I was\u2014you feel the same thing I do. The connection. The heat.\u201d He poked her in the chest, an umpire making a point to the pitcher. \u201cDifference is, I\u2019m willing to admit it.</p> <p>You\u2019ve been running away from it for days. So which one of us is the fearless bodyguard and which of us is the coward?\u201d He sighed, while she stared at him, stunned. \u201cToo bad, so sad. I didn\u2019t think you were scared of anything or anyone. So disappointing to be wrong about people you care about.\u201d</p><p>Kara forced her fist to unclench. It\u2019s not nice to punch doctors, no matter how outrageously provocative their comments, she reminded herself. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything,\u201d she snapped. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t care about me.\u201d</p><p>They were nose to nose, or as close as they could get, as she was a head shorter. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me how I feel,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou\u2019re fabulous, dammit and that\u2019s the end of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know me.\u201d Her voice cracked with desperation. \u201cJared, if you knew what I did for a living, the things I had to do to survive, you wouldn\u2019t feel this way.\u201d</p><p>His finger came to rest on the tip of her nose. He didn\u2019t smile. \u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence and then she said it, ignoring the way her heart was pounding crazily, the way her head was screaming ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?</p> <p>\u201cYou got it, Dr. Dean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Kara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhhhh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKara. This isn\u2019t my house. Or yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is breaking and entering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. Technically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically?\u201d he nearly shouted, then remembered he didn\u2019t want to go to jail and lowered his voice.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re standing inside a house the size of the Playboy Mansion\u2014\u201d</p><p>She snickered. \u201cThat\u2019s not far off.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and I don\u2019t even want to know how you cracked that lock. Now there\u2019s little red lasers all over the living room, starting about two feet from where we\u2019re standing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the security system. Don\u2019t walk in there yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh,\u201d he said with heavy sarcasm. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re futzing with the alarm. Do you think they\u2019ll let me kiss you goodbye before they cart me off to the local hoosegow?\u201d</p><p>She ignored him, simply popped the cover off the alarm plate and hooked up a small silver box, about the size of an ATM card. She crossed a few wires, then numbers started to stream across the digital display. A few seconds later, the lasers shut off.</p><p>\u201cCake,\u201d she said, brushing by him. \u201cDon\u2019t touch anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Maybe you should remind me to keep breathing and any other obvious advice you can think of.\u201d He followed her nervously. Prove it, he\u2019d said and she had taken him right up on it. Your own fault, moron .</p><p>He\u2019d suspected nothing when she drove them to the house. Hell, he hadn\u2019t even noticed they\u2019d left his own modest neighborhood for the much more pretentious Carleton area, where mansions were as plentiful as street lamps. He\u2019d spent the drive trying to figure out a way to prove to her that her past and her current activities didn\u2019t change the way he felt about her. Hell, her past had shaped the woman he was falling in love with. Far from scaring him off, it just made him feel closer to her.</p><p>He was close to her right now, in fact. So close he could have strangled her, which he felt like doing.</p><p>This was big-time trouble if they were caught. They were both looking at prison terms for the evening\u2019s exercise, all so Kara could prove she was a criminal sociopath.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said we were going hacking,\u201d he muttered, following her through the mansion. \u201cI pictured us in a cozy computer room somewhere, pressing buttons. Not hanging around in a living room that looks like it was decorated by the director of the Guggenheim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHacking doesn\u2019t have much to do with computers these days.\u201d She was climbing the stairs slowly, steadily, not looking back. \u201cIt\u2019s B&amp;E-speak for getting into a business to steal from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this is somebody\u2019s house. Thirty or forty somebodies, given the size, but still...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a business,\u201d she said with maddening mysteriousness and wouldn\u2019t continue, no matter how much he kept bugging her.</p><p>Although the house was empty, the owners had left several lights on, shattering another of Jared\u2019s theories about burglaries. Kara wasn\u2019t a twitchy junkie with a heroine habit to feed, the \u201cbreaking\u201d of the breaking and entering took about ten seconds and nothing was broken and there were lights all over the place, so no creeping in the dark like a demented boogeyman. Jared wondered what else popular fiction had wrong about crime.</p><p>The bedroom was a joke. Something out of a bad movie...a bed the size of his kitchen, covered with a red satin comforter and about a thousand pillows. Mirrored ceiling. Dark furniture the owner\u2019s family probably brought to America via the Mayflower . The carpet (cream shag) was so deep, he could feel himself actually sink into it. The dressers were spotless, except for one large picture of a middle-aged white male, bearded and benevolent looking, with a smile so large, it showed his back teeth. The guy looked like Santa on acid. And, if this was his house, it was kind of in bad taste to have the only photo in the bedroom be of the owner.</p><p>Bad taste, Jared thought with grim humor, sure. Almost as bad as breaking into someone\u2019s house.</p><p>There were mirrors everywhere. It was like being trapped in a carpeted disco. Jared could see seven reflections of himself and seven Karas stepping to a mirror and doing something...and then the mirror was swinging open and...</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d</p><p>...they were in a vault. Kara, her fingers safe in surgical gloves, was opening a drawer and withdrawing a necklace worth, he estimated, the GNP of China.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t steal that,\u201d he said, trying to sound authoritative, but very much afraid he was whining.</p><p>She smiled at him like a cat. It was irritating, he thought, how beautiful she looked even when she was being sly. \u201cCan\u2019t I? If you mean I don\u2019t have the ability, you\u2019re wrong. If you mean my moral code won\u2019t let me, you\u2019re wrong. If you mean I\u2019ll go to jail, you\u2019re wrong again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I mean it\u2019s rotten, I\u2019m right. Put it back.\u201d She moved to tuck the necklace away and he grabbed her wrist. She raised an eyebrow at him and looked pointedly at his hand, but he didn\u2019t loosen his grip.</p><p>\u201cLook, you\u2019ve made your point. I see what you do now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re terrible, awful, evil, a real blight on society, I should have listened to you back at the apartment, blah-blah. But don\u2019t steal from these folks just to prove me wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen the last drawer on the left,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cUse your shirt sleeve, don\u2019t leave prints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t care how much jewelry they\u2014\u201d</p><p>She pried his fingers off her wrist. \u201cJust open it, please, Jared.\u201d</p><p>He did. At first his eyes wouldn\u2019t translate what he was seeing. When they did, he blindly put his hand out for something to lean on, certain he was about to be sick. Kara was there, not letting him touch anything, letting him sag against her.</p><p>\u201cThose men\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd children, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFilthy goddamned perverts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and they\u2019re having terrible luck,\u201d she said sympathetically. He stared at her; she sounded genuinely sorry for them. \u201cThe film from their last drop-off was intercepted by the cops. And now they\u2019ve been robbed. When the cops come, they\u2019ll find...this.\u201d</p><p>In a flash, he saw her brilliance, saw the trap she had lain for the pedophiles. \u201cThe police can\u2019t search without a warrant,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cbut if there\u2019s a robbery...and they happen to find pictures, say, all over the hallway...\u201d He paused. \u201cBut you\u2019re never caught.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him. \u201cWe\u2019re going to trip the alarm on the way out. Cops\u2019ll be here in about five minutes.\u201d She opened another drawer full of filth and waved a spare pair of surgical gloves at him. \u201cWant to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was fun,\u201d he said half an hour later, feeling more deeply satisfied than he ever had. Saving lives was fabulous, but preventing the further brutalization of children was even better. \u201cNow where are we? Is it time for ice cream?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPross house,\u201d she said shortly, getting out of the car and striding, unafraid, through the worst neighborhood in the city. There were more streetlights out than on, more shattered store windows than whole and entirely too many rough-looking men giving his Kara the once-over. Jared could feel himself bristling and singled out the meanest looking one for a good glare. \u201cKeep up, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the looks of those guys,\u201d he said, nodding to a gang of thugs clustered under a broken streetlight. \u201cYa want I should rough \u2018em up for ya?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAren\u2019t you cute. Jared, trust me. Worry about the ones you don\u2019t see.\u201d</p> <p>She bounded up the steps to a battered brownstone, nodding politely to the two teens\u2014either of which could have given your average beat cop a run for her money\u2014and ringing the buzzer. The teens appeared to completely ignore her, but Jared noticed they both made way. He reached out and snagged Kara\u2019s elbow just as she was buzzed in. \u201cI\u2019m with her,\u201d he told the teens, who ignored him as they had Kara, \u201cand don\u2019t get smart or I\u2019ll have her whup you both.\u201d</p><p>Inside, he was pleasantly surprised to find a homey entryway. Shabby, but dignified. \u201cWell, this is something,\u201d he said, looking around. \u201cFirst, the Playboy Mansion. Then the fence...that\u2019s the guy who cashed in the necklace, right? Now we\u2019re...I have no idea where. What\u2019s a pross house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a pross house,\u201d a warm, pleasant voice said. Jared jumped and spun; Kara turned unhurriedly toward the voice; Jared realized Kara had known they weren\u2019t alone in the hall. \u201cThat\u2019s a place where prostitutes...ah...ply their trade. This is a shelter for soiled doves trying to make new lives for themselves.\u201d</p><p>The woman who spoke was astonishingly beautiful, despite the knife scar that bisected her right cheek.</p><p>Far from detracting from her beauty, the scar served to accent the flawless state of the rest of her face.</p> <p>She had shoulder-length, rich brown hair the color of dark chocolate, eyes the color of a sea lagoon and skin the color of a really good espresso. She was quite a bit shorter than Kara and if she weighed more than a hundred pounds, Jared vowed to eat the scale.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he said politely.</p><p>\u201cMadam, actually,\u201d she said and tittered. \u201cWell, former madam. But you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPresent for you, Mag.\u201d Kara handed her the shoe box in which, Jared knew, there nestled close to half a million dollars.</p><p>\u201cAwwww...\u201d Mag caught the box and tucked it under her arm like a football. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t get you anything. Who\u2019s the stiff stud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happen,\u201d he said with as much dignity as he could muster, \u201cto be the young lady\u2019s personal physician.</p> <p>I started by advising her that this neighborhood is bad for her health, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Meg brayed laughter, cutting him off. \u201cHer? There\u2019s nothing in this neighborhood bad for A.A. She\u2019s safer here than anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Click. Everything fell into place. But instead of being shocked, he felt like nodding thoughtfully.</p><p>Shocked? Hell, he wasn\u2019t even mildly surprised. The only reason he hadn\u2019t figured it out earlier was, he\u2019d always thought A.A.\u2014whenever he thought about A.A. at all\u2014was more interested in lining his or her pocket than protecting doctors from hit men.</p><p>Kara turned to leave. \u201cI\u2019ll see you, Meg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Can\u2019t stay away, can you? Good for us.\u201d Meg\u2019s smirk switched off and she abruptly looked haggard, old. \u201cBad for you.\u201d</p><p>Kara shrugged and left without another word. Jared offered his hand to Meg, who only looked at it, amused. Then he hurried after Kara.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d he said on the street.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever it is, put it back,\u201d she said reasonably, opening the car door and sliding inside.</p><p>Jared realized with a start that she hadn\u2019t bothered to lock the car...and it had remained unmolested the entire time they were inside. Well, no wonder. Given who she was.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Avenging Angel,\u201d he said, jumping into the passenger seat. \u201cI\u2019ve read about you. You\u2019ve been doing a Robin Hood thing...stealing from the rich and corrupt, then donating the money to homeless shelters and such.\u201d He felt like clapping, he was so pleased at having figured it out. Then it hit him and he didn\u2019t feel like clapping anymore. \u201cBut this is terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI warned you,\u201d she said quietly, driving back to his apartment.</p><p>\u201cThis is why you can\u2019t testify against ole One Eyebrow. The D.A. is at least as interested in putting you in jail as he is some mob hood. Jesus, there\u2019s\u2014didn\u2019t I read somewhere that there\u2019s a $500,000 reward for your capture? The guys you\u2019ve been stealing from put up a pot?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell, this is totally unacceptable! The D.A. should thank you, not issue warrants for your arrest.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and, in the poorly lit car, all he could see were her eyes. They were huge. He tried not to yelp as she ran a red light. \u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, why don\u2019t you let me drive? Seriously. Kara? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. He didn\u2019t get another word out of her until they were back at the apartment.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up tomorrow.\u201d She glanced at her watch. \u201cLater this morning, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms across his chest. \u201cForget it. You\u2019re coming inside with me so we can finish talking about this.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. He looked so stubborn, so determined. It was cute, if irritating. \u201cDon\u2019t make me throw you out of this car, Jared. I\u2019d try not to hurt you...but you wouldn\u2019t like it, just the same.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t, she saw with surprise, fazed by her threat. \u201cIf you do, I\u2019ll stand on the street corner, waving my arms and telling everyone that Carlotti is the only man on the planet with penis envy. That he used to have two eyebrows but quit plucking them when his tweezers broke. That I saw him assaulting my future wife and I\u2019m going to tell the world, take out an ad, camp out in the D.A.\u2019s office. How long do you think it\u2019d take for him to come get me?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. Her throat had actually gone dry; she swallowed to force moisture. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t\u2014never mind. You\u2019re crazy enough to do it. Fine. We\u2019ll go in.\u201d</p><p>Once inside, he absently locked the front door\u2014not that it would do any good against anyone like her\u2014took their jackets and tossed them on the couch. She turned her back to him and wondered, once again, if she had lost her mind. What was she thinking, showing this strait-laced doctor a piece of her life?</p><p>And why hadn\u2019t he thrown her out, or at least threatened to turn her in? He\u2019d pretended to be appalled because the D.A. wanted her arrest, not because she stole for a living and that was the biggest, most vicious lie she\u2019d heard from a man yet.</p><p>\u201cSo, what?\u201d he was saying. \u201cI figured it out, you\u2019re the notorious A.A. Was that my cue to scream and run away? To never see you again? Was that supposed to make me not attracted to you? Because it failed, failed, failed.\u201d</p><p>Anger at his obtuse nature flared in her and she gladly went with the emotion. She was tired of holding back, tired of forcing cool when he made her feel the exact opposite.</p><p>She slammed her hand on the back of the couch, kicking up a small puff of dust. \u201cJesus, don\u2019t you get it? I\u2019m not like you, I\u2019ll never be like you. I can\u2019t live in your world and you certainly can\u2019t live in mine. I wanted to protect you from Carlotti until we neutralize him and that\u2019s fine, but that\u2019s all there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell.\u201d He started toward her and she stumbled back, not trusting herself to stay strong, stay angry, if he touched her. If he touched her, she was going to forget all about their differences...again. \u201cI see your little field trip for what it is. You broke into a mansion and did what you liked there...no one could stop you. Then you went to a fence, who sure isn\u2019t going to turn you in\u2014he\u2019s probably been profiting off your hobbies for years. Then you take me to the worst neighborhood in the city to show me how everyone defers to you. This whole \u2018hacking\u2019 thing was supposed to prove that you\u2019re evil incarnate and\u2014tell the truth\u2014you wanted to show me what you could do. You wanted to show off a little. Don\u2019t you get that you don\u2019t have to steal to be worth something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, I knew you couldn\u2019t under\u2014\u201d</p><p>He swiftly crossed the room to her and put his hands on her shoulders, shaking her as one would a child.</p><p>His face was blazing, but not with anger. With sincerity and passion. \u201cYou\u2019re precious in yourself, you need prove nothing, you\u2019ve got so much to offer, you are your own self , Kara and you\u2019re not defined by what you steal or who you can beat up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014that\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I care that you\u2019re a thief? You think I care that you steal pretty stones and give them to people who don\u2019t have your determination to stay strong? You think I give two shits that the D.A. wants to throw your ass in jail?\u201d The mere act of saying the words made Jared\u2019s expression darken. \u201cHe won\u2019t, not while I\u2019m around. Nobody is going to put you in a cage while I\u2019m around, so just stop it, stop running away, stop pretending you don\u2019t feel it, stop telling yourself you don\u2019t want me as badly as I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook her again and the word was a roar: \u201cCoward!\u201d</p><p>She brought them to the floor with a deft leg sweep, landing squarely on top of his chest. He was still holding her shoulders and she stared into his eyes, dark and blazing. \u201cI am a coward,\u201d she said softly, less than an inch from his mouth, \u201cbut only when I remember I have something to lose.\u201d Then she bent down and kissed him. His arms were around her a moment later, his mouth opening beneath hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThief,\u201d he said into her mouth. \u201cTook my heart, too, damn you.\u201d</p><p>Then I\u2019m not the only thief in the room, she had time to think, before capitulating to the sensations he effortlessly called up in her. His crisp, clean, utterly masculine scent delighted her, she felt like burying her face in his neck and never letting go. She tugged at his shirt and his fingers were there, frantically unbuttoning it for her and then he was yanking at her t-shirt. She sat up, straddling him and pulled it off, then unsnapped her bra. He groaned as her breasts bounced free and reached eagerly for her, his arms coming around her, his fingers stroking the smooth skin of her back. He sucked at the tender skin at the hollow of her throat and she grinned, knowing a hickey would soon bloom there, realizing they were like a couple of horny teenagers, furiously necking on the living room floor. As a teenager, she\u2019d never had the leisure to neck on anyone\u2019s floor. She found she liked it. A lot.</p><p>She pulled free of him and stood, then unzipped her jeans and slid them down her thighs until they puddled on the floor. He lay on the floor, arms crossed behind his head and watched with eyes narrowed from urgency. She pulled her panties down and stood over him for a long moment. His gaze held nothing but admiration, but part of her was frightened. It had been years since she had done this. Over three, at least and the last time out of pure loneliness and desperation, a foolish one night stand; she had never seen the man again.</p> <p>But this was different, Jared was different. She hadn\u2019t had feelings for her other lovers, pitiful though their numbers were. She hadn\u2019t had to will herself to keep her hands off them, didn\u2019t feel deep fear in the pit of her stomach when one of them had been in danger. The three men she had taken out of loneliness since she turned seventeen had lived in her life, had been raised by the same institutions she had and were quite conversant with danger. But Jared...</p><p>\u201cI want you to know something,\u201d he said softly, breaking her tormented reverie.</p><p>\u201cYes, Jared?\u201d Was she really standing naked over this man, debating whether or not to take him?</p><p>\u201cBe gentle. It\u2019s my first time. Also, frequent exposure to X-ray radiation has neutered me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She pounced on him, cutting off his laughter before it really got started. \u201cHow can you make jokes at a time like this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d he chuckled, \u201cI joke when I get nervous. And since you looked like you were getting ready to bolt\u2014naked, no less\u2014I figured I\u2019d better say something before you pulled another Houdini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo me a favor and stop figuring,\u201d she said dryly and then he mock-grabbed for her. She pulled back and they rolled over and over on the floor, tussling. She won, of course and soon she was once again straddling him.</p><p>\u201cHas anyone ever told you how utterly, utterly gorgeous you are?\u201d he said, his expression pure delight.</p><p>She blushed at his obvious sincerity. \u201cSomeone should paint you and hang you in a museum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuseums, now there\u2019s an easy hack,\u201d she teased.</p><p>He groaned and put his hands under her bottom. For a moment she wondered if he was going to grab her, then realized he was shoving his jeans down. \u201cKara, please. Now is not the time. I don\u2019t want to hear how you cracked the Louvre and made off with a zillion dollars worth of paintings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was only kidding. I\u2019d never steal from a museum,\u201d she said, offended.</p><p>\u201cOf course. How silly of me.\u201d He stopped smiling when he saw she wasn\u2019t. \u201cI know. You only crack the bad guys. Reason number seven hundred fifty-seven why I\u2019ve got a crush on you the size of Czechoslovakia. Now come here.\u201d</p><p>She bent to him, still prepared to sulk, then realized she was looking for a reason, any reason, tempted to pick a fight so she wouldn\u2019t have to be intimate with him. It wasn\u2019t a matter of being afraid of him. It was strictly a matter of being afraid of losing control, of blurting things to him that she swore to herself she would never tell anyone, ever.</p><p>His lips drove the unpleasant thoughts from her mind. They nibbled and kissed and sucked and then his tongue was darting into the cup of her ear and she could feel the zing of pleasure right down to her toes.</p><p>She could feel his length pressing urgently against her lower stomach and reached down to gently clasp him. He was hot and hard and quite large and throbbed intriguingly against her palm. She started to ease down, intent on taking him into her mouth, when he grabbed her shoulders and pulled her back up.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled, honest to God, but if you do that , we\u2019re done before we started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow disappointing,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cShameful, but true. I remember your fingers from the last time we got carnal, you know. You can get to anything...especially me.\u201d While he murmured to her his hands were on her breasts, his fingers gently caressing the sensitive undersides.</p> <p>She stroked his stomach, his ribs, enjoying the way his firm flesh felt beneath her hands. He liked to rave about her body, but he was in pretty fine shape himself. She told him so.</p><p>\u201cVolleyball,\u201d he replied. \u201cThat\u2019s the secret. Also being too overworked to eat. Now come down here again. Kiss me.\u201d</p><p>She did and as his tongue slipped past her teeth she felt his fingers caressing her stomach and moving lower. Straddling him as she was, her knees were spread wide and he found her easily. She sucked in breath as his fingers stroked her slick flesh, moving with exquisite care and gentleness.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s nice. You\u2019re like...like hot damp silk,\u201d he sighed, breaking the kiss. One of his fingers slipped inside her, just barely nudging into her and she swallowed a groan. \u201cSit up a bit so I can watch your face.\u201d</p><p>A terrifying thought. He could watch her unguarded expressions, know instantly just how dear his touch was, how she craved it, craved him... \u201cNo,\u201d she said, hoping he would mistake her breathlessness for passion and not apprehension.</p><p>His face didn\u2019t change but his eyes went thoughtful and his finger slowly withdrew. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said easily, \u201cthat\u2019s all right.\u201d He pushed her up a bit and put his hands on her thighs, spreading them even wider. His thumbs stroked her inner thighs. \u201cKara, sweetheart, I\u2019m dying to find out if you taste as good as you look.\u201d While he talked, his hands were easing her forward, his voice gentle, as if soothing a wild mustang ready to bolt. More than a little dazed by the magic his fingers had wrought, she found herself over his mouth. She put her hands out and steadied herself against the wall and instantly realized in this position he couldn\u2019t see her face. Why had he done that? What was he thinking?</p><p>Then his tongue flicked against her and darted up inside her and she forgot everything except how he was making her feel. She swallowed a groan as he gently kissed then sucked and nibbled her so-sensitive flesh while marvelous warmth spread through her limbs, while she bit her lip to keep from crying out, while she pounded her palms against the wall. He groaned against her slick flesh and the vibration sent another shock wave of pleasure racing through her. She began to rock against his sweetly talented mouth, as unable to stop her movement as she could have regulated her heartbeat. Her orgasm neared, taunted her, then danced out of reach.</p><p>She felt his thumbs between her thighs, spreading her apart, exposing all of her to his mouth and she nearly shrieked at the wonder of it. She should have felt laid open, vulnerable, frightened. Instead, she was very much afraid Dr. Jared Dean was going to be raped in another half minute if he didn\u2019t...</p><p>His tongue found her throbbing center, darted across the sensitive bud and then his lips closed around it and he suckled gently while his tongue flicked with astonishing speed. She wasn\u2019t slapping the wall anymore, she was pounding it with her fists, her concentration narrowed to a fine point: in all the world, there was only his mouth and her approaching orgasm. But ah God it was still so far away, dancing just out of reach, she couldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>His finger\u2014no, two fingers slid inside her but his mouth, his tongue never stopped and her orgasm wasn\u2019t far away at all, it was right here , racing through her, making her shake, making her choke back a wild groan, making her claw the wall.</p><p>Another few moments and she was resting her forehead against her arm, trying to get her gasps under control. \u201cJared,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He was stroking her thighs; she\u2019d pulled back from his mouth so he could have some breathing room.</p><p>\u201cYes, hon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it again,\u201d she whispered and smiled at his groan. He put light pressure on her thighs and she let herself be pushed down until she was straddling him again. She reached behind her and found him, clasped him gently. About to lower herself on his throbbing rod, a glance at his face told her how it was with him...there was a muscle jumping in his cheek and his eyes were dark slits. His \u2018yes, hon?\u2019 had been so thick as to be unrecognizable. That made her feel closer to him than the intimate duty he\u2019d just performed for her...what was it he had said? That it was a relief to find out the attraction wasn\u2019t just one-sided?</p><p>\u201cI want to go slowly,\u201d she said, \u201cto make it last.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSure. I see that happening.\u201d He pushed at her thighs and lunged; in half a second he was fully embedded inside her, his hot hard length starting a glorious aching inside her. \u201cSorry,\u201d he panted, while she gasped and steadied herself on his chest as he began to thrust, \u201cbut if I don\u2019t come soon I\u2019m definitely going to enter heart attack country. God , you tasted good...sounded good.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t care, she barely heard his words, she was astonished at the power of his strokes, how he manipulated both their bodies to give them pleasure, how in this instance he wasn\u2019t easy-going Dr. Dean, but a pure male animal, determined on his course, obeying a biological imperative older than the family of Man.</p><p>She recovered from her surprise long enough to help him, to meet his thrusts and they both moaned in unison at how splendid that was, how they both made each other feel...if she believed in such things, she would have thought their bodies had been made expressly for the other and no one else...certainly it had never been like this before with another man. How could it have been? Other men were not Jared. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pulled her toward him and kissed her and the taste of herself on his mouth coupled with the fierce plunging between her thighs jolted her into another orgasm; she whimpered into his mouth. His tongue thrust past her teeth, demanding, possessing, insisting, his hands were hard on the back of her neck, forcing her to him, keeping her to him and she wanted more, needed more, but finally it was too much, too intense and she broke the kiss and buried her face in his throat. He cradled her head gently and then stiffened and she could feel his muscles lock as he at last found release.</p><p>They stayed pressed together for some minutes, too sated to venture conversation, but Kara started a silent countdown and couldn\u2019t help but smile when the inevitable wisecrack came: \u201cYou realize that as my bodyguard, it\u2019s completely unethical for you to be sexually harassing me like this? I\u2019m lodging a complaint with the union.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d find a way to spoil this,\u201d she said, but she didn\u2019t mean it. \u2018This\u2019 had been nothing special, not at all, merely an instant treasured memory to be taken out and lovingly explored some time in the future when she was alone again. \u201cAm I too heavy? Should I get off?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes and don\u2019t you dare move. Christ. As much as I\u2019ve been fantasizing about it, I never thought it\u2019d be so fabulous.\u201d</p><p>She giggled into his neck. \u201cYou\u2019ve been fantasizing? About me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, about Granny from The Beverly Hillbillies...of course about you. Christ, don\u2019t you know? You\u2019re all I can think about. Dream about. Wait\u2019ll I tell you what I was reduced to doing in the shower this morning...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d she said dryly, inwardly thrilling to his words. \u201cAnd as far as the sex being good, conceit, thy name is Jared. It was good because you\u2019re good.\u201d She laughed. \u201cAnd it\u2019s obnoxious to immediately start complimenting your own performance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it at all,\u201d he said, serious for once. She pulled back from his embrace and looked at him.</p> <p>There was no hidden grin, no teasing glint in his eyes. \u201cIt was you. You\u2019re amazing...so beautiful and responsive, although,\u201d he added with a wry smile, \u201cyou certainly did your best to hide the fact that you were affected by my surging, tumescent loins\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTumescent means windy,\u201d she said, fighting another laugh.</p><p>\u201c\u2014I mean, would it have killed you to scream that I was your love monkey? Maybe claw my back a little?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything, just kept smiling. Funny how he had noticed, though. Her control seemed to bother him, though she wasn\u2019t sure why. If anything, he should be grateful for it.</p><p>\u201cNext time, maybe,\u201d he said, then leered when she raised her eyebrows at him. \u201cAw, you know you can\u2019t resist me, baby. Of course, I\u2019ll need a good forty-eight hours to recover...\u201d</p><p>She poked him in the ribs, earning a grunt, then snuggled against him again, oddly reluctant to separate from him. Their lovemaking had been marvelous, sublime, but it had solved nothing. They were still ludicrously different, he would still bug out on her the moment things got hairy. But for now...</p> <p>For now, she thought, I could almost believe in happy endings.</p><p>\u201cOh, Kara,\u201d he sighed, stroking her back, \u201cyou really do have to marry me.\u201d</p><p>She froze. He felt it at once, but didn\u2019t comment, just kept running his hands up and down her back, trying to calm her with his touch. She would have given anything to know what he was thinking.</p><p>Stupid, she told herself. You know what he\u2019s thinking. Unlike you, he doesn\u2019t hide how he feels. He really thinks he loves you, the poor bastard.</p><p>O God, she thought in despair, we are in so much trouble .</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>He fell asleep with a stupid grin on his face, a grin that absolutely would not fade. He didn\u2019t want Kara thinking he had some sort of \u201cme Tarzan, you Jane, me Jane\u2019s hot love monkey\u201d mentality about what they had shared, so he tried to quit smiling by deliberately calling up terrible thoughts: Famine (Boy, Kara doesn\u2019t eat enough to keep a newborn alive, I should really get her to eat more...), war (Kara would kick some major ass in a war, we should get her into Afghanistan, take care of a few problems that way...), working a 48 hour shift with no intern to help (I wonder if Kara would come to work with me again and hang out for a while?), but she pervaded every rotten thought, making every one of them not so rotten. And now she was sleeping beside him!</p><p>She hadn\u2019t wanted to. She\u2019d wanted to get off the floor, get dressed, lock him in his apartment like a barely-trained dog and leave for the rest of the night. To go where, he had no idea...he didn\u2019t even know if she lived in the city. She was obviously rattled by his latest declaration of love and in true Kara fashion wanted to run away from strong emotion, hide until she had everything under control. Jared wanted more.</p> <p>Seeing he was going to be stubborn, she had sighed and acquiesced and they had crawled into bed together. Kara had dropped off at once\u2014after insisting she be the one to sleep nearest the door, still selflessly looking out for him like the utter sweetheart she was\u2014but Jared was having a little more trouble.</p><p>Of course, he hadn\u2019t gotten into a fight, taken out three strong men, broken into a mansion, swung by a pross house and then hotly defended her way of life, all in the space of six hours. All he\u2019d done, as usual where she was concerned, was watch and make wisecracks. Except at the end of the evening, of course.</p><p>His smile broadened, remembering. Sliding between Kara\u2019s thighs, seeing her gaze soften as her body welcomed him, had been like coming home and in much the same way someone\u2019s life flashed before their eyes at the moment of death, in that instance their future flashed before his. He saw a wedding, Kara blooming with child, babies, a house in the country. Children blessed with his sense of humor and Kara\u2019s utter fearlessness. He saw...oh, everything he\u2019d ever wanted since he was old enough to realize people could make their own families, their own happiness.</p><p>He knew better than to mention any of this to Kara. She got rattled enough when he told her he loved her. He always tried to make it sound like a joke, or hide the phrase in the middle of a sarcastic observation, but she tensed up anyway. No doubt about it\u2014the woman he\u2019d fallen for was big-time damaged.</p><p>Now, what to do about it?</p><p>Also, his mind whispered to him, annoyed, there\u2019s a contract out on your life.</p><p>Right, right, he hadn\u2019t forgotten. Well, actually he had, for hours. Getting to know Kara was infinitely more interesting than worrying about some mob boss who, frankly, Kara could beat the snot out of anytime she liked.</p><p>He glanced over at her, able to see quite well thanks to the moonlight splashed all over the room. Kara slept in the nude and her full breasts were peeking out from under the sheet. Her hair was unbound and spread across the pillow and looked as amazing as he had imagined it would. Interestingly, there was a frown wrinkle between her eyebrows and even deep into REMs, she looked like she was thinking hard about how to get out of a trap.</p><p>He tucked an arm around her slender shoulders and pulled her toward him and she at once shifted in her sleep and cuddled into his embrace. He smiled again\u2014God, he just could not stop with the grinning\u2014and thought it was telling that Kara didn\u2019t keep any sort of distance between them when she wasn\u2019t consciously trying.</p><p>Her thigh was draped across him and the feel of her smooth skin, coupled with the sweet weight of her breasts against his arm, caused an interested stirring between his legs. He forced the thought away. Kara needed her sleep...and so did he.</p><p>Now if he could only stop grinning.</p><p>Doctors, especially those not long out of their first year residency, often came awake easily. In Jared\u2019s case, Kara\u2019s uneasy stirring brought him fully awake a moment before she cried out in her sleep. The sheets and blankets had twisted around her and she fought them with weak, frantic cries. He shook her shoulder\u2014and dodged as her small fist shot out, missing the side of his face by a hair.</p><p>\u201cKara! Wake up, honey, you\u2019re having one hell of a bad dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody\u2019s gone!\u201d she cried, thrashing. \u201cThey\u2019re gone, I\u2019m all alone again. No! Come back! Come back !\u201d The body was Kara\u2019s, the deadly fists were also hers, but the wailing was that of a child, abandoned. Lost. And Jared instinctively responded to that voice.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d he soothed, dodging another flailing fist and pulling her into a tight embrace. \u201cI\u2019m here.</p><p>You\u2019re not alone. Everything\u2019s all right.\u201d Until she remembers a little more of her training , he thought nervously and knees me in the gonads.</p><p>Trembling like a puppy, she shook her head against his shoulder. He was fairly certain she wasn\u2019t awake\u2014not completely\u2014and wondered how old this memory of hers was. Ten years? Twenty?</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all gone,\u201d she said, almost moaned, \u201cand I have to go back. He\u2019ll hurt me. He\u2019s always hurting me.\u201d</p><p>Who, Jared wondered with growing rage, was \u2018he\u2019? A foster father? A guard at Juvenile Hall? One of the many who had hurt Kara for his own end, then either abandoned her or forced her to run away again.</p><p>Only, Jared grimly deduced, to be brought back and shuffled into another foster home, where the cycle could start again. And again. A wretched existence, one that had broken more children than not. It was amazing that Kara had not only survived, but had emerged with her conscience and honor intact.</p><p>\u201cNo one lays a hand on you while I\u2019m around,\u201d he said, pulling the blankets over both of them, gratified at how she pressed against him, already relaxing back into sleep. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m here and I\u2019m not going anywhere. Not ever.\u201d</p><p>Not even, he added silently, if I have to handcuff myself to your side for a year to get you to believe I\u2019d never abandon you .</p><p>He caressed her breast, felt her nipple stiffen against his palm and stroked slowly, soothingly. She sighed. \u201cGo to sleep,\u201d he murmured, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing here to be scared of,\u201d and wondered how the hell he was supposed to go to sleep with a cock that was now wide awake and raring to go. For starters, you could keep your hands to yourself, moron . Sure. He\u2019d stop eating and breathing while he was at it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes were open and she was staring at him in the gloom. She rolled closer, pressing more of her breast into his hand. She took a deep, shaky breath and let it out slowly. \u201cJared,\u201d she whispered, \u201cdon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that \u2018Don\u2019t. Stop!\u2019 or \u2018don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust shut up,\u201d she said, not unkindly, \u201cand love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an easy one,\u201d he said gently, kissing her brow. \u201cEasier than breathing.\u201d He wasn\u2019t talking about the physical act. He wondered if she knew that. Even if she did, he realized, she wouldn\u2019t believe him. It was enough to make him want to weep...or beat the living shit out of everyone in her life who had ever hurt her.</p><p>He forced that away, not wanting to let ugly thoughts intrude on their precious time together. He leaned forward and kissed her, slowly sucking her lower lip into his mouth. She made a small sound and reached for him, found him, then her hand slid lower and she gently cuddled his testicles in her palm.</p><p>He pressed kisses to her throat, her upper chest, her breasts and moved lower, licking the small cup of her navel, nuzzling the sweet fleshy slope that led to her marvelous center. He parted her with his tongue, smiling at her gasp and slowly, lovingly licked her slick length, tasting her salty warmth. She was still damp from their earlier lovemaking, from the seed he\u2019d eagerly given her and that thought\u2014he\u2019d left his mark on her, in her\u2014thrilled his inner Neanderthal.</p> <p>She was wriggling while he nuzzled and licked and kissed, catching more and more of her wetness with his tongue, spreading her damp folds so he could lap up her marvelous juices. Wriggling and groaning and saying something and...moving? He was so deeply into the moment, concentrating on her so fiercely, that he hadn\u2019t noticed her movements until he felt her own mouth close around him. Her hand was still cupping his testicles, but now he could feel himself easing into her mouth, down her throat. In response he jabbed his tongue inside her as far as it would go and felt her tremble beneath him. In response to that , she backed off, only to slowly suck one of his testicles into her mouth.</p><p>He nearly fainted on the spot. It felt like the bottom dropped out of his scrotum, the sensation was so fine he could feel his eyes roll back. He couldn\u2019t recall any woman ever doing that to him before.</p><p>She eased off again, probably feeling him shaking like a mobile home in a hurricane and whispered anxiously, \u201cWas that all right? I\u2019ve never tried that before.\u201d</p><p>He said something\u2014\u201cGbbrrlldd,\u201d it sounded like and when she tried it again his hips bucked without prompting from his brain. She played with him like that for a while, her tongue dancing circles around his aching balls and he endured, his face pressed against her inner thigh, not daring to pleasure her for fear he would accidentally bite her or be too rough. When she pulled back and again sucked his length into her mouth, he felt it was safe to continue with her and, in fact, was eager for the taste of her again.</p><p>She was holding him quite easily and he marveled at the concealed strength in her small, wiry frame. She was supporting him by his inner thighs, occasionally lowering him enough so he could plunge deeply into her throat, then pushing him back so she could breathe easier. While she took breaths, her tongue flicked out at the tip of him, teasing, stroking and even\u2014very gently\u2014nibbling.</p><p>In response, he again spread her wide and licked her slick length, pausing to pay extra, delicate attention to the impudent bud that was the center of her pleasure. Her thighs trembled in his hands as he slowly sucked her clit into his mouth and he hummed against her flesh, knowing the vibrations would push her closer to the edge. He dipped a finger inside her, then withdrew, then dipped again. When his finger was slick, he stroked a path down to the tight bloom of her anus and gently rubbed the rich core of nerve endings there. She made a surprised sound which escalated to a muffled shriek as he slowly pushed his finger past that tight muscular ring. She writhed, trying to jerk away from him, but had no leverage from her position and, with his cock in her throat, no way to verbally protest.</p> <p>\u201cEasy,\u201d he murmured, \u201cjust let me...for another few seconds...it\u2019s all right...\u201d When he was up to the first knuckle he bent to her again, jamming his tongue inside her damp cave and prodding as his nose dug into her clitoris and his finger slid around slowly, out just a touch and then in, no big dramatic strokes, just an overall pressure and gentle wriggling.</p><p>She quit trying to get away from him; he could, in fact, feel her entire body quaking as her orgasm neared. She let go of his thighs and he thrust against her warm, inviting mouth, hoping like hell she was getting enough air, hoping like hell he would come soon before he had a heart attack...meanwhile, the taste and smell of her was in his mouth, his nose, driving him crazy, making him want to never stop touching her, tasting her and she was bucking against him and he felt her clench around him as she shook with the force of her orgasm. A half-second later, he found his own release, felt his seed pouring down her throat and pulled back, afraid for her, but she held onto his thighs with an iron grip and milked him greedily, not letting go until she was damn well ready.</p><p>They collapsed against each other and lay without moving, trying to get their breath back. Finally, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t even remember why I woke up. But thank God I did.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and the laugh turned into a groan as she pinched his inner thigh, then started tickling. He barely had the strength to roll away from her. \u201cChrist, you\u2019re amazing,\u201d he had time to say before falling into a sleep so deep, it was nearly unconsciousness.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>Kara came awake like a cat in the dark. As always when in a strange place, her waking thoughts were chaotic: Where am I? Is it safe here? How long have I been here? Who\u2019s after me? Am I safe here ?</p><p>Memories flooded back and she relaxed, then despised herself for relaxing. She certainly wasn\u2019t safe in Jared\u2019s bed. For one thing, the man was deluded into thinking he cared about her, but she wasn\u2019t falling for that one, thanks very much. For another, the man was ridiculously talented in bed, a Gold Star Lover...not that her experience was vast, but still. She thought about his hands on her, his mouth on her and felt her face getting warm. He\u2019d done things to her no one had ever done, things she\u2019d never even thought of. And her body craved more, needed more.</p><p>She forced her mind away from Jared\u2019s overall marvelousness and back to the problems at hand.</p> <p>Carlotti had a contract on the man whose bed she was sharing. Jared was a bomb waiting to go off and blow her life to pieces; it was a simply a matter of what happened first: Carlotti got the drop on them, or Jared broke her heart.</p><p>Then run, her mind whispered treacherously and she squirmed in shame. Jared saw a lot\u2014too much, sometimes\u2014and he was right when he called her a coward. It was her nature to run from adversity and emotional danger. Jared had meant something to her from the beginning and that had only made her fight harder.</p><p>Now it was too late. She quit pretending when he coaxed her into staying overnight. She was in love.</p><p>She was such a stupid fool she had given her heart to someone again, despite life\u2019s cold lessons...and look who she\u2019d picked to fall for! A doctor who was as straight and narrow as a ruler, whose idea of big trouble was running out of gauze pads.</p><p>Lying next to Jared\u2019s comforting warmth, she wryly reflected on the fact that she would take murderous goons and the threat of jail over falling in love any day. She was the thief, but Jared had effortlessly lifted her heart and taken it for himself. His sleight of hand had been so superb, she had never seen it coming.</p><p>She sat up and looked around his bedroom. There was plenty of light from the moon and she observed a single man\u2019s clutter, a man who worked long hours and cared little for keeping up with the laundry.</p><p>Despite the mess, his bedroom was comfortable and inviting. And big. Plenty of room for two.</p><p>She shook her head at her foolishness. Jared was beyond marvelous, with a healer\u2019s comforting touch and a comedian\u2019s wit, but he would eventually leave her, as everyone did. Does. It wasn\u2019t a bad thing, it was just the nature of things, of men, of family. She knew once you grew to depend on someone, they would immediately leave you to an orphanage or the streets.</p><p>Worst of all were the foster families, the ones who didn\u2019t have to care for you, who were paid by the state to feed you, but then pretended they did care, right before they shipped you back to the state home.</p><p>She had sworn by the age of ten never again to fall into the trap of caring and for the most part had kept that promise to herself. There had been a few slips, of course, but the lesson, hard learned, sometimes had to be reinforced.</p><p>She eased from the bed and Jared never stirred, though he muttered unhappily in his sleep and his hand sought her. She tucked the blankets beneath his chin, marveling at how boyish and charming he appeared even in sleep. She hated to leave him, this warm, comfortable room, this place. And because she hated it so much, she made herself get dressed and get the hell out.</p><p>Once on the street, she paused for a moment, observing pre-dawn traffic and wondering what to do now. Her attitude toward Carlotti had always been re-active, not pro-active: she never went looking for trouble, but when it found her she defended herself. That, she belatedly realized, was not the way to handle the Carlotti situation. The more time she spent with Jared, the more foolish her thoughts became.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t quit bodyguarding, couldn\u2019t walk out of Jared\u2019s life and leave him on his own until the situation resolved itself. Good doctor Jared would become shortly a Mob prisoner, then a cadaver. So how best to complete her service and get out of Jared\u2019s life?</p><p>Pro-active, she reminded herself, buttoning her jacket against the early morning chill. Find Carlotti. It wouldn\u2019t be difficult. Find him and kill him. Now. Before one more day went by. And then get out of Jared\u2019s life... before he hurts you... while there was still time. She had never killed anyone\u2014that sort of thing was never necessary during her hacks\u2014but she figured Carlotti was an excellent place to start. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Given a choice between taking an irrevocable step toward corruption and keeping Jared safe...no contest.</p><p>Okay. One of Carlotti\u2019s girls was living at Mag\u2019s pross house. Mag owed her several favors. It was a good place to start.</p><p>Kara stepped down from the curb to flag the cab at the end of the block.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s here for sure ,\u201d the prostitute repeated nervously. The woman\u2019s street name was Krystal (\u201cThat\u2019s with a \u2018K\u2019, sugarbumps.\u201d) and while she claimed to be not yet drinking age, Kara put her at mid-to-late twenties. Of course, Krystal-with-a-K could be right. The street was tough on faces and the average pross had a shelf life slightly longer than yogurt. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know why we had to come here now . I told you, if he comes , it won\u2019t be \u2018til suppertime .\u201d</p><p>Krystal slung her purse over one bony hip and glared at Kara. She was a tall woman, underweight and twitchy, with a long, narrow face and a gleaming gaze that watched avidly for disaster. The woman had observed a child slip and fall down hard enough to skin both knees bloody and had laughed so hard she\u2019d stumbled off the curb. Kara hadn\u2019t commented, but did walk over and assist the child to his feet, brushed him off and sent him on his way. She wasn\u2019t surprised, by either the child\u2019s misfortune or Krystal\u2019s cruelty. The prostitute with a heart of gold was a movie myth. The very nature of their work bred savagery and indifference. Their lives were so hard, who cared about anyone else\u2019s? Kara didn\u2019t like it, but she could understand it.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate you showing me the place,\u201d she replied absently. The warehouse was close to the train depot and she imagined it had once been used to store incoming shipments. Krystal told her Carlotti used it to house stolen goods and black market movies...here a customer could get a tape of a movie before it even hit the theaters. \u201cBut it\u2019s beginning to occur to me that I\u2019ve been something of an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Krystal replied, her ratty gaze darting all over the empty first floor. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>It had taken Kara hours to seek out Krystal and talk the woman into giving her directions to the warehouse. Krystal\u2019s insistence on accompanying her should have been the first tip-off. Now it was past lunchtime and Kara remembered that, as usual, no one knew where she was, or when she was expected back. She\u2019d been led to an abandoned warehouse by an untrustworthy woman who laughed at a child\u2019s pain. And she only had Krystal\u2019s word that Carlotti wouldn\u2019t be here for another six hours.</p> <p>The oldest trick in the book, Kara thought, shaking her head as she heard the bolt from the front door shoot home, locking them both inside. And I fell for it. Because I wanted to rush and get this over with so I could run away from Jared. Stupid, stupid girl. Now pay the price for your cowardice.</p><p>A few boxes tumbled to the floor across the room and then Anthony Carlotti was walking toward her, flanked, as always, by several musclemen. And one musclewoman , she reminded herself, seeing Krystal\u2019s malevolent grin. The woman had not been nervous about betraying Carlotti. She\u2019d been nervous that Kara would smell a trap and vamoose.</p><p>\u201cLooka this,\u201d Carlotti said, pushing more boxes out of the way, \u201cwe got us a thief in the house.\u201d</p><p>Krystal cackled dutifully, watching avidly while Carlotti slipped black leather gloves over his huge fists.</p><p>Kara knew he wore them when he planned to beat someone to death. It was a special murder saved for special occasions: rivals, traitors. Hated enemies. Beating someone to death hurt his hands, broke bones, so he didn\u2019t do it often.</p><p>\u201cGosh,\u201d she said mildly, relishing his annoyance at how she wasn\u2019t cowering, \u201clucky me.\u201d She knew her expression was mellow, her tone unworried, but inwardly she was seething at her foolishness; she had stopped making such mistakes by her eleventh birthday. Jared had shaken her in more ways than one, but she couldn\u2019t blame him for this. No, she was definitely in a mess of her own making.</p> <p>And what a mess it was. She could have taken two of the bad guys, maybe three, not counting Carlotti.</p><p>But there were five total and, judging by the bulges in a few jackets, three of them were armed.</p><p>She came to the unsurprising realization that she was going to die, that it was going to take a long time, that they would probably strip her of her valued control before it was over. She didn\u2019t mind dying so much\u2014or wouldn\u2019t have, before loving Jared\u2014but above all she wanted to die well. And she was pretty sure that wasn\u2019t going to be possible.</p><p>Worst of all, she had left Jared unprotected. Once she was bleeding her life out on the filthy warehouse floor, Carlotti could pick Jared off at his leisure. All it would take was one phone call\u2014come quick, Dr.</p><p>Dean, your lady friend is in trouble. And Jared, blessed do-gooder, would come on the run. Dying was awful enough. Dying with the knowledge that she had killed Jared with cowardice was too much to be borne.</p><p>While Carlotti edged closer\u2014cautious, even on his own turf, surrounded by his own people\u2014she decided she would have to take Carlotti with her. She could do that much for Jared.</p><p>While she pondered how best to kill her killer, Carlotti had crossed the room and slapped her hard enough to slam her back against the table. She shook off the blow, blew her hair out of her face and asked with mild curiosity, \u201cDo you throw like a girl, too?\u201d</p><p>Carlotti reddened and raised a clenched fist. Kara gathered herself for the fight of her life...and his. Time seemed to freeze for a long moment and then there was a brisk knock.</p> <p>Surprised, they all looked toward the door.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>\u201cOkay, Jared, don\u2019t panic.\u201d This was good advice, which unfortunately didn\u2019t take because he was trying to put his pants on backwards.</p><p>Finally dressed, he fled the apartment, cursing himself at every step. He had known when Kara left, of course...he\u2019d been a light sleeper all his life. A mouse couldn\u2019t creep out of his bed without him knowing it. He assumed she wanted to get up to have some time to herself, maybe use the bathroom. The click of the front door closing had brought him bolt upright in bed. By the time he\u2019d thrown his clothes on and gotten to the street, she was long gone.</p><p>And he knew what she was going to do. He wasn\u2019t sure how he had come by the knowledge\u2014no, that was a lie. He knew Kara, had watched her, fought beside her (sort of), had his hands on her while she came, held her in his arms while she slept. He knew her fear, though he only had a vague idea of its depths. And knew the only way someone with her warrior\u2019s honor could leave his life was if she eliminated the threat to him.</p><p>She had gone after ole One Eyebrow. He had to stop her or, if he was too late to do that, help her. And there was only one person he could turn to for help.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019ll it be, doc?\u201d Mag asked, covering her surprise with a friendly leer. \u201cHalf \u2018n half? Around the world? All my ladies aim to please. Satisfaction guaranteed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d she admitted, \u201call my girls are retired now. The most we could offer you is a hickey. Five bucks,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake! I\u2019m here to find out where Kara went, not to indulge in a business transaction.\u201d Jared tried for fierce and hoped like hell he wasn\u2019t blushing. His face felt hot, but that could be because he\u2019d run all the way here from his car. \u201cShe\u2019s gone after ole One Eyebr\u2014Carlotti. I\u2019ve got to help her.\u201d</p><p>Mag snorted. \u201cHelp her what? Get killed?\u201d</p><p>Jared fought the urge to choke the former madam. It was more of the street \u201cKara doesn\u2019t need help and even if she did, you should leave her alone\u201d mentality. Stand alone and never ever ask for help, because that meant you were weak. These people , he thought grimly, have watched too many Clint Eastwood movies.</p><p>Even the street punks he\u2019d backed down had cautioned him to leave Kara alone. Funny, how the street knew her\u2014their\u2014business, but wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t interfere. Scared of Carlotti, or more of that maddening street code...either way, it was an infuriating impediment.</p><p>He\u2019d brought his car to a smoking stop in front of a fire hydrant and all but leapt onto the cracked sidewalk. He\u2019d charged up the stairs to Mag\u2019s place, only to find his way blocked by three husky teens, any one of whom would have been a formidable opponent.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t cared. Clenching his fists, he\u2019d snarled, \u201cOut of the way, boys. I\u2019m a doctor. I can hurt you in ways you can\u2019t begin to imagine.\u201d Which hadn\u2019t impressed them, he was annoyed to note, but one of the boys had recognized him as the man who\u2019d shown up with the Avenging Angel the day before and told the other two to back off.</p><p>Jared had strutted past them. \u201cThat\u2019s right, punks. Touch me and the Angel will have your braces for Christmas tinsel. She worships the ground I walk on, you know.\u201d</p><p>He had ignored the hoots that greeted this statement. He\u2019d also ignored the parting advice of one: \u201cStay out of this, homely.\u201d</p><p>\"That's 'homey',\" he'd muttered back, only to hear more laughter.</p><p>Now he was faced with Mag, who wasn\u2019t any more help than the boys had been. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? She\u2019s in this mess because of me. She\u2019s taking on Carlotti because of me .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy, aren\u2019t you the powerful one. Didn\u2019t think anybody could get Angel in a mess without her say-so.\u201d</p><p>She gave Jared a long, pitiless look. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no mess she\u2019s in that you won\u2019t make it worse. You\u2019re not one of us, doc. You\u2019re a citizen. I bet you even pay taxes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for reminding me and by the way, it\u2019s not a dirty word,\u201d he snapped. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve had quite enough of the you-wouldn\u2019t-understand-you\u2019re-not-one-of-us bullshit. Just because I didn\u2019t grow up around the corner doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know about trouble.\u201d</p><p>Mag was silent. They both looked when the door to the entryway opened and a girl\u2014a kid, no more than thirteen, probably\u2014entered, carrying two glasses of ice water. She handed them to Mag, gave Jared a brief, uninterested look and left the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave something to drink,\u201d Mag said at last, handing Jared a glass. \u201cYou probably need it. Running all over the place like an idiot. You know, Kara won\u2019t thank you for butting in.\u201d</p><p>Relief made his knees want to buckle; he willed himself to stand straight. Mag had said Kara wouldn\u2019t thank him, which sounded an awful lot like the canny former prostitute had knowledge she was going to share. \u201cI won\u2019t thank you,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cif something happens to her because I\u2019m not there to help.</p><p>Especially when you know where she is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly, I only have a guess. I didn\u2019t have time to warn her about Krystal,\u201d she said, sounding annoyed, \u201cand that\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m telling you anything. If I thought she had the whole story, I wouldn\u2019t say shit and there wouldn\u2019t be a thing you could do about it, pretty boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarn her?\u201d he asked sharply. Definitely don\u2019t like the sound of that, oh no .</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t here when Krystal left with her. Kara can take care of herself, but Krystal\u2019s a snake and snakes bite everybody, even snake handlers.\u201d</p><p>Mystifying, but interesting. Jared nodded encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cI was about a day away from kicking her skinny ass out of here. She was trouble from the start. Not because of what she\u2019s been through, what she\u2019s done. She\u2019s trouble because she likes it. I can\u2019t put up with that. Won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Well. Any woman a tough cookie like Mag didn\u2019t like definitely bore watching. Suddenly realizing how thirsty he was and realizing he wasn\u2019t going anywhere until Mag had her say, he drained his water glass and gagged on the lemon slice before spitting it back among the ice cubes.</p><p>Mag sighed and he had a moment of sympathy for her. The woman was getting ready to do things that went against everything she had ever learned. She was going to trust a stranger, she was going to help that stranger interfere in street business and she was as much as admitting the infamous Avenging Angel needed help. Big-time sins, where she and Kara had come from.</p><p>He didn\u2019t care. Concern for Kara drove out consideration for Mag\u2019s moral dilemma. If he had to, he\u2019d throttle the information out of the woman and to hell with anyone who might get in his way.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know for sure,\u201d Mag said at last. \u201cBut there\u2019s a warehouse Carlotti\u2019s been using lately. Krystal was busted there last week, but the cops only hauled her in, nobody else in the gang. You might want to try there. It\u2019s down by the waterfront. Third and Lancaster. You can\u2019t miss it, it takes up the whole block.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye,\u201d he said, putting down his glass and turning to leave. Mag reached out, flash-quick and snagged his elbow. Jared was astonished at the smaller woman\u2019s strength. He could have broken her hold, but it would have taken effort, as well as precious time.</p><p>\u201cFreeze, Doctor Doofus. Do you have a plan? I mean, besides barging through the front door and getting shot in the face?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. That was pretty much my plan. Let go, willya? You\u2019re cutting off the circulation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou in the market for some advice, Citizen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of my girls. They get sick a lot. Too many years standing on street corners, you\u2019ll catch everything, you know?\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded. He did know. Prostitutes were easy prey for just about any bug that came along. Many of them were afflicted with chronic colds, viruses and the tunnel honeys developed emphysema in a distressingly short time from exposure to car exhaust.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mag was saying, \u201cthey don\u2019t like to go to the clinic. The wait\u2019s long, they have to sit through lectures from people who don\u2019t know shit about the life and if you don\u2019t have insurance it\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nightmare of paperwork and bureaucratic indifference,\u201d Jared finished. \u201cHow about I make some housecalls for you? Maybe two or three times a month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDara!\u201d Mag yelled, startling him and the same girl who had brought their drinks reappeared. She was actually, Jared noticed, much younger than early teens. He didn\u2019t want to think about the circumstances that had led her to a home for retired prostitutes. \u201cWe still got those boxes left over from last night\u2019s supper?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe also need to borrow one of your birthday presents. The one I got you for a joke.\u201d</p><p>Dara almost smiled. The child reminded him of a younger, more solemn Kara. \u201cBe right back,\u201d she said, turning to leave.</p><p>\u201cAssuming you don\u2019t get killed, doc\u2014which you probably will\u2014I\u2019ll expect you here a week from today to give some of the girls a checkup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the vote of confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think your presence will make a damn bit of difference,\u201d Mag went on ruthlessly, \u201cbut you never know. If nothing else, you might make a good distraction. So here\u2019s what I suggest you do...\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>There was another knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is that?\u201d Carlotti asked, perplexed.</p><p>He was right to be perplexed, Kara thought. This wasn\u2019t a neighborhood where one knocked. Certainly the police wouldn\u2019t bother. And anyone who belonged in this warehouse was here right now. So who was it?</p><p>\u201cGirl Scout cookie time already?\u201d she asked brightly.</p><p>\u201cShut the hell up. Joey, go open the door.\u201d</p><p>Joey did, first freeing his semi-automatic and holding it loosely in his gun hand. Kara noticed he hadn\u2019t bothered to ratchet a bullet in the chamber, a fact which cheered her immensely. How nice to know that Carlotti, a monumental idiot, still chose to surround himself with fellow morons. She almost laughed aloud and got ready.</p><p>Her mood had dramatically shifted and she wondered at it. And in another half-second she was able to put her finger on the reason for her sudden high spirits. For once in her life, she wasn\u2019t acting like a rat in a trap, wasn\u2019t wondering how best to scuttle away and live to thieve another day. Now she was thinking like an assassin. It was unsettling, but nice to be thinking about something besides how to run.</p><p>Joey unbolted the door and swung it open. It groaned on heavy hinges which cried out for oil, revealing...</p><p>Jared.</p><p>\u201cPizza?\u201d Joey asked.</p><p>Kara closed her eyes. The stress had finally gotten to her. All those years of living by her wits, of cheating death\u2014and various arresting officers\u2014had finally caught up with her; in this moment of extreme peril, she was hallucinating.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s sixty-nine ninety-five,\u201d Jared was saying. Kara opened her eyes. It was Jared. Dressed in a red jacket, a red cap and jeans. Perhaps most surprising, he was carrying six large pizza boxes.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t an actual delivery uniform, she realized, but the bold colors\u2014coupled by the pizza boxes\u2014tricked the average observer into thinking he was a delivery boy.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t order no pizzas!\u201d Carlotti shouted, \u201cSo get the hell lost!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jared yelled back. \u201cDude, if you don\u2019t pay, it gets taken outta my paycheck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re payin\u2019! I gotta pepperoni extra cheese, I gotta meatlover\u2019s special, I gotta vegetarian, I gotta sausage onion mushroom, I gotta cheese...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we didn\u2019t order any pizza,\u201d Joey said, still trying to puzzle this out. Kara could practically read the man\u2019s torturous thought process: we should be beating the crap outta the bimbo, instead we\u2019re talking about pizza? Wha?</p><p>\u201cSixty-nine ninety-five, man, let\u2019s go, I\u2019m double parked.\u201d Suddenly, shockingly, he hurled the pizza boxes at the bad guys, who had loosely clustered around Joey and yelled, \u201cRun, Kara!\u201d</p><p>Joey\u2019s elbow came up, blocking, but it did no good...the boxes went everywhere, their tops popping open and spilling their load. To her astonishment\u2014and Kara had thought nothing more would surprise her this day\u2014she saw the boxes were filled with dozens and dozens of marbles.</p><p>Pandemonium. Joey was the first to fall, hitting the cement floor so hard his gun was jarred from his grip.</p><p>Jared snatched it from the floor, cat-quick, then pointed it at Carlotti with wildly trembling aim, squinched his eyes shut, again yelled, \u201cKara, dammit, run!\u201d and pulled the trigger.</p><p>Nothing happened, of course; she doubted Jared knew how to pump a cartridge in the chamber.</p><p>Frankly, she was surprised he\u2019d known which end to point at Carlotti. But it didn\u2019t matter; it was his pure hearted effort that counted. He\u2019d risked everything to come here, the moron and had been ready to violate his healer\u2019s oath to save her life.</p><p>She had no trouble keeping her balance on the treacherous floor; it took stamina and concentration, both of which she had in spades. She was at Jared\u2019s side in an instant, pulling the gun from his grip and throwing it as hard as she could. She knew more about guns than her lover\u2014almost anyone would\u2014but she had always concentrated on the martial arts, never feeling the need to bring a gun along on her hacks.</p><p>Besides, she had noticed before that those who were good with guns often depended on them to the exclusion of everything else.</p><p>Three of the goons were scrambling on the floor like dazed crabs. Marbles were still rolling everywhere.</p><p>One of thugs had racked his knee as he\u2019d fallen and was not at all interested in getting up and joining the fray. Instead, he rocked back and forth on the floor, his lips skinned back from his teeth, holding his knee with both hands. Kara heard a click and shoved Jared out of the way just as the air exploded with sound.</p><p>\u201cThe idiots don\u2019t even have silencers,\u201d she muttered, flinging a pizza box at another bad guy\u2019s head.</p><p>During his flinch she kicked his legs out from under him and yanked the gun away hard enough to break two of his fingers. The small crackling sounds\u2014and the significantly louder scream of the creep who\u2019d actually shot at Jared \u2014were infinitely satisfying. For a moment, she was sorely tempted to empty the clip into the goon\u2019s head and almost smiled...she hadn\u2019t been nearly so furious at the danger to her own life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joey had gotten to his knees, only to topple over as Jared dealt him a vicious kick to the kidneys.</p><p>Kara broke a chair over another one, kicking his gun across the floor where it skittered beneath a table.</p><p>She looked around, grinning and unable to stop. Chaos reigned. In less than thirty seconds, the situation had radically changed. Now it was no longer a question of \u201cgee, I hope I can kill Carlotti before he kills me\u201d. Now there was no doubt. She would kill him and end this. There was time to do one of two things: save herself, or do what should have been done years ago.</p> <p>No contest.</p><p>She started toward Carlotti, who was trying to help two of his men up at the same time, urging them to</p><p>\u201cget her, shoot her, fuckin\u2019 get her, dammit!\u201d too much a coward to take her on alone. He wasn\u2019t armed\u2014he\u2019d been planning to beat her to death\u2014and she was still grinning, could feel the expression on her face and knew it wasn\u2019t a nice smile, but oh, she wanted his death so badly, wanted Jared safe forever and now, now it was going to be done, it finally\u2014</p><p>Someone tackled her from behind; it was like being taken down by a diesel truck. She got her arm up on front of her face before her nose connected with the cement floor, then felt herself lifted quickly and hustled toward the door at the back of the room. She got a whiff of Jared\u2019s aftershave and in a moment of perfect understanding realized what he had done. And what he had prevented her from doing.</p><p>\u201cJared, let go ! I can\u2019t let the opportunity go by, I can\u2019t run away from this! You idiot, you\u2019re ruining everything!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWrong, blondie,\u201d he said and the tricky bastard didn\u2019t even sound out of breath. He had one arm twisted into the center of the back and was propelling her so firmly and quickly, it was all she could do to keep her feet.</p><p>They left the chaos of the main room behind them and, to the stunned mobsters, it must have seemed that they disappeared into the shadows.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>\u201cYou idiot!\u201d she hissed as he yanked her into a small storage room. She got a brief glimpse of a short counter, some mops and a few pails before he closed the door. She stood perfectly still, waiting for her eyes to adjust to the dark, while he stumbled around, feeling for something to block the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you might have been killed!\u201d Never had she felt so many conflicting emotions: anger, relief, giddiness, fear. \u201cI left you in bed for a reason, you know. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shushed her scolding with a long kiss, then lifted her and placed her on the counter. She wondered how he could see a thing in the dark and was a little annoyed, frankly. She was the fly-by-night cat burglar, for heaven\u2019s sake...it was ridiculous that she had been cursed with lousy night vision.</p> <p>She pulled away from the kiss\u2014not without regret\u2014and opened her mouth to continue listing his wrongdoings and brother, they were legion, when he pinched her on the underside of her right breast, hard.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet. You don\u2019t get to yell at me. I get to yell at you. Quit putting yourself in danger for my sake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your voice down.\u201d They had been whispering and it was doubtless Carlotti and Co. were mobilized yet, but old cautionary habits died hard.</p><p>He sighed, a depressing sound in the dark. She wished she could see his expression. \u201cLook, Kara, I guess I\u2019m a\u2014a closet chauvinist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCloset imbecile, you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can take care of yourself most of the time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the time?\u201d</p> <p>He ignored the interruption. \u201cBut I can\u2019t help coming to your rescue. And admit it! This time you needed it. If I hadn\u2019t distracted those guys, you\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to think of that. Her stupidity. How she had been led to the warehouse like a child of five. \u201cYou should have stayed home,\u201d she said stonily.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not listening. If you ever leave me alone in the dark to go off and confront a killer\u2014if you ever try to take on five men by yourself again, I\u2019ll break your neck.\u201d He was hissing in her ear, making all the hairs on her left arm stand up. She couldn\u2019t tell if he was scolding her out of relief or if he was really furious. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to the D.A. myself...I\u2019ll never cook lunch for you again...and...and...\u201d Then he kissed her again, hard enough to make her lean backward. It was a bruising, possessive kiss and she could feel her unwitting response to it, feel the wanting flare up in her like newspaper catching fire.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get out of here,\u201d she managed and he took advantage of her open mouth; his tongue thrust past her teeth and she gasped. \u201cCarlotti\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you not say another man\u2019s name when I\u2019m having my way with you?\u201d he teased. His anger seemed to have vanished for the moment and she was glad. She didn\u2019t like being reminded about leaving him alone. She had regretted it the moment it was done.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still in a lot of trouble,\u201d she couldn\u2019t help reminding him, feeling like a nag but unable to help it.</p><p>\u201cCarlotti and his men will tear this warehouse apart looking for us. We have to be absolutely quiet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and find a way out of here without being seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis warehouse takes up the block,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cThey\u2019ll be searching for a while.\u201d</p><p>She assumed he was intimidated at the thought of leaving the temporary safety of the closet and took pity on him. He had been remarkably fearless when he posed as a pizza delivery man, but Jared was a regular guy and not used to the violence that was her day-to-day existence. And he did save her life.</p><p>Probably. The least she could do was humor him before pushing for them to leave.</p><p>\u201cRemember,\u201d he whispered, so quietly it was more breath than sound, \u201cno noise.\u201d Then he stood very close, so close he forced her knees apart. Not for the first time, she vowed to never again wear a skirt, but she\u2019d thought a skirt would fool Carlotti into seeing her as more helpless than she really was.</p><p>Jared\u2019s fingers were sliding up her inner thighs.</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to be utterly silent,\u201d he murmured in her ear, so quietly she had to concentrate carefully to catch what he was saying. And concentrating was difficult, given where his fingers were. \u201cIf you make a lot of noise, the bad guys will find us and what kind of a bodyguard would endanger the man she\u2019s supposed to protect?\u201d</p><p>Shocked beyond words, she realized the depth of the trap he had set for her. She couldn\u2019t protest much louder than a whisper\u2014which he could ignore\u2014and couldn\u2019t fight him off\u2014however carefully\u2014without bringing attention to their position. Anything much above a whisper could be heard and what if Carlotti\u2019s men were in this hallway right now? They most likely were not, but she dared not take the chance. As Jared said, what kind of a bodyguard would she be if she brought the bad guys down on them?</p><p>She was amazed at his ruthlessness, at how he was taking advantage of her protective nature to do as he liked, regardless of her feelings.</p><p>While this went through her mind, his hands were at her sweater, unbuttoning it and then spreading it apart. Annoyed and strangely excited and more annoyed at being excited, she tried to slap her knees together, but they merely thudded against his hips. She felt him ease her breasts from their bra cups, then felt his breath a moment before his mouth closed over one nipple. She swallowed her gasp as he sucked hard, drawing her nipple against the roof of his mouth and then tracing a circle around it with his tongue.</p><p>Abruptly her breasts felt warmer, heavier and she had the absurd thought that she was wearing too many clothes. And so was he.</p><p>He lavished attention on her breasts while she fought the urge to squirm against him. This was beyond madness. This was asking to get caught and killed. This was\u2014this was unprofessional! Her distracted mind seized on the perfect description for their situation, desperate to think about something besides his mouth and hands. If she couldn\u2019t talk him out of it\u2014couldn\u2019t talk at all!\u2014or fend him off with a few well-placed smacks, she certainly wasn\u2019t going to let him know how his touch affected her. He would get tired of the game soon and...</p><p>His thumbs were stroking her inner thighs, only centimeters away from the elastic of her panties. And his mouth was still on her breasts, kissing and licking and sucking. Now she did squirm, having no more control of the motion than she did her heartbeat. His touch was so feather-light it was almost like a dream. And with every stroke he got nearer her panties, the crotch of which had become embarrassingly damp.</p><p>When his thumbs slipped past the elastic and caressed her plump outer lips, her hands snapped into fists and she managed to restrain herself from seizing his hair and demanding he do something, right now! In seconds, she had gone from annoyance to pure sexual heat. Carlotti could have been standing at Jared\u2019s shoulder and she wouldn\u2019t have cared. She forgot about the foolishness of Jared\u2019s actions and turned her formidable concentration to keeping quiet.</p><p>Abruptly, shockingly, Jared spread her apart, a thumb on each fold and did nothing more down there, just held her apart while kissing her deeply, sucking her lower lip into his mouth. Her knees slapped into his hips again as she wriggled against him, trying to get closer, to touch more of him, but he stayed where he was, taking her frustrated whimpers into his mouth and nipping her gently as a warning to stay quiet.</p><p>He breathed a command into her ear and she complied at once, hooking her legs around his waist. He lifted her with one arm and with the other hand, stripped her panties past her hips, setting her down and pulling them off as she let go of his waist. He slowly inched her skirt past her thighs until it was bunched around her waist, then passed his hand down her lower stomach, pausing to caress the dark forest of hair above her aching center. Everything was aching; her breasts wanted his hands back, her nipples were so tight and hard it was almost painful and as for the sensations below her waist...she bit her lip, hard, so as not to shriek at him to take her now, yes, right now, stop torturing me and take me right now ! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She heard a muffled double thud and realized he had dropped to his knees. He spread her apart again and she felt his mouth at her center. Quick as thought, she jammed her palm into her mouth and muffled the wild groan she couldn\u2019t lock back. Then she hung onto the counter for dear life as his tongue slipped inside her, then retreated and swept across her clit, which had began to throb in delighted abandon.</p><p>She felt a finger push slowly, gently inside her as his mouth settled over her clit and he began to suck, occasionally flicking the trembling bud with his tongue as she swallowed a sob of purest frustration. She had assumed quickies were just that\u2014quick\u2014not drawn-out torture, not being touched with skill and love but unable to touch back, not being able to talk, to beg, to plead...she wanted to pull him inside her.</p><p>She wanted to jump off the counter and get down on her hands and knees, flip her skirt up over her back and beg him to take her from behind. She wanted to take him inside her mouth. She wanted to touch every inch of him, she wanted to own his body as he owned hers, she wanted...</p><p>His fingers were gone, his hands were on her thighs, spreading them as far apart as they would go. Now his tongue was inside her again, darting in controlled jabs. She cupped her own breasts, squeezed. Her head fell back against the wall and she stared blindly at the ceiling. She could feel his hands on her thighs, his tongue inside her, darting, flicking, probing...then he was kissing her clit and she was biting her lips bloody so as not to scream.</p><p>She could feel her orgasm like a flower felt the sun start to rise and welcomed it. But mere seconds from the point of no return, Jared abruptly pulled back, leaving her teetering and only years of hiding her feelings kept her from bursting into frustrated tears. He sat back on his heels and blew, just puffed soft breaths at her swollen, hot, tender flesh and when he seemed sure she wasn\u2019t going to spin away from him into release, he started all over again...his sweet, talented mouth busy between her thighs, bringing her to the edge and leaving her there too many times to count. She couldn\u2019t think of protesting, of fighting it, could only hang onto the counter with her eyes closed and her mouth open while he played her body like a virtuoso handled a violin...with skill, with love, with absolute control.</p><p>A thousand years later, he stood up and she heard the most welcome sound in the world...he was unbuckling his belt, pulling his zipper down and who would have thought the simple rasp of metal teeth would bring another surge of heat between her legs? Her eyes had adjusted as much as they would to the dark and he was nothing but a large shadow in front of her, now leaning forward and giving her his mouth. She sucked greedily at his lips, his tongue, tasting him, tasting herself. He broke the kiss and she heard how his breathing had roughened in the dark until he was nearly panting and wondered if his silence wasn\u2019t so much out of safety, but because he could no longer speak.</p><p>She felt the tip of him nudge between her swollen nether lips without entering and even though she didn\u2019t have nearly as much of him as she liked, she could still feel him throbbing furiously. She tried to scoot forward, to impale herself on him, but he instantly moved back. She got the message at once and quit trying, grinding her teeth because even now, even now he would not relinquish his dominance and ohhhh, when she was herself again she was going to make him pay for this.</p><p>He stroked his thick tip up and down her slick flesh, never quite dipping inside, soaking himself wet with her wetness. His other hand was squeezing her breast, hard, pulling at her swollen nipple, running the straining peak through his fingers. She gloried in his rough touch, it was exactly what she needed, craved, to offset the delirious madness he\u2019d brought to life within her. Then she felt him slip into her. She had time to think, oh thank Christ, I\u2019m going to come at last, before she realized he\u2019d only slid in an inch...and stopped.</p><p>Her legs started to come up around his waist, she was done with waiting, done with the endless torture, when his hands slapped against the insides of her knees and he held her legs apart. He began to rock, shallow strokes that only brought a fraction of his length within her and then out again and she sobbed, she couldn\u2019t hold it back but wept as quietly as she could and he sighed. She knew her control troubled him, knew he longed for her to let go with him...is that why he had done this? To make her lose herself?</p><p>Did he need proof that under her cool exterior she was a hot-blooded woman with very basic needs, needs he was so excellently equipped to meet?</p><p>In response to her sigh, her soft sobs, his strokes had lengthened, they were long and deep and he let go of her legs so she could cling to his waist. His hands slid beneath her buttocks and he pulled her tightly against him, so her exposed breasts were pressed against his sweat-damp shirt and he pumped, pumped, pumped, done with his teasing touch, now just taking her as she had longed to be taken, in long slick strokes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he managed softly, his voice so low and thick she could barely understand him, \u201cI\u2019m going to let you come now. And you want to, don\u2019t you, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer; she didn\u2019t have to. Everything clenched within her and suddenly her orgasm was bursting through her, so hard and fast she buried her face against his shoulder and bit back the shriek of relief and ecstasy. She could actually feel her uterus contracting, feel the throbbing as blood rushed to the very center of her. No sooner had her long-awaited orgasm ended than another began, swooping through her, she was on a roller coaster of pleasure, cresting one hill only to plunge down another and she could feel him trembling, heard his breathing stop for a moment and then he was pulsing within her, his grip on her like iron, his face buried in her hair.</p><p>A long moment passed while their breathing slowed, while they came back to the planet. She felt him kiss her ear and then whisper, \u201cNever, never, never leave me to wake up alone and afraid for you.\u201d And then, more softly still, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>She wept and tried to whisper the words he wanted to hear, words she never thought she would say\u2014or feel\u2014but he seemed to understand and shushed her and held her for a long time.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still mad at you,\u201d Jared whispered cheerfully, \u201cbut right now I\u2019m so relaxed, it\u2019s hard to care.\u201d</p><p>Kara snorted. She was fairly annoyed herself, but couldn\u2019t figure out if it was because her pride was wounded at how he so ruthlessly mastered her, or because he\u2019d cheated her out of killing Carlotti, or because he\u2019d come to the warehouse in the first place. But his seed was trickling between her thighs and, as he said, it was difficult to stay angry. What she wanted to do was check into a hotel and spend the rest of the day making love. Instead, she was tromping through a warehouse with her wiseass lover, keeping an ear cocked for pursuit and wondering what the hell to do now.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hear sounds of pursuit, which was comforting, but if she couldn\u2019t kill Carlotti, it was past time to be gone. If she were alone, she wouldn\u2019t worry a jot about silently slipping out of the warehouse unseen. But Jared was at her side and \u201cstealthy\u201d wasn\u2019t exactly the best word to describe him.</p><p>The \u2018clang\u2019 as he tripped over a pail brought this point home and she swallowed a sigh. Looking sheepish, Jared regained his balance and picked up the pail, apparently meaning to carry it with him.</p><p>\u201cWhen we get out of here,\u201d she said at last, \u201cyou should go to the D.A. Tell him everything you\u2019ve seen and ask for police protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew that,\u201d was the rude reply. \u201cIf I leave you alone for a minute, I\u2019ll never see you again. You weren\u2019t going to come back, were you? You were going to ice the bad guy and disappear on me.\u201d His voice was the muted thunder of anger. His eyes told a different story.</p> <p>\u201cJared...Jared, I\u2019ll only get you killed.\u201d She swallowed the lump in her throat. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear that.</p><p>Anything but that.\u201d</p><p>His gaze still reproached her. \u201cOh. Okay. But you putting yourself in danger on my behalf, I can choke that down, no problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhhhh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhhh yourself,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>She held up a hand to forestall further arguing and poked her head around the corner. She never peeked. Slow movement gave the bad guys something to train their gun sights on. A quick glance, flash and gone. \u201cHallway\u2019s clear, let\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hand closed around her bicep, circling it easily and he pulled her back. She was surprised again at the strength in that hand, then reminded herself that Jared Dean was many things, but he wasn\u2019t a wimp.</p><p>\u201cListen up, blondie,\u201d he said, not unkindly. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. I mean right this second and in general. I know you don\u2019t believe me and that\u2019s okay...for now. I don\u2019t expect you to take me on faith.</p><p>I know I have to prove myself. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d she said with deliberate cruelty, because they didn\u2019t and because she wanted him out of that warehouse and safe and didn\u2019t want to hear him explain why it was all right not to trust him. Because if he kept up this\u2014this nobility stuff, she\u2019d probably have to break down in tears and beg his forgiveness and never, never, never leave his side. And of course that\u2014all of that\u2014was impossible.</p><p>\u201cMake time, dammit. I know where you came from. Well, where I come from, it\u2019s the worst kind of cowardice to leave a woman\u2014particularly a woman you love\u2014in order to save yourself. It\u2019s not gonna happen. I\u2019m never going to the D.A., I\u2019m never going to stay out of the way when you kick ass on the bad guys and I\u2019m not hiding in the goddamned bedroom while you kill the guy who wants to kill me. Get.</p><p>Used. To. It.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him thoughtfully. He wasn\u2019t angry...well, he was a little, but that wasn\u2019t hot rage talking for him. He really was a chauvinist and she should have been annoyed at his ludicrous attempt to repress her, but the reality was, she thought it was kind of nice. If incredibly misguided.</p><p>Jared, she knew, never said anything he didn\u2019t mean. He was stuck to her like a lamprey, whether she liked it or not. And frankly, the only reason she didn\u2019t like it was because of the danger it represented to him. So the question was... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know that look,\u201d he said warningly, \u201cand you can just forget it.\u201d</p><p>...should she knock him out and more or less drag him to the police station? It might be the only way to protect him from his chivalrous instincts.</p><p>He was backing up. \u201cTouch me and I\u2019ll scream.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed. \u201cNever mind.\u201d Once he woke up, he would never remain in police protection. The big idiot would probably take to the streets, looking for her. He\u2019d never find her unless she wanted to be found, but he\u2019d get himself mugged and knifed and any other manner of assault on his person while he blundered about, looking for her...</p><p>Kara, checking the next hallway, suddenly realized what she had been thinking. Not that Jared would leave me , she thought with dawning excitement, but that he would look for me! Is that a true perception of his character\u2014of his love? Or am I still foggy from lust? It\u2019s entirely possible, the man is ridiculously good in bed...</p><p>Further pondering was interrupted by the click-click of high heels on tile. Behind her, Jared halted obediently, hefting the pail in readiness. She shook her head at him. She knew that walk. And it answered the question...</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>...what had happened to Krystal during the fight?</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you guys doing here?\u201d Krystal, who had rounded the corner, was now staring at the two of them. Her face was bloodless, scared and she had obviously been crying, but Kara couldn\u2019t summon any pity for the woman.</p><p>\u201cRunning from your boyfriend,\u201d Kara said sweetly. Jared glanced at her and raised an eyebrow at the tone he had never heard from her before. \u201cI guess things didn\u2019t work out exactly as you planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014I\u2014he made me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he make you wear those tacky shoes, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCat fight!\u201d Jared said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cI wondered what happened to you,\u201d Kara continued. \u201cYou ran, didn\u2019t you? Ran as soon as it looked like things weren\u2019t going Carlotti\u2019s way. Not only did you align yourself with unregenerate scum, you can\u2019t even be loyal. Now...what? You\u2019re lost? Trying to find him? Or us?\u201d</p> <p>Krystal grinned suddenly, looking not unlike a Great White shark. Crocodile tears shone like cubic zirconium on her cheeks while she inflated her lungs for a yell that would, no doubt, bring the bad guys crashing down on them.</p><p>Jared moved before Kara could; he grabbed her around the shoulders with one hand and clapped the other over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Kara warned, before...</p><p>\u201cOuch, dammit! God, she\u2019s got a bite like a hyena. Now what?\u201d he complained, just before his breath whooshed out as Krystal simultaneously buried an elbow in his stomach and brought her spike heel down on his instep.</p><p>\u201cWell, hit her back,\u201d Kara said impatiently, checking the hall to make sure their scuffling hadn\u2019t been overheard. She was annoyed at Jared\u2019s interference; this was taking too long and making too much noise. \u201cShut her up somehow. We can\u2019t drag her with us and we can\u2019t leave her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, can\u2019t? You\u2019re a doctor, you probably know all sorts of dirty tricks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Jared trailed off as he tried to hold the wildly flailing Krystal, whose wrathful mumblings through his palm were getting louder, like the hum of hornets in a disturbed nest. \u201cBut she\u2019s a girl!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Kara said, honestly irritated, but she had to fight a smile. He really was adorable.</p><p>And Krystal, she was sure, was never a girl. The woman had been born a wolverine. \u201cThen let her go.\u201d</p><p>Jared dodged a wildly flailing elbow and tightened his grip enough to make Krystal gasp. \u201cAh...sorry.</p><p>Okay, ma\u2019am, I\u2019m going to let you go, but you have to promise to be quiet. Do you promise?\u201d</p><p>Krystal quit struggling and nodded, her eyes slits of rage; Jared let go of her. Krystal\u2019s hand shot toward her purse, but before she could finish working the clasp, Kara pivoted on her right leg, swung around and clipped Krystal on the chin with her left foot. Hard.</p><p>Krystal dropped like a bag of dirt. Her purse hit the floor, the clasp popped open and a butterfly knife slid out, all steel and lethal edges.</p><p>Jared looked at the unconscious woman, then at the knife, then at Kara. He shrugged and she could swear he was seemed embarrassed. \u201cSorry. I just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. \u2018But...but...she\u2019s a girl!\u2019\u201d Kara shook her head and tried not to laugh. \u201cLeave her here. She can\u2019t screw us over if she\u2019s down for the count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at this,\u201d he complained, holding out his hand. Krystal had broken the skin with her bite. \u201cIt\u2019ll have to be disinfected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you might consider a rabies booster. Hell, you might want to just cut the whole thing off, play it safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHar, har,\u201d he said sourly. \u201cYou realize, when we\u2019re married, I\u2019m not going to be too cool on continuing your idea of a social life.\u201d</p><p>She said nothing. Married? Impossible.</p><p>\u201cNiiiiiice spin kick, by the way,\u201d he continued, unaware\u2014or pretending to be\u2014of her sudden discomfort. \u201cIt happened so fast, I didn\u2019t even see it coming until it was done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. That\u2019s the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to have a man around,\u201d he sighed and slung an arm across her shoulders. They continued down the hall.</p><p>They surprised two more of Carlotti\u2019s goons on the way out. When Kara heard their footsteps around the corner, she was overjoyed. One way or another, she knew, this would soon be over.</p><p>The fight\u2014well, Kara\u2019s part of the fight\u2014was finished almost before it had a chance to get started. Even though the men were looking for them, they still seemed surprised to actually find Kara and Jared and she was on them before they\u2019d had a chance to so much as twitch their gun hands. She grabbed the one nearest her, wondering</p><p>CLANG!</p><p>what the hell that noise was, but too focused</p><p>CLANG!</p><p>on the task at hand to give it her full attention. She wrenched the man\u2019s gun away so hard she heard his wrist snap,</p><p>CLANG!</p><p>then buried her foot in his balls and, when he bent forward in agony, brought her knee up into his nose, breaking it and putting him out.</p><p>CLANG!</p><p>She popped the clip and ejected the shell out of the chamber, then slipped the rounds out and tossed the now-empty clip over her shoulder. She turned and what she saw so astounded her, she could only stare, the gun falling from her nerveless fingers.</p><p>Jared, her gentle healer lover, was attacking the other goon with grim ferocity. With the pail. The man had both arms up to protect his face; his gun had fallen to the floor. Unfortunately, this wasn\u2019t the movies and it was taking several blows to knock the man out and the poor guy kept yelping and trying to fend off Jared.</p><p>She was about to lend an apparently much-needed hand when Jared stepped forward and swung the pail in a powerful uppercut that caught the man on the chin and threw him back against the wall. He bounced off and hit the floor, flopping over like a fish and then not moving.</p><p>Jared dropped the pail,</p><p>CLANG!</p><p>and rushed to the man who had been sent to kill him. His skilled fingers found a pulse, then checked the man\u2019s pupils and felt the back of his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think I fractured anything,\u201d he said, unable to keep the relief out of his voice. \u201cBut he\u2019ll have one hell of a headache when he wakes up.\u201d Then, as if fearing he sounded too much like a citizen, he added coolly, \u201cTeach these guys to mess with us. Where\u2019s the other one? You want me to take care of him, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jared,\u201d Kara said gravely. \u201cI managed on my own. Nice work.\u201d</p><p>She should have...but couldn\u2019t. Absolutely did not have the heart to tell him that he\u2019d just bashed an undercover cop into sludgy semi-consciousness.</p><p>As a child, Kara hadn\u2019t just studied the bad guys to survive. Her other opponents\u2014less deadly, but better organized\u2014were the police and Kara had learned to spot a rookie before he or she spotted her.</p><p>There were so many giveaways, Kara wondered why the cops themselves didn\u2019t catch on.</p><p>The haircut, for one\u2014trimmed exactly three-quarters of an inch around the collar and perfectly straight.</p><p>Even when they suffered their hair to grow long and forewent bathing in order to look like street people, cops had trouble pulling it off. How many street people had perfect teeth? How many of the female homeless had waxed legs and shaved armpits?</p><p>Their nice, even, 36-inch police academy strides were another tip-off. She\u2019d heard the man coming down the hall and had known at once that Carlotti\u2019s gang had been infiltrated. And had rejoiced.</p><p>That was before Jared had assaulted the man, of course. Now he wasn\u2019t just Carlotti\u2019s intended victim...he was accomplice to the Avenging Angel and had just committed assault and battery against an undercover cop.</p><p>Kara realized it was time for a new plan. There was only one problem. Jared was absolutely going to hate it.</p><p>The real irony, she thought, still listening for the sounds of approach, is that I\u2019m going to be busted for assaulting a police officer, when I never touched one in my life .</p><p>She almost laughed.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>Suddenly, weirdly, Kara was in no great rush to leave the warehouse. Jared couldn\u2019t figure it out. He was pretty sure she wouldn\u2019t mind if he checked the guy she\u2019d taken down\u2014not that he gave a good damn if she did object\u2014and aside from a broken nose, the guy would be okay. But she wasn\u2019t moving with the same silent urgency she had been before. She was almost...strolling. It was like they were an ordinary couple, exploring an abandoned warehouse for fun. Since there was no longer an apparent rush, he was half-tempted to ask her if she\u2019d duck into an empty room for another quickie.</p><p>Oh boy. He tried to wrench his mind away from the mental image, but in an instant he was back in the closet, feeling her squirm beneath his hands, listening to her soft whimpers as she strained against him, reached for him, held him to her with all her strength. It had been astonishing, outstanding, hideously dangerous, incredibly dumb in retrospect...and worth every sweaty second. He\u2019d brave the danger of discovery another hundred times, if only to feel Kara come alive beneath his hands. Her control was a constant irritant and, worse, made him feel like an utter shit, like she didn\u2019t trust him enough to be honest about her feelings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He reminded himself that teaching Kara to trust would take more than a week and a week was about as long as they\u2019d known each other. So reign it in, big boy , he growled at himself, it\u2019s going to take time to get past twenty years of negative reinforcement. Jeez! That\u2019s some ego you\u2019ve got on you, pal.</p><p>He realized suddenly that they hadn\u2019t used protection either time. Both times had definitely been in the heat of the moment, but that was no excuse for his carelessness. He knew he was disease-free...oh, hell, of course Kara was, too. She was scrupulously careful about everything she ever did; she definitely wasn\u2019t going to get caught\u2014literally\u2014with her pants down.</p><p>That left a possible pregnancy as their only concern. And God help him, he fervently hoped she was pregnant. He wanted lots of children with Kara. He wanted a built-in entrance to her life, forever. If she wouldn\u2019t marry him\u2014and she would, eventually, dammit\u2014being the mother of his child was a good start toward lifelong intimacy.</p> <p>He noticed Kara was looking at him curiously and, he noticed, didn\u2019t even glance around the corner before taking them down the hallway. \u201cWhat are you thinking about? You\u2019re uncharacteristically silent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping I\u2019d gotten you pregnant.\u201d</p><p>She blushed and he almost laughed. She had the oddest\u2014and most refreshing\u2014reactions sometimes. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m not\u2014I never\u2014I mean, I haven\u2019t had sex in years, so I don\u2019t use anything long-term, like the Pill. But it\u2019s not the right time of the month for me.\u201d A short pause, then she blurted, \u201cWhy do you want me to be pregnant?\u201d</p><p>He reached out and took her hand. \u201cI think about the kids we\u2019ll have all the time,\u201d he said simply. \u201cAnd if you had my baby, that would keep you in my life forever.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were huge. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you be afraid of\u2014of how I\u2019d raise him? Or her?\u201d</p> <p>He almost laughed, but saw her expression\u2014she was deadly serious\u2014and choked it back. \u201cUh, yeah, let\u2019s think about the despicable habits you could pass on: honor, integrity, self-defense, championing the weak...yeah, poor little tyke would be a real scumbag with those handicaps.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything, just kept staring at him. Finally she muttered, \u201cYou\u2019re too good to be true. This has to end before I realize it.\u201d Before he could reply\u2014and what a reply it would have been\u2014she added,</p><p>\u201cIn case you were wondering, I\u2019m not\u2014I mean, I don\u2019t have any\u2014I\u2019m all\u2014uh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisease free? Me, too,\u201d he said cheerfully. Then, hopefully, \u201cAre you absolutely positive you can\u2019t be pregnant right now?\u201d She rolled her eyes at him and he sighed. \u201cThen I guess I\u2019d better pick up some condoms on the way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhat, won\u2019t be necessary?\u201d He tightened his grip on her hand. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you run away from me again and that\u2019s final. I\u2019m in your life, blondie and that\u2019s it. If we were in high school I\u2019d give you my class ring. Hell, if you\u2019d let me, I\u2019d pick up an engagement ring on the way home. Or you could break in and steal one...\u201d</p> <p>Then he heard the sirens. And saw Kara wasn\u2019t surprised, was actually leading them back to the main area of the warehouse.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer any of his questions, just determinedly tugged him along behind her as she unerringly found her way back to the room where they\u2019d nearly been killed. It would have taken Jared about a week to find that room again, but Kara had them there in five minutes.</p><p>And he absolutely could not figure out how she knew the cops were on the way. It explained her sudden relaxation, how she shifted from urgently wanting to leave to urgently wanting to hang around. But it didn\u2019t explain why she was bringing them entirely too close to the cops.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to make sure they arrest Carlotti?\u201d he whispered, then realized he could have spoken in a normal tone of voice, because she threw open the door and marched right up to the knot of cops clustered around the handcuffed bad guys. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening, officers,\u201d she said politely. \u201cMr. Carlotti has put a contract on Dr. Dean\u2019s life...this is Dr. Dean,\u201d she added, prying Jared\u2019s fingers away from her hand one by one. \u201cI myself can testify to several attempted assault and attempted murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing ?\u201d Jared practically shrieked.</p><p>\u201cOh-ho,\u201d one of the cops said, grinning at Kara.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at, flatfoot?\u201d Jared growled.</p> <p>\u201cAlso,\u201d Kara continued loudly, \u201cI need to be charged with assaulting a police officer. Your undercover cop is up on the third floor outside the accounting offices. He\u2019s mildly concussed. You\u2019ll know him because there\u2019s a pail right next to him,\u201d she added helpfully.</p><p>\u201cUndercover...\u201d Jared trailed off in horror. The bad guy he\u2019d bashed was a cop ? Kara had known?</p><p>And was going to take the heat for it? \u201cBut I was the one who-oooof!\u201d He hadn\u2019t been fast enough to avoid her elbow to his solar plexus, which effectively robbed him off enough air to speak for the better part of a minute. He bent forward, gasping.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough of that,\u201d another cop said sternly. Kara obediently stepped away from Jared, her hands in the air. \u201cYou\u2019re saying you have knowledge of a contracted murder? And felonies? And you admit to assaulting\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, can we get going, please?\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cDr. Dean\u2019s not going to be out of breath much longer. Oh! I almost forgot. My given name is Kara Jayne Jones, aka Robbing Hood, aka the Avenging Angel. Just the other night, I hacked into the Freibur Mansion. I can tell you exactly how I did it. Maybe,\u201d she continued politely as another police officer deftly cuffed her hands behind her back, \u201cyou want to give the D.A. a call when we get to the station house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll straighten all that out later, ma\u2019am. I\u2019m going to read you your rights now, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not necessary. I have the right to remain silent,\u201d she recited obediently, \u201cand if I give up that right, anything I say may be used against me in a court of law. Which is unlikely to ever happen, because the D.A. is so overworked, he\u2019ll go for a plea bargain. Also, I have the right to an attorney. If I don\u2019t have the funds for one\u2014and I don\u2019t, by the way, I give most of my money to charities\u2014the court will appoint one for me. He or she will also be woefully overworked and will push for a plea. Which suits me fine. It\u2019s really for the best, Jared, stop looking at me like that,\u201d she added sharply. \u201cI\u2019ve been selfish to avoid testifying, just because I didn\u2019t want to go to jail. You\u2019re right, I am a coward. But if I quit trying to hide my past, I can keep you safe, put Carlotti away forever and stop running.\u201d She shrugged and smiled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer, really.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a breath and straightened painfully. His lower abdomen was throbbing dully. What had she poked him with, a stick of dynamite? \u201c...can\u2019t...\u201d he wheezed. \u201cCan\u2019t let you...do this...for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe reasonable,\u201d she advised as a cop, who\u2019d been listening intently while trying not to show it, started to lead her away. \u201cWhat\u2019s a little jail time\u2014okay, a lot of jail time\u2014if it means you\u2019re safe?\u201d she continued over one shoulder. \u201cI can do time standing on my head, Jared. It\u2019s a lot easier than being out in the real world. Think about it. My rent will never go up!\u201d She shouted that last as the door slammed and he could hear her laughing\u2014laughing!\u2014as she was led to a police car.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he screamed, lunging after her, only to be caught by the shoulder and hauled back. He turned furiously and threw a punch before he could stop himself. The police officer jerked his head to the side; Jared\u2019s fist whistled harmlessly past the cop\u2019s ear. The other one pulled a nightstick and smacked Jared in the shoulder with it. Not hard enough to hurt, but hard enough to get his attention.</p><p>\u201cBad idea, my friend,\u201d the cop advised softly. \u201cYou don\u2019t strike us as the average street punk, but even uptown guys know better than to try to clock a cop.\u201d</p><p>Not this uptown guy, Jared thought furiously, I\u2019ve already bashed one cop around tonight, boys, don\u2019t push your luck. Then he shouted, \u201cBut it\u2019s me! It\u2019s my fault! I\u2019m the one who\u2014\u201d He struggled to go after Kara again, but both cops locked their arms around him and held him back, with some difficulty.</p><p>\u201cWe gotta take your statement anyway, sir,\u201d the other one said. \u201cYou can come down and straighten everything out.\u201d His voice was brisk and oddly soothing, a voice trained to calm individuals and control crowds. \u201cAnd you want to do that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let them keep her, put her in a cage...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we better get going, huh? Now, we can arrest you for assault and haul you in that way, or you gonna be a good boy and follow us in your car...you do have a car here, right? Okay. What\u2019s it going to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrouble,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s going to be.\u201d He shrugged free of their restraining arms and started for the door. \u201cI\u2019ll see you boys there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will, of course, obey all city traffic ordinances on the way,\u201d the cop said and his partner laughed.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even wave goodbye, he thought darkly, pulling into the police station parking lot, thanks to the goddamned handcuffs.</p><p>For that matter, he hadn\u2019t even known her last name until she\u2019d announced it to the cops. Announced it!</p><p>God!</p><p>She must have been planning this all along, he thought, stomping up the steps. She knew, somehow, that one of the bad guys was a cop. Let him bash the guy around. Planned to take the heat for it, turn herself in, testify against Carlotti. And his contribution to this plan was to blithely announce he needed to buy condoms. He almost groaned thinking about it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A police dog, a husky German Shepherd, snarled at him on his way to the desk. Jared snarled back and the dog blinked, surprised. A busy night at the one-ten precinct, Dr. Jared Dean found himself marching past various drug dealers, pimps, prostitutes and burglars, all protesting to different police officers, in various tones of voice, that they had been framed.</p><p>He stopped before the desk sergeant; miraculously, there was no line. \u201cIt was all me!\u201d he proclaimed loudly to the room. \u201cI\u2019m the guy who hit the cop with the pail. I request\u2014no, I demand that you arrest me in Kara\u2019s place. And let me post bail for her! Right now!\u201d</p><p>The desk sergeant, an attractive blonde with eyes almost as pretty as Kara\u2019s, eyed him with no change of expression, then said, \u201cFine, thanks. And you?\u201d</p> <p>Jared held out his hands, wrists together. \u201cArrest me! Book me, Danno! I am guilty, I am scum, I am\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilty scum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut first, how much to bail Kara Jayne Jones out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a seat, I\u2019ll look into this for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you have to arrest me, throw the book at me, handcuff me, lock me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, yes, plenty of time for that. Have. A. Seat.\u201d</p><p>Cowed\u2014not so much by the woman\u2019s tone of voice as her completely unruffled manner\u2014Jared did. He passed the time by spot-diagnosing the many people in the room, as well as fantasizing about all the things he would say to Kara once he had his hands on her. Thirty-five minutes had passed when the desk sergeant crooked a finger at him. Jared was in front of her in three bounds.</p><p>\u201cFirst, no charges have been filed against Ms. Jones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jared could feel his mouth pop open. \u201cBut that\u2019s imposs\u2014I mean, great! So when are they taking me away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t. Yet.\u201d The sergeant\u2014Ristau, the nametag read\u2014gave him a level look and continued.</p><p>\u201cAnd a good thing for you, because you can\u2019t be arrested yourself and post bail for somebody. Officer Carl isn\u2019t pressing charges because he really can\u2019t. He didn\u2019t identify himself to you and your girlfriend as a police officer, you apparently honestly believed he was a danger to you, you were obviously not with Carlotti and the officer in question doesn\u2019t even have a concussion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I hit him so many times...\u201d Jared heard himself and shut up.</p><p>Sergeant Ristau looked smug. \u201cWell, you must be a real lightweight, pal, because they aren\u2019t even keeping him overnight for observation. Says he doesn\u2019t even have a headache.\u201d</p><p>In a flash, Jared saw it\u2014it would be much more an embarrassment to the police officer if they did file charges, than if not. How to explain how a mild-mannered (usually) physician got the better of a trained officer of the law? Better to ignore it and hope the situation went away.</p><p>\u201cSo, your ladyfriend is free to go...for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jared was dazzled. He had no idea the police were so pleasant and flexible. None of the officers he\u2019d run into tonight had even raised their voices, much less tried to slap him around or took off their pants to show off their butts. It wasn\u2019t much like NYPD Blue.</p><p>Ristau lowered her voice. \u201cSome of the detectives know her\u2014know about her, anyway. And we all heard about the Freibur mansion and how that went down. That bust is going to result in a lot of gold shields. Your friend\u2019s a popular girl around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my fianc\u00e9e,\u201d he bragged, slinging an elbow against her desk and casually leaning closer. His relief was so great, he felt like swooning. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice. Anyway, you and Ms. Jones can go, but she\u2019s got a meeting at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow with the District Attorney. She gave her \u2018word of honor\u2019 that she\u2019d show and I guess the detectives believe her, because she\u2019s free to go. They\u2019re gonna finish processing her and you can pick her up. If she doesn\u2019t show,\u201d Ristau added, gently shoving Jared\u2019s elbow off her desk, \u201ca warrant will be issued for her arrest.\u201d</p> <p>Another warrant, you mean, he thought, but didn\u2019t say aloud. He had trouble believe this was happening\u2014no assault charges and even though the cops knew who she was, they were letting her go?</p><p>He had no idea the real world worked this way. Law enforcement was much more pleasant than medicine.</p><p>He thanked Sergeant Ristau, then found his way to Holding to wait while they let Kara go. He was allowed to go where the cells were and wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. Scenes from \u201cChained Heat\u201d and other women-in-cages movies flashed through his mind, beautiful women dominated by handsome guards, lush female prisoners turning to each other for sensual comfort...he shook his head. The movies couldn\u2019t be completely true.</p><p>They weren\u2019t. Instead, he saw no more than a half dozen women in the cell with Kara. She was showing a prostitute how to radically extend her pimp\u2019s index finger the next time he laid a hand on her. \u201cBend it waaaaaaay back,\u201d she was saying, gently demonstrating, \u201cand whenever he moves, or even says something you don\u2019t like, bend it back a little further. You can actually walk him where you need him to go. But it\u2019ll probably only work once...he\u2019ll never let you near his fingers after that.\u201d</p><p>Three other women were poring over last month\u2019s issue of Glamour\u2019s Do\u2019s and Don\u2019s and another one sat by herself in a corner and gazed at Kara with what could only be described as heroine-worship. The last woman was sleeping peacefully on the top bunk. Except for the bars, it looked more like a teacher\u2019s lounge than a hotbed of hardened female criminals.</p><p>Kara heard his footsteps and looked up. Her eyes widened in surprise, which annoyed him. \u201cWhat did you think?\u201d he snapped by way of greeting. \u201cI was going to let you sit in jail all night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you yelling at me for?\u201d she protested, rising and coming to stand before him as close as the bars would allow. \u201cAnd what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cracking you out of this pokey.\u201d He glared at the janitor, who was quietly sweeping the floor near the door. \u201cAnd God...help... anyone...who gets in my way.\u201d</p><p>Kara rolled her eyes; the janitor didn\u2019t trouble herself to look up.</p><p>The tremendous stress of the past few hours caught up with him. \u201cYou\u2019re in a lot of trouble, Kara Jayne Jones!\u201d he roared in a tone that brought two of Kara\u2019s cellmates to their feet. \u201cTurning yourself in, trying to take the heat, having to see the D.A. tomorrow...you just wait until I get you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like my father,\u201d she said, exasperated, but she was doing, he saw with surprise, an awful lot of smiling. Shit, was she really that surprised and pleased he\u2019d come? What did she think, he\u2019d have gone gaily back home to eat leftovers and watch PayPerView while she rotted in prison? Well, rotted in Holding? \u201cSomebody\u2019s father, I mean,\u201d she added, \u201cI don\u2019t remember what mine sounded like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKara! Will you focus, for Christ\u2019s sake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer man\u2019s comin\u2019 down hard,\u201d one of the jailed women said to another, not bothering to lower her voice.</p><p>He ignored the peanut gallery comment and stuck his finger through the bars, shaking it just under Kara\u2019s nose. \u201cWe are getting out of here and going home and\u2014and then you\u2019re in big trouble, a lot of trouble and you just wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t keep my finger in her face, I was you,\u201d another woman advised. She mimed cracking the index finger backward.</p><p>\u201cJared, you\u2019re hysterical. Calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not!\u201d he practically shrieked. Then decided she was right and forced several calming breaths. He didn\u2019t say another word to her until they were in his car, on the way back to his place, half an hour later.</p><p>\u201cWell!\u201d Kara said brightly. She was, he noticed, more relaxed and cheerful than he had ever seen her.</p><p>She was staring a lengthy prison term in the face and didn\u2019t seem too worried. It was beyond weird.</p><p>Actually, it was kind of irritating. Didn\u2019t she care that she was leaving him? For about thirty years? \u201cIt certainly is a relief to be done with hiding. I\u2019m almost looking forward to meeting the D.A. He\u2019s been this big boogeyman in my mind so long...yeek!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d said \u2018yeek!\u2019 because he had abruptly pulled over and slammed on the brakes, bringing them to a smoking, sliding stop.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared. I\u2019ll meet with the D.A. tomorrow, who\u2019s going to insist I be held over for the grand jury. And I\u2019ll pull some serious jail time for all the hacks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he said patiently, as if she knew none of this, \u201cyou stole from the corrupt, the baby-rapers and murderers and drug dealers. And gave the money to the people they victimized.</p><p>She smiled sadly. \u201cYou\u2019re so adorable, you know that? I\u2019m telling you it doesn\u2019t matter. Rules are rules.</p><p>I\u2019m going down, Jared. For a long, long time. And you\u2019re letting me go\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fuck I am.\u201d He could hardly recognize his own voice. That low, dangerous tone wasn\u2019t at all like him. That wasn\u2019t Dr. Dean\u2019s bantering tone. That was the voice of a desperate man driven to great lengths to protect the woman he loved.</p><p>She ignored him. \u201c\u2014because I won\u2019t have you waste your life waiting for Visiting Day. You\u2019ll be old, Jared. Old before your time, old when I get out. I\u2019ll be old, too. It won\u2019t be allowed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that. Kara. You have to run. I\u2019ll drive you to the train station or the bus station or the airport or to Chicago where you can disappear or...whatever. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014can have every penny in my account for tickets. You don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014deserve jail, not like Carlotti does. All you did was try to stay alive and dammit, you\u2019re not going to jail and that\u2019s final!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut I am. And that\u2019s final. Jared. My darling, my only\u2014\u201d Her voice caught, then firmed, then went rock-steady. \u201cI\u2019m done with running. It\u2019s like banging your head against the wall...it feels so good when you stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll do something\u2014something really terrible to you if you don\u2019t come with me to the airport, right now.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and dared to smile. \u201cNo,\u201d she said softly, sweetly. \u201cYou won\u2019t. You love me. You\u2019d never hurt me. Don\u2019t you see? That\u2019s why this is so hard. You\u2019re making it hard. Poor Jared. I warned you. Never say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d</p> <p>He was silent. She was right. She had tried. She had fought him, their mutual attraction, tried hard to keep it purely business. She had known from the beginning that he meant despair and heartbreak to her and she to him. She had tried to tell him; he\u2019d been too infatuated to listen.</p><p>He put the car in gear and pulled back out into traffic.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>\u201cI know that look,\u201d she teased. They had entered his apartment, hung up their coats and Jared had silently fixed Kara a light supper. They were doing dishes now, shoulder to shoulder at the sink. It had been, to put it mildly, a long day.</p><p>Jared found it mildly unbelievable that they were doing something so undramatic and domestic like the dishes. But he had to do something with his hands. He was too emotionally exhausted to think about anything else at this point. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about bashing me with a pail,\u201d Kara continued, \u201cand hiding me somewhere so I miss my appointment tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>He coughed and hoped like hell he wasn\u2019t blushing. That had been exactly what he was thinking.</p><p>Trouble was, he\u2019d need something along the lines of an Army tank to stop Kara...he supposed he could inject her with a sedative from his bag while she slept, but the chances of doing that and a) not getting his arm broken and b) maintaining his self-respect, were slim.</p><p>\u201cYou could never pull it off,\u201d she said kindly, as if reading his mind. Sad, really, that she seemed to know him as well as he felt he knew her. Knowledge that should have thrilled them had come too late. \u201cYou\u2019d never do it. You\u2019re too nice.\u201d</p><p>He grunted.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to spend our last night together sulking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he growled. Then groaned and shut the water off. \u201cScrew the dishes. Screw all of this. I can\u2019t believe you won\u2019t let me talk you out of going tomorrow. You spend twenty years on the run from authority and pick tonight\u2014 tonight\u2014to do the right thing? Cripes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth the cost,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cNot to me.\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence while she finished drying the last glass, then she laid the towel on the counter, turned him toward her and rested her head against his chest. He stood stiffly, not returning her embrace.</p><p>\u201cI love you for saying that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about all of this. I should never have gotten you involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have missed it for anything. Wouldn\u2019t have missed knowing you for anything.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and stepped away from him. \u201cGod, don\u2019t talk like that! You\u2019re acting like I\u2019m in my grave.</p><p>I\u2019m just going to prison for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA long while.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d He threw up his hands, turned his back on her. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>Her hand came to rest on his shoulder and she said softly, more breath than sound, \u201cWe make the most of tonight.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard. \u201cOh, Kara.\u201d He turned and pulled her against him, found her mouth, lost himself in her kiss. His lips parted hers, her small tongue curled up to meet his. His body was responding with enthusiasm, but his mind held back. Lovemaking tonight would be agonizing, all the more potent and heartbreaking because it would be their last evening together. He wasn\u2019t sure he could do that. Put his heart on a sacrificial alter like that.</p><p>Her thoughts seemed to run in the same direction, because she pulled back and looked at him, her eyes mesmerizing pools of deep blue. Her lips were rosy and swollen from his kiss. \u201cCoward,\u201d she whispered and he shuddered and tightened his grip on her.</p><p>He swallowed the lump in this throat and abruptly scooped her up. \u201cSaw this in a movie once,\u201d he said hoarsely, trying to banter with a voice that wanted to crack. \u201cAlways wanted to try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it An Officer and a Gentleman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPorky\u2019s IV, actually.\u201d</p><p>She snorted, then giggled, then laughed outright, which got him started and by the time they reached his bed, he was staggering and roaring, trying not to drop her and the tears that rolled down his cheeks were surely from laughter.</p><p>He dropped her on the bed and she sat up, reached around and started tugging at the clip that held her hair up. He stopped her, said, \u201cLet me,\u201d and gently freed the large barrette from her hair. The lush blonde waves tumbled past her shoulders, almost to her waist. He held the length in his hands, gently combing his fingers through the strands, then brought her hair forward. He slowly pushed her back until she was lying flat on the bed and rubbed her hair, like a coarse silk blanket, over her breasts until her nipples were poking stiffly through the strands.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s...\u201d She gulped and tried again. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever done that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s ever loved you like I do before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he teased, tickling the underside of her breasts with some of her hair. \u201cNo protestations that I don\u2019t really love you? That I couldn\u2019t possibly love you once I found out who you are and what you\u2019ve done and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She moved like lightning. He felt his wrists seized and he was jerked forward until he sprawled on top of her. \u201cYou really have to shut up now,\u201d she mock-growled and bit his earlobe.</p><p>\u201cUnhand me, you cad!\u201d he shrilled, then kissed her deeply.</p><p>Jokes were forgotten as their hands rekindled the desire that was always just below the surface. In a few moments they were both nude, their bodies pressed tightly together.</p><p>He pressed wet, hot kisses along the slope of her neck, loving the way his touch made her shiver.</p><p>\u201cKara,\u201d he breathed, \u201cI\u2019m going to kiss every inch of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe first,\u201d she whispered back and wriggled free of him, then started planting delicate butterfly kisses along his collarbone.</p><p>It took forever; it was over in an instant. She didn\u2019t just kiss, she licked and nibbled and sucked, her lips caressing every inch of his skin. When he felt her fingers close around him, felt her draw his hot, throbbing length into her mouth, he was certain he was mere moments away from a heart attack. Let\u2019s see, he thought disjointedly, marveling at how hot her mouth was, how wet, how...I\u2019ll show up in the E.R. and they\u2019ll get some leads on me, then they\u2019ll get the defib paddles and shock me and when that doesn\u2019t work they\u2019ll crank the volts and shock me</p><p>shock me</p><p>until</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d Kara said huskily and kissed the tip of him with no small amount of satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he said shakily, throwing his arm across his eyes. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten off that quickly since\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to say, since I was a kid,\u201d he said frostily, but couldn\u2019t help smiling at her as she came up and cuddled against him. He kissed her, tasted himself on his mouth and at once felt an interested stirring between his legs. \u201cMy turn.\u201d</p><p>He rolled her on her back, cupped her breasts and licked her cleavage, then drew a stiff nipple into his mouth. He could have spent an hour on her breasts alone; their creamy perfection, each topped by a rosy, sweet nipple, seemed to demand his touch. In truth, he ached to touch them, touch her, show her with his body how deeply he cared for her, loved her.</p><p>She was sighing in his arms, her fingers were in his hair, she was murmuring nonsense words to him and when he remembered this was their last night together, that this time tomorrow she would be sleeping in a windowless cage, he\u2014</p><p>He shoved the thought away. \u201cTurn over,\u201d he said and when he\u2019d eased her to her hands and knees, started kissing her spine. He trailed kisses all the way down her back, nibbled on a pert, firm buttock, then stretched out on the bed behind her, grasped her thighs and kissed the entrance to her sex. She moaned and arched and then he was licking softly, steadily, his tongue cleaving her hot, swollen women\u2019s flesh. He could hear her throaty groans and in response to that primitive sound his engorged cock dug urgently into the bed and still he licked, licked, licked. He put his hands on her, tilted her hips back and spread her flesh with his thumbs while he forced his tongue inside her. She screamed his name and rocked back against his mouth. He could hear her begging, groaning and felt like doing a little begging himself, like doing a little taking himself and instead let his hungry mouth have free reign. His tongue stabbed at her, his lips tasted her and wanted more of her tangy sweetness, his hands kneaded her firm, white flesh.</p><p>\u201cJared...\u201d</p><p>He slipped his thumbs inside her, wriggled them. Her flesh was red, swollen, hot and tasted pretty damned fine. He could have touched her forever. Wanted to. He wished he could see her face, but respected her earlier request, respected her fear at appearing vulnerable, even before him. Maybe especially before him. He loved her, she was coming to love him and he wouldn\u2019t spoil it by forcing an intimacy she wasn\u2019t ready for. Not even on their last night together.</p><p>\u201cJared, please...\u201d</p><p>He rose up behind her and gently took her down to the bed, riding her until they were both on their stomachs. \u201cPlease what?\u201d he whispered, smoothing her hair back from her face while fighting the urge to rear back and slam himself into her. Repeatedly.</p><p>\u201cPlease now,\u201d she rasped, \u201cI\u2019ll die if you don\u2019t come inside me now.\u201d She wriggled beneath him and he clutched her shoulders and shuddered all over, knowing if he did what he wanted, what his cock so urgently demanded, they would be done before he was all the way inside. Twice in one night! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Humiliating , he thought and could have smiled. \u201cPlease, Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose we can renegotiate,\u201d he whispered and tongued her ear. \u201cAre you suuuuure you insist on keeping your appointment tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was only kidding,\u201d he said, not sure if he was telling the truth. \u201cI\u2014whoa!\u201d She\u2019d bucked, reared up on her hip and tumbled him onto his side. They faced each other and she reached for him, her fingers closing around him with care, with love.</p><p>\u201cNo you weren\u2019t. But I don\u2019t blame you.\u201d She wriggled closer to him; her eyes were enormous. Her face was flushed, her forehead sheened with sweat. She raised her leg and scooted still closer.</p><p>Unbelieving, he moved to meet her.</p><p>He watched her face while he slowly penetrated her. Her eyes widened, her breath caught, her gaze bored into his. If he hadn\u2019t come earlier, he surely would have at that exact moment; the intimacy was incredible, like nothing he\u2019d felt before. Jesus , he thought, thrusting slowly, mesmerized by her face, the eyes really are the windows of the soul and hers is...is so beautiful...</p><p>He kissed her softly and she cried out into his mouth, then he felt her tighten around him, felt her press herself as closely as she could. He reached out, found her breasts, stroked her nipples while he thrust against her and she had barely stopped shuddering from one orgasm when another was on her.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Kara,\u201d he groaned while she shivered and bucked against him, while her eyes closed and she dug her nails into his back, \u201cI think I\u2019m just about done. I think this is...is...\u201d Abruptly, shockingly, she jerked away. He was now thrusting into air. \u201cWhat the hell ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cServes you right,\u201d she gasped, \u201cfor trying to use sex to get me to blow off the D.A.\u201d Then, incredibly, she shoved her hair off her damp forehead and stuck her tongue out at him. \u201cSo phhhhhbbbtttt!\u201d</p><p>He yowled and grabbed for her. She tussled with him briefly, then let him roll her onto her back and enter her again. Her legs came up, wrapped around his waist and she thrust back at him, grinning at him the whole time and he didn\u2019t know whether to laugh, too, or throttle her.</p><p>He came instead, so hard and long he felt his eyes roll back. Then collapsed over her.</p><p>\u201cYou screamed like a girlie girl when you thought we were done,\u201d she whispered into his ear.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I get my strength back, I\u2019m going to kick your ass,\u201d he growled.</p> <p>\u201cSweetie, you couldn\u2019t kick a hole through a paper sack.\u201d She giggled. \u201cBut because you\u2019re so good in bed, I think I\u2019ll keep you.\u201d She stopped laughing, probably remembering she was in no position to keep anybody.</p><p>He finally broke the silence. \u201cLet me rest. But only for a little bit. I\u2019m not wasting one minute of tonight sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d she said and put her head down on his shoulder.</p><p>\"I had the oddest dream about you,\" he said, much later. Early morning sunlight was slanting across his bed. Contrary to their best intentions, they had indeed dozed off for a few hours. He had been thrilled to wake up beside her. And nearly cried when he remembered he likely never would again. \"The first night you stayed over. Remember? You slept on the couch.\"</p><p>\"I remember.\" How could she forget? \"I had a strange dream that night, too.\"</p><p>\"In yours, did I dress in an armadillo suit, throw pickles at you and then hump you like a monkey?\"</p><p>She shook so hard with laughter she nearly fell off the bed. \"No! Don't take this the wrong way, but you're sort of a freak sometimes.\"</p><p>\"Says the compulsive thief. What happened in your dream?\"</p> <p>\"You anally raped me, then disappeared.\"</p><p>He looked appalled. \"I don't know which idea is worse.\"</p><p>\"Well,\" she teased, \"I did have an orgasm. So it wasn't all bad.\"</p><p>\"Did you now?\" His hand closed over her breast. \"Let's see if you can have another one. Where were we\u2014er\u2014getting busy? In your dream?\"</p><p>His palm was rubbing lazily across her nipple, and she was a bit breathless when she replied. \"Your couch. You bent me over the arm rest and did as you liked.\"</p><p>\"Mmm. Too bad I don't have any lubricant.\"</p><p>\"Lubricant?\"</p><p>\"Don't yell, I'm right next to you. Well, I'm certainly not going to bend you over anything without lots of K-Y.\"</p><p>She couldn't believe they were having this conversation. \"Could you use something else?\" Not that I've decided whether or not I'll let you.</p><p>\"Like what? Vaseline? Crisco? Nope; we need something water soluble.\"</p><p>\"You sure seem to know a lot about it,\" she said tartly.</p><p>He smiled lazily. \"Well. I am a doctor.\" His hands were busy between her legs. \"Oooh, God, that's nice...you're still slippery from last night.\"</p><p>\"I was too tired to get up and wash,\" she said, almost groaned; his fingers\u2014two, then three--dipped inside her with no resistance at all. \"And then we...we fell asleep.\"</p><p>\"Turn over for me.\" His fingers were busy, busy.</p><p>\"No fair disappearing when we're done,\" she said, and was instantly sorry. Why remind him that their time was so desperately short?</p><p>\"No chance,\" he said firmly, easing her over on her hands and knees. Then she felt his fingers, slick from their juices, ease past her sphincter, stretching her, teasing her.</p><p>\"God, that's nice,\" she moaned.</p><p>\"Wait,\" he panted, and then she felt his engorged tip against her bottom.</p><p>\"Push hard. Really hard.\"</p><p>\"I'll hurt you. And frankly, it'll probably sting my poor dick like crazy.\"</p><p>She bit back a laugh. \"I want it to hurt. I want to have a sore bottom for a while.\" Something to remember you by when I'm by myself in a cell tonight.</p><p>\"Kara...\"</p><p>\" Shove.\"</p><p>He was reluctant, she knew, but also excited. The word was barely out of her mouth when he obliged with a grunt. The pain was searing, abrupt...and oddly pleasurable. She gasped harshly as he shoved again, his balls slapping against her.</p><p>\"You're\u2014\" She gulped and tried again. \"You're hurting me.\"</p><p>He thrust, thrust, thrust at her poor throbbing bottom. \"I know...sorry...ah, Jesus !\"</p><p>\"Don't stop.\"</p><p>\"Thank God.\" His hands found her breasts, squeezed hard, marked her flesh. His thighs slammed against her. Her ass burned. Unlike her dream, she had not the slightest sensation an orgasm was anywhere near.</p><p>Still, the feel of his cock digging into her, opening her, was strangely exciting. So were his thrusts; they were wild, almost out of control; his arousal was total, it had dominated him completely. He knew he was hurting her, and couldn't\u2014wouldn't\u2014stop.</p><p>And that was most exciting of all.</p><p>\"Kara...\" A strangled groan.</p><p>\"I've never let anyone do this,\" she said in reply and that was it, that finished it for him. He collapsed behind her, breathing harshly. She felt him slip out of her and had time for a quick, amused thought: Nothing is keeping me from the shower this time . Then he flipped her over, spread her legs, opened her wide with his thumbs.</p><p>His head dipped and she felt his tongue flick across her clit. She squirmed and his mouth followed her.</p><p>His tongue and lips were delicate...a direct contrast to the pounding he had just given her.</p><p>His tongue eased inside her with sweet slowness, then retreated, then eased back in. She could hear someone whimpering softly and realized she was the one making the sound.</p><p>He pulled back a bit and lapped at her, then started licking her the way a child licks a popsicle in July: slowly and enthusiastically. Savoring it. And like a popsicle, she melted.</p><p>She brought her legs up and locked her ankles behind his neck. Now he was sucking on her clit, teasing the aching bud with swirls and sweeps of his tongue, and she began to scream. Sort of. In truth she was too tired to scream; what left her throat were shrill, desperate whimpers.</p><p>Her hips bucked against his mouth once. Twice. Then she was coming, coming and melting, straining toward him.</p><p>They held each other until their breathing slowed.</p><p>After a long moment, she said, \"We really need a shower.\"</p><p>\"And a transfusion. Kara, I'm pretty sure you've killed me. I just haven't caught on yet.\"</p><p>She giggled tiredly. \"Shall I roll you toward the bathroom?\"</p><p>\"Bathroom later. Snuggle now.\" So saying, he tucked her head into his shoulder and tossed the sheet over them. \"I love you.\"</p><p>She smiled against his flesh. \"I love you, too.\"</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>\u201cYou look almost as bad as I feel,\u201d he lied. Kara looked beautiful, as usual, but she did have dark circles under her eyes. \u201cAnd I feel like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have stayed home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start up with that crap again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you should have,\u201d she said, blatantly ignoring his command. \u201cThey\u2019ll take me away after the meeting and I don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t want you to see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d he shouted, startling several courthouse staff. Kara was leading them straight to the D.A., like the demented homing pigeon she had turned into. \u201cI saw you clapped in irons and hauled away not even twenty-four hours ago.\u201d He looked at his watch. \u201cNot even fifteen hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d she said stubbornly. \u201cThis is no place for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d</p><p>In another circumstance, he could have appreciated the grandeur and majesty of the old courthouse. The architecture spoke of a love of design, the mellow wood spoke of a love of caretaking. The building had to be a hundred years old and was magnificent. Unfortunately, right now it was a symbol of everything that was about to go wrong with his life, so he could have gouged holes in the banisters and taken pleasure in it.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be bringing a lawyer to this meeting?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI waived my right to council,\u201d she said, not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cCripes! Aren\u2019t you taking this throw-the-book-at-me-bullshit a little too far?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him and, disgusted, he quit bugging her.</p> <p>When they reached the correct floor, there was no one sitting at the secretary\u2019s desk, but a man popped out of the small adjoining office and approached them, hand out. \u201cHi,\u201d said the guy who was going to clap his Kara in chains for the next thirty years. \u201cI\u2019m Tom Wechter.\u201d</p><p>Tom Wechter was the youngest D.A. in the history of the tri-state area. The state was proud of him, with good reason. He had an astonishing conviction rate and was boyishly handsome, with dark blonde hair cropped short, an athletic frame, a firm handshake. Jared hated him on sight.</p><p>He shook their hands. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go into my office and have a seat?\u201d</p><p>They wordlessly followed him in. He shut the door behind them and the sound reminded Jared of a closing casket.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Wechter said, sitting behind his desk. His suit jacket was hanging over the back of his desk chair; his sleeves were rolled up, exposing smooth forearms lightly sprinkled with blonde hair. His tie was a nightmare\u2014dark green with orange dots. Like a car accident, Jared had trouble looking away from it.</p> <p>\u201cFirst things first. Dr. Dean, your name is not unknown to me. You made quite an impression on the desk sergeant...Officer Ristau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Officer Ristau,\u201d he said fondly, ignoring Kara\u2019s raised eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cAnd Ms. Jones, you\u2019ve also got some fans in the police department. It was suggested to me by several detectives\u2014many who had worked the Freibur case\u2014that I cut you a deal...reduced sentencing in return for your testimony against Anthony Edis Carlotti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdis?\u201d Jared couldn\u2019t help asking.</p><p>Wechter never blinked. \u201cFamily name. However,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe\u2019ve had an undercover cop in Carlotti\u2019s gang for some time. The officer in question\u2014who had a hell of a headache last night, thanks to you, Ms. Jones\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kara moved her foot on top of Jared\u2019s and pressed, hard. Jared gritted his teeth and remained silent.</p> <p>\u201c\u2014has, in the past thirteen months, gathered so much evidence of murder, assault, prostitution, fraud, rape and blackmail\u2014most of it on tape, no less\u2014that Carlotti and his associates have been advised by counsel to plead man one\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cManslaughter in the first degree,\u201d Kara muttered to Jared.</p><p>\"Hey, I watch Law and Order .\"</p><p>\u201c\u2014and, it must be said,\" Wechter-the-robot continued, \"Carlotti practically ruptured something agreeing to a plea. So that takes care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d Jared hoped he hadn\u2019t guessed correctly. \u201cYou don\u2019t need Kara\u2019s testimony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The better news, Dr. Dean, is because Carlotti has been jailed for reasons that have nothing to do with you, there\u2019s no longer a hit on your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoody,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cBut Kara is still screwed, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a legal term I\u2019m familiar with.\u201d</p> <p>Jared stared. The guy was either the biggest stiff in the world, or just dim.</p><p>\u201cThe Avenging Angel,\u201d Wechter said after a short silence. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you for a long time.</p><p>I\u2019ve dreamed of getting you in this office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Kara said quietly. Her expression was serene, almost bored. Jared swelled with pride. Her life was shattering, imploding, but to look at Kara you might have thought she was waiting for a bus. Or thinking about stealing one. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to keep out of your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been at this for years, haven\u2019t you? The vigilante stuff?\u201d</p><p>Kara opened her mouth, but Jared cut her off. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer that, Kara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little late to play coy now, Dr. Dean. Haven\u2019t you?\u201d he asked Kara.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have I been breaking the law, or how long have I been pulling jobs like the Freibur house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least fifteen years, I\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>Kara nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d</p><p>Another silence. Jared was ready to scream from the tension. Not that Wechter or Kara were exhibiting any. That was all right. He was sweating enough for all three of them.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Wechter said again. \u201cI have a sister.\u201d</p><p>Kara made a polite noise. Jared considered putting his fist through a wall and bellowing something along the lines of, Can we just get on with it ?.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Wechter continued. \u201cShe ran into some trouble a few years ago, when she was a freshman in college, when I was the ADA for this county. She believed a new gentleman friend when he said he was a nice guy, followed him out the back door of the restaurant, went for a walk with him in the park. Ran into three of his friends,\u201d Wechter continued coolly, as if reading a weather report.</p><p>\u201cThey were having a surprise party and she was the guest of honor.\u201d He had started tapping his fingers on the desk, the only sign of stress Jared had been able to find in the man. Tap-tap. \u201cSo she fought and cried and screamed and of course no one came to her aid. At first.\u201d</p><p>Tap-tap. \u201cAnd about when the first one, the one who\u2019d lured her to the park, was getting ready to take my sister\u2019s virginity, someone kicked him in the side of the head hard enough to tumble him off my sister.\u201d</p><p>Tap-tap. \u201cAnd when my sister sat up, she saw that not only was her would-be rapist badly hurt, unconscious, but all of his friends were, too. And the only person still standing was a blonde girl about her age. Dressed in dark clothing.\u201d</p><p>Tap-tap. \u201cSo this woman\u2014this girl, really\u2014helps my sister to her feet, asks if she needs to go to the E.R. My sisters says no, thank you. The girl relieves all four men of their wallets. Hands my sister their drivers\u2019 licenses. Presses something else into my sister\u2019s hand, something cold and hard. The girl wishes my sister a pleasant evening and leaves.\u201d</p><p>Tap-tap. \u201cAnd my sister gets all the way home before thinking to look at what\u2019s in her hand. It\u2019s an enormous diamond ring. Prominently listed, I noticed the next morning, on the police report and worth close to a million dollars. Not that the robbery victim was going to see it again, or any insurance money...he was busy explaining to the vice department why he had so many snuff films in his basement, not to mention the equipment for making same.\u201d</p><p>Tap-tap. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a nice story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love happy endings,\u201d Kara said obediently.</p><p>Jared tried to speak, but his mouth was still hanging open. He was trying to process everything he had just heard...Kara had saved this man\u2019s sister? That\u2019s why the D.A. had been pursuing her for so long and so hard? But what did it all mean?</p><p>\u201cLuckily I am a man who reveres the honor of his profession above all else,\u201d Wechter said with a completely straight face. \u201cEven if the girl in the story had been you, Ms. Jones\u2014and what are the chances?\u2014your past deeds can have no bearing on my duty as an officer of the court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jared practically screamed.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Kara said, with a frown in Jared\u2019s direction. \u201cPlease allow me to save you some trouble. I will plead guilty to whatever charges you wish to bring.\u201d</p><p>The D.A. sighed. \u201cUnfortunately, from an administrative standpoint, it\u2019s just not feasible.\u201d</p><p>Jared was having trouble keeping up. \u201cWhat\u2019s not feasible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProsecution. I don\u2019t think I can get a conviction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up , Jared. Mr. Wechter, I\u2019ve\u2014I\u2019ll tell you everything you need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho will press charges? The pedophiles? The child pornography merchants? Every house you burgled, every con man you swindled, most of those people are still in prison. But just suppose, for the sake of argument, this office was able to bring charges against you, was able to convince a grand jury that you deserved to be held over for trial. I\u2019m sure Dr. Dean could find someone to say you\u2019re unfit for trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right!\u201d he said again, louder. This was something he\u2019d never thought of. But hell, his med school roommate was an up-and-coming guy at Bethesda Psych. And wasn't one of his ex-girlfriends just named Chief Resident at Beth Israel\u2019s Psychology Department?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...very generous,\u201d Kara said after a long moment. \u201cBut I was arrested last night. My fingerprints were taken, I gave a statement and signed my name to it. It\u2019s not that easy to disappear into the cracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not in a bureaucracy,\u201d Wechter said dryly. \u201cWhy, we\u2019re able to keep track of every little thing around here. Also, your fingerprints didn\u2019t take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jared and Kara said in puzzled unison.</p><p>\u201cYour fingerprints. We\u2019re on a new system now, it\u2019s all done by computer\u2014you noticed you didn\u2019t get any ink on your fingers? Well, in theory, the fingerprints go right to the computer. Except...\u201d Wechter shrugged. \u201cThere was a glitch. We can\u2019t find your file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the police report?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegrettably, the detectives who took your statement can\u2019t find it. They can\u2019t even remember your name. Or what you look like. Isn\u2019t that the oddest thing, Ms. Smith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJones.\u201d</p><p>Wechter shrugged.</p><p>Silence, while Kara and Jared digested this. Jared thought\u2014it almost sounded like\u2014it seemed as if the D.A. and detectives were using their influence to let Kara go. But that couldn\u2019t be true...this wasn\u2019t the movies. Bad things happened to good people. As a doctor, he saw it every day.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wechter,\u201d Kara said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m more grateful for these\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBureaucratic foul-ups.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014than I can say. But it\u2019s time for me to face the music, so to speak. I can\u2019t keep running. Frankly, I\u2019m glad to be done with it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMiss Doe, what purpose is served by putting you in prison?\u201d Wechter asked, equally quietly. \u201cAnd I might add, this is the only get-out-of-jail-free card you will ever get from this office. If in the future you\u2019re caught stealing so much as a rice cake, I will prosecute.

She looked dazed. About as dazed as he felt, frankly.</p><p>\u201cThanks for stopping by,\u201d Wechter said briskly, picking up a pen and pulling a pile of papers toward him. The meeting was clearly over. \u201cIt was nice meeting you, Miss Smith.\u201d</p><p>Kara opened her mouth to correct him. Jared kicked her in the ankle, then grabbed her arm and hauled her up from her chair. \u201cNice meeting you, too, Mr. Wechter,\u201d he said warmly. He could have kissed the man. On the mouth, even! \u201cWe\u2019ll see ourselves out.\u201d</p> <p>Engrossed in paperwork, Wechter only grunted. He looked up just once, when Jared was ushering Kara out. \u201cRemember,\u201d he said, completely deadpan, \u201ccrime doesn\u2019t pay.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Kara said for the fourth time. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he let me go. All those years...tracking me...and I was avoiding him...do you think he\u2019s worked so hard, risen so fast, so he could be in a position to help me when the time came?\u201d</p><p>They were in the same small park where Kara had polished off Carlotti\u2019s goons a few days earlier. It was a seedy, disgusting little place, but it was \u201ctheir\u201d place, so he didn\u2019t mind as much as he should have.</p><p>He considered her remark. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about it like that. It\u2019s something to consider, huh? It would explain a lot. I mean, the guy\u2019s a legend. He never loses a case. He\u2019s the most popular D.A. the state\u2019s ever known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the handsomest,\u201d Kara added demurely.</p> <p>Jared scowled. \u201cForget it. You belong to me, sunshine. All he can do is keep you out of jail. I can keep you healthy.\u201d</p><p>He felt her small hand curl into his, felt her squeeze. \u201cOf course I belong to you. But now what? I spend the last day psyching myself up to lose everything. Now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re going to have the life you deserved. Don\u2019t you get it? You can do anything you want. No more running. No more being afraid. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019ve been reborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world am I going to do for a living? I never went to college...I don\u2019t have any societally-correct skills. Not that the cops could catch me if I did decide to keep hacking,\u201d she added thoughtfully, ignoring Jared\u2019s scowl, \u201cbut it\u2019d be pretty rotten to reward Wechter\u2019s show of good faith by keeping up my old habits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight. Besides, you\u2019ll be too busy making a life with me to worry about cracking safes,\u201d Jared declared, tightening his grip on her hand. \u201cI want you to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said casually, \u201cof course we\u2019ll get married. As soon as possible, I think.\u201d</p><p>She giggled at the look on his face. \u201cChrist, that was easy! I figured I\u2019d have to spend the rest of the year talking you into it. Maybe shoot you up with Demerol and haul you before the judge myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoooo...\u201d She paused, then slowly continued. \u201cI finally figured it out the night before. And again this morning. You thought\u2014 we thought\u2014I\u2019d go to jail for years and years. But you stuck by me anyway.</p> <p>You were sure you were going to lose me. But you didn\u2019t leave. You...you don\u2019t leave when things get hard. You risked yourself\u2014needlessly, but it\u2019s the thought that counts\u2014for me. You endangered yourself because you didn\u2019t want me to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re saying,\u201d he cut in eagerly, \u201cis in the face of all that, it was pretty goddamned stupid of you to be afraid of making a life with me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of it in quite those terms,\u201d she said dryly, \u201cbut essentially, yes.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her and hugged her fiercely. Her breath exploded against his ear and she wriggled ineffectively. \u201cPlease, Jared, I can\u2019t breathe,\u201d she protested, but she was laughing. \u201cBesides, before you get all excited, I have a request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t knock over Tiffany\u2019s on our honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, ha. I need to use Mr. Wechter one more time...I hope he\u2019ll cooperate. Do you think he\u2019ll figure I only had one chip with him and I already cashed it in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKara, sweetie, I don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about. What do you want with Wechter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be approved, no problem, but me...I want to join the foster parenting program. From the parenting side, I mean,\u201d she added darkly. \u201cI\u2019ll give my word about no more hacking, but nobody said I couldn\u2019t teach wards of the state how to protect themselves. Nobody said I couldn\u2019t teach them that there are houses where nothing bad happens when the shades are drawn.\u201d</p><p>He smiled sadly. Someday he\u2019d have to ask her about her entire childhood, beginning to end. He hoped he could hear the entire story without crying...or putting his fist through a wall. \u201cI\u2019m sure Wechter would help you get approved,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t mind? The kids will come and go, you know. And they\u2019ll be...damaged. Some of them.</p><p>They probably won\u2019t like us much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, probably not. You...\u201d He rested a finger on the tip of her nose. \u201cWhat\u2019s not to like?\u201d</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>Kara sat down at the kitchen table somewhat heavily. At five months pregnant, getting around was definitely trickier than usual. She\u2019d never been so heavy in her life. So clumsy in her life! It was a good thing she\u2019d given up hacking, because she probably couldn\u2019t fit through the front door of a lot of her old targets by now. Slow as she now was, she\u2019d probably trip the alarm a dozen times before so much as touching the front door.</p><p>She poured Gary more cereal, knowing he was still hungry and knowing he wouldn\u2019t ask for seconds.</p><p>It was amazing, she thought, that the great Avenging Angel, scourge of city scum, the feared burglar who could crack any lock and bypass any security system, didn\u2019t know her own ovulatory cycle. In the warehouse closet, on Jared\u2019s\u2014their\u2014living room floor and in their bed the night before she\u2019d gone to see Thomas Wechter, it had indeed been her time to get pregnant. Two months later, Jared had laughed like a loon when she\u2019d told him, then kissed her on the mouth and immediately taken her to bed.</p><p>Afterward, he\u2019d charged to Babies R Us like a man possessed.</p><p>She grinned, remembering, and Gary looked up at her questioningly. \u201cI was thinking about something happy,\u201d she explained. \u201cSomething about Jared.\u201d</p><p>Gary nodded and kept eating. He had no comment to add and Kara didn\u2019t expect one. Gary was small for his age and his medical records were a nightmare of too many burns and broken bones. He didn\u2019t talk much and tensed whenever Jared\u2014or any adult male\u2014entered the room. Kara knew what that meant and ground her teeth in silent rage for what the child had been through.</p><p>Jared knew what it meant, too and did his best not to startle the boy. Since the man tended to bound through their home like a kangaroo on uppers, that wasn\u2019t always successful. But in the three weeks Gary had stayed with them, he seemed to gradually relax, even around her husband.</p><p>The boy had stopped eating, she noticed and was watching her silently. She poured herself another glass of milk and mopped the last of her egg yolk from her plate with a piece of toast. No wonder I\u2019m so fat I can hardly see my feet , she thought with in inward chuckle. \u201cGary? Did you want to ask me something?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI was wondering...how long...will I stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She considered the answer carefully. \u201cYour stepfather will go to jail. And your mom has to follow some rules to get you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike stop drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that and some other stuff. But the thing is, she really really wants you back. She misses you a lot.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know her husband was doing bad things to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell her,\u201d Gary whispered.</p><p>Kara nodded. \u201cBut the way the judge looks at it is, she should have figured it out, you know? That\u2019s why you have to stay somewhere else for a while. She\u2019s trying awfully hard, Gary, only it\u2019ll take time.</p><p>The judge has to be sure, absolutely sure that you won\u2019t be hurt in her house anymore. And it\u2019ll take a while for her to follow all the rules so you can live with her again. I would guess you\u2019ll be with Jared and me for at least six months.\u201d She paused. \u201cIs that okay?\u201d</p><p>Gary nodded.</p><p>\u201cBecause if you would rather stay somewhere else, that\u2019s totally okay and Jared and I won\u2019t be mad, I promise. You don't even have to say it to me, you could tell your case worker\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it here,\u201d Gary said casually and stood to put his cereal bowl in the sink. Kara was cheered that he\u2019d felt confident enough to interrupt her. She started to get up to put her own plate in the sink when she heard the crash of Gary\u2019s cereal bowl hitting the tile.</p><p>All the color drained from the boy\u2019s face and he cringed away from her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d he cried. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Gary, relaaaaaaaaaax,\u201d she said casually, inwardly wishing the boy\u2019s stepfather would stop by just long enough for her to break all his fingers. \u201cI drop stuff all the time. So does Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked as if he didn\u2019t believe her. \u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>She raised her plate high, then dropped it. It shattered spectacularly. \u201cNope. See? Like I said. Happens all the time.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. She decided he was still entirely too tense and so dropped, in rapid succession, both their juice glasses and his bread plate.</p> <p>\u201cAccidents will happen,\u201d she said cheerfully as the bread plate broke against the wall. \u201cSee, Gary?</p><p>They\u2019re just things . You can always buy more things .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t\u2014won\u2019t Dr. Dean be mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Dean just wants to know what the heck you two are up to.\u201d</p><p>Gary jumped again. Jared was standing in the kitchen doorway, looking at the mess and shaking his head.</p> <p>\u201cGary had an accident,\u201d Kara explained. \u201cThen I had several.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s lips went white as he pressed them together, but the laugh escaped anyway. Kara grinned at the sound and Gary visibly relaxed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll clean it up,\u201d Gary said timidly.</p><p>\u201cFreeze,\u201d Jared ordered and Gary froze. \u201cYou\u2019re both in socks. Gary, I\u2019m going to pick you up and put you in the living room. Kara, I have no idea how I\u2019ll heft your gross bulk, but I\u2019ll think of something. Then I\u2019ll clean it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee if you get any tonight,\u201d she muttered as Jared gingerly picked his way through the minefield of glass slivers, picked Gary up and carried him out. Then he returned for her.</p><p>\u201cI can do it,\u201d she said doubtfully. \u201cI\u2019m pretty coordinated.\u201d</p> <p>He snorted. \u201cSays the woman who tripped getting out of bed this morning. Just stand still.\u201d He scooped her up with a theatrical groan, stole a kiss, then staggered into the living room. Gary saw them coming and giggled. He was standing next to their neighbor, Ava.</p><p>\u201cWell, hi,\u201d Kara said, surprised, as Jared put her down and returned to the kitchen. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Jared had brought company. Do you have time for a bite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ava said regretfully. She was a charming matron with two young sons, both of whom had been over to play with Gary. She and Kara had absolutely nothing in common and Kara didn\u2019t know if she liked Ava because of that, or in spite of that. \u201cI just need to call the locksmith. Jack took my keys to work with him and now I\u2019m locked out.\u201d</p><p>Kara edged toward the door. She had an idea why Jared had brought Ava over. \u201cDid you try the back door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I know it\u2019s locked,\u201d Ava assured her. \u201cIt\u2019s always locked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill. It never hurts to try. Let me check it for you. Keep an eye on Gary for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe broke things,\u201d Gary reported solemnly to Ava as Kara left the room.</p><p>Sure, Kara thought, grabbing her smallest toolkit on her way out, I promised. No more hacking. But that doesn\u2019t mean Ava should be stuck outside for the six hours it\u2019ll take a locksmith to get here.</p> <p>She grinned. She was hopelessly in love. She had a baby on the way and nice neighbors and was finally part of the system in a good way, a helpful way. She was married to a passionate, amazing, wonderful man and she still got to crack the occasional lock.</p><p>Life was good. And, in a way, it was all because of Ole One Eyebrow.</p><p>Kara laughed and bent to the lock. </p> </body></html>"]
