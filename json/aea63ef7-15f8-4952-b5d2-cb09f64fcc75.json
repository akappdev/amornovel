For me, right now, it was akin to one of the inner circles of Hell.</p><p>\u201cHow,\u201d I demanded, \u201ccan the air possibly contain this much moisture? It\u2019s like going swimming.\u201d</p><p>My sister, walking beside me in the late-afternoon sun, grinned. \u201cUse your magic to push it off you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo much work. It just keeps coming back,\u201d I grumbled. Jasmine, like me, had been raised in the dry heat of Arizona, so I couldn\u2019t understand why she didn\u2019t have the same revulsion I did to the monsoon conditions of high summer in the Midwest. We both wielded weather magic, but hers was focused primarily on water, so maybe that explained her blas\u00e9 attitude. Maybe it was just the resilience of youth, seeing as she was about ten years younger than me. Or maybe, just maybe, it was because she wasn\u2019t nearly five months pregnant and hauling around an extra ten pounds or so of offspring who seemed intent on overheating me, sucking my resources, and pretty much slowing down every goddamned thing I did.</p><p>It was also possible hormones were making me a little irritable.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost there,\u201d said a polite voice on the other side of me. That was Pagiel. He was the son of Ysabel, one of the bitchiest gentry women I knew\u2014and she didn\u2019t even have excess hormones as an excuse. Pagiel hadn\u2019t inherited his mother\u2019s personality, thankfully, and possessed a knack for crossing between the Otherworld and the human world that rivaled mine and Jasmine\u2019s. He was roughly the same age as her, and the fact that I had to have a teenage escort to get me to my doctor\u2019s appointments only added insult to the many injuries I\u2019d endured these last few months.</p><p>A block ahead, the Hudson Women\u2019s Health Clinic stood among its carefully pruned pear trees and neat rows of geraniums. The business was right on the line of the commercial and residential zones of the city and tried to give the appearance that it was part of the latter. It wasn\u2019t the pretty landscaping that made me keep coming back to this sauna, walking half a mile each time between the Otherworldly gate and the clinic. It wasn\u2019t even the medical care, which was fine as far as I could tell. Really, when it came down to it, this place\u2019s biggest appeal was that so far, no one had tried to kill me here.</p><p>That cursed wet heat had me dripping with sweat by the time we reached the building. I was used to sweating in the desert, but something about this climate just made me feel sticky and gross. Fortunately, a wave of air-conditioning hit us as we walked through the door. As glorious as it was for me, it was a miracle for Pagiel. I always liked seeing his face when he felt that first blast. He\u2019d grown up in the Otherworld, where fairy\u2014or gentry, the term I preferred\u2014magic could work wonders. He wouldn\u2019t blink an eye at magical feats that would make a human gape. But this? Cold air produced by a machine? It blew his mind every time. No pun intended.</p> <p>\u201cEugenie,\u201d said the receptionist. She was middle-aged and plump, with a kindly, hometown air about her. \u201cBack with your family I see.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019d taken to passing Pagiel off as our brother, for simplicity\u2019s sake. Really, though, it wasn\u2019t a stretch to imagine us all being related. Jasmine\u2019s hair was strawberry blond, mine a light red, and Pagiel\u2019s a true auburn. We could have done advertising for the National Redhead Solidarity Group, if such a thing existed. No one at the clinic ever seemed to think it was weird that I brought my teenage siblings along, so maybe that was normal around here.</p><p>We took seats in the waiting room, and I saw Pagiel shift uncomfortably in his jeans. I hid a smile and pretended not to notice. He thought human clothes were crude and ugly, but Jasmine and I had insisted he wear them if he wanted to be part of my obstetric security detail. Normally, the gentry favored silks and velvet in their clothing, with flourishes like puffy sleeves and cloaks. Maybe he could have gotten away with that on the West Coast but not here in middle America.</p><p>Both he and Jasmine stayed behind when the nurse came to get me. Jasmine used to go in with me, but after an embarrassing incident when Pagiel had tried to attack someone with a Milli Vanilli ringtone, we\u2019d decided it was best if he wasn\u2019t left alone. Although, I admit, it was hard to fault his actions.</p><p>I went to see an ultrasound tech first. As the mother-to-be of twins, I was knocked into a high-risk category and had to have more ultrasounds than someone with a \u201cnormal\u201d pregnancy would. The tech situated me on the table and slathered gel on my stomach before touching it with her paddle. And just like that, all my crankiness, all my sarcasm\u2014all the feelings I\u2019d so haughtily walked in with\u2014vanished.</p><p>And were replaced with terror.</p> <p>There they were, the things that I\u2019d risked my life\u2014and the fate of the world\u2014for. To be fair, the images still didn\u2019t look like much to me. They were only sketchy black-and-white shapes, though with each visit, they became increasingly more babylike. I supposed this was a marked improvement, since for a while there, I was certain I\u2019d be giving birth to aliens and nothing human or gentry at all.</p><p>\u201cAh, there\u2019s your son,\u201d said the tech, gesturing to the left side of the screen. \u201cI was pretty sure we\u2019d be able to spot him this time.\u201d</p><p>My breath caught. My son. As she moved the paddle to get a better angle, his profile flashed into stark relief, small arms and legs and a rounded head that looked very human. This tiny creature, whose beating heart was also clearly visible, hardly seemed like a conqueror of worlds. He seemed very small and very vulnerable, and I wondered not for the first time if I\u2019d made a mistake in continuing this pregnancy. Had I been tricked? Had I been taken in by this innocent fa\u00e7ade? Was I even now nurturing the man who prophecy said would try to enslave humanity?</p><p>As though sensing my thoughts, his sister stirred on the other side of the screen. She had been a large driving force in my decision to keep this pregnancy. If I\u2019d terminated it in an attempt to save the world from my son, I would\u2019ve been responsible for ending her life. I couldn\u2019t do that to her. I couldn\u2019t do that to him, even. It didn\u2019t matter what the prophecy said. They both deserved a chance to live their lives, free of what destiny had allegedly dictated for them.</p><p>Now, if only I could convince all the people who were trying to kill me of that.</p><p>\u201cEverything looks great,\u201d the tech told me. She put the paddle away, and the screen went black, shrouding my children in shadows once more. \u201cPerfectly normal.\u201d</p><p>Normal? Hardly.</p><p>Yet, when I was ushered into an exam room to speak to the doctor, her opinion was the same. Normal, normal, normal. Sure, twins required extra watching, but otherwise, everyone seemed convinced I was the model of a perfect pregnancy. None of them had any idea, not even the tiniest clue, of the daily struggle I went through. None of them knew that when I looked at my stomach, I was tormented with the image of violence done in my name and the fate of two worlds hanging in the balance.</p> <p>\u201cDo you feel them move yet?\u201d the doctor asked me. \u201cIt\u2019s around that time.\u201d</p><p>Images of Alien came to mind. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. How will I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019ll be pretty obvious in later pregnancy. This early, you start to feel fluttering sensations. Some people say it\u2019s like a fish swimming around. You\u2019ll know when it happens. Don\u2019t worry\u2014they won\u2019t be trying to kick their way out. Not at first.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered, not sure how I felt about that. Despite the changes in my body, it was still easy to regard this as some physical ailment. It was only the ultrasound that reminded me there were actually people living inside me. I wasn\u2019t sure I was ready to also start feeling them squirm around.</p><p>The doctor glanced at her clipboard. \u201cHonestly, everything looks great,\u201d she said, echoing the ultrasound tech.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired all the time,\u201d I countered. \u201cAnd I keep getting short of breath. And I\u2019m having trouble bending. I mean, I can still do it, but it\u2019s not easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me.\u201d I used to banish ghosts and beat up monsters for a living.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cYou have two people growing inside of you. It\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have a lot of things to do. My lifestyle\u2019s pretty, um, active.\u201d</p><p>She remained unmoved. \u201cThen you\u2019re going to have to adapt.\u201d</p><p>Despite my whining, I was sent off with a clean bill of health and instructions to book my next appointment. In the lobby, I found Jasmine and Pagiel exactly where I\u2019d left them. She was leafing through a copy of People and trying to explain to him both the definition and appeal of reality T V.</p><p>Maybe the office didn\u2019t bat an eye at my \u201csiblings\u201d because I simply had too many other weird habits. Like, for example, I always paid for each visit in cash. When you tacked on things like ultrasounds, blood work, and other medical testing, the final price tag was pretty high. I always felt like I was one step away from pulling out a Mafia-style suitcase filled with hundred-dollar bills. There was no alternative, however. I couldn\u2019t do anything that would allow my enemies to track me. Medical insurance claims would create a paper trail, as would even paying with a check or credit card. For the majority of gentry, none of that was a concern. Most were like Pagiel and could barely grasp the idea of banks or the postal system, let alone using them to track me. Unfortunately, my enemies in the Otherworld had very good connections here among humans, those who knew our systems inside and out. It was because of them I was in Ohio in the first place. Tucson had been compromised.</p><p>Another woman, far more pregnant than me, was just entering the office as the receptionist printed my receipt. A gust of wind swept in behind her, and she had to fight to catch the door and make it close. Pagiel, though inept at technology, had been trained in the gentry ways of chivalry and jumped up to help her.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she told him. She flashed the rest of us a cheery smile. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how fast the weather turned on us. A cold front came out of nowhere.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The receptionist nodded sagely. \u201cThat\u2019s how it is this time of year. We\u2019ll have storms tonight for sure.\u201d</p><p>As if I needed another reason to dislike the Midwest. God, how I missed Tucson\u2019s unchanging climate. As I walked out with Jasmine and Pagiel, I knew I had an unfair attitude. I was simply feeling the woes of my self-imposed exile. I didn\u2019t really hate Ohio so much as I missed Arizona. Once we were back in the Otherworld, I could visit the kingdom I ruled and practically be in a mirror of Tucson. I\u2019d designed it that way. And yet ... it wasn\u2019t the same. I kept blaming everything on the weather, but a place was defined by more than just that. There was a culture and a vibe, driven by its people, that was unique to every location. The Thorn Land was great, but it would never replace my hometown.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d said Jasmine, trying to pry her hair off of her face. A fierce wind had whipped it right at her as soon as she stepped outside. \u201cThat lady wasn\u2019t kidding.\u201d</p> <p>I pulled myself from my self-pity enough to note that she was right. The temperature had dropped, and that thick, suffocating air from earlier was now in motion as fronts collided. The cute ornamental trees swayed back and forth, like synchronized dancers. Dark clouds, tinged with a sickly green, gathered above. A chill that had nothing to do with the cool-down ran over my skin. My asshole gentry father, aside from getting me stuck with a prophecy that said his eldest grandson would conquer humanity, had also passed on his prowess with weather magic. I was tuned in to all the elements that made up a storm: the moisture, the air, even the charged particles that heralded lightning. My senses were open to them, and the intensity of all those factors hitting me at once now was a bit overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cSo much for a candy run,\u201d I muttered, peering at the angry sky. I was out of Milky Ways and pretty desperate for some. \u201cWe\u2019ll be lucky if we don\u2019t get drenched before we reach the gate.\u201d Not for the first time, I wished I had a car during these Ohio trips, but it was pointless. The only real reason I came here was for the clinic, and it was within walking distance to the gate that led back to the Otherworld. There\u2019d be no practical way to keep a car here. Plus, riding in one would probably kill Pagiel.</p><p>I\u2019d glanced at the sky, mostly verifying that things looked as bad as they felt, when something suddenly jerked me to a standstill. If I scanned to the north, looking above a stretch of trees, I could see the edge of the storm clouds. The black ceiling above us only extended a mile, and where it ended abruptly, I could see sunshine and blue sky. I was willing to bet the air was stiflingly hot and humid there too. Looking around, I saw that was the case everywhere. Directly above us, the sky was dark, but those clouds extended in a very finite, very clearly defined way. It was like being under a perfectly round dome. All around those hard edges, sun fought to get through.</p><p>My companions came to a halt beside me, and I met Jasmine\u2019s gaze. \u201cI feel it... .\u201d she murmured. \u201cI didn\u2019t at first. There was too much going on... .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I said. Along with feeling storm elements, she and I were also sensitive to magic specifically acting on them. What we were feeling now wasn\u2019t a natural occurrence. There were so many stimuli that the magic behind it had remained hidden to me initially\u2014as was no doubt intended. There were Otherworldly forces at work. And with that realization came another: we\u2019d been discovered. My Midwest safe house was no longer safe. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p> <p>Pagiel\u2019s young face was grim as he glanced at me. \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Pagiel had inherited his mother\u2019s magical prowess with air, so he too had probably figured out something was amiss.</p><p>I began walking again. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to the gate. There\u2019s no other choice. Once we cross, we\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever\u2019s doing this must know about the gate,\u201d pointed out Jasmine. \u201cThey could be on the other side waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But that also means they would\u2019ve had to defeat all the troops left behind.\u201d This gate in Hudson didn\u2019t open within the borders of my kingdoms in the Otherworld. It was close enough to my allies, however, that the journey had always seemed worth it in order to get safe medical treatment in the human world. Still, we never made the journey without a considerable and armed escort on the other side.</p><p>The wind seemed to increase as we walked, blowing against us and slowing our progress. I could\u2019ve used my magic to control it but was holding back until faced with the storm\u2019s creator\u2014or rather, creators. There were only two people in known gentry history who could singlehandedly summon and control a storm like this. One was my deceased father. The other was me. My bet was that this was the work of a number of magic users, a thought that made me grit my teeth in frustration. A lot of planning would\u2019ve had to go into this, which meant my enemies had known about Hudson for a while.</p><p>Almost as annoying as being found out was having to deal with my own physical limitations. I wasn\u2019t crippled, not by any means. I wasn\u2019t even waddling. But, as I\u2019d told the doctor, I just couldn\u2019t quite do the things I used to. A half mile was not a huge distance, not at all, especially on suburban sidewalks. In my pre-pregnancy state, I could have easily broken out into a run and covered the distance quickly. Now, my best was a half-ass jog, and I was very aware of the fact that I was slowing Jasmine and Pagiel down.</p> <p>We exited off the main road, cutting through the outskirts of a vast, wooded park. Otherworldly gates were rarely found in heavily populated, urban areas, and this one lay deep within the park\u2019s grounds. The trees blocked the direct force of the wind, but the branches were shifting wildly, showering us with twigs and leaves. We were the only ones out here, since most reasonable humans would\u2019ve long since taken shelter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be here,\u201d I called to my companions, forcing my voice to be heard above the wind. From the satchel I wore across my body, I produced my wand and an iron-bladed athame. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to attack, it\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d</p><p>They attacked.</p><p>Five spirits, two water elementals, and another elemental who glowed like a will-o\u2019-the-wisp. Elementals were gentry who could not cross fully into this world in their original forms. They manifested as vaguely anthropomorphic creatures, composed of whatever element most strongly tied to their magic. From the scope of the storm, I suspected more were lurking nearby, but they were probably the weaker ones. It would take all of their power just to maintain these weather conditions, with none left over for fighting. These sent to battle us were the strongest, and the spirits were a backup choice I\u2019d seen frequently. Spirits who hadn\u2019t moved on to the Underworld had no care for who ruled humans or the Otherworld. They were therefore easy recruits for the gentry who opposed me.</p><p>They weren\u2019t the only ones with help from beyond the grave.</p><p>\u201cVolusian!\u201d I called. I quickly chanted the words that would summon my undead minion. The sounds were lost in the wind, but it didn\u2019t matter. My intent and power were what counted, and within seconds, Volusian materialized. He was shorter than me, with pointed ears, red eyes, and smooth black skin that always reminded me of a salamander\u2019s. \u201cThe spirits!\u201d I snapped.</p><p>Volusian needed no further urging. He hated me. He wanted to kill me, even. But so long as I bound him to my service, he was forced to obey my commands. He attacked the spirits with a fury, his magic flaring bluish white in the shadowy landscape. Jasmine had already set herself on the water elementals while Pagiel took on the will-o\u2019-the-wisp, whom I assumed had some connection to air or the charges in the atmosphere.</p><p>And me? I hung back. I hated doing it but had no choice. We\u2019d rehearsed this over and over. The decision to have these twins meant nothing if I let myself get tossed around or\u2014worse\u2014killed. In protecting myself, I protected them, even though it went against every fighter\u2019s instinct I had. Fortunately, I wasn\u2019t entirely useless. Our attackers wanted me but were too distracted by my allies. This freed me to use my magic to diminish some of the more annoying effects of the weather. It also allowed me to banish the spirits. Volusian was well matched against them, but obviously, the less he had to deal with, the better.</p> <p>I extended my wand at one of the spirits as it ganged up with another against Volusian. They were translucent, wraithlike creatures who floated in the air and would have been almost impossible to see outdoors in the sun. The shadows and clouds made them eerily discernible. Opening my senses, I reached past this world, past the Otherworld. I brushed the gates of the Underworld, establishing a connection that was solid but wouldn\u2019t pull me in. Banishing spirits to the Otherworld was easier and used to be my tactic when I was eliminating them for frightened suburbanites. Spirits sent there could return, however, and I couldn\u2019t take that chance anymore. The less of them around to come back for me, the better. It was the Underworld or bust.</p><p>I focused my will on my target, using the human magic I\u2019d learned as a shaman to drive the spirit out of this world. The creature shrieked in rage as it felt the Underworld\u2019s tug, and seconds later, it dissolved into nothing. I immediately set my sights on a second spirit, briefly allowing myself to assess Pagiel and Jasmine\u2019s progress.</p><p>To my astonishment, Pagiel had defeated the will-o\u2019-the-wisp elemental already. I hadn\u2019t even seen it happen. I had the power to banish elementals back to the Otherworld as well, but for my two sidekicks, physical confrontation was the only option. Pagiel had used his magic to destroy the elemental outright, obliterating it into nothingness. I\u2019d known he was a strong magic user but had never truly seen him in battle until now. He was stronger than Jasmine, I realized. He immediately joined her side against a water elemental, blasting it with a wind that brought it to a standstill while she used her magic to call on the water of the elemental\u2019s form and rip it to pieces. Meanwhile, I banished a second spirit.</p><p>\u201cEugenie, go!\u201d cried Jasmine, barely sparing me a glance as she and Pagiel sparred with the last elemental. Volusian was down to one spirit. The odds were in our favor now. None of these attackers would have a chance to break away and come after me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I grimaced but didn\u2019t hesitate. Again, this was part of the plan we\u2019d established. These Otherworldly denizens were here for me. If I was gone, and they weren\u2019t destroyed first, they\u2019d likely leave once they realized only Jasmine and Pagiel (and Volusian) were left. I felt like a coward and had to keep reminding myself, If you die, the twins die.</p><p>I took off at that half jog, continuing to use my magic to lighten the storm and make my passage easier. Ahead of me, a ring of bright yellow buttercups stood out in sharp contrast against the park\u2019s green grass. No matter how many times the landscapers mowed them down, the buttercups always returned within a day. They marked the gate.</p><p>I was steps away from it when something hit me from my left. The force knocked me over, and I only barely managed to twist my body in a way that minimized the jarring as my knees hit the ground. It had been foolish to think the gate wouldn\u2019t be guarded. My attacker was another elemental, seemingly composed of moss and leaves. They decayed and shifted before my eyes, marking just how weak the elemental really was. It could barely exist in this world. The creature\u2019s chances of survival were slim, yet it had apparently thought it worth the risk to its life to come and take mine.</p> <p>I struggled to my feet as it came at me. In one leafy hand, the elemental held a copper dagger, honed to a fine point. Copper was the toughest metal gentry could wield, and even if it wasn\u2019t as effective as steel, it could still kill. The elemental\u2019s moves were awkward and lumbering, giving me enough time to get to my feet, even in my addled state. I still held the iron athame and felt some satisfaction that pregnant or not, I was faster than this bumbling creature. It swung at me, and I easily dodged, giving me an opening with my athame. The blade made contact, slashing across the elemental\u2019s green chest. It shrieked in pain, and I made an instant decision not to finish it off. I didn\u2019t have the luxury of playing hero. That injury was more than enough to slow the elemental and let me spring for the gate. I hurried into the ring of buttercups and reached toward the Otherworld. The gate was a strong one that worked at all times of the year and required hardly any effort from someone who knew how to use it. It was another reason we\u2019d selected this area.</p><p>The paths between the worlds opened, and I felt a slightly disorienting sensation, like I was being taken apart and reassembled. Within seconds, I found myself standing in the Honeysuckle Land, surrounded by my own soldiers. There was no sign of any foes here, and from the startled looks my guards gave me, my battle-marked state was totally unexpected. They wasted no time in responding, however, and had their weapons drawn the instant the elemental followed me through the gate.</p><p>Only, it was no longer an elemental. It wasn\u2019t even an \u201cit.\u201d It was a she, a gentry woman no older than myself with brown hair braided into a high bun. She staggered two steps toward me, still holding the copper blade, before falling to the ground. Blood spilled from her chest, showing the severity of the wound I\u2019d given her. It had been done with iron\u2014the gentry\u2019s bane\u2014and occurred in the human world, where she was at her weakest. Maybe she could have survived a similar injury in this world, but now, it was too late. The blade fell from her hands as she feebly clutched at her bleeding torso. All the while, her eyes never left me.</p><p>\u201cDeath ... to the prophecy... .\u201d she gasped out, just before death took her. The light left those hate-filled eyes, and soon she saw nothing. I felt ill.</p><p>New arrivals from the gate immediately drew my guards to attention, but it was only Jasmine and Pagiel. They looked as if they\u2019d been in a fight but otherwise showed no serious damage. Jasmine looked at me first, and despite her hard face, I knew she was checking me for injury, just as I\u2019d done for her. It was hard to believe we\u2019d once been enemies.</p> <p>Satisfied I was okay, she then glanced at the dead woman before meeting my gaze. \u201cWell,\u201d Jasmine said, relaxing slightly. \u201cAt least you don\u2019t have to go to Ohio anymore.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>The layout of the Otherworld defies human physics. There are no straight lines from point A to point B, even when you walk along a road that doesn\u2019t seem to curve or fork away. One step forward on a road may take you into a kingdom you thought you\u2019d cleared ten miles back. Most of the kingdoms tended to stay in the same proximity to each other, but there were no guarantees. A road whose quirks you thought you knew by heart might suddenly change without warning.</p><p>Fortunately, there were no such surprises today. The road we\u2019d taken to reach the Hudson gate eventually got us back to the Oak Land, with only the expected detours into friendly lands. The Oak Land wasn\u2019t one of my kingdoms. It was ruled by my strongest ally, who was also the one who made me the most nervous. Dorian and I had once been lovers and waged an Otherworldly war together. Things had fallen apart when he\u2019d tricked me into a quest designed to conquer a kingdom I didn\u2019t want. We\u2019d been quite hostile toward each other for a while, but my pregnancy had changed our relationship. He was one of the advocates of the prophecy that said my father\u2019s first grandson would conquer humanity, and so, even though he wasn\u2019t the father, Dorian had vowed to aid and protect my children.</p><p>Once he\u2019d ascertained I was alive and well, however, he showed little sympathy upon hearing about our ambush.</p><p>\u201cI never understood why you had to go to that Ohoho place anyway,\u201d he said, pouring a glass of wine. \u201cI say good riddance.\u201d</p> <p>I sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s Ohio. And you know why I was there. The twins need medical care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you claim. They can receive \u2018medical care\u2019 here. Ours is just as good as humans\u2019. Do you want a glass?\u201d He held up the wine bottle.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cNo. And that\u2019s exactly the point. Medicine here\u2019s not the same at all. Wine\u2019s terrible for babies.\u201d</p><p>Dorian swept into the sitting room to join me, elegantly arranging himself on a love seat that displayed his purple velvet robes to best effect. \u201cWell, of course it is. I\u2019d never dream of giving wine to an infant! What do you take me for, a barbarian? But for you ... well, it might go a long way to make you a little less jumpy. You\u2019ve been positively unbearable to live around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t have it either. It affects the babies in utero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d he said, tossing his long auburn hair over one shoulder. Life would be easier if he wasn\u2019t so damned good-looking. \u201cWhy, my mother drank wine every day, and I turned out just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re proving my point for me,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cLook, I know you believe everything\u2019s fine here and there\u2019s no reason I should ever set foot outside the Otherworld, but I just don\u2019t feel safe not having this pregnancy monitored by a\u2014human doctor.\u201d I\u2019d been about to say \u201creal doctor\u201d but caught myself in time. It was true that I\u2019d watched the gentry perform some amazing feats of healing. I\u2019d literally seen limbs reattached. Yet, despite all the gentry magic, nothing could match the comfort I took in the reassuring numbers and bleeps of medical machinery. I was half human, after all, and had been raised that way.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t \u2018feel safe,\u2019 eh?\u201d Dorian gave me one of his laconic smiles. \u201cTell me, did the assurance you got from your human doctor today outweigh the potential damage you received when that elemental knocked you around?\u201d</p> <p>I scowled and looked away. Even though I\u2019d managed to land fairly well when I\u2019d fallen near the gate, I\u2019d still had Dorian\u2019s healers check me out when I returned. They\u2019d performed some minor spells on me to relieve bruising and had sworn there was no injury to the twins. They had no diagnostic equipment to prove it, but gentry healers did have an innate sense for such things in the body, just like I was sensitive to the components of storms. I had to take it on faith that the healers were correct.</p><p>\u201cWe should\u2019ve been more prepared, that\u2019s all,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cHow much more prepared can you be?\u201d asked Dorian. He still spoke in that easy way of his, like all of this was a joke, but I could see the hardness in his green eyes. \u201cYou already traipse through this world with a veritable army at your back. Are you going to start bringing them with you into the human world too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. We\u2019d never get a hold of enough jeans to outfit them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou risk yourself. You risk them.\u201d Dorian pointed at my stomach, just in case there was any question who he meant. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be going to the human world. Honestly, you shouldn\u2019t be traveling between kingdoms here! Pick one. One of yours, mine, it doesn\u2019t matter. Just stay still somewhere, and stay protected until they\u2019re born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not very good at staying still,\u201d I remarked, noting a similarity between this conversation and the one I\u2019d had when I told the doctor about my physical frustrations.</p><p>To my surprise, Dorian\u2019s face actually softened into sympathy. \u201cI know, my dear. I know. But these are unusual times. I\u2019ll give you this: moving around does make it harder for them to find you. Maiwenn and Kiyo can only monitor so many places at once, so there\u2019s something to be said for not staying entirely stationary.\u201d</p><p>Maiwenn and Kiyo. My heart twisted. We rarely ever spoke those names. Usually we just said \u201cthe enemy\u201d or simply \u201cthey.\u201d But even though there was a large contingent of gentry who wanted to stop Storm King\u2019s prophecy, we all knew that two in particular were the real threats. Maiwenn was queen of the Willow Land and had once been a friend. Kiyo was my ex-boyfriend and half human like me.</p><p>He was also the father of my children.</p><p>Kiyo ...</p><p>If I thought about him too long, my emotions would get the best of me. Even after our romantic relationship had begun to fracture, I\u2019d still cared about him. Then, he\u2019d made it clear that he considered me and the twins acceptable losses to prevent any threat to humanity. I certainly hadn\u2019t wanted to see the gentry conquer the human world either, but his actions had left me reeling. It was still a hard reality for me to accept, that I could know someone so well ... and yet not really know him at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you think we should do about the wedding?\u201d I asked, forcing myself to change the subject. \u201cThey know I\u2019ll be there.\u201d Two servants of mine, Rurik and Shaya, were getting married soon, and I was hosting the festivities.</p><p>Dorian nodded, eyes narrowed in thought. \u201cThey also know all of your allies and a number of others who simply don\u2019t want to be on your bad side will be there. So long as we can get you back to the Thorn Land securely, there shouldn\u2019t be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what he\u2019s doing! It\u2019s imperative I speak to him now !\u201d</p> <p>Dorian and I both flinched at the interruption and turned in surprise toward the source of the angry female voice. Guards standing sentry at the sitting room\u2019s door immediately began protests about how Dorian wasn\u2019t to be disturbed, but it was clear those explanations were being ignored.</p><p>A world-weary expression crossed Dorian\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he called. \u201cLet her in.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been sprawling on a chaise, nearly as at ease as Dorian, but now I straightened up. I knew who this newcomer was and wouldn\u2019t be caught off-guard.</p><p>Ysabel came striding into the room, wearing a gown that was elaborate even by gentry standards. I always thought the best term to describe their fashion sense was \u201cMedieval rave.\u201d Her dress was made of a heavy silver satin with a crazy V neckline that went nearly to her stomach. A pattern of seed pearls trimmed all the hems and also adorned her long auburn hair. I wondered if she was on her way to some formal event or if she was simply continuing in her efforts to lure in Dorian. She\u2019d been his mistress until he and I were together, but he hadn\u2019t resumed things after our split.</p><p>Perhaps more astonishing than her attire was that she had company. Trailing in her wake were Pagiel and her formidable and generally unpleasant mother, Edria. The boy had to hurry up to keep pace with the other two and looked miserable. A few moments later, his younger sister Ansonia also entered nervously. She had long hair, almost the color of mine, and looked terrified to be here.</p> <p>\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d exclaimed Ysabel, coming to a halt before Dorian. I couldn\u2019t tell if her cheeks were flushed with anger or bad makeup application. Considering the gentry often made their cosmetics out of nuts and berries, neither possibility would have surprised me. \u201cThis is unacceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother\u2014\u201d began Pagiel, reaching her side.</p><p>Ysabel pointed at me, anger flashing in her eyes. \u201cI refuse to allow her to keep endangering my son! Why, he nearly died today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not!\u201d exclaimed Pagiel.</p><p>Dorian gave Pagiel a calm once-over. \u201cHe looks fine to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a very close thing,\u201d said Edria gravely.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, recalling how quickly Pagiel had dispatched his foe. \u201cFrom what I saw, he had things under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know?\u201d asked Ysabel with a sneer. \u201cYou ran away.\u201d</p><p>I felt a blush of my own creeping over my cheeks. My new coddled status still grated on me, as did the knowledge that I had to keep myself out of harm\u2019s way while others defended me. No matter how logical it all seemed, I\u2019d never be easy about it.</p><p>\u201cHey, I did my part,\u201d I said.</p><p>Ysabel had already turned away from me and was addressing Dorian. \u201cIt isn\u2019t right that my son is risking his life for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d said Edria. Her dark hair was pulled back so tightly that I swore it stretched the skin on her face. Maybe it was the gentry equivalent of a facelift. \u201cHe has no stake in this alleged prophecy concerning her son. He owes her nothing.\u201d</p><p>Pagiel kept trying to interject and was constantly shushed by his mother and grandmother. I felt bad for him, particularly as the only male in that family. His father had died years ago, and Ysabel\u2019s father had allegedly been some ne\u2019er-do-well who ran out on them. Pagiel had no one but women around.</p><p>Dorian glanced between Ysabel and Edria. \u201cI\u2019m not ordering him to do anything for her. He goes with her by choice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not safe,\u201d said Ysabel.</p><p>Dorian remained unmoved. \u201cAnd again, I say that he goes with her by choice. Honestly, I\u2019m not really sure what you expect me to do. Your son is a free citizen of my kingdom, and he is of age to make his own decisions.\u201d</p><p>Ysabel looked on the verge of stomping her feet. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous! Isn\u2019t it your job to protect your subjects from harm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d said Dorian. \u201cAnd at the same time, I must also look after the kingdom\u2019s needs. I can hardly protect every soldier in times of war, can I? And even if we aren\u2019t technically at war right now, this kingdom is supporting the Queen of Rowan and Thorn. Doing that has certain unavoidable dangers, but there\u2019s nothing to be done for it. Hence my use of \u2018unavoidable.\u2019 I can hardly denounce him for voluntarily choosing to assist her. And, in fact, since he\u2019s gone above and beyond to keep her safe\u2014as today\u2019s skirmish proved\u2014he\u2019s actually due for commendation.\u201d</p><p>Pagiel beamed under his king\u2019s praise, but Ysabel\u2019s face grew darker. Part of me felt a little sorry for her. After all, she was a mother trying to protect her son. Bitchy or not, she did care about him. At the same time, it was hard for me to give too much credit to someone who\u2019d often used her son for her own gain. After the death of her husband, Ysabel had come to Dorian\u2019s court with the sole purpose of seducing a man (preferably the king) who would then provide for her. Bringing Pagiel and Ansonia had been a ploy on Ysabel\u2019s part to enhance her own allure. Fertility was a continual concern among the gentry, who didn\u2019t conceive easily. Flaunting her two children was Ysabel\u2019s attempt at showing off what a good catch she was.</p><p>\u201cThere, you see?\u201d asked Pagiel triumphantly, finally getting a word in. \u201cI have the king\u2019s support. I believe in what I\u2019m doing. I want to further the prophecy.\u201d</p><p>I winced a little at that. While I was thankful to those who were helping protect me from Kiyo and Maiwenn, that gratitude was marred by the knowledge that most who aided me did so in the hopes that my son truly would conquer humanity. Gentry and humans had once shared the same world, but the former had eventually left as magic faded and technology rose. Many gentry felt they\u2019d been wronged and deserved a claim back there.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a foolish boy,\u201d snapped Edria. \u201cAnd you have no idea what you believe in. Half of why you do this is because of her sister.\u201d</p><p>I saw a flicker of embarrassment in Pagiel\u2019s features, but he held his ground. It was true that I\u2019d originally gotten to know him when he began showing a romantic interest in Jasmine. Over time, however, he\u2019d become vehemently opposed to those who would threaten unborn children and had taken my side because of that.</p><p>\u201cMy reasons are my own,\u201d Pagiel returned, glaring at his mother and grandmother. \u201cNot yours. This is what I\u2019m choosing to do, and you can\u2019t stop me.\u201d</p><p>The three of them seemed to have forgotten us and had been drawn back into their own private family dispute. Ansonia continued skulking in the back. I was guessing her mother had ordered her here to show family solidarity.</p><p>\u201cPagiel\u2019s been amazing,\u201d I said, hoping to lend him a little support. \u201cIn fact, he\u2019s been essential on our trips to the Otherworld. Few other gen\u2014er, shining ones have that kind of power in the human world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPower that\u2019s being wasted,\u201d said Edria with a sniff. \u201cHe has more important things to do than be your errand boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandmother, you can\u2019t talk to her like that!\u201d Pagiel looked mortified. \u201cShe\u2019s the Queen of Rowan and Thorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if she\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d said Dorian, raising his hand. Everything about his posture was still easy and relaxed, but there was sternness in his voice that drew everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cThis conversation is done. There\u2019s nothing I can\u2014or will\u2014do. Both of you charming ladies must accept that Pagiel is a man and in control of his own life. Although, if it\u2019s any comfort\u201d\u2014he spared me a brief, amused glance\u2014\u201cI doubt he\u2019ll be traipsing off to the human world anytime soon, now that Her Majesty\u2019s secret hideaway is no longer so secret.\u201d</p><p>I scowled but made no argument\u2014because he was right.</p><p>Pagiel\u2019s blue eyes lit up. \u201cI\u2019ll help you find a new place,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019ll check all the gates and see where they lead into the human world.\u201d</p><p>I smiled indulgently. I was beginning to think Dorian might have a point about staying holed up in this world, but I didn\u2019t want to dress Pagiel down in front of Ysabel and Edria. \u201cThank you, Pagiel.\u201d</p><p>Ysabel looked ready to explode. \u201cThis isn\u2019t finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Dorian. \u201cI assure you, it is. Now go. All of you.\u201d</p><p>That commanding tone was back, and after some obligatory curtsies and bowing, the family scurried off.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re always so delightful,\u201d said Dorian.</p><p>\u201cNot the first word that comes to mind for me,\u201d I said, watching as the guards shut the door again. I sighed. \u201cAlthough, I really do hate the idea of anyone risking their lives for me. Especially Pagiel. I like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the unfortunate thing,\u201d said Dorian, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be people you like. Enemies tend not to risk their lives for you. Only your friends are willing to make the sacrifice. Besides, I thought you got over this moral quandary when we went to war against Katrice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I ever really got over it. Mostly I learned to deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may have to be a permanent philosophy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I agreed. I stood up, stretching to relieve an ache in my back that hadn\u2019t been there earlier. Great. One more way my body was falling apart. \u201cI should get back to the Thorn Land now.\u201d</p><p>Dorian rose with me. \u201cNot yet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I eyed him warily. \u201cTrying to keep me around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust being smart. Maiwenn\u2019s agents were probably watching this hold, waiting to see if you\u2019d return after their ambush. If they\u2019re still in the area, it\u2019s best you not take to the roads, escorted or not. That, and they\u2019d also likely expect you to report here and immediately go home. Wait another day or so, and they\u2019ll give up and leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate intrigue,\u201d I muttered, knowing he was right again.</p> <p>\u201cBut you do it so well.\u201d</p><p>Then, without warning, he reached out and laid a hand on my stomach. I jumped back. \u201cHey! Ask permission first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wanted to check in on my little prodigies,\u201d he said, unfazed. He stepped toward me again. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not your prodigies.\u201d I gave a reluctant nod, and his hand returned. \u201cWhy bother? I haven\u2019t felt them move yet. You certainly can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so, I like the connection. We\u2019re going to be very close, these two and I. Well, if you\u2019ll stop being stubborn and let me adopt them.\u201d</p> <p>It was an offer he kept making me, one that would give my children legitimacy and status in the Otherworld. As queen of two kingdoms, though, they had plenty of status and inheritance through me, without his help. Dorian kept claiming he simply wanted to be a part of our lives. After all the mistrust between us, I was certain there was some sort of attempt at control going on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still thinking it over,\u201d I said evasively.</p><p>He chuckled to himself. \u201cSomething makes me suspect you\u2019ll be \u2018thinking it over\u2019 for the next twenty years.\u201d</p><p>Dorian said no more, but his hand didn\u2019t move either. He seemed completely entranced by touching me, and I wished I could read what he was feeling. Dorian excelled at disguising what was on the inside. Part of that came from being king, and part of it came from just being ... well, Dorian. As we stood there, I soon became aware of the warmth of his hand on me and the closeness of his body. It was disconcerting and stirred up too many recollections of our past. I\u2019d been deeply in love with him when he betrayed me; it hadn\u2019t been an easy relationship to just let go of. Even now, the memories of our closeness and the intense physicality burned within me. When he started to slide his hand toward the side of my hip, I abruptly pulled away.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t over there,\u201d I said, hoping I sounded more irritable than flustered. I took a few steps toward the door. \u201cI\u2019ll stay another day or so and then head back.\u201d</p><p>He clasped his hands in front of him and nodded. \u201cAs you wish. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see you around. If not, then at the wedding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said. I held his gaze for a few moments and then quickly turned away, afraid of what I might see in his eyes. Having to guess at his emotions was frustrating sometimes, but it wasn\u2019t nearly as scary as actually knowing them.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>I didn\u2019t take offense that Rurik and Shaya wanted to be married in the Rowan Land, rather than the Thorn Land. Sure, the Thorn Land was where they\u2019d fallen in love while working for me, but I\u2019d known for a while that few gentry shared my love for the endless heat and vast deserts of my primary kingdom. The Rowan Land was still under my rule, though, and even I had to admit it was pretty gorgeous. It was the kind of place that came to mind when you pictured pastoral picnics and idyllic afternoons. Flowers bloomed in abundance, and low, rolling mountains made for a pretty backdrop along the horizon. If I had any issue with the Rowan Land, it was that I simply hadn\u2019t wanted to be its queen.</p><p>The wedding was held in the vast grounds stretching out beyond the monarch\u2019s castle. The castle had been designed by the Rowan Land\u2019s last ruler, Katrice, and looked like something straight out of a Bavarian postcard. Magic tied to plants and nature was a common gentry power, and several people must have been hard at work in decorating the grounds. I\u2019d told them they could do whatever they wanted, and they\u2019d taken me at my word. Huge, flowering cherry trees\u2014which hadn\u2019t been there a few days ago\u2014lined the courtyard like sentries, showering everything with delicate pink petals. Climbing roses had been coaxed into a natural arch where the couple would take their vows and bloomed in exotic colors I\u2019d never seen in the wild. There were no chairs for the guests, and I\u2019d been told it was tradition to stand for gentry weddings, particularly since the ceremony was usually brief. Off to the sides, kept discreetly away during the ceremony, servants were piling ornate wooden tables with platters of food for the feasting that would follow. Blue morning glories wound their way up the tables\u2019 legs, and gentry magic ensured the food stayed hot.</p><p>If there was anything that marred this beautiful scene, it was the abundance of soldiers patrolling the area. They weren\u2019t easy to spot\u2014at first. Guests were pouring into the area, dressed in the variety of colors and fabrics the gentry so loved. It made it difficult to distinguish anything, but after a minute or so of study, I could pick out the uniforms of both my own soldiers and the ones that Dorian had lent for the occasion. Although they were spread throughout all the grounds, the soldiers were more densely arranged around wherever I was. No surprise, seeing as I was the reason for the extra security. I also knew that all the guests\u2014many of whom were dignitaries and royalty from other kingdoms\u2014had been extensively screened before they were allowed anywhere near the wedding site. I felt a little guilty that my situation put this joyous occasion into lockdown mode, but Rurik and Shaya had taken it in stride.</p><p>\u201cThis dress makes me look fat,\u201d I told Jasmine as we stood near the back of the crowd and watched the last-minute preparations fall into place. She glanced over at me and my efforts to rearrange the folds of my long, gauzy dress.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant,\u201d she stated. \u201cEverything makes you look fat.\u201d</p><p>I scowled. \u201cI think the correct response was, \u2018No it doesn\u2019t.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Jasmine shrugged, feeling no remorse for her blunt honesty. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad. And it\u2019s just in your stomach.\u201d She eyed me critically. \u201cAnd maybe your chest.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, knowing some of what she said was true. I was so active that I\u2019d really put on no weight that wasn\u2019t essential for the pregnancy. And yeah, I knew I wasn\u2019t that big yet, but standing here\u2014especially next to Jasmine\u2019s slim figure\u2014I was again reminded of the hard truth: I was no longer the one in charge of my body.</p><p>\u201cYour Majesty?\u201d</p><p>A new voice drew me out of my self-pity, and I turned to see a middle-aged gentry woman standing beside me in a velvet gown. She swept me a low curtsy and then straightened up in one graceful motion. Her tawny hair was piled up into an impossibly high hairdo that could only be the result of magical assistance. Rubies glittered at her ears and throat.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Ilania. I am an ambassador of her royal majesty Varia, queen of the Yew Land. My most gracious and exalted lady sends her well wishes and congratulations on such a joyous occasion.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t familiar with Varia or the Yew Land, but Ilania\u2019s presence didn\u2019t really surprise me. Probably only about a third of the guests here were actually friends or family of the happy couple. The rest were those who, knowing of my regard for Shaya and Rurik, had come to get in good with me and make a show of diplomacy and friendship. Some supported Storm King\u2019s prophecy; some didn\u2019t. Regardless, most\u2014unless they were specifically allied with Maiwenn\u2014wanted to make sure they weren\u2019t on my bad side.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s nice of you. Both of you.\u201d I groped for diplomatic small talk. \u201cI hope you didn\u2019t have to travel too far?\u201d</p><p>Ilania made a dismissive gesture, showing what nonsense that was. \u201cNo journey would be too far to send my lady\u2019s regard. In fact, she has entrusted me with this most precious gift as a sign of her friendship.\u201d</p><p>Two servants in what must be Yew uniforms appeared, carrying a statue made of a marbleized green and white stone. The statue was a little shorter than me and depicted a unicorn balancing a fish on its nose and a butterfly on its horn. Odd choice.</p><p>\u201cUm, thank you. I\u2019m sure Shaya and Rurik will find a great place for this in their bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Ilania chuckled. \u201cThis is for you, Your Majesty. And actually, we brought two\u2014one for each of your lands. I also have one for King Dorian, whom I\u2019m most excited to meet. Since we don\u2019t travel here very often, we wanted to make sure to extend our friendship to as many as possible. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d she added. \u201cEach of the statues is different. All are made of damarian jade, but we\u2019d hardly give you all identical designs. That would be tacky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I agreed, eyeing the unicorn and its friends.</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want tacky.\u201d Her servants seemed restless, so I directed them inside, with instructions to find a servant of mine who would take the statue\u2014or rather, statues\u2014off their hands. Both my castles actually had storerooms for gifts like this. I\u2019d learned a long time ago that even if I had no intention of displaying or using some royal gift, it was always best to keep it around in case the giver ever paid a visit.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what you offer in return,\u201d added Ilania. \u201cI\u2019m sure it will be lovely.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cEr ... I\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d</p><p>She laughed merrily. \u201cSurely you know about our land\u2019s custom? We exchange gifts to emphasize our bonds of friendships. We\u2019ll proudly display the offerings from your kingdoms, just as I know you\u2019ll display ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, making a mental note to tell the servants to dredge up some acceptable gifts. Keeping up with gentry etiquette boggled the mind. \u201cWe\u2019ll make arrangements for you to take them when you leave.\u201d</p><p>Ilania glanced around us conspiratorially and then stepped in closer to Jasmine and me. \u201cMy most gracious queen also has another gift for you\u2014or rather, an offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I asked carefully. The gentry loved wheeling and dealing, and I wasn\u2019t surprised that a gift and offer of friendship would come with strings attached. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ilania nodded. \u201cMy queen knows of your ... situation.\u201d She gave my stomach a not-so-subtle look, just in case there was any question about what my \u201csituation\u201d was. \u201cAs the ruler of many kingdoms, Queen Varia has no interest in the prophecy or any stake in conquering other\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cDid you say she rules other kingdoms? How many is she bound to?\u201d Gaining control of a kingdom in the Otherworld was no small thing. A binding took place between the monarch and the land itself, one that required considerable strength on the ruler\u2019s part. It was such a great feat, in fact, that no other monarch besides me had been able to pull it off in recent history. At least, that\u2019s what I\u2019d been told. Discovering someone who ruled an additional kingdom\u2014multiple ones, allegedly\u2014was huge.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t bound to them, not exactly,\u201d explained Ilania. \u201cRather, she rules them. Their own monarchs have agreed to become subject kingdoms to her. So, technically, those monarchs are bound to the land, but they happily acknowledge Varia as their high queen.\u201d</p> <p>I glanced over at Jasmine. She looked just as surprised as I felt. I\u2019d never heard of anything like this, a kingdom willingly subjugating itself to another. The Yew Land and its neighbors were far away from my own, so it wasn\u2019t entirely surprising that this hadn\u2019t reached me before. Still, it was odd.</p><p>Ilania seemed to take our stunned silence for awe. \u201cWith so many allies around her, my queen\u2019s territory is vast and safe. We know that you\u2019re under constant threat here\u2014even in your own kingdom.\u201d She paused to allow a couple of soldiers to pass us, proving her point. \u201cMy queen would like to extend her hospitality to you and provide a haven in which you can safely have your children. And, in fact, if you so desired, they would be welcome to stay there afterward as long as you wished. My queen\u2019s forces and power would ensure no harm befalls them, as would the distance from your enemies.\u201d</p><p>It was true that my greatest adversaries were, unfortunately, also my close neighbors. I didn\u2019t like the rest of her implications, though. Ilania was essentially saying that my own resources weren\u2019t enough to keep me and the twins safe but that her overlord queen could.</p><p>\u201cWhy would she offer this?\u201d I asked, again suspicious of any gentry kindness.</p><p>\u201cMy queen is also a mother and is appalled to see these constant attacks on you and the unborn. She finds them cowardly and wrong.\u201d Ilania smiled sweetly. \u201cAnd, as I was saying, my lady is well content with her own lands. She has no interest in the prophecy and its promise of conquering the human world. She is, however, interested in maintaining friendly relations with another woman possessed of power and command. It\u2019s very dreary for her, having so few equals to talk to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can imagine,\u201d I muttered. Around us, harried servants were trying to organize the assembled throng into some type of order. \u201cLook, things are about to get started, so I have to take my place. Send my thanks back to your queen, but tell her I\u2019m happy to stay where I\u2019m at for now. We\u2019ve done a pretty good job at keeping me safe so far.\u201d Ohio adventures aside.</p><p>Ilania curtsied again. \u201cAs you wish, Your Majesty. My lady urged me to tell you, should that be your answer, that her offer will still stand if you change your mind.\u201d</p><p>I reiterated my thanks and then hurried off with Jasmine toward the front of the crowd. \u201cThat was weird,\u201d Jasmine remarked.</p><p>\u201cThe offer, not so much,\u201d I said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s always maneuvering for position around here. But that stuff about other kingdoms? That\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>I had no time to ponder the Yew Land further because once things got going, they were going. As the presiding monarch here, I had a front-row spot. Dorian stood near me, both because of his rank and connection to the couple. They\u2019d originally been in his service and had come to mine when I\u2019d seized control of the Thorn Land. Other monarchs were arranged accordingly in a complex system of status that I didn\u2019t entirely follow but which wedding planners had been agonizing over for weeks. Jasmine, as my relative but not a reigning monarch, was a couple rows away. Beside me, Dorian gave me one of his rogue smiles, and it was hard not to smile back. Whatever animosity existed between us, it was easy to put aside for this occasion, particularly since almost a week had passed since our fight over Ohio. Besides, if anyone was going to be able to give me answers about the Yew Land and its subjugated kingdoms, it would be Dorian.</p><p>Gentry religion was never anything I\u2019d managed to get much of a grasp on, particularly since my hold on human religion was already pretty loose. From what I\u2019d learned, gentry beliefs were polytheistic and nature-oriented, with specific practices and doctrine that varied widely by region. A priest of some sort was presiding today, but I\u2019d been told he was mostly there to lend authority as a witness and officiant and that religion would have little role in the ceremony.</p> <p>Another gentry custom was made apparent as soon as the couple appeared. There was no giving-away of the bride, nor did she even walk the aisle alone. Shaya and Rurik walked together through the crowd, hand in hand, making their way to the arch of roses as equals. Few gentry even bothered with weddings, but those who did regarded them\u2014rightfully\u2014as occasions of great joy and didn\u2019t believe white was an appropriately cheerful color. So, Shaya wore a silk gown of deep rosy pink and had given up her usual braids to wear her long black hair loose down her back. It contrasted dramatically with Rurik\u2019s pale, blond features, but their expressions of happiness were a perfect match.</p><p>The ceremony was as short and sweet as I\u2019d been told it would be, mostly a recitation of the couple\u2019s commitment to each other. The two of them getting together was still kind of incredible to me, seeing as they were so different. Shaya was always reserved and responsible. Rurik was arrogant and crude. Yet, somehow, they\u2019d made it work and reached this point.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Eugenie,\u201d said Dorian, once the vows were complete and the crowd had erupted into cheers, \u201care you tearing up? I never took you for the sentimental type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I snapped, running a hasty hand across my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s just hormones. They make me do stupid things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said, in a tone that clearly told me he didn\u2019t believe me at all.</p><p>\u201cYour Majesties.\u201d</p><p>Shaya and Rurik stood before us, bowing low. Custom dictated that the new husband and wife present themselves to their liege lady before they could go on to their family and friends. They\u2019d kind of rolled Dorian into the deal too since they still regarded him as their ruler to a certain extent. I thought the custom was kind of silly. Why should the couple come to us for a blessing? This was about them. We had nothing to do with it. Still, I\u2019d long since learned not to fight against gentry etiquette and surprised Shaya with a big hug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you,\u201d I said. She had tiny roses tucked into her hair, and their scent surrounded me. The cherry trees had increased their petal production\u2014through magic, no doubt\u2014so that they rained down around us like confetti. \u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, flushing under the praise.</p><p>To the surprise of both of us, I hugged Rurik too. \u201cI\u2019m even happy for you. Though I\u2019m not entirely sure you deserve her,\u201d I teased.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you many years of joy and fertility,\u201d said Dorian, with a genuine expression of pleasure on his face. He always wore a smirk of some sort, so these moments of pure, legitimate delight were rare.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys going on any kind of honeymoon?\u201d I asked, realizing it was something I probably should\u2019ve found out long before this. So much emphasis had been put on preparing for the wedding and its security that I\u2019d never really thought much past today. My question was met with three puzzled looks.</p><p>\u201cHoneymoon, Your Majesty?\u201d asked Shaya, clearly unfamiliar with the word.</p><p>I was surprised by their surprise. \u201cEr, yeah. It\u2019s like a trip ... a trip you take after you get married. You go away somewhere on a vacation, for a week or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what end?\u201d asked Dorian with a small, curious frown.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cWell. So you can get away and be alone and ... well ... you know ...\u201d</p><p>Understanding flooded their faces. Shaya shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019re in wartime, Your Majesty. We could hardly dream of doing anything so frivolous.\u201d</p><p>Typical gentry. They had no problem getting hot and heavy in public, but the idea of a private, romantic getaway was \u201cfrivolous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d added Rurik with a wink, \u201cwhy do we need to leave? Plenty of places to do it around here. And in the Thorn Land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d I said, after they\u2019d strolled away. \u201cHow in the world did he win her over?\u201d</p><p>Dorian chuckled. \u201cWell, I daresay he won you over too. You weren\u2019t his biggest admirer when you met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for damned sure,\u201d I said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a difference between simply learning to get along with someone and vowing to spend the rest of your life with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way I see it, you can\u2019t have one without the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes no sense,\u201d I countered.</p><p>\u201cLove rarely does. It\u2019s a magic beyond any in this world.\u201d I rolled my eyes, and he extended his arm to me. \u201cShall we see what delights lie in store among the refreshments? Surely there\u2019s something there that even human medicine will allow you to consume.\u201d</p><p>The mood was too festive for me to give him a hard time, so I let him lead me across the grounds, which wasn\u2019t easy. Everyone passing by had something to say to us, whether it was simple congratulations or outright declarations of fealty. We had to carry on our conversation in pieces.</p><p>\u201cHave you found another human doctor you can see?\u201d Dorian asked me. \u201cIn a new and secure location?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I said. His wording wasn\u2019t lost on me. He\u2019d phrased it as a given, rather than chiding me for what he thought was a foolish errand, as he had last time. I knew it was a great concession for him, and I was willing to give something back. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not sure I should. Everything\u2019s been going so well ... with the pregnancy, that is. Like you were saying, whatever help a human doctor can give me might be undone by the dangers I\u2019m risking by venturing out of my kingdoms.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dorian nodded thoughtfully, with no hint of an I-told-you-so attitude. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll choose what\u2019s best, I\u2019m sure. Perhaps Roland might be able to suggest something when he next visits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d I agreed. My gaze drifted to the opposite side of the courtyard, and I felt a smile grow. \u201cAnd I know Pagiel will go with me anywhere and defend my honor.\u201d</p><p>Dorian followed where I was looking. Pagiel, bright and full of energy, was holding onto Jasmine\u2019s hands and trying to coax her into a dance. Gentry musicians had appeared in a corner and struck up a tune that had many skipping food for dancing. She kept shaking her head, but even I recognized the coy look of someone playing hard-to-get. It was obvious she secretly enjoyed his attentions.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d Dorian asked.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d I said as we finally reached the food. \u201cHe\u2019s a good kid, and at least he\u2019s relatively close to her age. Besides, now that I\u2019ve claimed the honor, I don\u2019t have to worry about her getting pregnant first.\u201d When I\u2019d first met Jasmine, she\u2019d been involved with a gentry king named Aeson and dead-set on fulfilling our father\u2019s prophecy. She, like Rurik, was someone who\u2019d undergone a change for the better.</p><p>I meant to ask Dorian about the Yew Land, but the opportunity never really presented itself. Aside from being distracted by those constantly coming up to talk to us, we were also just caught up in the festivities themselves. Both of my kingdoms, as well as Dorian\u2019s, had been living in a tense state these last few months, and it was nice to have a break from that. I laughed and cheered with the others when Rurik brought Shaya out onto the dance floor and spun her around. I watched Jasmine and Pagiel flirt with youthful innocence. I even drank some sort of sweet nectar, which the chef had sworn to me wasn\u2019t alcoholic. It was served in goblets constructed from tulips, reminding me not for the first time that my life really was a fairy tale\u2014just not always a happy one.</p><p>Dorian admired the happy, dancing couples and then gave me a knowing look. \u201cI suppose I\u2019d be wasting my time asking you to dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have more luck with one of the horses,\u201d I said.</p> <p>He chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re smaller than you think, and besides, you keep forgetting how beautiful fertility is to us\u2014not like humans, who seem ashamed of it. You\u2019ve spent too much time among them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an understatement,\u201d I teased. \u201cI\u2019ve spent most of my life with them. I can\u2019t help but think like a human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said with mock sadness. \u201cIt\u2019s a habit I keep hoping you\u2019ll shake.\u201d</p><p>I refused Dorian\u2019s further invitations to dance, but later, in watching him twirl around with other women, I realized the recent tension wasn\u2019t just between our kingdoms. Whether it was my resentment over how he\u2019d tricked me into winning the Iron Crown or simply disputes over how best to protect my twins, it seemed that Dorian and I had been bickering nonstop. It was nice to have just one evening where we were at peace with each other. I was reminded\u2014almost\u2014of how things used to be, back when we were a couple.</p><p>It was after midnight when I finally retired from the celebration. Enchanted fireflies had replaced the cherry petals, illuminating those revelers who were still going strong. I slipped away without any big good-byes because I\u2019d learned a long time ago that once you started with one, many more would follow, and it\u2019d be hours before I\u2019d actually get to bed. So, really, only my guards noticed my exit, several of them detaching and following me inside the castle.</p><p>When I reached my rooms, I saw that some helpful servant had placed Ilania\u2019s statues in there, maybe in case I wanted to decorate with them. Along with the unicorn statue I\u2019d seen earlier, there was also one comprised of five fish balanced gracefully on top of each other. I would have that one sent off to the Thorn Land, since it seemed ironic for a desert kingdom. Tomorrow would be soon enough to put the other statue in storage here, as well as give me the chance to ask Dorian about the Yew Land since I was certain he was staying over tonight. I\u2019d also have to make sure Varia got her token gifts. So much to do, but I was too exhausted to deal with any of it just yet.</p> <p>Thinking of Dorian reminded me of a comment he\u2019d made. Even though I was ready to fall over, I delayed a moment to summon Volusian to me. The room, which had moments ago been warm and cheery in the summer evening, grew cold and sinister. Volusian appeared in the darkest corner, his eyes glowing red.</p><p>\u201cMy mistress calls,\u201d he said, in his flat tone.</p><p>I stifled a yawn and sat on the bed, suddenly feeling smothered by the long dress. \u201cI need you to go to Roland whenever he\u2019s up in the morning. Ask him to come see me here when he gets time. Emphasis on the \u2018when he gets time,\u2019\u201d I warned. The last time I\u2019d sent Volusian with a request to my stepfather, the spirit had simply said, \u201cYou must come now.\u201d Roland had practically killed himself trying to get to the Otherworld, certain my death was imminent. With Volusian, one had to be specific.</p><p>\u201cAs my mistress commands,\u201d he replied. \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. That\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>I stared in astonishment, not so much because of the question itself, but because I could probably count on one hand the number of times Volusian had ever interrupted me. He tended to adhere to his servitude tenaciously (so long as my power was there to hold him) and rarely offered up anything that wasn\u2019t asked of him. Equally rare was him soliciting information that wasn\u2019t essential to his tasks. It was his way of showing how little he cared about me and my affairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s what?\u201d I asked, glancing around.</p> <p>He pointed at the two statues. \u201cThose,\u201d he declared, \u201care damarian jade.\u201d</p><p>I thought back to my conversation with Ilania. \u201cEr, yeah, I think that\u2019s what she called it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWho is she? And is she here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ambassador from the Yew Land,\u201d I said, still kind of amazed by this conversation. \u201cShe\u2019s here on behalf of her queen, Varia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVaria,\u201d he repeated. \u201cShe must be Ganene\u2019s daughter.\u201d There was something chilling about the way he said Ganene. The word dripped with venom.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cThey just brought me the statues and made an offer of friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure they would,\u201d he replied enigmatically. \u201cThey excel at that.\u201d</p><p>I stood up. \u201cVolusian, what do you know about them? Do you know how they\u2019ve got all these subjugated kingdoms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSubjugated kingdoms? No, but it seems like a reasonable idea, mistress. One you might consider.\u201d Volusian had calmed back down to his dry self, if he\u2019d ever truly been upset. It was hard to tell with him.</p><p>\u201cHave you been there?\u201d I asked. \u201cTo the Yew Land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in many, many centuries, mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about Varia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know her at all, mistress. As I said, I have not been in the Yew Land for many centuries. Much has undoubtedly changed in that wretched place.\u201d His red eyes flicked toward the statues. \u201cExcept for their abhorrent taste in art. If my mistress has need, I would gladly destroy those monstrosities and blight their unsightliness from her gaze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery kind. Why do you hate the Yew Land so much?\u201d Before he could answer, another question came to mind. \u201cVolusian, are you from the Yew Land?\u201d</p><p>He took a long time in responding. I think, had he been able, he wouldn\u2019t have answered. The binds that held him were too strong, however.</p><p>\u201cYes, mistress.\u201d</p><p>He offered no more. I could\u2019ve grilled him further but thought better of it. Volusian was an old, old spirit. Maybe he was from the Yew Land, but by his own admission, he hadn\u2019t been there in recent times, nor did he know Varia. My guess was whatever animosity he held toward that kingdom predated her and was probably of little use to me. What intrigued me, though, was that I had my first real piece of background about Volusian. I\u2019d always known he had done something terrible that had resulted in him being cursed to wander the worlds without peace. I now had a good idea of where his troubles may have started.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else, mistress?\u201d he asked when I remained quiet.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I\u2019d been lost in my own thoughts. \u201cOh, no. That\u2019s it for now.\u201d</p><p>Volusian nodded in acquiescence, then began to fade into darkness. For a moment, only his red eyes seemed to remain, but then they too disappeared in the shadows.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Life soon returned to whatever passed as normal in my world. The many guests and visitors who\u2019d arrived for the wedding dispersed to their own lands, and true to their word, Shaya and Rurik continued their duties just as before. There was little outward sign that much had changed with them, though occasionally I\u2019d catch them secretly exchanging happy looks.</p><p>One guest who didn\u2019t leave right away was Dorian. He kept saying he would. He\u2019d even make comments that began with, \u201cWell, when I leave tomorrow ...\u201d But the next day he\u2019d still be hanging around the Rowan Land. Almost a week went by before I finally brought the matter up.</p><p>I found him out in some of the woods beyond the castle. While this was still fairly secured land, I was nonetheless trailed by quiet, discreet guards who kept a distance that was respectful but still close enough to pounce, should the need arise. Dorian was engaged in a typically Dorian activity: hunting. Well, kind of. The forest clearing was littered with thin, wooden cutouts of various animals. They were life-size and painted in bright, gaudy colors. As I approached, I saw Dorian\u2019s long-suffering servant, Muran, nervously holding up a cutout of a pink stag. On the opposite side of the clearing, Dorian focused on them with razor-sharp intensity and drew back a giant longbow. There was a twang as he released, and the arrow shot forward, implanting right near the edge of the target\u2019s upper body, only a couple of inches from Muran\u2019s hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that kind of dangerous?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d said Dorian, notching another arrow. \u201cThose animals aren\u2019t real, Eugenie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d I said. \u201cThe purple polka dots were kind of a giveaway. I was talking about Muran.\u201d</p> <p>Dorian shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s still alive, isn\u2019t he?\u201d He drew back again, and this time the arrow hit the side of the stag\u2019s head, not far from Muran\u2019s own. The poor man yelped at the close call, and Dorian gave me an expectant look. \u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>I had to suppress an eye roll. Those targets were too big and Dorian too good a shot for him to be \u201caccidentally\u201d making such close calls. It was a testament to his skill that he was purposely hitting so near the edges to torment Muran.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do the rabbit next,\u201d suggested Dorian. \u201cI need more of a challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes, sire,\u201d squeaked Muran. He returned the stag to the pile of other targets and produced a yellow and green striped rabbit that was much, much smaller than the stag. After first pausing to wipe sweat off of his forehead, Muran held out the rabbit off to his side, as far away from himself as he could.</p><p>Dorian tsked. \u201cYou\u2019re tilting it. Use both hands to keep it steady.\u201d Doing so, of course, forced Muran to bring the target directly in front of him.</p> <p>I groaned. \u201cDorian, why do you do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can,\u201d he replied. He let loose an arrow and impressively hit one of the rabbit\u2019s ears, again only just missing Muran.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you think you might be able to go home?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even look at me as he sized up his next shot. \u201cAre you kicking me out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I do have to go to the Thorn Land soon and commune with it.\u201d As part of the bond between monarch and kingdom, it was necessary that I connect to the land periodically. This usually just involved me meditating for a while and reaching out to the land\u2019s energy. It was a seemingly small task, but if I didn\u2019t do it regularly, both the land and I would suffer. The longest I\u2019d gone without was about a month, and during that time, I\u2019d dreamed nonstop about the land. Possessing two kingdoms now meant twice as many meditation sessions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you don\u2019t just send your sister,\u201d Dorian said. \u201cSeeing as she\u2019s getting so good at it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t start,\u201d I said.</p><p>I was in a good mood, and the atmosphere between us had been so easy recently that I didn\u2019t even rise to the bait. Jasmine and I had discovered that as a quick fix, she could do a type of makeshift connection with the land. Someone had told me that monarchs\u2019 children occasionally did this as well in other kingdoms, so maybe the land just recognized some sort of genetic connection. Dorian feared I was opening up the door for Jasmine to conquer my kingdoms, but I was confident she\u2019d long since given up such ambitions. Besides, I\u2019d felt the connection between her and the land when she did it, and it was nothing like what I experienced. The land accepted her as a Band-Aid in my absence but never truly let her into its heart like it did for me. The land was always grateful for my return, and I too pined for it when gone.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s better if I do it myself,\u201d I told him. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m right around the corner, there\u2019s no reason not to. I mean, you\u2019re welcome to stay here if you want, I just thought ...\u201d</p><p>\u201c... that if you were leaving, there\u2019d be no reason I\u2019d want to stay?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>I shrugged. That was exactly what I\u2019d been thinking, and I now felt a little embarrassed at my presumption. For all I knew, Dorian just liked the change of scenery. I\u2019d given him no reason to want to spend extra time with me.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right,\u201d he said, hitting the rabbit\u2019s tail. \u201cPerhaps I should return home. It\u2019ll be harvest time soon.\u201d</p><p>That brought a smile to my face. \u201cIt\u2019s always harvest time.\u201d One of the perks of the Oak Land\u2019s perpetual autumn was that trees and plants that normally only bore fruit late in the year were always producing. I\u2019d seen servants pick all the apples from the trees surrounding his castle, only to find those same trees heavy with fruit again in a couple of days.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, but my people fall apart without me. You\u2019d think they would\u2019ve learned to manage after all this time, but it\u2019s still quite dreadful.\u201d He finally lowered his bow and glanced at me. \u201cYou want to take a shot?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head. \u201cThat bow\u2019s too big for me. Besides, I don\u2019t really get off on shooting animals\u2014even fake ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s preposterous. You eat them, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but there\u2019s a difference between killing them for survival and killing them for sport. I know, I know,\u201d I added, seeing him start to protest. \u201cThese aren\u2019t real, but the resemblance is close enough that when I look at them, it\u2019s still like taking joy in real animals\u2019 deaths.\u201d</p><p>Dorian looked over to where one of his personal guards stood ready and alert. \u201cAlik, would you remedy this situation? Use the stag, please.\u201d</p><p>Alik bowed. \u201cOf course, Your Majesty.\u201d He strode over to the pink stag and, to my complete astonishment, began hacking away at the stag\u2019s neck with his sword. It had the effectiveness of an ax, making me think there must be some magic afoot. That\u2019d be a difficult task with a regular sword, let alone the copper kind favored by the gentry. When Alik completed his work, we were left with a decapitated wooden pink stag.</p><p>\u201cThere we go,\u201d said Dorian, pleased. \u201cIt hardly looks real now. Is that better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know how to answer that,\u201d I replied.</p><p>Dorian beckoned me over. \u201cCome, I\u2019ll help you draw the bow. It\u2019s a noble weapon that any good queen should know how to use, regardless of intent.\u201d</p><p>To my own surprise, I complied, letting him guide my hands to hold the bow in proper position. I\u2019d practiced with smaller bows around here\u2014it was unavoidable in the Otherworld\u2014but nothing resembling this beast. Dorian stood behind me, one hand on my hip and the other on my arm to keep me in the right position.</p><p>\u201cMuran,\u201d he said. \u201cProp our headless deer friend against that maple, will you? Then keep an eye on it from over there to make sure it stays upright.\u201d</p><p>If Muran ever had any fears about his master\u2019s regard for him, they were wasted. As I\u2019d suspected before, Dorian\u2019s skill was such that his \u201cclose calls\u201d with Muran had never truly been any threat. But me and my lack of expertise? We were a different matter\u2014and a dangerous one that could result in Muran actually losing a limb if he held the target again. Dorian was now ensuring his servant stayed out of harm\u2019s way.</p><p>With Dorian\u2019s guidance, I drew back the bow. No, not guidance, exactly. Dorian was actually doing a lot of the work. This would have been a tough draw for me under the best of times, and my recent reduction in physical activity had only made me weaker. I let the arrow go, and it hit the ground before even getting close to the target. My second shot didn\u2019t do much better. By the third, my arm felt like it was ready to fall off, and I was just getting frustrated.</p><p>\u201cPatience, my sweet,\u201d Dorian told me. \u201cThis is just something that takes practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the practice in the world won\u2019t help,\u201d I grumbled, feeling petulant. \u201cNot so long as I\u2019m incapacitated.\u201d</p><p>Dorian snorted. \u201cYou? Hardly. Now, that deer, yes, he\u2019s incapacitated. But I recall seeing you dispatch some wraiths a couple weeks ago. Anyone who witnessed that, including those miserable creatures, would hardly say you were incapacitated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was kind of badass,\u201d I admitted, lowering the bow. \u201cI just don\u2019t have much patience for this ... state I\u2019m in.\u201d Apparently, \u201cstate\u201d would continue to be the best way to describe my pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cThat \u2018state\u2019 will be over before you know it.\u201d Dorian took the bow from me and passed it off to a servant. \u201cAnd until then, you\u2019re much more capable of things than you give yourself credit for. Once your little world-conquering bundles of joy are born, we\u2019ll train you up to be the best bow-woman in this world.\u201d</p><p>His bravado made me smile again, and I felt a little silly for my whining. Hopefully, it was just more I could blame on hormones. Inspiration hit me, and I straightened up proudly. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons. I\u2019m already the best shot in this world. And in the others.\u201d</p><p>Dorian arched an eyebrow. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>I glanced over at my fallen arrows and summoned the air currents around them. The air was quick to obey me and lifted the arrows off the ground. One quick motion, and they shot off toward the stag like rockets, embedding themselves in what would have been the poor creature\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cMagnificent,\u201d laughed Dorian, clapping his hands. \u201cYou really are a natural.\u201d</p><p>I returned his grin, delighted with my triumph and with ... well, this. This small moment out in the sunny spring day. This small moment ... with him. I met his eyes, momentarily caught up in the shades of green that played throughout them, rivaling the leaves that gently rustled around us.</p><p>\u201cEugenie?\u201d</p><p>Whatever else might have passed in that moment was lost as I turned and saw Roland Markham approaching with a group of Rowan soldiers. Dorian was forgotten as I hurried over and hugged my stepfather.</p><p>\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d said one of the soldiers. \u201cRoland Storm Slayer is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see,\u201d I said. If there was anyone the gentry regarded with as much awe as the mother of Storm King\u2019s heir, it was Roland. He had rescued my mother when she\u2019d been abducted to the Otherworld. Later, when Storm King came seeking her and me, Roland had finally put an end to my biological father once and for all. Killing the Otherworld\u2019s most powerful, notorious warlord in recent history earned a lot of respect\u2014and wariness. Roland was oblivious to it all, however. In truth, he disliked coming to the Otherworld and had vowed never to return after rescuing my mother. It was only because of me and the dangers I now faced crossing worlds that he had consented to come back. He was incredibly uneasy each time he did, though, and his own nerves distracted him too much to see the nervousness in others here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou look good,\u201d Roland said, giving me a head-to-toe assessment. He would never let on to it in front of everyone else, but I knew he was checking me for scrapes and bruises the same as he would if I was ten years old. Whenever he was in the Otherworld, he also had a tendency to ignore everyone else and only talk to me.</p><p>\u201cSo do you,\u201d I said. Roland had gone gray but was still lean and muscled, ready for anything that came his way. Tattoos of whorls and fishes adorned his arms, and I took comfort in their familiarity.</p><p>\u201cYour, uh, creature said you wanted to talk to me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d Glancing around, I saw that between my soldiers, Dorian\u2019s guards, and Roland\u2019s escort, we\u2019d gathered quite a crowd. Dorian followed my gaze and guessed my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should go inside where we can speak more privately,\u201d he said, automatically inviting himself along. A glint of surprise flashed in Roland\u2019s eyes, but there was no real reason Dorian couldn\u2019t hear what was being discussed.</p><p>\u201cI went to your other place first,\u201d Roland told me as we walked toward the castle. \u201cThe guards there explained where you were at and brought me here.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help a smile at his use of \u201cyour other place.\u201d The idea of me being a queen was still unsettling for Roland, and he couldn\u2019t quite bring himself to say \u201cyour kingdom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re fortunate,\u201d said Dorian. \u201cThis is a much more pleasant land to meet in than that desert wasteland Eugenie usually prefers to spend her time in.\u201d</p><p>Roland glanced around, taking in the lush greenery, warm breezes, and singing birds. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I like the other one better. This one\u2019s kind of boring.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTypical,\u201d scoffed Dorian. \u201cLike father, like daughter.\u201d</p><p>Roland wouldn\u2019t admit as much in mixed company, but I knew the comment pleased him. If things hadn\u2019t turned out as they had with my Otherworldly involvement, Roland would\u2019ve been content to ignore my biological heritage for the rest of my life. Blood and the Storm King prophecy meant nothing to him. I had been Roland\u2019s daughter for years, and as far as he was concerned, that\u2019s how it still was.</p><p>The three of us sat down in a small parlor that still bore the signs of its previous owner\u2019s taste in decorating, mainly a lot of doilies and paisley prints. Being \u201ctrapped\u201d indoors made Roland uneasy, and he shifted uncomfortably, literally on the edge of his lion-footed velvet chair. Quickly, I explained to him what had happened in Ohio. As he listened, his face grew darker, and all his discomfort at being behind gentry walls faded as his concern shifted to me.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019d had such a good feeling about that one too. How did they find it? There\u2019s no way they can have spies in every part of our world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re pretty good at having spies everywhere in this world,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cWe know they regularly watch the borders of my kingdoms\u2014and Dorian\u2019s\u2014to track my movements. I\u2019m just usually too well guarded for them to do anything. My guess is someone tracked me to the gate that led to Hudson, and from there, they just staked the town out until they figured out my patterns.\u201d It still irked me that pulling that off was something Mainwenn and Kiyo\u2019s spies would\u2019ve had to have done over a long period of time\u2014and I\u2019d never noticed.</p><p>\u201cSo we need to find another doctor,\u201d said Roland. I could already see the wheels spinning in his head as he assessed various locations and what he knew of their Otherworldly connections.</p> <p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s up for debate,\u201d interjected Dorian. \u201cThese human doctors keep telling her she\u2019s fine and healthy. Why does she need to keep seeing them then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo ensure she stays healthy,\u201d said Roland evenly. \u201cNo offense, but I\u2019m not leaving her in the hands of your medieval medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt Eugenie appreciates the thought of any of us making decisions for her.\u201d That almost made me scoff. Dorian was notorious for making \u201chelpful\u201d decisions on my behalf, so it was comical that he\u2019d now take the high ground about my independence.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d I said. \u201cBoth of you. Dorian has a point\u2014I have been getting healthy reports. But ... it\u2019s hard for me to entirely let go of modern medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Modern\u2019 indeed,\u201d said Dorian dismissively.</p><p>\u201cEasy enough to talk healthy now,\u201d said Roland. \u201cBut childbirth\u2019s an entirely different matter. You\u2019ll want our doctors then. You don\u2019t know what can happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven birth to lots of children, have you?\u201d asked Dorian.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your infant mortality rate around here?\u201d returned Roland. I saw Dorian flinch ever so slightly. Once they were adults, gentry were extremely healthy and hard to kill. Infants were another matter, and that\u2014coupled with the difficulties gentry had conceiving\u2014made having children in general pretty difficult.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s irrelevant if she gets herself killed with all this world crossing!\u201d exclaimed Dorian in a rare show of frustration. \u201cIf she stays put here and doesn\u2019t venture out of her lands, she\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p><p>I could see Roland starting to get almost as worked up as Dorian. \u201cPutting aside the medical part for a moment, she\u2019s hardly safe with her enemies right on her doorstep. Even if she is in her own \u2018lands,\u2019 how long do you think those bastards will leave her alone once they realize she\u2019s holing up here?\u201d The \u201cright on her doorstep\u201d part reminded me of Ilania\u2019s invitation to the Yew Land and arguments about how I\u2019d be safer once I wasn\u2019t actually sharing borders with Maiwenn. I had no intention of accepting that invitation, but Roland\u2019s words still drove home the same truth. Staying here might not be wise either.</p><p>I expected Dorian to come back with one of his stinging remarks and escalate things further with Roland. It was simply Dorian\u2019s nature, plus this was an issue he felt passionately about. I was about to silence them both when Dorian took a deep breath and said, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to pick a fight with you. I respect you too much, and at the heart of this, our goals are the same. We both just want her safe.\u201d</p><p>Roland\u2019s blue eyes narrowed as he sized Dorian up. I caught my breath, wondering what Roland\u2019s response would be. Agreeing with a gentry was not his normal operating procedure.</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Roland said at last. \u201cWe do want the same thing. Arguing methods is counterproductive.\u201d</p><p>I exhaled and stared at both men in astonishment. Contrary Dorian and stubborn Roland ... in agreement? If not for the fact that threats on my life were the source of their accord, I would\u2019ve reveled in this as a landmark moment of gentry and human peace. Unsurprisingly, this tranquil interlude couldn\u2019t last. Guards burst into the room, with Pagiel right beside them. It was almost a repeat of last week at Dorian\u2019s, and I half expected Ysabel to be in tow, ready with some new bitchy comment. Pagiel\u2019s expression told me, however, that something much direr was at stake.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Dorian and I asked in unison.</p><p>Pagiel\u2019s face grew grim, and I had a feeling he was trying very hard to behave in a calm and controlled manner. A glint in his eye suggested his outrage was so great that he just wanted to burst out with it. \u201cAnsonia,\u201d he said.</p><p>I cast a quick, questioning glance at Dorian to see if this made any sense to him. His puzzled look said he was just as much in the dark as I was. Pagiel\u2019s sister had left shortly after the wedding, and I\u2019d hardly talked to her while she was here.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cShe was attacked this morning by Willow Land riders on the outskirts of the Oak Land, on her way to see our grandmother.\u201d</p><p>That got Dorian\u2019s attention. He leaned forward. \u201cThe Oak Land? My Oak Land?\u201d As if there was any other.</p><p>\u201cWas she alone?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Dorian stood up, his face as furious as Pagiel\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s irrelevant. Alone or not, a young girl should be able to ride the length and breadth of my kingdom without feeling threatened by any brigand\u2014let alone militants from another kingdom! Maiwenn has gone too far. This is an act of war! This is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the girl okay?\u201d asked Roland, his quiet voice cutting through Dorian\u2019s outrage. At first, Dorian looked offended at the interruption, but then he\u2014like me\u2014seemed to realize that we all probably should\u2019ve asked that immediately.</p><p>Pagiel nodded and took another steadying breath before continuing. \u201cShe\u2019s with a healer now and is recovering. Maiwenn\u2019s people beat her up pretty badly but were interrupted when some passing merchants noticed what was happening. By that point, the attackers realized they\u2019d made a mistake and were ready to flee anyway.\u201d</p><p>Something twisted in the pit of my stomach. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018made a mistake\u2019? What was their intent?\u201d</p><p>Pagiel\u2019s face was still hard and angry, but I was pretty sure I caught the faintest glimpse of apology in his eyes at what he had to say next. \u201cThey had no actual interest in her personally, Your Majesty. They attacked her because ... because they thought she was you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Whatever look came over my face, it was enough to finally crack Pagiel\u2019s anger. He blanched and hurried forward, falling to his knees. \u201cYour Majesty, I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have said anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d I said, putting out a hand to stop him. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d His words had stunned me, making everything I said and did sluggish. I felt as if I were moving underwater.</p><p>Dorian gave me a sharp look. \u201cNeither did you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cThat poor girl was beaten because of me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot because of you. Because of them. Although ...\u201d He shrugged, his expression considering. \u201cWhen I think about it, I suppose there is a remarkable resemblance between the two of you. An easy\u2014if stupid\u2014mistake.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t help,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cNot one bit. All that means is that every girl in our kingdoms with hair like mine now needs to watch her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were fools to do this,\u201d declared Dorian. \u201cNot just because of the violation of my land, but also because they should\u2019ve known you wouldn\u2019t travel alone. If any one of them had half a brain, they would\u2019ve deduced right away that they had the wrong girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet that changes nothing.\u201d I sighed and turned back to where a worried Pagiel still knelt before me. \u201cGet up,\u201d I told him. \u201cWhere is she now? You said she was with a healer. In the Oak Land?\u201d</p> <p>Pagiel got to his feet. \u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should go see her,\u201d I murmured, more to myself than anyone else.</p><p>Dorian scoffed. \u201cOh, yes. That will certainly improve the situation. Go take a jaunt between kingdoms. Expose yourself to more risk.\u201d</p><p>My temper flared. \u201cWhat else do you expect me to\u2014\u201d I bit my lip on any other angry protests as I reminded myself we had an audience. Swallowing back all the things I wanted to say to Dorian, I attempted to put on as calm a look as I could for Pagiel. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry this happened to Ansonia. I can\u2019t promise immediate retribution for it, but I can promise you it won\u2019t ever happen again.\u201d</p><p>Pagiel nodded, his face growing fierce once more. \u201cI understand. But if you do strike back at some point\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you can definitely be part of it,\u201d I finished, guessing what he was going to ask. I didn\u2019t like to encourage revenge, especially in someone so young, but he was certainly entitled to his outrage. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know. In the meantime, go back to Ansonia. If there\u2019s anything she needs, anything at all, just have her ask Dorian\u2019s staff and they\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d I felt no moral qualms about speaking for Dorian, especially since he ordered my own people around half the time too.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Your Majesty.\u201d Pagiel glanced at Dorian. \u201cYour Majesties. I believe my mother is, uh, already working with the servants to ensure Ansonia is comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Oh, I didn\u2019t doubt that in the least. A pang of regret struck me as I recalled that last antagonistic meeting with Ysabel. I\u2019d been semi-sympathetic to her concerns for Pagiel but had mostly treated her as though she was behaving in a hysterical and exaggerated manner. Whatever she was doing now, no one could accuse her of overreacting. Her daughter\u2019s life had been wrongfully threatened.</p><p>After a few more conciliatory words from us, Pagiel and the guards who\u2019d entered with him finally left. Once I was alone with Dorian and Roland again, I stood up to walk off my frustration. I paused at the room\u2019s window, looking out at the idyllic green grounds below. The Rowan Land looked more like a fairyland than ever before when seen from afar. One didn\u2019t notice all the danger and turmoil from this high up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up, my dear,\u201d said Dorian, watching me pace. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you could\u2019ve done. The question is: what are you going to do now?\u201d</p><p>I glanced back at him in alarm. \u201cWhat are you going to do? You weren\u2019t serious about this being an act of war, were you? I mean, we\u2019re already kind of at war, but there\u2019s no need for some drastic retaliation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s need for something drastic,\u201d countered Dorian. \u201cReally, Pagiel\u2019s interruption follows quite nicely on the heels of what we\u2019d just been discussing. They have us running and slinking in the shadows. Are you really going to do this for the rest of your pregnancy? Are you going to do this after your children are born?\u201d</p><p>I threw up my hands. \u201cWhat else is there to do? Are you proposing some invasion of Maiwenn\u2019s land?\u201d</p><p>Dorian looked remarkably calm, considering the topic. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be unfounded. And it would certainly send a message that they can\u2019t keep pushing us around. I don\u2019t suppose it\u2019s occurred to you that maybe attacking young Ansonia wasn\u2019t a mistake on their part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would make you say that?\u201d I came back over to stand in front of him. Roland watched our exchange in silence. \u201cShe has nothing to do with any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d said Dorian. \u201cAnd the next girl attacked won\u2019t either. Or the next.\u201d</p><p>I could hardly believe what I was hearing. \u201cYou\u2019re saying they\u2019re purposely attacking girls who look like me? Even though they know it\u2019s in error?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying for sure that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. But it would be an excellent ploy to turn your\u2014our\u2014own people against us, if they feel they\u2019re being unjustly targeted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSending our people to war would put a lot more of them in danger,\u201d I pointed out. Five years ago, I never would have dreamed I\u2019d be having these sorts of discussions.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Dorian. \u201cBut danger\u2019s a lot easier to face when you\u2019re initiating it on your terms, as opposed to exposing yourself to victimization.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey already went to war once for me. I\u2019m not going to let it happen again,\u201d I said adamantly. Last year, Leith\u2014the former Rowan queen\u2019s son\u2014had taken it upon himself to become the father of Storm King\u2019s heir, whether I consented or not. During my rescue, Dorian had then taken it upon himself to punish Leith\u2014by impaling the prince on a sword. Katrice hadn\u2019t taken that news well, starting a war between us that had eventually led to me inheriting this kingdom. I\u2019d hated every minute of that war and had been wracked with guilt over the thought of soldiers dying for me, no matter how many times I\u2019d been assured that my people were willing to defend my honor.</p><p>Dorian\u2019s look wasn\u2019t unsympathetic, but it wasn\u2019t exactly warm and friendly either. \u201cWar may be on you again, whether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d I said, raking a hand through my hair. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about the nobility of war anymore. Ansonia survived, which is what counts. We\u2019ll deal with the rest later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put it off too long,\u201d Dorian warned. \u201cOr you may find others making decisions for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said.</p><p>What I didn\u2019t add was that I had no intention of letting any more decisions be made without me, nor would I allow any other girls to be hurt on my behalf. An idea was forming in the back of my mind, one I was pretty sure Dorian wouldn\u2019t like. It created a hollow feeling inside me, but from the moment Pagiel had told us about Ansonia, I\u2019d known I had to take drastic action\u2014and not the kind Dorian was suggesting. The answer was so simple, I couldn\u2019t believe it had never occurred to me before. With an expression as convincingly bland as one of Dorian\u2019s, I glanced over at Roland. \u201cLet\u2019s go figure out where my next doctor\u2019s going to be. At least that\u2019s a relatively simple matter.\u201d</p><p>Dorian scoffed. \u201cA foolish matter, you mean.\u201d But he made no attempts to go with Roland and me, just as I\u2019d thought. He and Roland did exchange very nice, very polite farewells, which I took as a positive sign, considering their past interactions. I wondered how polite things would stay between them if the plan I was formulating actually came to pass.</p><p>\u201cNasty business back there,\u201d said Roland, speaking up at last. We were almost to the castle\u2019s exit, and I think he felt more at ease now that he was nearly free of the walls. \u201cNo easy answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>\u201cHow old is this girl you were talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little younger than her brother. That\u2019s Pagiel\u2014the one you just saw.\u201d I didn\u2019t bother correcting for the rate at which gentry aged compared to humans. Roland would understand.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a dirty feel to all of it,\u201d said Roland. He scowled. \u201cAttacking pregnant women, attacking children. I wish you weren\u2019t involved in any of it.\u201d</p><p>We passed through the gates, back toward the lush grounds that had held the wedding. Two guards silently detached from a group near the door and followed me, keeping that respectful distance they excelled at.</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us,\u201d I said. \u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019m not just involved\u2014I\u2019m at the heart of it.\u201d</p><p>I led us out to a cluster of hazel trees and settled down there on the grass. Roland looked surprised at the choice but quickly joined me. The guards, assessing the situation, chose sentry spots that maintained my privacy but would allow them quick access should a bunch of monkey assassins sent by Maiwenn leap down from the trees. Satisfied the guards were out of earshot, I leaned close to Roland and pitched my voice low, just to be safe. As my hands rested on the sun-warmed grass, I felt the Rowan Land sing to me, happy and content.</p><p>\u201cI hate to admit it, but Dorian\u2019s right about a couple of things. It seems crazy, but this could become a regular tactic of Maiwenn\u2019s. And he\u2019s also right that me jumping between kingdoms and worlds just exposes me to further attacks.\u201d I tipped my head back, taking in the scent of honeysuckle. I couldn\u2019t see it from where I sat, but my senses were always attuned to the land\u2019s various stimuli. \u201cI was recently approached by an ambassador from a far-off kingdom, who invited me to come hide out with them. They promised security. Their argument was that I\u2019d be away from my enemies\u2019 lands and could avoid all the crisscrossing if I just stayed in seclusion within their borders.\u201d</p><p>Roland\u2019s gray eyebrows rose. \u201cAnd you\u2019re thinking of doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cCertainly not with them, at least. I was thinking ... I was thinking that maybe the place where I really need to hide and stay put is in the human world.\u201d The full weight of it didn\u2019t really hit me until I spoke those words. From Roland\u2019s expression, I could tell that he understood what a huge thing this was that I was suggesting.</p><p>\u201cSo not in Tucson,\u201d he said, after several thoughtful moments.</p><p>\u201cNot in Tucson,\u201d I agreed, not entirely able to hide my regret over that. \u201cIt\u2019d be the first place they\u2019d look. But I have to assume that somewhere, in all the safe places you\u2019ve come up with for medical care ... well, somewhere there must be a place where I could hide and live a \u2018normal\u2019 life until the twins are born.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded slowly. \u201cI can think of a couple of places, but if you did this ... I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong. There\u2019s nothing I\u2019d like better than to get you out of this cursed place. But do you know what you\u2019re truly asking? If you want to hide out back in our world, then you can\u2019t do anything that would risk detection. You can\u2019t use your gentry magic. You can\u2019t even use your shamanic magic. Any of that could alert some Otherworldly creature wandering our world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d I said. That hollow feeling within me intensified.</p><p>A faint smile lit his features. \u201cI know you do\u2014in theory. What I worry about is that you\u2019re going to stumble across some poor person being tormented by a ghost and do a banishing without thinking twice. It\u2019s not easy for you to stand by while others suffer.\u201d He gestured around us. \u201cCase in point.\u201d</p> <p>I stared off, knowing he was right. Could I do what I was proposing? Without me realizing it, my hand had moved protectively to my stomach. I could do it for them, I decided. I could do it for all the innocents in Dorian\u2019s kingdom and my own. Better to ignore a haunting, I thought, than to allow others to die for a prophecy that probably wasn\u2019t even real.</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cI understand. I\u2019ll do it\u2014or rather, not do anything.\u201d</p><p>Roland studied me for a few more seconds and seemed satisfied with what he saw. \u201cWhat about all of this? Don\u2019t you need to have some kind of regular bonding with this place ... and the other one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s probably going to be the trickiest part here. Jasmine can do a few quick fixes to tide the land over. I don\u2019t know how long the land will accept her, though. If it can\u2019t ... then, well, I\u2019ll have to come back or else I\u2019ll have caused suffering of a different type. The land will wither otherwise. But, if she and the land can manage it until the end of my pregnancy, I\u2019ll just be the only one who suffers. Being away from the land affects me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the sound of that,\u201d he said darkly.</p> <p>I smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s nothing physical or dangerous. . . just an intense longing. Like caffeine withdrawal.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cI doubt it\u2019s that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut what about the rest? You said you\u2019ve got a few places in mind that I could go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, though I\u2019ll need to make some queries first.\u201d In a rare show of affection, he rested his hand on mine. \u201cI wish I could just take you home with me. I\u2019d feel better if you were always in my sight.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed his hand back. \u201cEven you couldn\u2019t take on a gentry army knocking on your door. And we can\u2019t risk Mom.\u201d I didn\u2019t add that if this plan worked out, Roland couldn\u2019t see me at all. Wherever I ended up hiding, I\u2019d have to stay there with no connection to my loved ones. Roland and my mother would undoubtedly be watched. Meeting his blue eyes, I knew he\u2019d already thought of this. He didn\u2019t like it, but he\u2019d agree to it.</p><p>After a bit more discussion, Roland was ready to leave and begin his search. That was his way. If there was a problem to be solved, he didn\u2019t want to delay. He wanted to get right on it and take care of business. Now that we\u2019d reached this decision, he was anxious to get me out of the Otherworld and into safety. Once he left, it was time for me to begin my own preparations, starting with the most important piece\u2014Jasmine.</p> <p>I found her in a nearby rose garden, curled up on a bench with some magazines she\u2019d procured from a recent trip to the human world. After first swearing her to secrecy, I explained the plan Roland and I had concocted. Her reaction wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d expected.</p><p>\u201cTake me with you,\u201d she said immediately.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point. I need you here. You\u2019re the only person who can cover for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the only one who can really protect you out there,\u201d she insisted. After a moment, she made a small concession. \u201cWell, maybe Pagiel too.\u201d</p><p>I had to work hard to keep my face serious. It was almost cute how she was convinced that out of all the powerful gentry around here, many capable of miraculous feats, only two teenagers could adequately watch over me.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t come. No one I know can, that\u2019s the point. I can\u2019t even tell anyone where I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit,\u201d she said. The profanity was an amusing contrast to her otherwise ladylike appearance, complete with a flowing ivory gown and flower-bedecked hair. \u201cHow will we know you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t, but if we can maintain obscurity and anonymity, you can be ninety-nine percent sure I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t like that. She didn\u2019t like any of that. Seeing how fiercely she wanted to protect me, I marveled at how Dorian continually worried about her wanting to steal power from me. If that had been her intent, you\u2019d think she would jump at the chance to become the lands\u2019 caretaker. Instead, she made it passionately clear she only wanted to be by my side.</p><p>But finally, after hashing out the same points I\u2019d just made with Roland and Dorian, I was able to convince her. I think the attack on Ansonia helped her accept the decision a little more easily. In growing close to Pagiel, Jasmine had gotten to know his sister as well. Jasmine was as outraged as the rest of us over the attack and didn\u2019t want to see any repeats.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d she said at long last. \u201cI don\u2019t want to, but I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. That means a lot.\u201d I had to repress the urge to hug her. No matter how close we\u2019d gotten, our sisterly relationship hadn\u2019t quite crossed into great shows of physical affection.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cAh, well. This is nothing. You\u2019ve got a lot worse ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d She gave me a sympathetic look. \u201cI sure wouldn\u2019t want to be you when you tell Dorian.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>That made two of us. That realization had been building within me this entire time: I would have to tell him. No one else really needed to be informed. One well-timed crossing to the human world, and no one here would be able to find me. Jasmine could do damage control afterward, telling my staff I was gone. Both kingdoms had seneschals to handle the day-to-day affairs, and everyone was used to Jasmine and Shaya assuming control when I wasn\u2019t around. They\u2019d all be shocked, but they\u2019d adapt.</p><p>But Dorian? He was an entirely different matter. No matter what had gone down in our past, there was no way I couldn\u2019t give him a heads-up that I was about to disappear for a while.</p><p>Nonetheless, I put off delivering the news for as long as I could in the following days. He kept hanging around the Rowan Land, and I no longer bothered him about returning to his own home\u2014which normally would\u2019ve tipped him off that something was afoot. Instead, he reveled in our time together and was an endless source of funny recreational ideas that made target practice on pastel wooden animals seem downright mundane. And without contact from Roland, it was even easier to procrastinate with telling Dorian the news. I simply had no news to tell.</p><p>Aside from the constant attempts at entertainment, Dorian also decided he would educate himself on the technicalities of labor and delivery in the human world. Considering my own haphazard knowledge of such matters, I wasn\u2019t sure I was the best source, but he insisted that if I was going to keep touting the need for a human doctor, he needed to understand why.</p><p>\u201cSo what exactly do they do when you have these doctor\u2019s visits?\u201d Dorian asked. \u201cThey seem pretty frequent.\u201d</p><p>We were outside, taking in the nice weather, about a week after I\u2019d last seen Roland. \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cthey, um, check my vitals. Like blood pressure and stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood pressure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like your pulse. But kind of not,\u201d I said lamely. Yeah. I really wasn\u2019t the best person to be explaining medical lingo.</p><p>Dorian leaned back against a tree. \u201cWell, any of our healers could do that for you. I could do it for you even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that. And sometimes, I have ultrasounds at my appointments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUltrasounds?\u201d</p><p>And so went the rest of our conversation, with me having to constantly stop and explain what I\u2019d just said. Each time, Dorian had some gentry equivalent for whatever I described. Some were more far-fetched than others, like when he said he was certain gorging on cake all day would achieve the same results as a blood-sugar test. He also had a very complicated explanation about how balancing a chicken in a tree was a well-established gentry method of determining gender. I was almost certain he knew there was no real equivalent to half the things I told him about and that he was making most of this up on the spot. He was simply trying to entertain me with the outlandish. Describing a C-section, however, brought his quips to a halt.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know what to say about that,\u201d he told me honestly. \u201cIt seems very extreme. And dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe here it would be,\u201d I said, thinking of the gentry aversion to metal. A scalpel might as well be a sword. \u201cAmong humans, it\u2019s a pretty safe and standard thing. Saves a lot of lives\u2014though I\u2019d rather avoid it if I can. I don\u2019t want a scar.\u201d</p><p>Dorian considered. \u201cActually, that\u2019s the only part I can understand. Why not wear a scar of motherhood? Better than a tattoo or some other mark of honor. Let the world know what you\u2019ve achieved.\u201d</p><p>I stretched out on my side in the grass. \u201cI\u2019d rather just let the kids speak for themselves.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and let the subject go. \u201cThere\u2019ve been no more attacks on Eugenie lookalikes, by the way. It seems Maiwenn has more restraint than we thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d I said. The guilt over Ansonia still haunted me. \u201cBeyond good. So you don\u2019t need to raze her kingdom just yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite yet, no. Though I nearly would for what she\u2019s put you through.\u201d I think he meant it. After all, he\u2019d once run a guy through to defend my honor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m still doing okay.

It\u2019s not just your body I want safe. I also want you to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>Whatever he wanted was lost as a guard came and announced that Roland was here. The lazy, funny atmosphere with Dorian vanished. A mix of emotions warred within me as I realized what this meant. My days of procrastination were over. Part of me was happy to finally get things rolling. It would ensure the greater good for everyone. The rest of me\u2014the cowardly part\u2014dreaded the consequences that would soon unfold. Dorian wore a kind, sincere look, and I could barely meet his eyes as I mumbled an apology and hurried off to talk to Roland.</p> <p>\u201cYou found a place,\u201d I said, once Roland and I were alone.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d He glanced around nervously. I\u2019d taken him to my bedroom, not wanting to risk even my discreet bodyguards overhearing something. Still, Roland regarded the room as suspect, as though perhaps there were magical ears within the walls. \u201cThough I\u2019d rather not tell you where until the last minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fair,\u201d I said, despite the curiosity that burned within me.</p><p>\u201cI can tell you that it\u2019s a town that has a shaman on hand\u2014and old friend of mine that I trust implicitly. She doesn\u2019t know your exact story, of course, but she understands there\u2019s some danger. She\u2019s more than willing to defend you if necessary.\u201d He smiled wryly. \u201cAnd hopefully she\u2019ll remove any temptation you have to do shamanic housecleaning. You see something going on, you just tell her.\u201d</p><p>The next most complicated part was figuring out how to get me to this secret location. The Otherworld lined up with the human world in a very rough way. It wasn\u2019t an exact match, but gates had a geographic similarity. For example, there was a favorite crossing spot of mine in the Thorn Land that led back to Tucson. One kingdom over, in Dorian\u2019s land, there was a gate that opened in New Mexico. Another nearby one went to Texas. That\u2019s how it was in this region of the Otherworld; most crossings led to the American Southwest. That was why I\u2019d had to travel to the Honeysuckle Land to reach the Ohio gate. Roland didn\u2019t elaborate, but from what I could gather, his safe house was not in the Southwest, meaning I\u2019d have to travel far in either this world or the human one.</p> <p>We worked out a reasonably convoluted plan, and then he left again in that way of his, off to make sure everything was in place back on the other side. The plan was for me to leave tomorrow, which was frighteningly close. But in this situation ... well, the sooner things were implemented, the better.</p><p>That evening, not long after Roland had departed, I received a message from one of my servants that Dorian wished to see me in his chambers. I almost laughed at that. It was so typical of him to send me a summons in my own castle, as though he were the ruler here, not me. On the other hand, I wondered with dread what this could be about. Despite all our precautions, had he somehow found out about my plan with Roland? Had Jasmine cracked? Had there been magical ears in the walls after all?</p><p>Entering Dorian\u2019s rooms, I found nothing so sinister. Like most of the larger guest suites in the castle, his consisted of a separate bedroom and sitting chamber. The latter had been arranged with an elaborate table for two, complete with a gold silk tablecloth and candelabra featuring a weird, branching style that seemed to defy all laws of physics. Under normal circumstances, a setup like this would\u2019ve instantly made alarms go off in my head as I tried to figure out what ploy Dorian had going on. My anxiety over tomorrow\u2019s adventure, however, superseded my normal wariness.</p><p>He was already seated and gestured me to the chair opposite him. He eyed me as I sat. \u201cI\u2019d so been hoping you\u2019d wear something a bit more formal. Velvet and lace, perhaps. With a plunging neckline, naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d I said. I was in jeans and a T-shirt that was one size larger than what I used to wear, no thanks to my expanding waist. \u201cMaybe next time you should let me know this is a formal occasion.\u201d A servant swept in through the door I\u2019d just entered, no doubt having waited until my arrival. He set down a platter of quichelike tarts and then scurried off. \u201cWhat is the occasion anyway?\u201d</p><p>Dorian sighed dramatically. \u201cA sad one, I\u2019m afraid. Tomorrow. . . I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are?\u201d For a moment, hope surged in me as I toyed with the idea of sneaking off when he wasn\u2019t even around. I wouldn\u2019t have to tell him my plans at all.</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d He swirled around a glass of red wine. For once, he hadn\u2019t harassed me about drinking any. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed my time here in your delightful company, but it\u2019s time I look to my own kingdom. I also intend to increase security near my borders to discourage that bitch from taking liberties with my people again. Just in case.\u201d \u201cThat bitch,\u201d of course, was Maiwenn.</p><p>I picked up one of the quiches. It was heavy with cheese, just the way I loved them. \u201cYou just said earlier that you thought she had restraint and wouldn\u2019t attack again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cI think her people truly did act in error with Ansonia. Even if they didn\u2019t, maybe she decided using a scare tactic that attacks innocents is too savage. But it doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019ve stopped or not. There was still an incursion on my land, and I have to show I won\u2019t allow it again. Maybe I won\u2019t raze her lands, but I\u2019ll certainly protect mine.\u201d</p><p>The mention of \u201cinnocents\u201d made me think of Kiyo. He hadn\u2019t hesitated to come after the innocents that were his own children, but I could see him being responsible for preventing further mix-ups from Maiwenn\u2019s people. I was certain he would put a halt to a scare tactic that would endanger those not involved in our dispute. I didn\u2019t want to think well of him, not after everything that had happened, but I knew his style.</p><p>Course after course of succulent finger foods came, and we were eating olives stuffed with herbs when Dorian said, \u201cI have another surprise for you.\u201d As though on cue, two servants entered. Between them, they were carrying ... a crib.</p><p>I jumped up before they even had a chance to leave. I stared at the crib in wonder. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d asked Dorian, looking very pleased. \u201cYour little warriors need a place to sleep, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p> <p>I supposed they did, but I honestly hadn\u2019t given it much thought. Nursery d\u00e9cor and baby registries had been kind of the last things on my mind. I ran my hand along the smooth surface of one of the rails. The entire thing had been carved out of golden oak and polished to brilliance. Elaborate designs of animals and plants had been worked into the wood with painstaking care. Knowing what I did about the gentry, I didn\u2019t doubt that most of this had been made by hand.</p><p>\u201cThis is ... exquisite,\u201d I said at last.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another one coming, but it\u2019s still in progress. I wanted to show you this one before I left and see if you approved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... yes. How could I not?\u201d I was still in awe at the gift and felt a lump forming in my throat. Whether my emotion was from the thought of a tiny sleeping form inside that crib or simply because of Dorian\u2019s kindness, I really couldn\u2019t say.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d he said, pouring more wine. \u201cI suppose we\u2019ll have to have a number of them made, eh? No doubt you\u2019ll be hauling those poor children around to both your kingdoms\u2014and to mine, of course. I can hardly spoil them if they don\u2019t visit.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and muttered something in the affirmative. We finished that course, but I was still too overwhelmed to say much that was comprehensible. The last serving of the night was dessert, and I could scarcely believe my eyes when I saw it. It was an elaborate chocolate cake, artfully decorated in the kind of fanciful icing designs the gentry loved. Hazelnuts and chocolate shavings added to the aesthetics, along with ...</p><p>\u201cAre those ... are those pieces of Milky Way?\u201d Even before the words were out of my mouth, I knew I was right. Chopped up and worked in with the rest of the confectionary wonder were bits of my favorite candy bar. \u201cHow on earth did you get those?\u201d Even the gentry had magical limits.</p><p>\u201cYoung Pagiel acquired some on a recent jaunt to the human world. I remembered how you\u2019d been wanting some.\u201d Some warning in my brain said I should be alarmed that Pagiel had made an unauthorized crossing and had managed to \u201cacquire\u201d human goods. I wasn\u2019t optimistic about his cash resources. \u201cServing them as-is seemed so primitive, so I had the cook find a more elegant method of preparing them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you did this.\u201d I watched as Dorian sliced the cake, thinking it was a shame to mar such beauty. \u201cWhy ... why did you? What do you want?\u201d</p><p>Dorian set a piece of cake on my plate and gave me a look that seemed legitimately perplexed. \u201cNothing. Well, except to make things pleasant between us again. As I was starting to tell you earlier, I want more than your safety. I want you to be happy. I feel justified in most of my actions\u2014most. There are some affairs I haven\u2019t treated you well in, and I want to rectify that. This cake is by no means the answer, but if we could manage any sort of trust again ...\u201d He glanced away briefly, displaying a vulnerability I hardly ever saw in him. \u201cWell. That would make me happier than you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>Tears threatened to well up in my eyes. Fucking hormones. I cast a quick glance at the crib before returning to the cake again. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. \u201cI-I\u2019m leaving,\u201d I blurted out. \u201cI\u2019m leaving the Otherworld.\u201d</p><p>Dorian\u2019s face didn\u2019t alter in expression as he studied me. \u201cOh? You found some acceptable but dubiously safe new doctor? I\u2019m telling you, the chicken would be much simpler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, feeling miserable. If we could manage any sort of trust again, that would make me happier than you can imagine. Why had he said that, of all things? \u201cFor good. Or, well, for a while.\u201d I explained to him what I\u2019d worked out with Roland, and throughout it all, Dorian\u2019s face still remained damnably calm. I almost wished he\u2019d flip into some burst of rage or mockery. Instead, once I\u2019d finished, his reaction was minimal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, setting his fork down beside an uneaten piece of cake. \u201cThat is unfortunate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunate? That\u2019s all you have to say?\u201d I wasn\u2019t trying to provoke a fight; I was just surprised.</p><p>He paused to sip some wine. \u201cWhat else is there? It sounds like everything\u2019s in place. And clearly you\u2019ve made up your mind if you\u2019ve been planning this behind my back all week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that what bothers you?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat I didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>At last, the hint of a smile\u2014but it was a bitter one. \u201cAh, Eugenie. There are so many things that bother me about this, it\u2019s hard to know where to start. I suppose it was foolish of me to try talking about trust again, eh? We\u2019re as far from that as ever.\u201d</p><p>I felt a mix of guilt and anger. \u201cHey, you\u2019re the one who started it! If you hadn\u2019t tricked me into the Iron Crown\u2014\u201d</p><p>He gave a melodramatic sigh. \u201cNot this again. Please. At least find some other grievance to lay at my feet. That crown saved lives, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou withheld the truth from me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve withheld this news of your departure from me all week,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cOne standard for me and another for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a hypocrite,\u201d I said, even though I kind of was. \u201cNot telling you this doesn\u2019t have nearly the impact of the Iron Crown! You just don\u2019t like being left out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I just said, there\u2019s a lot more to it than just that,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cLike you thinking obscurity is an adequate substitute for the protection of some of the greatest magic users in this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike yourself?\u201d I guessed.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Modesty was never a virtue Dorian really prized. \u201cDo you think I wouldn\u2019t rip the earth up around anyone who tried to lay a hand on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I don\u2019t think you can always be nearby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could be,\u201d he countered. Some of his earlier anger eased. \u201cI\u2019ll stay here in your lands permanently. Oh, I\u2019ll have to make the occasional jaunts back to the Oak Land, but far better me traveling than you. Unless, of course, my hair leads to another case of mistaken identity.\u201d He tossed some of that glorious auburn hair over one shoulder to make his point. \u201cOf course, with my rugged and manly features, it seems unlikely that kind of error would occur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not realistic,\u201d I said, not falling prey to his charm. \u201cAnd really, I do think this other plan is the safest option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet I won\u2019t have any idea if you actually are safe. You\u2019ll be lost among humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like Jasmine.\u201d</p><p>He sniffed. \u201cWho knew? It appears she and I finally agree on something.\u201d</p><p>Unlike Jasmine, though, no amount of arguing convinced him of the plan\u2019s soundness. He didn\u2019t try to talk me out of it; he just stubbornly refused to endorse it. And, as I continued laying out my now well-worn arguments, I could see that patient mask of his growing thinner and thinner. This decision really did agitate him, though I couldn\u2019t entirely figure out what bothered him the most. At last, he stood up and cut off some point he was making.</p><p>\u201cMy dear, this is a waste of time for both of us. We\u2019re going to have to agree to disagree, and really, I see no point in my continued presence. It\u2019s time for me to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d I asked, standing as well.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He reached for a cloak that was draped over a small table. \u201cAs I said before, I\u2019m not the one in danger. I\u2019d thought to stay until tomorrow to enjoy more of your company, but it seems that\u2019s futile now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so upset,\u201d I said petulantly.</p><p>Dorian approached the door. \u201cWho says I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d I said. I would\u2019ve smiled if anything about this was funny. \u201cEverything about you right now. Your face, your tone, your body language. You\u2019re pissed off. I knew you would be. But you can\u2019t really fault any of my reasoning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I suppose I can\u2019t,\u201d he agreed. He reached the door and regarded me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better this way,\u201d I said, desperately wanting him to endorse this. \u201cAnd it\u2019s easier on you.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cDo you think that matters? Eugenie, what\u2019s \u2018easy\u2019 is of no consequence when it comes to you. I would do anything for you\u2014anything at all\u2014if it only meant you\u2019d\u2014\u201d He cut himself off and abruptly turned away, resting his hand on the door\u2019s handle. Yet still he didn\u2019t leave.</p><p>A bizarre thought came over me, one that made my heart stop for a moment. All this time, I\u2019d assumed Dorian just found me entertaining in his usual perverse way, that he\u2019d liked my attentions and the prestige of being connected to my children. But I\u2019d figured any romantic attachment had died after the Iron Crown. Now ... now I knew I was wrong.</p><p>\u201cDorian ... are you most upset because ...\u201d The words came out awkwardly as I found the courage to speak them. \u201cAre you upset just because you won\u2019t see me? Because ... you\u2019ll miss me?\u201d It was a pathetic way to phrase it, but we both knew what I meant.</p><p>He glanced back at me over his shoulder, a smile on his face but sadness in his eyes. \u201cEugenie, do you know what I love about you?\u201d I waited expectedly since Dorian used that rhetorical question in nearly every conversation we had, and his answer was always different. His smile grew, as did the sadness. \u201cI love that that is the absolute last conclusion you came to.\u201d</p><p>He departed, shutting the door firmly behind him and leaving me feeling like an idiot.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>While it was true that nothing could ever fully match the Otherworld\u2019s convoluted system of travel, Roland came pretty close with the arrangements he made to get me to his mystery safe location. I left the Otherworld through a gate that opened up in Tucson, knowing that I\u2019d likely be observed. A trip there\u2014though clearly unsafe\u2014didn\u2019t raise too much suspicion, if only because my enemies would probably expect me to visit friends and family back there. It was a risk we deemed worthy, in order to cover our larger scheme.</p><p>But once I set foot in the human world, the craziness of Roland\u2019s plan fell into place. He\u2019d set it up so that my journey used practically every mode of travel imaginable\u2014car, train, airplane, and even bus. Sometimes it would only be a short distance on one of those means of transportation. Sometimes I wouldn\u2019t even go in the right direction and would simply zigzag to my next waypoint. Varied means of technology made it difficult for gentry to follow me, and the complex system of reservations and directions made it difficult for humans\u2014like Kiyo\u2014to track me. Roland only stayed with me while I was in Tucson, for fear that he might be used as a way to locate me. He also hoped that by returning home and behaving normally, it might create the illusion that I was staying with him. That meant some Otherworldly creature would undoubtedly come calling, but Roland assured me he could handle it and that they\u2019d leave him alone once the truth was discovered.</p><p>So, I did my traveling alone, which I didn\u2019t mind so much. There were so many connections to make and so many directions to follow that I had little chance to think about all the problems I\u2019d left behind. Near the end of my second day of travel, I arrived in Memphis. It wasn\u2019t my final destination\u2014but was close. Roland wanted me to stay there overnight and for most of the next day. It was a test to see if I\u2019d been followed. If I had been, it seemed likely someone would make a move quickly. If I hadn\u2019t, then I could freely continue on to the last stop. Roland had given me the number of a shaman who lived in Memphis to call if I needed help, just in case things went bad. Aside from that, I had nothing else to do but wait out the day in a hotel room and hope we\u2019d shaken any supernatural followers.</p><p>After so much time in the Otherworld, I\u2019d hoped the return to modern life would distract me. Cable TV and deep-fried food were certainly things I\u2019d been without for a while. Their novelty was short-lived, however. As I lay on my hotel bed, I just kept thinking about that last conversation with Dorian. Since seeking his protection during my pregnancy, I\u2019d regarded him with nothing but suspicion and wariness. I\u2019d been convinced of ulterior motives and had been certain the only reason he had aligned himself with me now was to further his own plots. The realization that he still had feelings for me\u2014and that I had been oblivious to them\u2014was startling. And troubling, though I couldn\u2019t exactly articulate why. I hadn\u2019t really allowed myself to think about him in a romantic way in ages, and now ... despite my best efforts ... I was.</p><p>Self-torment aside, my day in Memphis proved remarkably uneventful\u2014which was all part of the plan. It was as close as I was going to get to confirmation that I hadn\u2019t been followed. Around dinnertime of the third day, I boarded a small commuter plane and braced myself for the last stop on this madcap journey: Huntsville, Alabama. I confess, when Roland had told me that\u2019s where his safe house was, I hadn\u2019t been excited. My stereotypes of Alabama were even worse than my Ohio ones. Roland had been quick to set me straight before I\u2019d left Tucson.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, Eugenie,\u201d he\u2019d told me. \u201cBut you\u2019re kind of a snob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not,\u201d I\u2019d argued. \u201cI\u2019m open-minded about a lot of things. And places.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d scoffed. \u201cRight. You\u2019re like most people from the Western U.S., convinced that anywhere else is beneath your notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true at all! It\u2019s just ... I\u2019m just used to certain things. I mean, Tucson\u2019s a lot bigger than Huntsville. I\u2019m just used to that larger-city feel, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he\u2019d said, eyeing me skeptically. \u201cWhich is why you\u2019ve been living in a medieval castle with no electricity or indoor plumbing.\u201d</p><p>It was a fair point, and I\u2019d made no further argument. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Some of my lingering doubts softened as the plane made its descent into Huntsville and I caught sight of a park filled with cherry trees that glowed like gold in the sunset. It was kind of amazing that I could even identify them. We were still fairly high, and unlike the Rowan Land\u2019s perpetually pink cherry trees, these had lost their blossoms and were in full leaf. Yet, somehow, I instantly knew the trees for what they were, and I found them comforting. This wasn\u2019t the Rowan Land\u2014and certainly not the Thorn Land\u2014but that little reminder of home made me feel less alone. I could get through this. Everything was going to be okay.</p><p>I was met at the airport by Candace Reed, the local shaman with whom Roland had set things up. He must have given her my description because she lit up when she saw me and hurried forward to hug me as though we\u2019d known each other for ages. She was about ten years older than me, with dark skin and hair and long-lashed eyes that sparkled with mirth. She wore faded jeans with a red-checked blouse and radiated an air of motherly protection.</p><p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d she exclaimed, promptly putting her hand over my stomach. I\u2019d noticed this seemed to be acceptable behavior for most people\u2014gentry and human alike\u2014and it normally weirded me out that pregnancy apparently smashed all personal boundaries. Somehow, I wasn\u2019t bothered by Candace doing it. \u201cHow far along are you, sweetheart?\u201d Before I could even answer, she took my small suitcase from me. \u201cLord, give me that! We can\u2019t have you hauling things around in your state.\u201d</p> <p>The suitcase barely weighed anything and was simply a few essentials my mom had thrown together for me. Something told me that arguing what I was capable of in my \u201cstate\u201d with Candace would be a losing battle.</p><p>\u201cI told Charles to have your room ready by the time we got home, so he better have listened to me,\u201d she continued as we headed toward her car. \u201cYou know how men are. He\u2019d be off daydreaming all the time if he didn\u2019t have me to keep him in line. Let\u2019s hope he didn\u2019t burn dinner either. I started it and told him exactly what to do, but knowing him, he probably got distracted. Could be a baseball game on TV or a woodpecker out back. Probably nothing but a pile of ash in the oven now. It\u2019s pot roast. Do you eat that? You should, you know. Protein\u2019s good for you and the baby. So are the potatoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabies,\u201d I corrected as we reached the car. \u201cI\u2019m having twins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh my!\u201d This revelation left her momentarily speechless, and a look of wonder fell over her features, along with a softer emotion I couldn\u2019t quite place. \u201cOh, that\u2019s just lovely.\u201d</p><p>She went to put my suitcase in the trunk, and as I sat down in the passenger seat, I caught a glimpse of some familiar tools in the backseat. A silver athame lay near a suede bag, out of which peeked another hilt that I was willing to bet belonged to an iron athame. Near those was a necklace consisting of raw smoky quartz beads. I couldn\u2019t help a smile. Candace\u2019s chatty Southern charm in no way meant she wasn\u2019t a fully active, totally deadly shaman who could combat any creature that messed with us. I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if there was a gun and a wand somewhere in the car too.</p> <p>Candace had recovered herself when she rejoined me and soon picked up her breezy conversation style. I was happy to let her do the talking. It gave me the chance to take in the sights as we drove to her house. The airport was situated a little outside downtown, and Candace and her husband lived farther out still, though she assured me I could reach the city from her place in a little over a half hour. That wasn\u2019t much different from my own house back in the Catalina Foothills near Tucson, and again, I felt a small twinge of reassurance about this new locale.</p><p>As we drove away from the airport and the more populous areas, I saw that the trees remained green but that the grass and low plants were yellowing. Candace explained that they were in a drought right now. As much as I loved the dry weather I\u2019d grown up in, there was a part of me that hated to see the land around us so parched for water. It wouldn\u2019t be that big a strain on my magic to summon a quick rain shower ... but, no. I didn\u2019t even need Roland\u2019s instructions to know how foolish such an act would be. I couldn\u2019t attract any attention to myself. These conditions were normal for summer around here; the land would survive without my help. Just worry about yourself, Eugenie, I chided myself.</p><p>Candace\u2019s house was situated on a heavily wooded street. She had neighbors, but they were spread out, giving the illusion that each house on the road was in its own private forest. I\u2019d gotten used to the Rowan Land\u2019s greenery, but the castle was set on cleared land, and seeing large trees right outside this house\u2019s windows was a world away from what I\u2019d grown up with.</p><p>\u201cThis is beautiful,\u201d I told her as we got out of the car. She\u2019d retrieved her arsenal from the backseat and was going for the suitcase, despite my offers of help. Twilight was casting shadows on everything, but the little house\u2019s windows lit up the darkness.</p><p>\u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said, gesturing me to follow. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here \u2019bout fifteen years.\u201d She took the steps onto the house\u2019s wooden porch, which even had a swing for two. A screen door kept insects out and let evening air inside, in an effort to cool the house. As though thinking of this, Candace cast me an apologetic look. \u201cNo air-conditioning. It can get pretty hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m used to it,\u201d I assured her. Compared to my castles, the ventilation here was state of the art. Screens would rock the Thorn Land\u2019s world, if I could figure out how the gentry could manufacture them.</p> <p>Inside, I met her husband, Charles. He was a tall, lanky man with blond hair that was starting to pick up a little white with age. His blue eyes were kind, and his quiet demeanor was quite the contrast to Candace\u2019s liveliness. Watching them interact, though, I realized quickly that they balanced each other in a very harmonious way. She passed my suitcase off to him while she checked on the pot roast\u2014which, it seemed, had not turned to ash.</p><p>He led me to a room on the second floor, with pine walls and angled beams crossing over the ceiling. A double bed with a blue and white quilt sat in one corner, but before I could make too many judgments about country living, I noticed a flat-panel TV mounted on the opposite wall. Roland had been right. Never assume anything.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our old TV,\u201d said Charles as though apologizing. \u201cWe just got a brand-new one for the living room. I hope this isn\u2019t too small... .\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cNo, it\u2019s perfect. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, looking pleased. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a spare DVD player that I\u2019ll hook up for you later.\u201d He then proceeded to give me a rundown of their vast channel lineup, reinforcing the fact that even if the Reeds lived out in the country, they still loved their comforts. After a few minutes, Candace interrupted his spiel, calling to us to come downstairs and eat.</p><p>The food was exquisite, though it soon became obvious I could never eat enough to satisfy Candace. She was worse than my mom, which was no small feat. Candace continued to dominate the conversation, leaving little room for either me or Charles, but I got the vibe this was perfectly normal and even welcome to them.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she was saying as she piled a second helping of green beans onto my plate, \u201cI suppose you\u2019ll need to get set up with a doctor around here. There\u2019s one OB on the road to Mooresville that a friend of mine used to see. That\u2019s who I was going to recommend, since it\u2019s closer. But seeing as you\u2019ve got twins\u2014did you know that she\u2019s having twins, Charlie?\u2014I suppose you\u2019ll probably want to see one of the specialists downtown. We can make some calls tomorrow morning, and Charles can take you to your appointments while I\u2019m working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, I don\u2019t want to cause you any inconvenience,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m sure I can get my own car and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s no inconvenience,\u201d Candace interrupted. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t mind, plus he works at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill ...\u201d I felt a little flustered at their attention, especially since the mention of \u201ctwins\u201d had made Charles\u2019s dreamy expression even dreamier. \u201cThat\u2019ll interrupt his workday. Besides, once I know the area better, I can probably just find my own place and\u2014\u201d Their solicitous looks turned to shock.</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth would you do that, child?\u201d asked Candace. \u201cDon\u2019t you like it here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014uh, no. It\u2019s wonderful. But I don\u2019t want to impose.... You\u2019ve got your own life here... .\u201d I faltered, suddenly at a loss. I\u2019d known I\u2019d be staying with them initially when Roland had made these arrangements, but he\u2019d also given me the impression that there\u2019d be no issue with me getting my own place eventually\u2014so long as I stayed in regular touch with Candace.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Candace seemed relieved that inconveniencing her was my only concern. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay with us as long as you need to, until this trouble\u2019s passed.\u201d Roland hadn\u2019t told her my history, of course, but had simply given a story with elements of truth. He\u2019d painted me as a shaman who\u2019d run afoul of some Otherworldly creatures\u2014not uncommon in this profession\u2014and said that pregnancy made it difficult for me to protect myself. She cast a concerned glance at my plate. \u201cGod knows you\u2019ll probably starve to death if left on your own.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to settle the matter for them, and any further protests I might have made were pushed aside when the front door squeaked open. I nearly leapt out of my chair at a potential invasion, but the Reeds\u2019 casual attitude kept me in check.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d a voice called. \u201cAnyone home?\u201d</p><p>A guy my age came into the kitchen. Candace hurried up from the table to grab a clean plate and immediately began piling it with food. \u201cSit down, Evan,\u201d she told him. \u201cBefore it gets cold. You can meet our houseguest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Evan,\u201d he said, in case I\u2019d missed that. He flashed me a grin and held out his hand. Before I could take it, he hastily wiped it on his blue jeans and then offered it again. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working outside all day. Sweat and dirt everywhere.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so right away?\u201d exclaimed Candace. \u201cWash your hands then. We run a civilized house.\u201d</p><p>Evan complied meekly and walked over to the counter. \u201cI\u2019m Eugenie,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cEvan is Charles\u2019s nephew,\u201d Candace explained, taking her seat again. \u201cLives a couple miles away.\u201d</p> <p>Evan returned with clean hands and joined us. \u201cI just came by to return Uncle Chuck\u2019s tools,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t just stop by here and leave without eating\u2014especially around dinnertime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m learning,\u201d I said.</p><p>This made him smile again, and he dug into his food with enough enthusiasm to please even Candace. She started back in with her domination of the conversation, though Evan was a good match for her and kept trying to draw both me and Charles in as well. Evan wasn\u2019t quite as lanky as his uncle but had the same blond hair and blue eyes. He had a muscular build that confirmed his earlier statement about \u201cworking outside all day,\u201d as well as the start of a sunburn, which Candace was quick to scold him about.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do, Evan?\u201d I asked, when a rare pause in the talking came up. I fully expected anything from farmer to mechanic. I guess I hadn\u2019t entirely let go of my stereotypes.</p><p>\u201cHigh school teacher,\u201d he said, between bites of potatoes. \u201cAt least, I am during most of the year. I\u2019ve still got another month or so off.\u201d</p> <p>Surprising answer. \u201cWhat do you teach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysics,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd shop.\u201d Seeing my astonished look, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s a small school. Some of us do double-duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I said. \u201cThose seem like polar opposites.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised. Plus, it gives me an excuse to make lots of field trips to the space center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should take Eugenie there,\u201d said Candace. She turned to me. \u201cHe\u2019s there so much that they should be paying him to give tours. You should talk to them, Evan. You could make a little extra money this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I could take her without seeking compensation from the space center,\u201d said Evan patiently. \u201cIf she even wants to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, mostly because I wasn\u2019t entirely sure yet how I\u2019d be spending my days around here anyway. The irony of my life wasn\u2019t lost on me. I hadn\u2019t just left behind a shadowy world of mystery and magic; I was now signing on to explore the ultimate triumph of human technology. \u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t tire her out,\u201d warned Candace. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant. With twins.\u201d</p><p>Evan gave me a once-over. \u201cReally? I can\u2019t even tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlatterer,\u201d I muttered, much to his amusement.</p><p>\u201cYou also can\u2019t take her on any of those simulator rides,\u201d added Candace. \u201cThey\u2019re not good for pregnant women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, I know,\u201d said Evan patiently.</p><p>\u201cJust making sure,\u201d she said. \u201cI know how reckless you can be.\u201d</p><p>Honestly, Evan seemed like one of the least reckless people I\u2019d ever met\u2014rivaled only by Charles. That easygoing nature must run in the family. Both were quick to smile and had a good attitude about everything. Even though Candace harassed them both for various reasons, it was obvious that there was a lot of love in this group, and they were all willing to bring me into their little circle. It was both touching and weird, and I mentioned it to Evan later.</p> <p>\u201cYour aunt and uncle are so nice,\u201d I confessed when we were alone. Charles had entrusted Evan with the spare DVD player to install in my room. \u201cI know she\u2019s friends with Roland\u2014my stepfather\u2014but still. They\u2019ve just gone above and beyond. I didn\u2019t expect this kind of welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how they are.\u201d Evan\u2019s back was to me as he connected a few cables between the TV and DVD player. \u201cThey\u2019re just naturally good. That, and they\u2019d bend over backward for someone like you anyway.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cBecause of Roland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d He straightened up and turned on the TV to test it. \u201cBecause of the baby. Er, babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>Satisfied all was working, he turned around and regarded me with a gentle smile. \u201cThey love kids and especially babies. They can\u2019t have any of their own\u2014though it wasn\u2019t for a lack of trying. They went through a lot of heartache, and even though they\u2019ve sort of accepted things now, I know it still hurts them sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea,\u201d I murmured. I rested a hand on my stomach. \u201cI feel kind of bad. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t be here... .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think like that,\u201d he chided. \u201cThey\u2019re not bitter. Like I said, they\u2019re good people, and you carrying twins just makes their day. You could stay here as long as you wanted\u2014you and the kids\u2014and they\u2019d be delighted. There\u2019s nothing they won\u2019t do for you.\u201d His words sent a disconcerting reminder of Dorian\u2019s constant What wouldn\u2019t I do for you? quip.</p><p>I wondered if Roland had known about the Reeds\u2019 childless state when he\u2019d decided on this location for me. Had he guessed their situation would add an extra level of protectiveness?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. I just don\u2019t feel like ... I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just kind of overwhelmed by it all. I don\u2019t think I can pay them back for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust accept it and let them take care of you,\u201d Evan said with a wink. \u201cThat\u2019s plenty of payback for them, believe me.\u201d He moved toward the door and stifled a yawn. \u201cI\u2019ve got to head out before I fall over, but I\u2019ll give you a call soon if you do want to go check out the space center. And if you don\u2019t, then just say so. Don\u2019t let Candace pressure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said truthfully. \u201cIt sounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>Evan left, and the rest of the household began winding down. Both Charles and Candace went out of their way to make sure I didn\u2019t need anything else before going to bed. I assured them I was fine and then finally shut the door on my little room. With a sigh, I stretched out on top of my bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat have I done?\u201d I murmured, staring up at the pine slats. One day I was the queen of a fairy kingdom, commanding armies and wielding powerful magic. The next, I was out in the country, the darling of a good-hearted family whose only motivations were kindness and affection to others. It left me confused and unsure of what exactly I wanted in the world. And weirdly, for the first time since I\u2019d left the Otherworld and begun my manic journey, I truly felt alone. I\u2019d abandoned a lifestyle that\u2014while dangerous\u2014was familiar and beloved. Now, I was in a much simpler, easier world ... but I questioned if I\u2019d ever truly feel like I belonged in it.</p><p>Dorian\u2019s face played through my mind again, and I forcibly pushed him away.</p><p>A small fluttering in my stomach made me jerk upright. I sat there in disbelief, staring around foolishly. What was that? Had that been ... ? Tentatively, I rested a hand on my abdomen, waiting for a repeat. There was none. I tried to remember what the doctor had said about the babies moving. I remembered the fish analogy and\u2014most importantly\u2014her comment that it wouldn\u2019t feel like something trying to kick its way out of me.</p><p>When nothing else happened, I lay back on the bed. That could have been anything, I decided. Too much pot roast. A muscle spasm. I\u2019d almost convinced myself I\u2019d imagined it when another fluttering in a different part of my stomach left me wide-eyed. I nearly stopped breathing, then told myself that wouldn\u2019t be healthy for any of us.</p><p>I used no magic but instead expanded my senses so that I could feel the air and water around me. I could hear the hum of insects outside and smell the leaves of the trees outside my window. The world fell into a comfortable harmony as I clasped my hands and rested them carefully on my stomach again. Another flutter answered me, and I realized that maybe, no matter how radically things had changed, I wasn\u2019t alone after all.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>I\u2019d thought my biggest obstacle in exile would simply be adjusting to a new area and new people. I was wrong. As it turned out, boredom soon became my greatest enemy in the following weeks.</p><p>The Reeds continued to be open and loving in their acceptance of me. For all intents and purposes, I was a member of the family. Evan made good on his promise to take me to the space center and went out of his way to show me all sorts of other interesting sights in the area. Still, he couldn\u2019t entertain me nonstop. Even though he was on summer break, he still had lots of home projects of his own to work on during the day, as well as a number of volunteer jobs. Likewise, Charles and Candace had their own commitments to preoccupy them. When evening came, they were quick to gather us all together, but the long daylight hours were left to my own devices.</p><p>Surprisingly, jealousy soon became an issue for me as well. Candace might maintain her breezy down-home style and tendency to over-mother while at home, but it was obvious that when it came to her shamanic work, she was all business. Her work sometimes took her quite a few hours outside of Huntsville, and I learned that this region was particularly active for ghosts. Old spirits had a hard time leaving familiar haunts. For whatever reason, gentry and other Otherworldly creatures weren\u2019t such an issue, so she rarely used her magic to touch the Otherworld. Her work was mostly restricted to banishing, which made her more of a Ghost Buster than a shaman.</p><p>She frequently came home with cuts and bruises from particularly troublesome spirits, and that was what drove me crazy the most. She never complained and took it in stride as part of the job, and Charles would patiently patch her up each time. She was always able to take down anything that came her way, but each time she returned home injured, I just kept thinking that if I\u2019d been with her, we probably could\u2019ve dispatched those ghosts without a scratch. It took every ounce of my willpower to stay silent and let her do her job the way she always had.</p><p>I\u2019d wondered initially if Evan knew what his aunt did for a living. Sometimes the shamanic trade was kept undercover. I quickly learned that not only did Evan know about her job, he also occasionally helped. His skills were pretty minor, but she believed it was good to have a backup. Her profession was well known to a lot of the community as well, who took ghosts and the supernatural as an accepted part of life. The area was rich in history, and a lot of the residents\u2014particularly those in remote regions\u2014had at least one ghost story to share. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Candace found me one afternoon, on a day she\u2019d finished up early. I was reading on the porch, trying with mixed luck to get into a book I\u2019d recently checked out. I hadn\u2019t actually used a library in years, but with all my free time, now had seemed like a good time to try to get back into the habit. They helped break up the time when I wasn\u2019t working on jigsaw puzzles, which were another old and neglected hobby.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you could help me out with something,\u201d she said, wiping sweat off her brow. The drought hadn\u2019t lifted, which also drove me crazy. Charles worked diligently to keep his garden watered and alive, and I had to rein myself in from using magic to help him out. I would\u2019ve gladly assisted with the manual labor instead, but he wouldn\u2019t allow that in my \u201cstate.\u201d</p><p>At her words, a brief surge of hope flared within me. Maybe she wanted me to come help her with a case! Then, as quickly as the thought had come, I promptly dismissed it. I was fairly certain Roland had made it emphatically clear that I was not to assist under any circumstances, and Candace was protective enough to uncompromisingly adhere to that.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d I asked. I racked my brain for any household tasks that needed tending but could think of none that were low-key enough for me to be allowed to do.</p><p>\u201cBusiness is picking up,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m getting lots of calls and e-mails. It\u2019s hard for me to keep up with them. Charles tries, but he doesn\u2019t always know enough to tell what\u2019s a priority and what\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>A secretary. She wanted me to be her secretary. I was so dumbfounded that I could make no response.</p><p>Uncomfortable with my silence, she added, \u201cI figured with your experience, you\u2019d be able to sort everything out and schedule it the right way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said at last. \u201cWhatever you need.\u201d</p> <p>My acceptance came more from a sense of obligation to this woman who\u2019d done so much for me than any real desire for clerical work. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I respected that trade immensely. Back in Tucson, I\u2019d had an administrative assistant named Lara. Her witty personality was enough to make me miss her, but she\u2019d also been amazing at sorting out the day-to-day details of my life and job. Yet, as awesome as I felt she was, my own pride was hurt at being downgraded to phone calls and e-mail. I was one of the most powerful shamans around. I could do things that most of my peers couldn\u2019t ... but this was what I\u2019d been reduced to.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not ideal,\u201d she said gently. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s something you\u2019d be good at.\u201d</p><p>I realized then that her offer came from more than just a need for someone to organize her affairs. Just like with her shamanic skills, I\u2019d underestimated her. She was more observant than she let on. She knew perfectly well that I was bored and restless, so she was trying to do what she could to help me while still maintaining Roland\u2019s rules.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, genuinely meaning it. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>A relieved grin spread over her face. \u201cGood. Now that that\u2019s settled, tell me how your appointment went.\u201d</p><p>I smiled back at her obvious glee. I\u2019d found a doctor in Huntsville and had a checkup this morning, continuing to get good marks. \u201cYou can see for yourself. There\u2019s a folder on the counter with something you might like.\u201d The doctor had sent me home with some ultrasound printouts of the twins. Candace hurried back inside, and moments later, I heard a delighted shriek. Laughing, I returned to my book.</p> <p>When I started working for Candace the next day, I wondered how Lara had managed to do her job for years without going insane.</p><p>To be fair, it wasn\u2019t like the phone was ringing off the hook. Candace had a separate line for business, and I only got a handful of calls that day. E-mail requests were about the same. Still, I was kind of amazed at the varied personalities I had to deal with. It was easy for me to tell the difference between a major haunting and a minor one, and the latter usually got scheduled out later. Some people didn\u2019t take that too well. Equally frustrating were those who didn\u2019t even know what they were asking for.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like an occasional knocking in the walls,\u201d one man explained to me on the phone. \u201cUsually when the air-conditioning kicks on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have central air?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose ... it might actually be something going on with the air-conditioning?\u201d</p><p>He considered this for a few moments. \u201cDoesn\u2019t seem likely. It\u2019s never done it before. I\u2019ve had this system for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said patiently, \u201cthings wear out over time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI dunno. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s a ghost.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cHave you had any other signs? I mean, have you actually seen an apparition or felt any cold spots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said after another long pause. \u201cBut I\u2019ve sometimes felt warm spots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarm spots?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat\u2019s not usually an indicator of a spectral presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re there. Even when the air-conditioning\u2019s on, it still feels pretty hot in the house.\u201d</p><p>I gritted my teeth. \u201cIf the air-conditioning\u2019s broken, that would explain the noise and why it\u2019s not cooling your house.\u201d</p><p>The guy was obviously still skeptical. \u201cI think it\u2019s a ghost. Do you think she can come out and take a look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it might be a while. Her schedule\u2019s pretty booked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ghost kind of adds character. Maybe I won\u2019t even have her get rid of it.\u201d</p><p>We scheduled the appointment, and I hung up, thinking bleakly that that had been ten wasted minutes of my life I would never get back. I also found myself again thinking of Dorian. Not that he would do phone customer service, of course. But that customer\u2019s personality was exactly the kind Dorian loved to taunt. I could see him nodding along seriously with the guy: \u201cIntriguing. Tell me more about your ghost.\u201d</p><p>Still, it occurred to me after a few days that I really was making Candace\u2019s life easier. I was also helping out Charles, who was relieved to no longer have to deal with air-conditioning ghosts. I decided the annoyance of customer service was a small price to pay for their hospitality.</p><p>A week or so into my gainful employment, Evan surprised me with a daytime visit. He was in his usual jeans and T-shirt but had obviously cleaned up and didn\u2019t have the typical wear and tear from working outdoors.</p><p>\u201cWondered if you wanted to go see some more local sights,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a plantation south of here that\u2019s a historic monument.\u201d</p><p>I made a face. \u201cThanks for the offer, but I don\u2019t really like the history of those places. It\u2019s hard for me to get too excited.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his face serious. \u201cThe history is ugly, but it\u2019s an amazing piece of architecture. And sometimes ... sometimes it\u2019s good to have a reminder of the evils of the past.\u201d</p><p>The comment surprised me. I\u2019d known Evan was neither stupid nor close-minded, but much like with Candace, it was easy to think he was just all laid-back charm. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said. I glared at Candace\u2019s business phone. \u201cVoice mail can take over today.\u201d</p><p>We drove deep into the country, about an hour and a half away from Candace\u2019s. The land was beautiful, and deep-rooted trees fought fiercely to maintain their green leaves in otherwise yellow and brown terrain. Evan left the windows open, and I leaned back with eyes closed, enjoying the rush of air over me.</p><p>A strange longing suddenly welled up in me, filling my mind with images of desert shrubs and cherry trees in bloom. The Thorn Land and the Rowan Land. How long had it been since I\u2019d been away? Nearly a month? The time seemed both impossibly long and short. The longing within me grew more intense, and in that moment, I would\u2019ve traded anything for my kingdoms. I\u2019d had those lands call to me before and knew this sudden urgency wasn\u2019t coming from them. This was all me, my own body\u2019s withdrawal from the Otherworld. If the lands hadn\u2019t sought me out, then Jasmine\u2019s bonding must be satisfying them. Somehow, that made me feel worse.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d asked Evan. I opened my eyes. \u201cYou looked like you were a million miles away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly,\u201d I said with a small smile. \u201cJust feeling a little homesick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve traveled a little, but most of my life\u2019s been here. Not sure what I\u2019d do if I was suddenly taken away from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you plan on staying here for the rest of your life?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said without hesitation. \u201cI love the land. I love my house. I even love my students. You always hear about teachers who are relieved when school\u2019s out, but me? I miss the kids the whole time. Can\u2019t wait to get back into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you teach the same thing each term?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t get bored?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I love the material. And there are always different kids cycling through, so it\u2019s new to them each time. That\u2019s fun to see.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head in awe. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, that I like kids?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cNo, no. That you\u2019re so content with your life. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s very common.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got everything you need, why complicate it? I mean sure, I\u2019d like a family someday, but other than that, I\u2019ve got a lot of good things going on. People get too caught up in what they don\u2019t have and get bogged down as a result. There\u2019s joy in the present. It\u2019s important to just make the most of these moments we have. Keep an eye on the future, but don\u2019t forget to enjoy now.\u201d</p><p>His eyes held mine for a brief moment before returning back to the road ahead. Evan had never made any romantic overtures toward me or behaved in any way that wasn\u2019t gentlemanly. That was fine by me. I liked him a lot, but after everything I\u2019d gone through, I was in no way ready to get involved in a new relationship. Nonetheless, I\u2019d gotten the vibe for a while that he wouldn\u2019t be opposed to something more developing between us. As his words had just confirmed, though, I\u2019d also gotten the impression that he was more than willing to be patient. He really was content with what we had now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And that was what was remarkable about him. He was content, at peace with what he had. He wasn\u2019t a slacker by any means, but there was none of that burning ambition to shape the world, as I\u2019d experienced too often with Dorian and Kiyo. There were no greater machinations here, just a simple love of life. Things were uncomplicated around Evan, and it occurred to me that maybe that wasn\u2019t such a bad thing. Complicated had been my operating procedure for so long that I\u2019d never given much thought to living without it. Would it be so terrible to let go of Otherworldly politics and prophecies? Maybe it would be good for me\u2014and my children\u2014to live around people who simply loved unconditionally.</p><p>There were no easy answers, certainly none that would present themselves today. We arrived at the plantation shortly thereafter, and it was as magnificent as Evan had said it was. The main building was constructed in Greek revivalist style, sprawling and grand with a veranda that even had pillars. Evan pulled up into a gravel parking lot and then led us toward one of the adjacent buildings, which had obviously been converted into a visitor\u2019s center. As we walked toward it, I came to a stop and glanced up in surprise.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s finally going to rain,\u201d I said.</p> <p>Evan stopped beside me and glanced up as well. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything about it. Look\u2014there isn\u2019t even a cloud in the sky.\u201d</p><p>It was true. There was nothing but open blue above us, paired with a merciless sun. Yet, I knew there would be a storm before the day was out. I could feel it with every part of my being. The air hummed with it. Remembering Ohio, I had a brief moment of panic that this unexpected storm might be magically induced. I took a deep breath and felt out its true nature. No, this was the real deal. A natural shift in weather that was much needed.</p><p>\u201cJust wait,\u201d I promised Evan as we continued walking. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>He gave me an indulgent smile but made no secret of the fact that he didn\u2019t buy it.</p><p>A sign at the visitor\u2019s center said the plantation was closed today, making me think our trip had been in vain. Evan continued, undaunted, and knocked on the door.</p> <p>\u201cWanda?\u201d he called. \u201cYou around?\u201d</p><p>A few moments later, the door opened, and a tiny gray-haired woman appeared. \u201cWhy, Evan. I wondered if you\u2019d make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I would,\u201d he said, giving her a quick hug. \u201cWanda, this is Eugenie. She\u2019s staying with Aunt Candy and Uncle Chuck right now. Eugenie, Wanda.\u201d</p><p>Wanda pushed her silver-rimmed glasses up the bridge of her nose and beamed at me. \u201cYou are very welcome here, darling. The house is open if you want to go look around. I know you remember the way, Evan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure do,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks for letting us come by. I promise not to mess anything up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better not,\u201d she teased.</p> <p>I gave him a look of wonder as we made our way to the house. \u201cDo you know everyone around here?\u201d I\u2019d noticed similar receptions in my time with him, but being given full access to a site like this was pretty remarkable.</p><p>He chuckled and opened the front door for me. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the perks of settling in one place so long. You don\u2019t just get to know people\u2014you practically become family.\u201d</p><p>We spent almost two hours going through the house. It was a huge place, with room after room that had been restored and furnished with period items. Most everything was labeled with small placards too, overloading my brain with more history than I could handle. The plantation\u2019s more sinister side and history of slavery continued to bother me, but I could see that Evan was right about the importance of learning about the past.</p><p>After finally seeing all there was to see, we returned to one of the grand sitting rooms. I rested on a small bench and admired the setting. Taking in the rich details and lush fabrics, I couldn\u2019t help but think this room would\u2019ve fit seamlessly into some gentry palace. Evan eyed me with concern.</p><p>\u201cYou up for seeing some of the outside buildings? We can head out if you\u2019re tired.\u201d</p><p>The truth was, I was tired. I firmly told myself it was simply from knowledge overload and depressing history\u2014and not because pregnancy was wearing me down. \u201cLet\u2019s at least take a quick look,\u201d I said, refusing to show any weakness. \u201cIt\u2019d be a shame not to after coming all the way out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed. He held out a hand to help me up, and I accepted. As we walked toward the door, a wave of cold hit me\u2014and it wasn\u2019t from the plantation\u2019s cooling system, either. In fact, it was exactly the kind of cold spot I\u2019d been trying to explain to that guy on the phone the other day.</p><p>\u201cDid you feel that?\u201d I asked, coming to a stop.</p> <p>Evan gave me a curious look. \u201cNo. What was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cold spot.\u201d Yet, even as I said it, the spot moved, and I was back in the room\u2019s previous temperature. I studied the room, looking for some sign of the source. Evan followed my gaze. Even with basic training, he understood the significance of a cold spot.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he murmured, pointing to a corner.</p><p>I\u2019d almost overlooked it. In a roped-off alcove filled with furniture, a ghost stood between a clock and a sofa. He was so still and so translucent from the sunlight that he was difficult to spot. He had a forked beard and wore an old-fashioned suit with a bow tie. He watched us warily but made no movements.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an old ghost,\u201d I said. \u201cJudging from the clothes. Probably been around since this place was built. Of course, if that\u2019s the case, he probably doesn\u2019t bother many people\u2014or else someone would\u2019ve called Candace long before this.\u201d</p><p>Evan shifted uncomfortably, a small frown wrinkling his forehead. \u201cTrue. But it doesn\u2019t matter. She\u2019d still say he should have been banished a long time ago. It isn\u2019t right for him to be tied to this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso true,\u201d I admitted. \u201cWe can let her know, and she can come back.\u201d</p><p>To my surprise, Evan produced a wand from his pocket. It was similar to mine\u2014which I\u2019d left with Roland\u2014save that the gemstones tied to its wooden base were different. \u201cI can do it now,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou carry a wand with you?\u201d I asked, kind of impressed.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAunt Candy says be prepared. You better step away.\u201d</p><p>I started to say I had nothing to fear from a mild-mannered ghost like this but then remembered that this wasn\u2019t my show. Besides, even though this ghost seemed pretty localized, it was better if I didn\u2019t draw attention to myself\u2014not that there seemed to be any danger of that. From the way the ghost had now fixed his steely gaze on Evan, it was obvious who had been identified as the threat. I moved to the room\u2019s far side.</p><p>\u201cSend him to the Underworld if you can,\u201d I said.</p><p>Evan nodded and extended the wand. I felt its magic fill the room as he attempted to open a gate that would send the ghost away. Before he\u2019d really even opened up past this world, the ghost attacked with a fury that neither of us had expected. Since the ghost had seemed so docile, I\u2019d figured he would take his banishing meekly.</p><p>No such luck. He shifted to a flying form and threw himself forward, knocking Evan to the ground and immediately shutting down the tentative gate. Evan had remarkably fast reflexes and rolled to avoid the ghost\u2019s next blow. Spying a silver candlestick, Evan leapt up and grabbed it with his free hand and then took a swing at the ghost. It was a smart move. A silver blade was better, but any silver object wielded as a weapon by someone with enough skill and magic to use it correctly could cause damage. Sure enough, though the candlestick seemed to pass harmlessly through the ghost\u2019s translucent form, he howled in rage and retreated out of reach.</p><p>Evan used the opportunity to attempt his gate. I felt the tingle of magic once more, soon followed by a connection to the Otherworld. With that connection, my earlier need for the Thorn Land and Rowan Land flared up with startling intensity. They were so close ... but still out of my reach. I bit my lip and forced myself to stay still. Despite the connection, Evan was taking my advice and sending his senses farther, forming an opening to the Underworld. The ghost snarled as he recognized what Evan was doing. A ghost could come back from the Otherworld sometimes, but from the realm of death, there was no return.</p><p>Knowing it was now or never, the ghost struck again. Evan was ready and dodged the blow, still swinging the candlestick defensively. I felt the connection to the Underworld waver, but he was just barely able to keep hold. His near loss was a sign of his inexperience. Neither Candace nor I would\u2019ve lost a gate that established. Still, he\u2019d pulled it off and began the banishing words. The ghost attacked again, and Evan shifted\u2014realizing too late it had been a feint. Evan moved in the wrong direction, and the ghost quickly picked up a wooden chair and threw it hard at Evan. The chair hit its mark, knocking Evan to the floor once again. The wand fell from his hand, instantly dissolving the connection.</p><p>The wand rolled to a central spot in the room, and I moved without even thinking. The ghost was advancing on Evan. I grabbed the wand and quickly cast an opening to the Underworld. As the magic poured through me, I nearly gasped. I hadn\u2019t realized just how long I\u2019d gone without it. Shamanic magic didn\u2019t have the addictiveness of gentry magic, but it still had a sweet, pleasurable feeling I\u2019d missed.</p><p>The ghost turned to me in surprise, not having expected me to offer a challenge. He abandoned Evan but wasn\u2019t fast enough to reach me before I spoke the banishing and sent him on. The ghost dissolved before our eyes, screaming in fury as it finally went where it should have long ago. Soon the screams were gone too, and we were alone. I hurried over to Evan, who was already getting to his feet.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked anxiously.</p><p>I almost laughed. \u201cMe? You\u2019re the one who just got tossed around by a ghost. Look at your arm.\u201d One of the chair legs had caught his arm at a bad angle, leaving a bloody gash. It likely wouldn\u2019t need stitches but was still ugly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said. He righted the chair and gave it a quick survey for damage. There was none, meaning he wouldn\u2019t get in trouble with Wanda. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a banishing that fast. I don\u2019t even think Aunt Candy can do it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt just takes practice,\u201d I assured him, not wanting to make a big deal of it. Evan knew I had a shamanic background, but I didn\u2019t want the extent of my power made that obvious. \u201cCome on\u2014we should get home.\u201d I was already looking back on what I\u2019d done with regret. In that moment, there\u2019d been no question. I\u2019d had to help Evan. But in doing so, I\u2019d exposed myself.</p><p>Candace\u2019s grim face confirmed as much when we got back to her place. \u201cThat ghost won\u2019t tell any tales in the Underworld, at least,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cAnd if he was tied to that house, it\u2019s unlikely he had contact with anyone who might be after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was hoping,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cStill. You shouldn\u2019t have done it, if only because you and those little ones could have been hurt.\u201d Her gaze lifted toward the kitchen, where Charles was bandaging up Evan. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot to learn, but he\u2019s tougher than he looks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, feeling terrible. The ride home had given me a lot of time to consider my actions. One of the twins chose that moment to kick, just in case it wasn\u2019t obvious that I\u2019d put them at risk. \u201cI just reacted. He was in trouble, and the wand was right there.\u201d</p><p>Candace\u2019s look was almost sympathetic as she rested a hand on my arm. \u201cI know. And I know that\u2019s your nature\u2014especially if you\u2019re anything like Roland. That man never did know how to stay out of trouble. But for now, you\u2019ve got to let go. Next time you fight a ghost, it may tell the ones who are after you where you\u2019re at.\u201d</p><p>I nodded meekly. Further conversation was put on hold as Charles and Evan rejoined us. Evan stopped in the doorway to the living room and pointed at the TV set. \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re from, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I turned and saw a news report on a grocery store robbery in Tucson. The security camera footage was spotty, frequently going to static, but it showed a few bizarre shots of what looked like items flying off the shelves. Eyewitness reports were equally odd, and if I hadn\u2019t known it was completely impossible, I would\u2019ve thought the store had been hit by a ghost. But a ghost had no use for money\u2014or, in this case, food, since that\u2019s what had been stolen.</p> <p>\u201cWeird,\u201d I said, once the story ended. If some other type of Otherworldly creature had been involved, I had no doubt Roland would deal with it. Knowing that made me feel even more ineffectual. Roland had theoretically retired, but my various actions over the last year had forced him to take on the role of an active shaman once more.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d remarked Candace. \u201cBut it hardly fits the usual\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped as a low rumbling sound filled the house. All of us stared at each other in confusion. Another rumble sounded, just as I saw the living room windows light up. My senses were suddenly flooded, seconds before the others realized what was happening.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s raining,\u201d exclaimed Evan. He hurried to the door, the rest of us right behind him.</p><p>Out on the porch, we watched in wonder as rain poured down in sheets while lightning ripped apart the sky. A fierce wind picked up, blowing the rain at us, but nobody cared. Charles laughed and stepped off the porch, holding his hands skyward.</p><p>\u201cThis\u2019ll fix my garden right up,\u201d he declared.</p> <p>Evan turned to me in amazement. \u201cYou were right. She said this would happen, Aunt Candy. This afternoon\u2014the sky was clear blue, and she swore there\u2019d be a storm.\u201d</p><p>Candace smiled and turned to watch Charles, oblivious to the true nature of my insight. \u201cI guess some people just have a knack for the weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Despite our conclusions that I probably hadn\u2019t raised any notice in the Otherworld, I still spent the next week on pins and needles. I jumped at shadows, expecting gentry assassins to come bursting through my window at any moment. Candace played it cool and casual as usual, but I noticed she too was more watchful than before. One evening, a friend of hers came by, a wizened woman with an accent so thick I could barely understand her. Candace claimed the friend was visiting for tea, but later, I noticed them walking around the yard. I never asked Candace about it, but I suspected her friend was a witch who had laid some protective wards for us.</p><p>My worries continued to be unfounded, and that slow, easy life resumed. Even doing customer service for Candace became more comfortable, and I simply learned to take the silliness in stride. Probably the part of my life that continued to bother me most was my longing for my kingdoms. I would often wake up in the middle of the night with a burning in my chest and tears in my eyes. I\u2019d remember the clean, crisp perfume of the deserts of the Thorn Land or the soft, rolling hills of the Rowan Land. Most of the need was still on my own side, but every once in a while, I\u2019d sense a faint whisper, as though the lands were starting to miss me too.</p><p>To my surprise, I also found myself missing Dorian. After finding out I was pregnant, I\u2019d seen him almost every week in the Otherworld. Not having his sarcasm and wit around anymore seemed weird, leaving an empty spot within me. Weirder still was that, aside from that last idyllic week, he and I hadn\u2019t really spent much tender or recreational time together. It had always been business, making plans for our kingdoms and figuring out how best to thwart Maiwenn and Kiyo. Nonetheless, I\u2019d simply gotten used to having him around. No matter our personal differences, we worked well as a team.</p><p>Occasionally, more troubling thoughts about him would plague me. Lying in bed at night, sweating from the Alabama heat, I\u2019d find myself sifting back farther in my memories, to the time when he and I had been involved. I was rapidly reaching a point in my pregnancy where sex sounded like the least appealing thing ever. But in my memories, it was still easy. There had been a lot of nights in the Thorn Land, when Dorian had been with me and we\u2019d lain in bed in similar kinds of heat, sweaty and restless. Even in those conditions, we hadn\u2019t been able to keep our hands off of each other. His skin had felt like fire against mine as he moved in me, his mouth equally hot wherever it touched me. The heat around us had seemed inconsequential to that between us.</p> <p>Recalling that night did more than just torment my body. It tormented my mind. I still hadn\u2019t gotten over the way he and I had parted. Dorian still cares about me. Dorian maybe even loves me.</p><p>How did I feel about that? How did I feel about him?</p><p>Although the weather in Huntsville remained hot, summer was winding down, and with its end, Evan would be returning to school. He began spending more time with me, still in that polite, hands-off way. Sometimes I\u2019d catch him looking at me in a manner that made me nervous, and I feared some outpouring of affection. It never came, showing he was just as patient and content as he\u2019d claimed to be. He further proved the point while we were out fishing one day.</p><p>I\u2019d never been fishing before. It wasn\u2019t something you really did a lot of in Tucson. We were out on a small, quiet lake ringed in willows, in a no-frills motorboat that had just enough room for us, our catch, and a cooler stocked with Coke, juice, and Milky Ways. Evan was very critical about everything we caught, and it was important to him that we caught no more than we could eat. Anything else was a waste, he declared.</p><p>\u201cUncle Chuck makes a mean batter for these,\u201d Evan told me. \u201cWe can have a fish fry tonight.\u201d</p><p>That sounded great to me then and there. I was starving, but then, I always seemed to be lately. My appetite had shot up out of nowhere these last couple weeks, much to Candace\u2019s delight. While I certainly didn\u2019t try to halt my eating, every extra bite was a reminder that I was going to get bigger and bigger. As it was, my weight had shot up exponentially too. It was still mostly confined to my stomach, but every day, I felt a little slower and a little more uncomfortable.</p><p>I finished off a Milky Way to curb my hunger, fully knowing no obstetrician would endorse it as sound nutrition. I chased it with a thermos of cider, giving me a brief flashback to the Oak Land harvest parties. Those bonfires and crisp nights, paired with Dorian\u2019s smile, seemed like a lifetime away.</p><p>\u201cI think there are some rules about pregnancy and fish,\u201d I told Evan, returning to the present. \u201cIt\u2019s probably in one of the pamphlets the doctors gave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019d be a shame,\u201d Evan said, casting his line out. A breeze off the water eased some of the heat and ruffled his hair. \u201cIf you can\u2019t have any now, we\u2019ll make sure you have a double helping after the babies come. If you\u2019re still here, that is. Have you thought much about it?\u201d</p><p>I watched my own bobber drift lazily in the water. As far as I could tell, I was doing exactly what he was with technique, but he kept catching more fish. \u201cHonestly, no. Mostly I\u2019m just trying to get through the pregnancy, but I\u2019ll have to figure out the rest soon enough.\u201d I sighed. \u201cDo you think I should stick around?\u201d It was a foolish question, I realized, seeing as he didn\u2019t have nearly enough background to understand the consequences of that decision.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter what I think. I like having you here, but in the end you have to do what you want and what you think is best.\u201d</p><p>I almost laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s ever said that to me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that? To do what you want?\u201d His bobber disappeared in the water, and he gave the line an experimental tug, revealing he\u2019d indeed hooked another fish. Damn. How\u2019d he keep doing that?</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of well-meaning people in my life, but most haven\u2019t been shy about telling me what they think I should do.\u201d</p><p>Evan reeled the fish in and deemed its size adequate. \u201cPeople will always do that\u2014and you said the magic words. Well-meaning. Most have good intentions for you at heart, but only you can make the final call.\u201d</p><p>I thought back to the last time I\u2019d seen Kiyo, when he\u2019d been trying to kill me in an effort to stop our children from being born. That didn\u2019t really qualify as \u201cgood intentions.\u201d Dorian\u2019s heavy-handed protection of me had looked out for my well-being, but it had been tainted with his own ambition. If push came to shove, I still wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d side with me or the prophecy. And yet, even as I thought that, I remembered our last meeting, when Dorian had admitted to having no ulterior motives, save to make me happy and rebuild our trust. It was hard to know what to believe anymore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Evan assessed our tally for the day and decided we had enough fish. \u201cDon\u2019t want to be greedy,\u201d he said with a wink. \u201cNeed the fish to keep making more fish. Now we\u2019ll find out if you\u2019re allowed to have the best fried fish in the state.\u201d</p><p>A little Internet searching back at the house provided info on fish types and local waters that declared I could eat small quantities. Fortunately, the Reeds made an abundance of side dishes and desserts that ensured what I lacked in fish, I could definitely make up for. I went to bed happy and full, still turning over Evan\u2019s words about doing what I thought was best. Such a novel concept.</p><p>The next day, I was left alone for most of the afternoon while everyone else tended to their own affairs. E-mail and calls were few, though Candace assured me we\u2019d see a surge when summer truly ended and people spent more time inside. So, it was another reading day for me, and I tried to make myself as comfortable as I could on my bed, something else that was becoming more difficult with my size. No breeze came in to cool the afternoon heat, and I mostly found myself growing sleepy.</p> <p>Suddenly, the temperature dropped sharply in the room, raising goose bumps on my skin. I\u2019d been nodding off but instantly opened my eyes, wide awake. There was nothing natural about this. Shit, I thought, sitting up. Here it was, the attack we\u2019d been dreading. And I was weaponless because I wasn\u2019t supposed to be practicing any magic. Well, I didn\u2019t need tools to use my gentry magic. If they were bringing the fight to me, then there was no need to remain covert\u2014</p><p>\u201cVolusian?\u201d I asked in disbelief. Red eyes and a small black body materialized in the room\u2019s darkest corner, which really wasn\u2019t all that dark this time of day. He glared at the sunlit window in irritation. I\u2019d been a heartbeat away from summoning a storm in the room and immediately stopped myself.</p><p>\u201cMistress,\u201d he said in his flat tone.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I demanded. \u201cI commanded you not to come!\u201d</p><p>I also hadn\u2019t told him where I was, but that made no difference. With his bonds of service, Volusian would always be able to locate me. Still, I figured not giving him any concrete information beforehand would be useful, in the event someone attempted to wrestle control of him from me. Likewise, I\u2019d commanded him to avoid the Otherworld altogether, in the hopes of keeping him off the radars of those who might try to use him.</p> <p>\u201cYes, mistress,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAnd were it up to me, I assure you, I would stay out of your presence for as long as possible, unless I was coming to end your life and rip you limb from limb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s very thoughtful,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd yet, here you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOthers forced me to, mistress.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d nearly relaxed, but this set me on high alert again. Sending my mind out, I tested the magical bonds that kept him under my control, half expecting them to have vanished. But no, we were still solidly connected.</p><p>\u201cRest assured, mistress, I am still enslaved to you,\u201d he said, guessing what I\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cThen how the hell did others force you to come here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith enough magic, it is possible to compel me to obey small commands while still bound to you,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cThat would take a lot of magic,\u201d I said. Commanding Volusian full-time was difficult enough. Overriding that bond\u2014even for a small order\u2014was equally difficult. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any one gentry who could pull that off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne gentry didn\u2019t,\u201d said Volusian. \u201cKing Dorian and Queen Maiwenn worked together to force me to come to you.\u201d</p><p>I had to replay his words a few times before I finally believed them. \u201cDorian and Maiwenn? Worked together? They\u2019d never do that. You must be confused.\u201d</p><p>Volusian\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cDo I look as though I get easily confused, mistress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ... but ... it doesn\u2019t make any sense... .\u201d</p><p>Oh, sure. Dorian and Maiwenn were both extremely powerful, and I didn\u2019t doubt that together, they could send Volusian to me. I also knew they each had valid reasons for it. Dorian had never approved of me running off here, and Maiwenn ... well, she wanted to kill me. Yet, those reasons didn\u2019t exactly mesh with each other enough to explain why those two would unite.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly did they command you to do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo come to you, mistress, and tell you they have a message for you. They also told me the message\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they command you to actually tell me the exact message?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d I said, relieved I wouldn\u2019t have to magically counteract them. \u201cThat\u2019s an order.\u201d</p><p>Volusian\u2019s face remained typically expressionless. \u201cMy mistress is not curious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I lied. I was terribly curious. But, I also didn\u2019t want to be swayed by anything those two had to say. I didn\u2019t want to hear Dorian\u2019s pleas about me coming back, no matter how well-intentioned he might be\u2014partially because I was afraid I might want to give in. I also didn\u2019t want to find out what Maiwenn\u2019s role was in this. If she\u2019d convinced Dorian to work with her, then maybe she had some song to sing about how she\u2019d seen the errors of her ways and no longer had a hit out on me. I certainly didn\u2019t believe that, and honestly, I had a difficult time imagining him buying it either.</p><p>Some worried part of me wondered if maybe it wasn\u2019t about me and the prophecy after all. What if something had happened to Jasmine? In that case, Dorian would have found a way to tell Roland, and I had to believe my stepfather would\u2019ve gotten that news to me. I supposed the other possibility was that something was wrong with my lands. Maybe they were suffering from my absence more than I\u2019d realized. Yet, when I touched those threads that connected us\u2014even across worlds\u2014I felt nothing particularly concerning. I was still joined to my kingdoms and had sensed none of the desperate longing from them that I had in the past when I\u2019d left them with no caretaker. Honestly, I sensed no emotion at all from the lands. If anything, the connection felt kind of numbed, probably from my absence. Still, it was there, and it was steady.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I repeated. \u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t hear what they have to say. I\u2019ve got a good thing going here. This is the right place for me to be, and I can\u2019t let anything ruin it right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs my mistress wishes,\u201d Volusian replied. \u201cDo you have any further commands for me then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the same ones as before. Avoid the Otherworld. Don\u2019t come here again. Unless ...\u201d Inspiration hit. \u201cIf they try to summon you, come here immediately if you\u2019re able.\u201d I didn\u2019t know if Dorian and Maiwenn would attempt the feat again, but it would require a complicated set of spells. If Volusian could get to me first, I could probably strengthen our bond to prevent others\u2019 influence. \u201cCome to me if anyone attempts to summon or compel you. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go.\u201d</p><p>Volusian vanished, and the room instantly returned to its previous temperature. Still, I couldn\u2019t help a small shiver. Dorian and Maiwenn hadn\u2019t found me, not exactly, but they\u2019d come much closer to it than I would\u2019ve liked. I knew sending Volusian away was the smart thing to do, but again, the question nagged at me: Why would those two work together? In some ways, that bothered me as much as Volusian\u2019s visit. Time and distance had made me start to miss Dorian, and some of the old fondness was starting to return. The thought of him playing some game with Maiwenn made all of my kindly feelings start to crumble. What was he up to?</p><p>No matter how hard I tried to push it aside, it was yet another thing to keep me up at night. That, the fear of a gentry attack, and my own pining for my Otherworldly lands continued to wake me up sporadically. I spent my days exhausted, having to nap a lot in the afternoon to make up for what I missed when the rest of the world was sleeping. One night, about a week after Volusian\u2019s visit, something else startled me out of sleep, though I couldn\u2019t readily figure out what it was.</p><p>I lay there in the dark, panicked, stretching my senses to see what had made me wake up. There was nothing magical around, nothing out of the ordinary. I stayed awake for some time, listening and waiting, but still found nothing. I had finally allowed myself to begin to drift off again when a small pain in my pelvis brought me back to alertness. It wasn\u2019t the most uncomfortable thing I\u2019d ever experienced, but it certainly got my attention. A lot of the muscles in my abdomen and back tightened as well, and I caught my breath, waiting for it to pass. After several seconds, it did, and my body relaxed.</p><p>I rolled to my other side, wide awake now. I had no clock in my room and couldn\u2019t say for sure how much time passed, but eventually, I felt that same muscle seizing and pain, only slightly more intense than before.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d I said aloud.</p><p>I eased myself out of bed and turned on the light. I found some drawstring yoga pants that I put on with the oversize T-shirt I\u2019d gone to sleep in. Trudging down the hall, I made my way to Candace and Charles\u2019s bedroom door and knocked. She opened it in about five seconds, an athame in one hand and a gun in the other.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked immediately, peering behind me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I think I might be in labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas your water broken? Are your contractions more than five minutes apart?\u201d Before I could even muster an answer, she turned and yelled, \u201cCharles, wake up! Just like we practiced!\u201d</p><p>And to my astonishment, it appeared they really had been practicing this. I was glad someone had because I certainly hadn\u2019t. Most of what I knew about childbirth came from TV, when people would boil water and make bandages out of sheets. I was pretty sure modern medicine had advanced past that, but I hadn\u2019t bothered taking any sort of labor class. There\u2019d been too much else going on, and I figured I could always do it \u201clater.\u201d I\u2019d kept telling myself I had plenty of time. In fact, that was the problem. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s too early,\u201d I said from the backseat of the Reeds\u2019 car. Candace had taken it upon herself to drive because she was certain Charles would \u201cfollow the speed limit.\u201d He rode in the passenger seat, carrying a bag they\u2019d long ago packed on my behalf. \u201cThis has to be something else. I\u2019m only ... what, twenty-nine weeks? I\u2019ve got eleven more to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwins come early all the time,\u201d said Candace, in a matter-of-fact tone that made me think she\u2019d been doing a lot of reading up on the subject.</p><p>\u201cBut why would mine?\u201d I argued, knowing I sounded like a petulant child. \u201cI\u2019ve done everything right. The doctors always say everything\u2019s fine with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSometimes nature has its own ideas,\u201d said Charles in that gentle way of his.</p><p>Indeed it did. When I was admitted to the hospital, the obstetrician on call was initially optimistic that they might be able to halt this labor and prolong the pregnancy, even though my contractions were picking up in frequency and intensity. Her words relieved me, even though she also mentioned something about future \u201cbed rest\u201d that made me uneasy. Still, that panicked voice inside me kept repeating, Too early, too early! If we could delay this, we had to, even if it meant me staying immobile and miserable. Health reasons were key, obviously, but there was also the simple fact that ... well, I wasn\u2019t ready for my new arrivals just yet.</p><p>Once I was in a room and the doctor was able to examine me more closely, her story changed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid they\u2019re coming whether you\u2019re ready or not,\u201d she told me, face serious. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of birthing plan you had, but we\u2019re going to have to do an emergency C-section. They\u2019re not turned the right way. Pretty common when twins come this early.\u201d</p><p>Was she kidding? I didn\u2019t have any plan, let alone a birthing one. My doctor in Ohio had also mentioned caesareans were common with twins. I admired the efficiency of the procedure but wasn\u2019t thrilled about being cut open\u2014or the extra recovery time. Still, wasn\u2019t this exactly why I\u2019d chosen to come to the human world for delivery? I\u2019d wanted to be in the hands of modern medicine, and this was as modern as it got.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said resolutely. Not that I had a choice. \u201cLet\u2019s do what we have to.\u201d</p> <p>Things moved quickly after that. In some ways, that was good. It gave me little time to worry because someone was constantly giving instructions or doing something to me. I was taken to an operating room with a flurry of activity, Candace by my side in scrubs. An anesthesiologist inserted something in my spine, and like that, all feeling below my waist disappeared. It was strange to say the least, but I was glad to be free of the pain of my contractions.</p><p>Whenever I thought of surgery, I thought of being knocked out and waking up later. So, even though I knew this spinal method was better, there was some part of my brain that said it wasn\u2019t natural to be awake while people were operating on you. The medical staff erected a small curtain above my waist so that Candace and I couldn\u2019t see what they were doing. I could feel it, though\u2014yet had no pain from it. There was just the pressure of a knife in my skin and muscle. I winced.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d asked Candace worriedly. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I assured her, trying to put on a brave face. \u201cIt\u2019s just ... strange.\u201d</p><p>I had an easier time with the thought of monsters beating me up and tossing me around than calmly allowing a surgeon to cut into me. I wondered if that came from living among the gentry for so long or if it was simply my nature to resist being helpless in the hands of others.</p><p>Between the sheets and numbness, it wasn\u2019t easy to tell how they were progressing. So, I was caught off-guard when a nurse said, \u201cIt\u2019s the girl.\u201d</p> <p>She lifted the squirming baby up to give me a quick look, and I felt dizzier than any drug could have made me.</p><p>A girl. My daughter. Everything I\u2019d done these last seven months had been for both twins, but she had been the force that initially spurred me to action. Kiyo had given me argument after argument about how her brother was some terrible creature that couldn\u2019t be allowed to live, yet I\u2019d been unable to sacrifice her along the way. And now, here she was. I felt worlds away from where I\u2019d been upon first seeing her on an ultrasound.</p><p>I had no time for further philosophical musings because they soon spirited her away. Her brother came shortly thereafter, presented to me in the same quick manner.</p><p>He made a small, piteous cry, and I tried to remember if the girl had cried or not. Everything had happened too quickly. Again, I got only a brief look before he was whisked away, with explanations of \u201coxygen\u201d and \u201cNICU.\u201d In that momentary assessment, I didn\u2019t see any conqueror of worlds. I only saw a baby, a very, very small one, who seemed surprised and upset to have to face what the world had in store for him.</p><p>I knew how he felt.</p><p>Even with the most intense part over, there was still more to do. There was the afterbirth to deal with, then the stitching and cleanup. My incision was stapled, and I couldn\u2019t even fathom trying to explain that to a gentry. The entire process seemed too quick and too neatly wrapped up for its magnitude. Candace stayed as close as they\u2019d let her throughout the whole ordeal, finally returning to my side when I was in presentable shape. She clasped her hands together, face shining.</p><p>\u201cDid you see them?\u201d she asked wonderingly. \u201cOh, Eugenie. They\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>They were, I realized. My glimpses had been quick, but those images were etched permanently in my memory. I wanted to see them again, as soon as possible. I was forced to wait, though, while the staff did whatever it was the babies needed in the NICU. Tests were run, and there was nothing I could do but bide my time until the obstetrician sat down with me again.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re both nearly three pounds each,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is fantastic. Twenty-nine weeks is definitely viable, but it\u2019s always better the more weight they\u2019ve got.\u201d That would be Candace\u2019s cooking and food agenda, I supposed. \u201cTheir lungs aren\u2019t as developed as a full-term baby\u2019s would be, of course, but we\u2019re able to help with that. All in all, they\u2019re in remarkably good shape. They\u2019ll need to stay here for a while, but at this point, I\u2019m really pleased with the prognosis.\u201d</p><p>After a little more medical talk, they finally let me go to the twins. I was wheeled down, which seemed like overkill, but the nurses assured me I\u2019d understand once some of my pain medication wore off. Candace and Charles accompanied me. He said something about having called Evan, but I didn\u2019t pay much attention. My only thought was that the nurse needed to get me to NICU faster. When we reached it, I wasn\u2019t fully prepared for what I found.</p><p>The twins were there, each in their own glass-encased bed. They weren\u2019t the only things in the box. Each twin was connected to feeding tubes and a ventilator, a world of dizzying machinery. It all seemed too big and too scary for such little people. Something caught in my throat.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know there\u2019d be so much ... stuff,\u201d I managed to say.</p><p>The nurse had a kind, compassionate face. Exactly what you\u2019d want from someone in this job. \u201cI know the machinery\u2019s intimidating, but don\u2019t focus on that. Focus on what it\u2019s doing. It\u2019s helping make sure they\u2019ll both get healthy and strong so they can go home with you.\u201d</p><p>I gave a weak nod and hastily ran a hand over my eyes. Had I really been afraid of these two? And how could anyone have wanted to harm them? They were so tiny, like little dolls, and looked so terribly helpless. I felt guilty and ineffectual, like I should have done something to delay their birth. Or like I should be doing something now. I was their mother. Wasn\u2019t it my job to protect them? I supposed, so far, I had, but now it was out of my hands.</p><p>They didn\u2019t look like the downy, cherublike babies on TV. There was a fragility to their limbs, hands, and feet that, again, reminded me of dolls. Their skin was pink and blotchy, yet I could tell I was the parent they\u2019d taken after. They had my coloring and didn\u2019t appear to have inherited any of Kiyo\u2019s features. Small blessings.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you call them?\u201d asked Charles.</p><p>Unlike everything else in this ordeal, I actually had an answer for that. My long days had given me a lot of time to ponder names, which were a much safer mental challenge than the rest of my life. It would be nice to say I\u2019d come up with really symbolic names or names of great people who\u2019d left some impact on my life. Nope. It was a much simpler matter than that. I simply gave them names I liked. Ordinary names. The kinds of names a person shaped\u2014not ones that shaped a person.</p><p>\u201cIvy and Isaac,\u201d I said. I was a fan of alliteration.</p><p>Candace and Charles seemed pleased by the choices. I\u2019d once heard her go off on \u201cthe ridiculous things people name their children these days,\u201d so I think she was relieved I hadn\u2019t made up some weird monstrosity for them.</p><p>\u201cThese are amazing times we live in,\u201d she said, looking down at Ivy. \u201cImagine having these little ones a hundred years ago. What would\u2019ve happened then?\u201d</p><p>Or, I thought, what would\u2019ve happened if they\u2019d been born in the Otherworld? Because I had to assume they would\u2019ve come early there too, in a position not suitable for natural birth. Dorian had seemed confident of his healers\u2019 magic to handle anything, but I wasn\u2019t so sure\u2014especially considering the gentry track record with infants. I couldn\u2019t believe anything the Otherworld could offer would match the care the twins were getting now. And I knew in that moment that everything I\u2019d been through\u2014turning my back on the Otherworld, coping with boredom, keeping away from magic\u2014had all been worth it.</p><p>I gazed at my children and sighed happily. \u201cWe\u2019re exactly where we need to be.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>The next few weeks were surreal, and for the first time since coming to Alabama, I no longer worried about the Otherworld or filling my time. Isaac and Ivy consumed my life.</p><p>Not that there was much I could do for them. They were in the hands of the doctors and NICU nurses. Initially, I was able to pump breast milk for the twins to supplement the high-calorie formula they were also being fed. I was a little weirded out by being hooked up to a machine, but it was worth it to feel like I was contributing something. In time, it became clear I was one of those women who simply couldn\u2019t produce milk very well, and I wondered if it was the result of my half-gentry heritage, since their women often had similar problems. Regardless, after two weeks, I stopped my attempts, and the twins went on a strictly formula diet. Some of the nurses tried to reassure me that the best antibodies came in the early days and that I\u2019d done a good job in giving what I could. I knew current thinking recommended breast-feeding for much longer, however, again making me feel woefully inadequate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So, my contribution simply became frequent, daily visits. I watched my children and the machines that supported them, silently counting each breath and heartbeat. I liked to think that Isaac and Ivy could sense my presence, even from inside their boxes. Maybe that was just wishful thinking, but it gave me some hope. I was rarely alone in my visits. One of the Reeds was almost always with me, and I took comfort from that too.</p><p>It was probably one of the most stressful times in my life, but progress was made in tiny, agonizing steps. The twins\u2019 prognosis remained good, and before long I was allowed to touch them inside their compartments. The first time I did it, brushing Ivy\u2019s hand, was like a miracle unfolding before me. I was certain I\u2019d never felt anything so soft. And as the one-month mark neared, I was told Isaac and Ivy might have to stay for only one more month, based on their progress. I barely heard that part because it was immediately followed by two pieces of good news. The doctors expected the ventilators to come off soon and also that the twins would be in good enough condition that I could hold them.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even imagine that,\u201d I said to Evan as he drove me home that evening. \u201cFrom the minute they were born, they\u2019ve been these fragile, unreal little things.... To be able to hold them ...\u201d I sighed and leaned my head back. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p> <p>He flashed me a quick smile. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll let the rest of us have a turn.\u201d I smiled back. In the beginning, I\u2019d thought his visits were simply as a kindness to me. Soon, I\u2019d realized he was coming to regard the twins with as much affection as his aunt and uncle did. He\u2019d gaze at them wonderingly, eyes shining as he let himself get lost in thought.</p><p>\u201cWell, there are two of them,\u201d I joked. \u201cThe problem might be having enough hands to hold them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in this family,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to fight us off.\u201d</p><p>We reached Candace and Charles\u2019s house, and I felt like I was floating ten feet off the ground. My mood was brighter than it had been in some time, and my physical condition was equally good. Spending so much time sitting and waiting had given me a chance to heal from most of the side effects of surgery. My staples had been removed ages ago, and I\u2019d even gone back on birth control pills out of habit, though sex was pretty far off my radar just now. The waiting and inactivity were probably the only positive parts of the twins being confined to the NICU. I had no doubt that had things been different with them, I would\u2019ve been out foolishly taxing my body long before its time.</p><p>\u201cLooks like a visitor,\u201d said Evan, turning the car off.</p> <p>I followed his gaze. I\u2019d been so consumed by my own joy that I hadn\u2019t even noticed a strange car parked in the driveway. It was nothing I recognized, though I did spot a rental sticker on it. I wasn\u2019t particularly concerned, since Candace\u2019s clients sometimes came by in person. Plus, if there\u2019d been some danger, I knew she would have called us and warned us away.</p><p>We walked inside, and I could hear voices from the kitchen. I practically sprinted in, anxious to share the good news with Candace and Charles. Like Evan had said, I had no doubt they\u2019d be lining up to take their turns holding the twins. When I entered the kitchen and saw who was there, though, I came to an abrupt halt. My happy words faltered on my lips, but a few seconds later, a new joy spread through me.</p><p>\u201cRoland!\u201d</p><p>I hurried into his arms, and he gripped me tightly. Until that moment, I hadn\u2019t realized how much I\u2019d missed him. The Reeds had become an adoptive family to me, but they could never replace Roland and my mom. Not having those two around during this part of my life felt strange and wrong sometimes.</p><p>When he finally released me, I saw his eyes were wet with emotion. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cWe\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too,\u201d I said, feeling very young. \u201cAnd Mom.\u201d</p> <p>Introductions were made with Evan, and then we all sat down at the table. Pictures of the twins were scattered everywhere. The NICU had been no deterrent to Candace, who brought a camera nearly every day.</p><p>\u201cI heard the good news,\u201d Roland said. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for you. They\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we got some good news about them today.\u201d How could I have forgotten my big announcement? As expected, Candace and Charles were delighted at the thought of holding Isaac and Ivy. \u201cYou need to come see them,\u201d I added to Roland. \u201cWe could go back tonight. Or in the morning. How long will you be around?\u201d</p><p>It was at that moment, as the question left my lips, that I realized something. Roland wasn\u2019t supposed to be here. That had been an unquestionable part of the plan from its inception. Roland could be tracked, and no matter how much we might miss each other, distance was the safest option. I met his eyes and could tell he knew what I had just realized.</p><p>\u201cNot sure,\u201d he said vaguely. \u201cBut I can definitely make time to see them.\u201d His evasive answer didn\u2019t surprise me. His presence must mean there\u2019d been some Otherworldly development, and that wasn\u2019t a topic we could discuss with the Reeds. A glint in his eye told me we\u2019d talk about it later, and I gave a quick nod of understanding.</p><p>Dinner was requisite, of course, and conversation shifted to happier topics, like the twins and Candace\u2019s cooking. I couldn\u2019t get enough of talking about Isaac and Ivy, yet at the same time, a nagging feeling dimmed some of my joy. Roland being here couldn\u2019t be a good thing.</p><p>Our chance to talk finally came later when Evan left and Candace and Charles settled down to watch the evening news. Roland and I went on a walk around the Reeds\u2019 vast property, ensuring we\u2019d have ample privacy.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here\u2014you have no idea how glad\u2014but there must be a reason you\u2019d risk someone from the Otherworld following you.\u201d</p> <p>Roland sighed and came to a halt beside a pecan tree. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing. There\u2019s no risk because no one\u2019s trying to find you anymore.\u201d</p><p>I stared incredulously. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s ... that\u2019s impossible. Of course they are. Kingdoms were on the verge of war because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got bigger things to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBigger things than the divisive prophecy saying my son will lead their armies into conquering this world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazingly, yes.\u201d He gazed up at the starry sky, gathering his thoughts. \u201cI guess it started ... oh, I don\u2019t know ... a month or maybe a month and a half ago. It seems the Otherworld\u2014or rather, large parts of it\u2014were struck by a blight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that entail exactly?\u201d I asked. For some reason, \u201cblight\u201d made me think of barren fields and locust plagues.</p><p>\u201cWinter,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cPerpetual winter. And not just any winter\u2014pretty much the worst you can imagine. It came without warning. Steady snow and frigid temperatures that kill people and crops. I wouldn\u2019t have believed it until I saw it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich kingdoms?\u201d I asked, frowning. Most of the lands remained in a permanent climate\u2014a pleasant one\u2014like mine and Dorian\u2019s kingdoms. Some monarchs did have their kingdoms cycle through four seasons, but they did so with the same kind of preparation that we did in the human world, making sure there were provisions put aside for the winter. Maiwenn\u2019s kingdom was like this.</p><p>Roland\u2019s face was grim. \u201cAll of them. At least, most of the ones in your \u2018neighborhood.\u2019 Some farther-out ones were spared, but everything you know was struck.\u201d</p><p>The implications didn\u2019t hit me immediately, and when they did, I wasn\u2019t sure I believed them. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean ... not ... not my kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>His only answer was a nod.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible. I mean, the Thorn Land\u2019s a desert! And besides, I would know... .\u201d Yet, even as I spoke, I wondered if that was true. Would I know? I had removed myself from the land, leaving it to Jasmine\u2019s care. I didn\u2019t connect with it in a deep way anymore. All I had was that steady humming that told me my bond to my kingdoms was in place\u2014a bond, I realized, that had felt numb recently. I\u2019d written it off to distance or Jasmine\u2019s caretaking. \u201cIt\u2019s not because of Jasmine, is it? Like, did the land not accept her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing the point again, Eugenie. It\u2019s everywhere. Yours. Dorian\u2019s. Everyone\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDorian\u2019s ...\u201d</p><p>That was what really drove the point home. Despite Roland\u2019s words, there was some part of me that could still blame my absence for the blight in my own lands. Other kingdoms\u2019 suffering could be written off to weak monarchs. But Dorian? Dorian was strong. His bond to his kingdom was rock solid, his control of it absolute. If there was any monarch whose power would protect his land against impossible odds, it would be Dorian, followed closely by Maiwenn.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they wanted, isn\u2019t it? Dorian and Maiwenn summoned Volusian to come to me with some message, and I sent him away. I thought it was a ploy, but it wasn\u2019t\u2014was it? They were trying to tell me about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost likely,\u201d agreed Roland. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard about that. Dorian only recently got in touch with me to convince me to come over and see it for myself. Then he begged me to let you know what was happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDorian doesn\u2019t beg,\u201d I murmured, still stunned.</p><p>Roland stared off into the shadows, his face troubled. \u201cUnder most circumstances, I wouldn\u2019t have told you. People can\u2019t live in cold like that, and those who survive have no food. You know how I feel about the gentry. But when I actually saw it ... the death and sickness. Well. I don\u2019t know, Eugenie. I don\u2019t like them, but no one should suffer like that. Not even the gentry.\u201d</p><p>I sank down to the grass, mostly because I felt exhausted in mind rather than body. My lands. My kingdoms were suffering ... had been suffering for a long time ... and I hadn\u2019t known. Maybe I could leave Otherworldly politics behind. Maybe I could even leave my enemies behind. But the land was part of me. I was responsible for it, and I had failed it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I can do,\u201d I said. \u201cEven if I went back ... I mean, if Dorian and Maiwenn haven\u2019t come up with any ideas, I\u2019m not sure I could do better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey mentioned something about uniting powers to attempt to break the spell.... I didn\u2019t really follow that, though.\u201d Roland\u2019s tone conveyed that even if he pitied the gentry for their suffering, their magic was still something he had no use for. \u201cDorian also has some ideas about who\u2019s responsible.\u201d</p><p>Of course he would. Even if his own magical attempts proved ineffectual, Dorian wouldn\u2019t sit idly by. He\u2019d try to solve this mystery. My knowledge of the situation was limited, but I tried to figure out where his thought process might go. I jumped back to one of Roland\u2019s earlier comments, about how some outlying kingdoms hadn\u2019t been affected.</p> <p>\u201cWho isn\u2019t under the blight?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou said a few weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Yew Land is one,\u201d said Roland, looking surprised at my leap. \u201cThat\u2019s who Dorian thinks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014is responsible?\u201d I guessed.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause as much as I hate to admit it, I know how Dorian thinks. If some places were affected and some weren\u2019t, I\u2019d look at the unaffected ones too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Dorian said.\u201d Roland didn\u2019t look pleased that I could \u201cthink like Dorian,\u201d and I could definitely understand his dismay. \u201cBut that\u2019s not all. Apparently, they\u2019re making quite a profit off of food. Their land\u2014and I guess their, what, subsidiaries?\u2014are still able to grow and produce food, and they have no qualms about selling it to the stricken lands at very, very high prices.\u201d</p><p>I was aghast. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p><p>Roland shrugged. \u201cBut some of the monarchs are willing to pay, rather than see their people suffer. And it\u2019s better than the alternative... .\u201d</p><p>I looked up sharply at his ominous tone. \u201cWhat alternative?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStealing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the Yew Land?\u201d I certainly didn\u2019t endorse theft but was surprised Roland would care one way or another about gentry stealing from each other.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom humans. There are gentry who have been raiding our world for food and supplies.\u201d</p><p>I gaped, unable to immediately form a response. I knew better than to say \u201cthat\u2019s impossible\u201d again, but it was still hard to believe. \u201cIf there were elementals going on food rampages, I think I would\u2019ve heard about that. They\u2019re not exactly subtle, and there are only a handful of gentry who can cross over in true form.\u201d Dorian was one, but I knew with absolute confidence he\u2019d never lower himself to that.</p><p>\u201cA handful is all it takes,\u201d said Roland. \u201cAnd those are exactly the ones doing this\u2014not the elementals. One of them\u2019s that boy ... the one I saw that day in the Rowan Land, whose sister had been attacked? You know him, right?\u201d</p><p>I jumped back on my feet. \u201cPagiel? No. No way. He wouldn\u2019t ... no.\u201d Once again, though, I had to question myself. Pagiel was entirely capable of crossing worlds intact. Even though I knew he was good at heart, I also knew he had a fierce, passionate streak about the things he believed in. He\u2019d made it clear\u2014both in his defense of me and his sister\u2014that he didn\u2019t care about the dangers involved if it meant doing what he believed was right. And if ever there was a cause that would trigger all his noble impulses, wouldn\u2019t it be feeding his starving people?</p><p>Yes, Pagiel as an Otherworldly Robin Hood was very much a possibility. With his powers to control wind and air, he\u2019d also be a formidable\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh Lord,\u201d I said. A flashback came to me of that weird story in the news about a Tucson robbery. \u201cI saw something about a grocery store in Tucson. That was him, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Roland. \u201cWith a couple cronies. The one good thing is that they\u2019re pretty fast and efficient. Most humans don\u2019t know what they\u2019re seeing when the hits occur, so there hasn\u2019t been any mass hysteria about supernatural invaders\u2014yet. And that\u2019s the thing... .\u201d</p><p>I snapped myself out of my dizzying ruminations and focused on him. The lines of his face were hard ... and filled with sorrow. \u201cWhat is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you know how hard it was for me to come to you? I swore nothing would get me out here ... no matter how many of those bastards come knocking at my door or tried to get me to tell where you were at.\u201d I flinched, wondering just \u201chow many\u201d there had been. \u201cI was willing to maintain the plan, no matter what, for as long as it took to keep you safe ... and then all this came along. Never in a million years could I have foreseen this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could have,\u201d I said softly. Roland was usually unshakeable; it was hard to see him so worked up.</p><p>\u201cWhen I saw those people, what they were going through ... that nearly made me come for you then and there. Then, when I found out what that boy was doing ... well, that sealed it. We can\u2019t have that, Eugenie. You know we can\u2019t. If other gentry catch on to what he\u2019s doing and realize they too can just march on over and take what they want, you can imagine the chaos that would follow. What\u2019s really awful about it all is that in some twisted way, I understand why he\u2019s doing it. He\u2019s a kid. He sees a problem, and he\u2019s trying to fix it. God help me, maybe I\u2019d do the same in his place.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to me then that Roland\u2019s emotion wasn\u2019t just because he\u2019d come to me in exile or because of gentry going on rabid shopping trips. Those were upsetting him, but the real problem was that Roland\u2019s worldview had been shaken. He\u2019d spent his life in the shamanic trade, crossing worlds and ousting those who didn\u2019t belong in ours. His view of the gentry had never been good, and it had worsened when he\u2019d rescued my mother and later seen the way I\u2019d been ensnared in magical schemes. Yet, now, through a weird series of events, against everything he\u2019d always told himself, he\u2019d suddenly come to see the gentry as ... people.</p><p>Having your beliefs radically altered like that\u2014no matter what your age was\u2014could be devastating. I knew that from personal experience.</p><p>I hugged him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said, unable to remember any time in my life when I\u2019d comforted him. \u201cYou did the right thing in coming to me. You\u2019re right to feel like you do. I feel the same. It\u2019s terrible\u2014all of it.\u201d</p><p>Roland awkwardly patted my back, and I knew he felt embarrassed by his emotions. With another sigh, he stepped back and regarded me wearily. \u201cYes, but what do we do about it? I can fight that kid off, you know. His hits are in Tucson\u2014probably because of the gates\u2014and I could easily call in a few outside shamans to help me. Still, I think a little reasoning might go farther.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would,\u201d I agreed. \u201cEspecially if it came from me.\u201d It was also preferable to Pagiel getting banished. Unfortunately, me \u201creasoning\u201d with him was easier said than done. \u201cI have to go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEugenie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do it,\u201d I said, more to myself than Roland. \u201cI\u2019ll be exposing myself, but it\u2019ll be worth it\u2014especially now that I\u2019m not pregnant. Except, the thing is, if I leave here and let myself be known again ...\u201d Here it was, the awful truth that had been building within me since Roland explained about the blight. \u201cIf I go to Tucson, I might as well go to the Otherworld while I\u2019m at it. Once I\u2019m out of here, I\u2019m out. If there\u2019s some way I can help undo what\u2019s been done and save my people\u2014to save everyone\u2019s people\u2014then I should do it.\u201d</p><p>I could tell by his face that he\u2019d been thinking along those lines but wasn\u2019t happy about the options either. \u201cThey really are distracted,\u201d he said. \u201cYour enemies. They\u2019d probably leave you alone if you could help them.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI know. I\u2019m not worried about myself. I\u2019m worried about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe twins.\u201d</p><p>I nodded again.</p><p>He took a long time in responding. \u201cWell, the thing is, we can pull you out of here without anyone Otherworldly knowing where you were. And that means no one will know where the twins are either. They\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThen what ... ?\u201d</p><p>Something in my stomach sank. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave them, plus I won\u2019t be able to contact them or get updates. And if I go to the Otherworld ... well, you know how these things are. There\u2019s no telling how long I\u2019ll be gone.\u201d The first time I\u2019d gone to the Otherworld, I\u2019d intended to make a quick late-night jaunt. By the time that mess was over, I\u2019d ended up queen of the Thorn Land. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be away from them. I know it\u2019s silly. They probably don\u2019t even know I\u2019m there, but I can\u2019t help it. I just feel ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a mother,\u201d he said. He put his arm back around me, seeming more at ease as the one doing the comforting.</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it\u2019d happen. I\u2019ve spent all these months afraid of them, afraid of what was happening to my body ... and now that they\u2019re here, I can\u2019t imagine how I got by without them. Like I said, it\u2019s silly ... especially since I\u2019ve barely touched them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not silly at all.\u201d He was quiet for a few moments. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go, you know. It\u2019s a mess, but no one expects you to take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. These are my people\u2014in the Otherworld and in Tucson. How could I ignore them and then try to teach my children to do what\u2019s right? I would always know I\u2019d abandoned everyone else. Of course, if gentry start regularly raiding our world, my failure would hardly be a secret.\u201d I laughed but found little humor in anything right now. I leaned my head against his chest, like I used to when I was little. \u201cI have to do this. Isaac and Ivy will be okay. No one knows they\u2019re here, and Candace and Charles have enough love for quintuplets. If the twins are discharged before I get back, they\u2019ll be more than taken care of. It\u2019s just ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>I felt tears start to form in my eyes and willed them away. \u201cI just wish I\u2019d gotten the all-clear on holding them before I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can wait,\u201d he said. \u201cWait until you can hold them, then go to the Otherworld.\u201d</p> <p>For a moment, I was tempted. Nothing seemed more important in the world\u2014in any world\u2014than having my son and daughter in my arms. But the longer I put off dealing with the blight, the more people would suffer. Plus, I had an uneasy feeling that if I waited much longer, I might never actually leave. My life here had been slow and comfortable, which had been good for me. It was what I had needed. It was what the twins still needed. Staying here, living a sweet, uncomplicated life with them and the Reeds would be easy. I could sink into this life and never look back....</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cThe sooner I take care of this blight business, the sooner I can come back to Isaac and Ivy.\u201d</p><p>Roland held me tightly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Eugenie. I\u2019m proud of you, but I\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d I said, pulling gently away. \u201cThis is the right thing to do. But before we leave, there\u2019s something else we have to do.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a curious look. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>I caught hold of his hand and tugged him forward. \u201cCome meet your grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Leaving was even harder than I\u2019d thought it would be. And believe me, I\u2019d expected it to be pretty hard.</p><p>It was one thing to talk of sacrifice with Roland, when I was away from Isaac and Ivy and fired up by the thought of saving the Otherworld and stopping Pagiel from pillaging among humans. Going forward with that decision, in the light of day, proved to be an entirely different matter\u2014especially when I was back at the hospital throughout the following week. It didn\u2019t help that the hospital staff kept regarding me like I was crazy. I knew they couldn\u2019t imagine any \u201cfamily emergency\u201d in the world that would be important enough to justify leaving the bedsides of my NICU-BOUND children. The nurses didn\u2019t judge\u2014not openly\u2014but I was certain I could see the disapproval in their eyes.</p><p>Or maybe I was just projecting.</p><p>The Reeds were equally astonished, but they had enough faith in Roland and me to believe that whatever cause was taking me away must be important. A good part of what delayed my departure was filling out the reams of paperwork that named Charles and Candace as the twins\u2019 guardians in my absence. Presuming the twins were discharged before my return, Charles and Candace would be allowed to take Isaac and Ivy back to their home. Whenever I started discussing money to help cover the costs that such a venture would entail, nobody would listen to me.</p> <p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Candace exclaimed as we were eating lunch in the hospital\u2019s cafeteria one day. I had just brought up\u2014for the tenth time\u2014the idea of Roland and me pooling funds to buy baby supplies. \u201cI won\u2019t hear of it. What are a few baby things here and there? It\u2019ll be nothing at all.\u201d</p><p>I might almost have believed her if I hadn\u2019t discovered a book on \u201cbaby essentials\u201d lying around their house, with a shopping list in Candace\u2019s handwriting tucked inside. Most items\u2014and there were a lot more than \u201ca few\u201d\u2014had had \u201cx 2\u201d written next to them, which didn\u2019t reassure me any.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much,\u201d I argued. \u201cYou guys can\u2019t afford\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what we can or can\u2019t afford,\u201d she scolded. \u201cYou just take care of whatever it is you need to and get back to them. We\u2019ll worry about those little ones. You don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>It was impossible not to worry about them, though. No matter how often I told myself that the twins were out of immediate danger and simply had to fulfill their NICU time, I couldn\u2019t help but fear maybe a doctor had missed something. Likewise, although I never doubted the Reeds\u2019 love and devotion, I kept imagining worst-case scenarios. Candace had a dangerous job, after all. What if something happened to her? Would Charles be able to care for them on his own? Would he and Evan have to move in together to take care of the twins, like in some wacky sitcom?</p><p>These imaginings delayed me day after day until, one afternoon, Roland called me into Candace\u2019s home office. He\u2019d been checking his e-mail on her computer and beckoned me over to his side. \u201cLook at this,\u201d he said, flipping to a news website.</p><p>I leaned over his shoulder and felt my heart sink. \u201cOh Lord,\u201d I muttered. The story was about a group of \u201chooligans\u201d who had raided and robbed an outdoor farmers market in Phoenix\u2014on horseback. Reports and witnesses were as sketchy as the Tucson theft had been on TV, but there was no doubt in my mind that this had been Otherworldly in origin. The nature of the farmers market had probably made it easier for them. Food, pure and simple, with easy accessibility. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose they rode their horses from Tucson to Phoenix?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlikely,\u201d Roland said, leaning back in the chair with a sigh. \u201cEspecially since people report that they seemed to have \u2018vanished.\u2019 My guess is they\u2019re just using a new gate. I know a couple up in that area.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded along, trying to merge my mental maps of this world and the Otherworld. \u201cThere\u2019s a Phoenix one in the Willow Land. If hostilities really have been lifted, then Maiwenn would probably let Pagiel use it.\u201d I sat down cross-legged on the floor, feeling a quick spark of pride at how quickly I was regaining my flexibility. \u201cI wonder if we should be relieved Tucson isn\u2019t the sole target\u2014or worry that Pagiel\u2019s spreading out to other gates and other cities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should be concerned that these raids are still going on, period. If you still think you\u2019re up for leaving, we should probably do it soon.\u201d His tone was hard, all-business, but I saw compassion in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still up for it,\u201d I said sadly. \u201cEverything\u2019s in place. If you can book us a flight for tomorrow, I\u2019ll be ready to go.\u201d Every word of that was true, but the finality of it was a hard thing to accept.</p><p>Roland made it happen. Candace and Charles sent us off with a huge farewell dinner of chicken and dumplings, though for once, the focus was less on the food and more on tying up all the loose ends and red tape with Isaac and Ivy. The morning of our flight, Roland and I left extra early so that we could make one more visit to the hospital. I don\u2019t know if my timing was just lucky or if the staff felt sorry for me, but the nurse declared we\u2019d reached a point where it would be okay for us to hold the twins.</p><p>I could scarcely dare to believe my good fortune. The ventilators were off, but there were still lots of cords and tubes to contend with, making everything a delicate balancing act. Roland and I were each given a twin, and after a little while, we switched. Looking down at Isaac, I felt my breath catch. Although still definitely a preemie, he\u2019d put on weight and looked much more \u201cbabylike\u201d than he had at birth. Now that they were both a little more developed, I was more confident than ever that they\u2019d taken after me and not Kiyo. It was just as well since they had my last name and would never have any contact with him.</p><p>Isaac slept the entire time I held him, making the small movements and coos that infants do in their sleep. He seemed very content, and I again wondered if he was aware of my presence in any way. Maybe that had been na\u00efve of me to imagine when I was on the other side of the glass, but now, in my arms, he must surely feel some sort of subconscious connection ... right?</p><p>So much has been done because of you, I thought. A world nearly went to war for you, and I had to change the way I lived to keep you safe. It had been worth it, though, and I dared to wonder if maybe this current tragedy in the Otherworld would leave its residents with a new sense of solidarity that would make the Storm King prophecy seem like an irrelevant fantasy from the past. I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever want to bring my children into the Otherworld, but regardless of where they were, I wanted them to live peaceful lives that weren\u2019t plagued by war and prophecy.</p><p>Ivy was actually awake, a rare treat. Her eyes were dark blue, normal for newborns, and I\u2019d been told we\u2019d have to wait a bit to see what color they settled into. I hoped they\u2019d be violet like mine and continue the trend of the twins not looking like Kiyo.</p><p>The visit was too short. I wanted to keep trading twins back and forth with Roland, memorizing every single one of my children\u2019s features. Both the NICU and our airline had their own schedules to keep, however, and we eventually had to give Isaac and Ivy back to their warm, enclosed homes. I left with a lump in my throat and hadn\u2019t gotten very far outside the nursery when I spotted Evan waiting in the hall, leaning patiently against a wall. I came to a stop, and Roland cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the car and meet you up front, okay?\u201d he said.</p><p>I nodded as he left and strolled over to Evan. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I asked. \u201cNot that I\u2019m not happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>Evan straightened up, giving me one of his warm smiles. \u201cHere to see you. Sorry I couldn\u2019t come by last night\u2014we had some late back-to-school events I couldn\u2019t miss. So, I wanted to make sure I caught you before you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d I said, surprised at the mix of feelings churning within me. I was still keyed up over my visit with the twins, and seeing him only added to the turmoil. \u201cI would\u2019ve hated to leave without saying good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really good-bye, is it? You\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I agreed. \u201cI just don\u2019t know when.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know we\u2019ll take care of everything, so don\u2019t you worry.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou sound just like your aunt and uncle. Candace keeps saying the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust telling it like it is.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t go without a good reason. So, take care of what you have to, and know that we\u2019re all here for you\u2014and for them.\u201d He nodded toward the nursery. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know ... and I\u2019m sorry ... sorry I have to go... .\u201d</p><p>Evan gently reached out toward me and placed his fingers under my chin, tipping my head up so that I had to look at him. \u201cWhy are you apologizing? You haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>Maybe. The truth was, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure why I was apologizing either. Lots of reasons, I supposed. I felt bad for leaving Isaac and Ivy. I felt bad for leaving Evan.</p> <p>\u201cI just feel like I\u2019m abandoning everyone,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cAbandoning would be taking off without leaving any provisions for your children or if you just left on a whim. None of that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>That well-worn thought came to me again, of how simple life would be here, with him. The \u201csimple\u201d part had nothing to do with the Southern jokes I\u2019d made when Roland first sent me here. It was all about this family, these people with their unconditional love and willingness to let everyone make their own choices. It was about a lifestyle free of politics and schemes. I took hold of Evan\u2019s hand and squeezed it.</p><p>\u201cThank you. For everything. I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a quizzical look. \u201cFor what, taking you fishing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, actually. And all the other million little activities you took me on. You have no idea how much it all meant to me, how much I needed those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, geez,\u201d he said, turning adorably flustered. I even caught sight of a blush. \u201cI was just worried you were bored left alone at the house all day. If I\u2019d known I was being rated, I would\u2019ve taken you on a proper date.\u201d</p><p>I laughed again and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek. \u201cYou did, believe me. Countless times.\u201d</p><p>He blushed further. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that. But when you get back, well ... then maybe ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I agreed, stepping back. Even now, he was still cautious of pushing too hard on my boundaries. \u201cThanks again ... and thank you for, well, for them.\u201d I pointed back at the NICU. \u201cI know you\u2019ll be just as busy with them as your aunt and uncle will be.\u201d</p><p>Evan smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to thank me for when it comes to those two.\u201d</p> <p>Our farewell took some of the sting out of having to leave the twins, but I was left melancholy and wistful for a whole new set of reasons as Roland and I began our journey home.</p><p>After a couple connections and layovers, we finally made it back to Tucson in early evening. For the first time in a very long while, I allowed myself to truly focus on something that wasn\u2019t the twins. Tucson. How long had it been since I\u2019d been here? Even before my time in Huntsville, I\u2019d had to avoid my hometown for fear of gentry assassins. Looking at the Sonora Desert that surrounded the city, bathed in the oranges and reds of sunset, I felt a surge of joy spread through me. Home. Maybe Tucson didn\u2019t have the magical pull of my Otherworldly kingdoms, but I\u2019d ached for it nonetheless.</p><p>My mother cried out in joy when Roland and I walked into their house. She raced forward, catching me in a tight embrace. I thought I heard a muffled sob and hoped she wouldn\u2019t cry because I was pretty sure I\u2019d start crying too. She clung to me for a long time, as though fearing I might vanish again if she let go. When she finally stepped back, she took one look at me and asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d My body wasn\u2019t a hundred percent back to its original shape, but it was pretty obvious I was no longer pregnant.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a grandmother,\u201d I said, opting for simplicity.</p><p>Since it looked like my mom was on the verge of passing out, we all moved to the kitchen table in order to recap what had been happening. Roland and I had plenty of digital pictures to share, and my mother pored over them, a look of wonder on her face that I was pretty sure mirrored mine. She grilled us on the twins\u2019 health and the hospital\u2019s care, then moved on to an examination of the Reeds.</p><p>For her own safety, I didn\u2019t tell my mom where the Reeds lived. As I described them, I had a momentary weird feeling as I realized this all read like some sort of real-life fairy tale. Two children, living in obscurity with a childless couple, only to discover later that they were the offspring of a fairy queen.</p><p>Once my mother was satisfied Ivy and Isaac were getting quality care, she moved on to much more momlike things. \u201cDid you really have to name her Ivy?\u201d my mother asked. She wrinkled her nose. \u201cIt\u2019s such a ... hippie name.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine name. And it sounds nice with Isaac.\u201d</p> <p>My mother looked skeptical. \u201cWell. So do Isabelle and Irene.\u201d</p><p>There was no question I\u2019d stay overnight at their house, but I knew that was probably the only time I could spend in Tucson. My mother would\u2019ve kept me forever if she could, but Roland and I both knew that I couldn\u2019t delay much longer in getting to the Otherworld. I planned on spending most of the next day acquiring gear for the wintry conditions of the Otherworld\u2019s blight. Roland shook his head when I told him that night that I planned on getting my down coat from my own house the next day.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to need more than that,\u201d he said ominously. \u201cYou need to go all out. Scarves, gloves, boots. Then layer up underneath those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is summer in Tucson,\u201d I reminded him, just in case he hadn\u2019t noticed the weather right outside his window. \u201cWhere am I going to find that stuff?\u201d There was actually a thriving ski trade outside of town in the winter, so getting supplies wouldn\u2019t have been that difficult any other time of year.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s out there. You\u2019re just going to have to do a little bit of hunting.\u201d</p><p>He was right. Daytime found me on quite the scavenger hunt as I scoured the city for sporting goods stores that had any meager winter stock. Secondhand stores provided some luck as well, particularly for things like sweaters. My Tucson nostalgia was still going strong, so in some ways, I didn\u2019t mind driving all over. I was able to see all the familiar sights I\u2019d missed and even grab lunch at one of my favorite hole-in-the-wall Southwest restaurants.</p><p>Late afternoon found me back in the Catalina Foothills, heading toward my own house. Just like everything else around here, it had been months since I\u2019d been to the house. I pulled into the driveway and sat in my car for several minutes, taking in the familiar view. It looked exactly the way I\u2019d left it, with its stucco finish and rock garden of a lawn. The house wasn\u2019t big\u2014it only had two bedrooms\u2014but there\u2019d been plenty of space for my needs. Plus, it had been mine, my own sanctuary, in a way that even the Otherworldly castles weren\u2019t, seeing as those always had people coming and going.</p><p>I\u2019d gotten a spare key from my parents and let myself inside, relieved the locks hadn\u2019t been changed. I\u2019d left the house in the care of my old roommate, Tim. He wasn\u2019t the type to make radical changes, but if any Otherworldly denizens had come calling after I left, I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if Tim had taken some extreme security precautions.</p><p>When I stepped into my kitchen, however, I came to a total standstill and wished I\u2019d brought a weapon. There was a stranger sitting at my table.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>He was wearing a stiff gray suit and had short, neatly trimmed black hair. His face was turned away from me as he rummaged through a briefcase on the table, but he jumped in alarm at the sound of my voice. He spun toward me, face showing the same panic I felt. After a few moments of study, however, his eyes widened, and his body relaxed.</p><p>\u201cEug?\u201d</p><p>I stared, wondering how this guy knew my name, and then ... I saw it. I gasped in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cTim? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>He flashed me a grin and settled back in the chair. \u201cOf course it\u2019s me. Who else would be here?\u201d</p><p>I was dumbfounded and couldn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cBut you ... you\u2019re wearing a tie.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down and scowled at the paisley silk monstrosity around his neck. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a pain, but my job has a dress code.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ... your job?\u201d I felt like I\u2019d wandered into some alternate reality and had to seek out a chair of my own at the table, lest I faint out of sheer mental exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d he said with mock enthusiasm. \u201cI\u2019m a productive member of society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cut your hair,\u201d I said, reduced to simply pointing out the obvious.</p><p>\u201cAnother requirement of the job.\u201d He absentmindedly smoothed some of his hair back and then brightened. \u201cBut they let me wear my headdress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour headdress?\u201d</p><p>He jumped up again and disappeared down the hall that led to the bedrooms. While he was gone, I glanced around, looking for any other signs that I had entered a parallel universe. Nope. Everything else was the same. Tim returned shortly, carrying a full, feathered Lakota headdress that reached nearly to the floor. He put it on and grinned at me triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>I looked him over from head to toe, taking in the formal suit juxtaposed with feathers. \u201cWhere exactly do you work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sell car insurance,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cAnd they let you wear all that to work?\u201d</p><p>He sat down again and left the headdress on. \u201cThey encourage it, actually. They really support the idea of a diverse workplace and wanted to hire as many minorities as they could. And even though there\u2019s a dress code, it\u2019s really important to them that their minorities express their unique cultural heritage. Wearing this is a way to bring some Native American influence into the workplace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Tim ... you aren\u2019t Native American.\u201d</p><p>This, at least, was semi-familiar territory. Tim, having few employable skills, had spent most of his life marketing what he did have: coloring and features that looked Native American to those who didn\u2019t know any better. He\u2019d rotated through various tribes (usually opting for non-Southwest ones, so as not to get in trouble with the locals) and played the part to help him get laid and sell bad poetry.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s never stopped me before,\u201d he said, following my very thoughts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, but when it comes to the workplace ... I mean, if you\u2019re getting some kind of benefit, you usually have to show documentation or something. And I know you don\u2019t have that.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI seemed so authentic that they didn\u2019t even bother doing a background check. There was another guy interviewing for the same position. I think he was full-blooded Apache, but he didn\u2019t do anything to play that up. Just showed up in a suit. If he\u2019d worn war paint, he might have gotten hired over me.\u201d</p><p>I groaned. \u201cProbably he was doing something crazy, like\u2014oh, I don\u2019t know\u2014relying on professionalism and job skills.

She said if you weren\u2019t around, then it was \u2018immoral\u2019 for me to keep living here rent-free.\u201d When we\u2019d been roommates, Tim had earned his keep by doing housework and cooking.</p> <p>I felt a smile creep over my face. \u201cYou\u2019re still with her?\u201d Tim getting together with my former secretary had been both unexpected and delightful. It was on par with Rurik and Shaya\u2019s seemingly mismatched relationship.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Tim sighed. \u201cOh, the things I do for love, Eug. Anyway, yeah, she said it wasn\u2019t right to drain your bank account for the mortgage, so I got a job, and she stopped the auto-deductions or whatever. Now we cover it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she lives here too,\u201d I mused. I wasn\u2019t surprised that Lara had been able to alter my mortgage payment options. She\u2019d always known more about my finances and business affairs than I had. \u201cWhere is she? I\u2019d love to see her.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the clock. \u201cStill at work. That Enrique guy has her working crazy hours, but at least she pulls a lot of them.\u201d That too was welcome news. As my business had dried up, I\u2019d worried about Lara and had introduced her to a private detective who needed clerical help. Apparently things had worked out. \u201cBut forget about us. Where have you been? Jesus, Eug. It\u2019s been, what? Almost half a year? I didn\u2019t think you were coming back.\u201d</p><p>There was legitimate hurt in his voice, and I realized that I hadn\u2019t spared much care for friends who might have wondered at my disappearance. Tim knew I was involved with the Otherworld, but he had no idea of the extent of my entanglement. He hadn\u2019t even known I was pregnant. I\u2019d taken off before it was obvious.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd messy. All I can tell you is that I had some, uh, things to take care of, and it was better for all of us that I stayed away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout even a hint that you were okay?\u201d Again, the hurt and accusation in his voice took me aback.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI ... I just didn\u2019t think. I can honestly say it was safer for you not to know, but I should\u2019ve sent some message ... or even left a note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the visitors we initially had were any indication, I can understand the \u2018safe\u2019 part,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cVisitors?\u201d My earlier instincts may have been right after all.</p><p>He waved a dismissive hand, like it was no big deal. \u201cYeah, kind of a random assortment. I don\u2019t know what kind of creatures they all were\u2014Lara could probably tell you. Your old man was around a lot and got rid of them, and before long, they stopped coming. I guess they recognized a lost cause.\u201d</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t realized Roland had done that for me, though it shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise. He was the kind of conscientious person who would think of things like that. I owed him. If it hadn\u2019t been for him, Tim might not be so blas\u00e9 about his \u201cvisitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, hey, that\u2019s taken care of. No harm done. Now. Let\u2019s move on to more important things.\u201d He stood up and took the headdress off. \u201cWhat do you want for dinner? It\u2019s been a while, but I still remember your favorites. We\u2019ve even still got a stash of Milky Ways.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll take those, but I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t stick around. I\u2019ve got to get a few things and then head out.\u201d</p><p>Tim had been about to open a cupboard and stopped. His face fell. \u201cCan\u2019t you even stay to see Lara? She\u2019ll probably be back in, oh, an hour. Two at most.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the clock and felt my own disappointment. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can. I\u2019m heading out of town again and still have to figure things out.\u201d Aside from my mom wanting to see me tonight, Roland and I had a few logistics to discuss about my Otherworldly trip.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Tim said. \u201cYou sure do know how to toy with a guy\u2019s emotions, Eug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, flashing what I hoped was a sympathetic look. \u201cI\u2019ll try to be back soon. Honest.\u201d I wondered how Tim would feel if he knew that when I did come back, I might have two babies in tow.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOkay. Can I at least help you get what you need?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d I told him. \u201cI need to dig out my winter stuff\u2014like, my real winter stuff.\u201d</p><p>That got a raised eyebrow, and he asked no questions. We were able to locate what I wanted quickly, largely because\u2014despite his many quirks\u2014Tim ran an efficient household and had had everything neatly arranged in storage. Once that was set, it was time for good-bye. Just like all my other partings, I felt guilty over this one. At least I knew Tim didn\u2019t need me, not like others did. Plus, I was actually able to say good-bye this time, instead of disappearing on him. Surely that had to count for something.</p><p>I left him shortly thereafter and headed back toward Roland and Mom\u2019s house. Again, I felt that ache in my chest as I took in the gorgeous scenery of the foothills. I loved this area. It was why I\u2019d shaped the Thorn Land in its image. It hardly seemed fair to be leaving here so soon, yet at the same time ... a thrill of excitement ran through me. Part of my heart might be here in Arizona, but the rest of it was tied up elsewhere, in a place I was burning to see as much as I had been to see this one.</p><p>Tomorrow I would return to the Otherworld.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>I felt a little ridiculous when my mom dropped Roland and me off at a gate out in the Sonora Desert. In addition to my down coat, I also had on a turtleneck, sweater, jeans, tights, knee-high boots, gloves, scarf, and knit hat. Roland was similarly bundled up. It was super early in the morning, but the temperature was already on the rise. Fortunately, there were no hikers out yet to see the spectacle we made.</p><p>I was riding shotgun, and my mom caught a hold of my hand before I got out of the car. \u201cBe careful,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t stay away so long this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I said, hoping I could keep my word. I gave her hand one last squeeze and then stepped outside, where I was immediately blasted by morning heat. I grimaced, feeling like I was in an oven. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>Roland nodded and headed over toward the gate. To the uninitiated, it simply looked like any other place out there in the desert. We knew what signs to watch for, however, and could even sense the gate\u2019s power. It was of moderate strength, meaning it required little effort for us to cross\u2014and was the kind that a wayward person could accidentally get caught up in on a sabbat day. Roland gave me one last questioning look.</p><p>\u201cSure you\u2019re ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d I said, not feeling sure at all.</p><p>We stepped through, and I felt that familiar and always-disconcerting sensation of being stretched, pulled apart, and reassembled again. Knowing what to expect helped a little, and within moments, I was back to myself\u2014just in time to be nearly knocked over by a blast of wind. I caught hold of the first thing I could, which turned out to be Roland. He steadied me as I regained my footing and stared around in disbelief at what I saw.</p><p>White, as far as the eye could see. We stood on one of the main roads that traversed the Otherworld. It was covered in snow that looked like it had been packed down somewhat by wagons, horses, and feet. I wondered also if there was some magic to the road that kept it semi-clear because the snow covering it was nothing compared to the drifts on either side of us, which came nearly to my waist. Also lining the road were trees coated in both ice and snow. There was almost something beautiful to their delicate, lacy appearance\u2014yet at the same time, the trees had a stricken and forlorn feel to them. They were imprisoned, struggling to stay alive.</p><p>With nearly everything blanketed in the ice and snow, it was difficult to pick out many features in the land. Even the sky was dreary, covered in white and gray clouds. This could have been any place, really. The unique characteristics that normally identified the various kingdoms were obscured in white, but I didn\u2019t need any of them. I knew exactly where we were.</p><p>We were in the Rowan Land.</p><p>My eyes had a difficult time believing it, but my heart knew. I sank to my knees and rested my palms flat on the ground. There it was, the hum of energy that sang within the land of every kingdom, the energy that made up the bond we shared. It screamed out to me for help ... and at the same time, it felt muted. It was like someone beating on glass, desperate to get out but unable to break the barrier. I couldn\u2019t break it either and understood more than ever why I hadn\u2019t known about the lands\u2019 distress while in the human world. The land hadn\u2019t been able to fully reach me.</p><p>Roland touched my shoulder. \u201cEugenie, come on. We shouldn\u2019t stay out here any longer than we have to.\u201d</p><p>I knew he was right and reluctantly got back on my feet, surprised to feel myself shaking all over. I suspected it was as much from shock as from the cold.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this,\u201d I said as I began following him down the road. \u201cI mean, visually, yes. Each time you described the blight, I kept picturing this documentary I once saw about Antarctica. This isn\u2019t far off, except with less penguins. What I didn\u2019t expect was how the land felt. This cold, or rather the magic that\u2019s causing it, goes all the way to the land\u2019s core. Until now, I thought only I could reach that deep.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re able to reach that far, were you able to get any sense if you could undo the magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just then, no. It seemed like the magic was entrapping the land, and there was nothing I could do to break through.\u201d I saw Roland frown but didn\u2019t know if that was in disappointment or because of his inability to fully comprehend gentry magic. \u201cMaybe in time, I could find a way.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t so sure, however. I had to imagine the other monarchs had experienced the same sensations I had, and if they hadn\u2019t been able to find a way to crack the enchantment after all this time, it seemed unlikely I\u2019d be able to either.</p> <p>After a little traveling on the road, the land shifted, and we found ourselves in a different kingdom. I knew instantly that it wasn\u2019t mine and was almost relieved to be free of the Rowan Land\u2019s pleading. Without that innate connection, though, I couldn\u2019t readily identify where we were. It took the sight of some massive oaks in the distance, their leafless branches burdened by snow, to tip me off.</p><p>\u201cThe Oak Land,\u201d I murmured. Dorian\u2019s kingdom. Even though I knew he\u2019d been affected, it was still incredible to see the reality. Many of the other kingdoms around here had changed since I became a frequent visitor, but the red-hued, perpetual autumn of his realm had remained constant. It was unreal to see a land that had once flourished in vivid color, now so barren and stark.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to see Dorian?\u201d asked Roland.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, even though I kind of did. \u201cWe\u2019ll stick to the original plan and check in with the Thorn Land first. I need to see my own people.\u201d</p><p>Another shifting of the road took us back to the Rowan Land, and still another took us into the Willow Land. I cringed, expecting an ambush, but the world around us remained frozen and silent. The only change was that in addition to the wind that had been constantly blowing, snow now began falling as well. It stung our faces and eyes and continued when we made our next crossing, into the Thorn Land.</p> <p>Although the land had its own unique feel, its cry for freedom matched that of my other kingdom. I stared around, watching the snow fall, unable to believe that this landscape had once been a mirror of Tucson.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go off the road now to reach the castle,\u201d I said. \u201cUsually there\u2019s a smaller road or at least a path that splits away, but if there\u2019s anything like that ...\u201d I shook my head at the drifts, unable to differentiate one from another. \u201cWell. It\u2019s buried.\u201d</p><p>Roland eyed the snow, which was as high as three feet in some places, depending on how the wind had blown it. The visible parts of his face were red, and I knew he was as cold as me. \u201cThis is going to be fun to walk through. You\u2019re sure you know where you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I can feel where everything is around here, and the castle\u2019s that way.\u201d I hesitated before continuing. \u201cYou probably won\u2019t like this, but I can make things a little easier.\u201d</p><p>The blight\u2019s enchantment was too powerful and all-encompassing for me to break or affect on a large scale with my weather magic, but I still had some control over the individual elements. The blight\u2019s greater spell had been to simply lay wintry weather on the land. Once in place, that weather behaved like any other. I summoned my magic to me, gathering the air and already gusting wind. Directing it forward, I made the air blast into the snow ahead of us, serving as a magical snow blower to create a more accessible path. Roland scowled but didn\u2019t protest. He knew as well as I did that we\u2019d be out here all day if we had to trudge through this mess unaided.</p><p>Still, it took us a few hours to reach our destination, and by that point, I could barely feel my limbs. I kept telling my legs to move forward and took it on faith that they\u2019d obey. I was also just exhausted. Even with magical help, we still had to walk through some snow, and I was a long way from being in my former physical shape. Roland, judging from his heavy breathing beside me, was fighting hard too.</p> <p>The Thorn Land\u2019s blocky fortress of a castle came into sight when we were still a good distance from it. The terrain\u2019s basic features had remained under the blight, and the land was relatively flat here, making the black stone building show up in high contrast against the snow. We were close enough to be in range of patrolling guards, and one of them soon rode up to us, demanding to know who we were.</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d I said, braving the cold to remove my hat and scarf.</p><p>It took several moments of staring before his face registered recognition. Even then, it was easy to tell he didn\u2019t believe what he saw. \u201cY-Your Majesty? Is it really you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same,\u201d I said, bundling back up. \u201cJust a little colder.\u201d</p><p>The guard turned and yelled something. Moments later, another scout rode up and shared his colleague\u2019s shock and amazement. \u201cRide back and tell them she\u2019s here,\u201d said the first guard. He dismounted and offered his horse to Roland and me. \u201cGo on and get warm. I\u2019ll follow on foot.\u201d</p><p>I started to protest, but the guard was dressed warmly and had probably become more used to this weather than we were. I thanked him and mounted the horse with Roland. My body remembered how to do it without difficulty, and I was again pleased to be regaining my former agility. The horse moved slower with two, but our speed was much better than if we\u2019d been on foot. The guard who\u2019d ridden ahead had long since beaten us, so we found a crowd waiting for us at the castle\u2019s entrance.</p><p>I climbed down from the horse ungracefully\u2014reminding me I shouldn\u2019t be quite so cocky yet about my improved athleticism. The clumsy move made me look like an undignified queen, but it was clear none of that mattered once the people caught sight of my face. I heard awed gasps, and one by one, they began falling to their knees in the snow with murmurs of \u201cYour Majesty.\u201d I\u2019d never been entirely comfortable with these shows of loyalty in the best conditions, let alone snowy and frigid ones. I was about to urge them to get up when I noticed one person still standing.</p><p>\u201cJasmine!\u201d I exclaimed, rushing forward.</p> <p>My sister stood wrapped in a fur-lined cloak, her face pale. It flooded with relief when I caught her in a big hug. She returned it with more fierceness than I would\u2019ve expected, considering we weren\u2019t usually so touchy-feely. \u201cThank God you\u2019re back,\u201d she said into my shoulder. \u201cNow we can fix all this.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t ready to tell her yet that I wasn\u2019t sure I could fix it. Yet, as I finally managed to get everyone to return inside, I could see from the servants\u2019 faces that they too thought everything would improve now that I was back. That faith made me uneasy. I also noted that, aside from the guards who\u2019d been on patrol, Jasmine was the only one in any sort of suitable gentry-style winter attire. The others who had rushed out to see me had been wearing clothing that had clearly been patched together to protect against the cold, with mismatched layers haphazardly arranged. Better than nothing, I supposed.</p><p>After a few greetings and nondescript assurances, Roland and I were able to leave the crowd and meet Jasmine in a cozy sitting room. When Aeson, this kingdom\u2019s former ruler, had been in charge, the land had undergone seasons, and the castle had been built to accommodate winter. That had made for miserable conditions once I turned the land into a desert, often making this keep feel like a kiln. Now, that design paid off. The sitting room was small, with no windows, and held the heat coming from a blazing fire. I was pretty sure it was the first time I\u2019d ever seen one of the fireplaces in use here.</p><p>Jasmine told me she\u2019d sent word \u201cto the others,\u201d whatever that meant. She then gave orders for food and drink to the servants before finally settling into a chair. There was a maturity to her that hadn\u2019t been there before, likely the result of being forced to take charge of so much so quickly. She kept her cloak on, but I was ready to remove my layers. I was still cold but felt heavy and encumbered. Roland must have felt the same way because he too stripped off his winter wear. We both found chairs and dragged them as close to the fire as possible. Jasmine sighed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I grew up in the desert or if it\u2019s just because this weather\u2019s such a bitch, but I swear\u2014\u201d Her jaw dropped as she did a double take at me. \u201cYou ... you\u2019re not pregnant!\u201d</p><p>I thought it had been obvious right away, but I suppose the coat might have been deceptive. \u201cNope, not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you ...\u201d Her words died again, and I could see her mentally crunching numbers in her head. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be due for a few more weeks. Did you\ufffd\ufffd\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d I said quickly, seeing panic start to overtake her. \u201cThey just came early. About a month ago. They needed lots of medical help, but everything looks great for them.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed, but her blue-gray eyes were still wide. \u201cThen you\u2019re ... wow. You\u2019re a mom. And I\u2019m an aunt.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYup. Their names are Isaac and Ivy.\u201d I wasn\u2019t going to say a word, not even to her, about their location, but their names were safe enough. That revelation got an even bigger reaction. Jasmine filled with delight.</p><p>\u201cYou named her after me!\u201d</p><p>I frowned, not entirely sure where that leap of logic had come from. Because of shared botanical names? \u201cWell, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Eugenie!\u201d She jumped up from her chair and hugged me again, leaving the cloak behind. \u201cYou\u2019re so awesome. Thanks so much!\u201d</p><p>She seemed so happy that I figured it wasn\u2019t worth mentioning the plant names were coincidental. Just as my un-layered state had surprised her, I was astonished to look at her now and see how skinny she was. I could feel her ribs when she hugged me.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d I exclaimed, once she\u2019d sat down again. \u201cYou\u2019re skin and bones!\u201d</p><p>Jasmine glanced down with a scowl and picked at her too-loose dress. \u201cOh, that. Well, there\u2019s not a lot of food anymore. Plus, trying to keep the lands alive takes a lot out of me.\u201d</p><p>Guilt ran through me. I certainly knew communing with the land took a fair amount of energy, but it hadn\u2019t occurred to me until now that doing so in these conditions would be extra taxing\u2014especially since she was just the substitute. Maybe that bonding wasn\u2019t solely responsible for her weight loss, but I didn\u2019t doubt that keeping the land in check played a role in some of the gauntness in her face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJasmine, I\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>She waved it off. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It had to be done, right? Besides, once it\u2019s charged, the land can go a while in these conditions. And you did what you needed. Everything\u2019s okay with Isaac and my namesake, which was the whole purpose.\u201d</p><p>She then proceeded to give us an account of how things had been in both kingdoms. Jasmine didn\u2019t use quite the technical language and statistics that Shaya might when describing people and resources, but she did a much better job than I would have expected. In filling in for me, Jasmine had ended up taking on a lot more responsibilities than just being the lands\u2019 caretaker. Her report gave me more specifics on the situation here, but the big picture wasn\u2019t much different from what Roland had described. As close as Jasmine was to Pagiel, she hadn\u2019t accepted any of his stolen goods\u2014though she was undecided on whether what he was doing was wrong.</p> <p>My kingdoms had, much to her chagrin, done some trading with the Yew Land. We were one of the few kingdoms that had a steady stream of resources unaffected by the cold: a thriving copper supply. We couldn\u2019t eat copper, of course, and had no other significant food sources. The crops in both kingdoms favored warm weather, and the animals in the Thorn Land hadn\u2019t been able to survive at all. The Rowan Land had some winter-ready game that had provided meat for the people, but even those animals were struggling. With limited food and a lot of copper that no one else could afford to buy, trading with the Yew Land had seemed like the only option.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Jasmine. \u201cI wish we didn\u2019t have to\u2014 especially since those bastards are probably responsible for this mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I assured her. \u201cYou had to feed the people, and the copper was doing us no good.\u201d</p><p>A servant arrived just then to announce a group of guests had arrived: Dorian, Shaya, Rurik, and Pagiel. \u201cHow\u2019d they get here so fast?\u201d I asked, once the servant went to fetch them. Jasmine had said she\u2019d sent word, but even with magical communication, the trip from Dorian\u2019s land would\u2019ve taken a while.</p><p>\u201cThey were all in the Rowan Land,\u201d explained Jasmine. She nodded toward Roland. \u201cHe gave us a heads-up that you might be coming one of these days, so Dorian\u2019s been hanging out there. He brought Pagiel because he figured you\u2019d want to talk to him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was right,\u201d I said. Despite his quirks, Dorian always had a good feel for what I was thinking.</p><p>My heart leapt when I saw him. After the dreariness of the blight, Dorian\u2019s presence was a breath of life and excitement. He swept in grandly, as though this were an ordinary state visit. He wore his typically rich, brightly colored garments, with the centerpiece being an emerald green cloak made out of satin and adorned with gold embroidery. It matched the green of his eyes and made his long hair look like a wave of fire that gave the illusion of warmth. Neither he nor any of the others were wearing heavy outerwear, so they must have shed it before entering the room. Probably whatever Dorian had for the cold weather wasn\u2019t fashionable enough for him.</p><p>He held my eyes for a moment, and I was suddenly flooded by a million thoughts. How we\u2019d said good-bye. The memories of his body that had haunted me these last couple of months. The way I\u2019d missed him. And again, the knowledge that he maybe loved me again.</p><p>\u201cThe wayward queen returns,\u201d he said as though none of those other matters existed. A quick assessment revealed to him what Jasmine had also discovered. \u201cConsiderably less of her.\u201d</p><p>His tone was light, but I could tell that, also like Jasmine, he was uncertain of what had become of my pregnancy and was hesitant to presume.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I left my children behind,\u201d I said. I kept my words light too, but their meaning left an ache inside me. \u201cThey were born about a month ago and are doing well.\u201d</p> <p>Shaya looked awestruck. \u201cTruly? They\u2019re thriving after being born that early?\u201d She shook her head in amazement. \u201cHuman medicine,\u201d was all she said on the matter. From the moment I\u2019d met her, she\u2019d been very outspoken about humans \u201ctwisting technology,\u201d but I think this had made her reconsider the benefits. Probably not enough to handle hearing about my C-section and the NICU, though.</p><p>Her awe soon gave way to joy. She embraced me, and even Rurik did too. Dorian and Pagiel didn\u2019t, both keeping their distance for entirely different reasons. Once the welcomes were done and we were all seated, Rurik leaned back and sighed with satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that you\u2019re back, we can get rid of this blight.\u201d</p><p>There it was again. I grimaced. \u201cWhy does everyone think I can fix things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Storm King\u2019s daughter,\u201d he replied. \u201cThe weather obeys you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this weather,\u201d I said. \u201cI mean, the little parts, yeah, but all of it? It\u2019s an enchantment that\u2019s bigger than just a weather pattern. It\u2019s permeated the core of the land ... corrupted it.\u201d</p><p>Dorian nodded. \u201cI know exactly what you mean. And I suspected as much\u2014that your formidable capabilities wouldn\u2019t be enough to break this.\u201d</p><p>Rurik seemed undaunted. \u201cEven if it\u2019s not a matter of controlling the weather, can\u2019t all of you just ... I don\u2019t know ... band together and break the spell?\u201d</p> <p>I glanced to Dorian for this answer. Roland had hinted that something like what Rurik was suggesting had already been attempted. \u201cSeveral of us monarchs tried to unite our powers and break through,\u201d Dorian confirmed. \u201cIt was ineffectual, and I didn\u2019t get the feeling that we were close\u2014like if we had one more person, we could have managed it. This enchantment is going to require something more, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaiwenn helped you,\u201d I said, trying not to sound accusing.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhat is it humans say? \u2018The enemy of my enemy is my friend.\u2019 Right now, the blight is everyone\u2019s enemy. Maiwenn wants to end it as badly as we do, and she\u2019s a force that shouldn\u2019t be easily dismissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe plotted to have me and my children killed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dorian said. \u201cI can see where that would bother you.\u201d</p><p>I arched an eyebrow at that. \u201cBother\u201d was kind of a mild way to put it.</p><p>Shaya\u2019s face had initially reflected Rurik\u2019s enthusiasm, but now she\u2019d grown grave. \u201cWe have to do something. We can\u2019t go on like this.\u201d</p><p>My gaze fell on Pagiel, who was watching me warily. \u201cWe also can\u2019t raid the human world for food.\u201d</p><p>He straightened up, and I knew he\u2019d been bracing for this. \u201cWhy not? There\u2019s plenty of food there! It just sits around. And most of those humans are fat anyway. They don\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s not the point. Most humans don\u2019t even know this world exists. They\u2019re not ... ready for it. Plus, what you\u2019re doing is practically an act of war. It isn\u2019t morally right.\u201d</p><p>Pagiel crossed his arms and leaned back. \u201cMorals don\u2019t mean much when friends and family are starving to death. And I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s wrong. Humans have plenty. We have none. Taking it from them is better than letting the Yew Land abuse us for their food. That\u2019s robbery right there.\u201d</p><p>It was hard to argue against his Robin Hood logic, and seeing his stubborn expression, I knew it would take more than a \u201ctalking to\u201d to win him over. Dorian, as his king, might be useful, but my guess was that even if he didn\u2019t actively condone it, Dorian wouldn\u2019t feel the food raids were severe enough to warrant intervention. After all, Dorian was a supporter of the Storm King prophecy. What was a little theft here and there compared to outright invasion? He probably thought Pagiel\u2019s raids were an acceptable warm-up act.</p><p>Still, Pagiel\u2019s words brought up another concern. I glanced around at the others. \u201cThe Yew Land. What do we know about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat they suck,\u201d said Jasmine.</p><p>\u201cNoted. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>Dorian propped his elbow up on the chair\u2019s arm and rested his face in his hand. \u201cEverything suggests they\u2019re responsible, though we have no hard proof.\u201d</p><p>Rurik snorted. \u201cNo proof? That bitch queen has said she can lift the blight to those who choose to follow her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Dorian, \u201cbut she\u2019s very careful with her wording. She doesn\u2019t say she can lift it because she caused it. She acts as though she simply has the power to\u2014if we bend the knee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame difference,\u201d growled Rurik.</p><p>\u201cI concur, but it\u2019s irrelevant. We don\u2019t know enough about their magic to puzzle this out,\u201d said Dorian.</p><p>The answer came to me like a slap in the face. \u201cVolusian,\u201d I said.</p><p>The others regarded me questioningly. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d asked Dorian. \u201cI assume he\u2019s as charming as ever, though I wouldn\u2019t know since you went to great pains to keep him away.\u201d</p><p>I ignored the jab. \u201cVolusian\u2019s from the Yew Land. That\u2019s where he was cursed. It happened a long time ago, but obviously, they\u2019ve still got some pretty serious magic going on. Maybe he knows something.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine leaned forward eagerly. \u201cSee? I knew you\u2019d know how to fix this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. But at least it\u2019ll give us a place to start.\u201d I stood up and spoke the summoning words. That familiar, cold feeling spread throughout the room, though for once, it was easy to shrug off. After I\u2019d trudged through that Arctic wasteland outside, Volusian\u2019s aura felt pretty soft-core. Moments later, Volusian appeared. He inclined his head to me.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back, mistress.\u201d</p><p>Around me, the others shifted uncomfortably. Roland had disapproved of Volusian since the beginning, and for once, he and the gentry agreed on something. None of them liked Volusian either. Dorian had even offered to help me banish him, since the curse was too much for one person to break.</p><p>I sat back down. \u201cVolusian, we need to talk to you about the Yew Land.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Volusian\u2019s expression remained unchanged, but like before, I got the vibe that his former homeland was nothing he wanted to discuss. \u201cYes, mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the Yew Land responsible for the blight?\u201d</p><p>A pause. Then: \u201cMost certainly, mistress.\u201d</p> <p>The others exchanged surprised looks. I shared the sentiment. With Volusian, such a direct answer was rare. Even though he was compelled to obey me, he excelled at finding ways to evade the truth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not quite the same as \u2018yes,\u2019\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Volusian agreed. \u201cI have not been to the Yew Land in centuries. I have not spoken to Queen Varia. I have seen no spells cast. Without that, I cannot say, \u2018Yes, they caused it.\u2019 This magic that\u2019s blighted these lands feels exactly the same as the sorts of spells the Yew people work. It is possible someone else has learned their magic\u2014but unlikely. Hence my answer: most certainly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d I said. Volusian-logic was wearying sometimes. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose then that you know how to break the enchantment.\u201d</p><p>Volusian\u2019s tone remained flat. \u201cOf course I do, mistress. I have known for some time.\u201d</p> <p>I nearly jumped out of my chair. Rurik actually did.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I cried. \u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you tell someone sooner?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t be certain, but I thought I saw the tiniest shrug of Volusian\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBecause, mistress,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never asked.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>\u201cGod. Damn. It.\u201d</p> <p>It was one of those times\u2014and believe me, there\u2019d been many\u2014when I wished I really could just blast Volusian into the Underworld. Usually those times also just happened to be when I desperately needed him. This was no exception.</p><p>I saw anger and disbelief kindling on the others\u2019 faces. I knew how they felt and had to remember that this was typical Volusian operating procedure. By the terms of his servitude, he really hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. Although I often asked him to give me a heads-up on useful information, he was under no obligation to deliver news I didn\u2019t explicitly ask for. In fact, if I had a standing order for him to tell me \u201canything important,\u201d I was pretty sure he would talk my ear off nonstop, just out of spite. His hatred for me and the Yew Land must have put him in quite the bind here. Who should he inconvenience the most?</p><p>I gritted my teeth. \u201cAll right, Volusian. Tell us about the enchantment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe spell originated in the Yew Land,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously. And that\u2019s where it\u2019s maintained from. I am not familiar with Queen Varia, but I find it unlikely she alone is working magic of this magnitude. Most likely, it is the collaboration of many who have pooled their powers together to establish the enchantment. Even then, a group of magic users could not maintain a spell so vast for so long. There is most certainly a physical component tied into this magic, objects that allow the Yew Land magic users to connect to the afflicted lands.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t entirely follow that last part, but understanding filled some of the others\u2019 faces. \u201cWe already thought of that,\u201d said Dorian. \u201cWe destroyed all those ghastly statues the ambassador left behind. It had no effect on the blight.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d nearly forgotten about those tacky green and white monstrosities that had been gifted to all of us. Looking back with the power of hindsight, I could see now how those sculptures would absolutely be perfect Trojan horses. Varia could have infused them with magic that maintained the blight spell, and then we\u2019d unknowingly keep them on hand, ignorantly obeying the rules of etiquette. It was the perfect explanation\u2014except that Dorian\u2019s words completely contradicted it.</p><p>\u201cBecause those are not the objects tied to the spell, Oak King,\u201d said Volusian. \u201cThis type of enchantment required much planning, and Varia and her conspirators would hardly leave the critical components around at your disposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are they?\u201d demanded Rurik.</p> <p>\u201cThe other gifts,\u201d I murmured. I remembered when Ilania the ambassador had given me the statues, one for each kingdom, and how she\u2019d said she looked forward to seeing what we gave back in return. Needing to match her kingdom\u2019s custom, I\u2019d given haphazard orders to send some token back with her. I\u2019d never followed up. I had no idea what my people had given to her. \u201cIlania made the rounds in all our kingdoms, distributing her crappy art, which then obligated all of us to give her something back.\u201d I turned to Shaya. \u201cWe sent her with something, right?\u201d</p><p>Shaya\u2019s eyes were thoughtful. \u201cYes. We gave her a very rare vase from the Rowan castle\u2019s original art collection. Later, she said that she would also like to take back something representative of the Thorn Land, no matter how small, so I made arrangements for that. She was very insistent it be from that land. I believe it was some sort of copper plate, but I can find out for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat matters is that we gave her something. And you did too, right?\u201d That was to Dorian. He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. I don\u2019t pay attention to such trifles.\u201d</p><p>I repressed an eye roll. Dorian might not keep up on his household\u2019s day-to-day affairs, but I had no doubt some wily servant had made sure the rules of etiquette were followed on his liege\u2019s behalf. And, in fact, I was willing to bet every monarch in the blighted kingdoms had followed suit.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I asked Volusian. Everything was starting to fall together. \u201cAll the gifts we willingly gave are what are being used to maintain the Yew Land\u2019s spell. They\u2019re tied to our kingdoms and were given freely. The \u2018freely\u2019 part must be crucial. Otherwise, she would\u2019ve just stolen random things. The gifts provide a physical connection to us that the magic\u2019s being worked through, allowing the blight to continue so long as she possesses those objects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be my assumption, mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019ve probably got those objects under lock and key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother valid assumption, mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould destroying these objects break the enchantment?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d said Volusian. \u201cWith no tangible tie to your lands, the Yew magic users would have no way to maintain the enchantment over such a long distance.\u201d</p><p>Remembering that there was always the potential for information that Volusian wasn\u2019t readily providing, I racked my brain for other pertinent details. \u201cIs there any other way to break the enchantment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could kill or incapacitate the magic users.\u201d There was something about the way he said \u201cincapacitate\u201d that made it sound worse than killing. \u201cHowever, destroying the talismans are most likely the simplest solution. They would all be kept in one place. The magic users can be scattered at any given time, and it is unclear how many are needed for the spell. If Varia has planned well, she will have more on hand than she actually needs, should something happen to one or two of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s settled then,\u201d said Rurik. It was clear he had less patience than I did for Volusian\u2019s communication style. \u201cWe head over there and break all the gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Over there\u2019 could mean a lot of things, I\u2019m guessing,\u201d remarked Dorian. His voice was lazy and smooth, but there was an eager glint in his eye. What was a recent problem for me had plagued Dorian and the others for a long time. No doubt he was as anxious as Rurik to finally make progress. \u201cParticularly since none of us have been to Varia\u2019s realm. Can you provide us with a more specific location within the Yew Land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Volusian. \u201cI am forbidden to cross its borders. The magic that exiled me prevents me from entering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d I muttered. Volusian was annoying, but he was good in a fight.</p><p>\u201cHowever ...\u201d Volusian hesitated, something I had rarely seen, as though deciding whether or not he should speak. \u201cThat spell is old. There\u2019s probably no one alive from the time it was cast. The spells that bind me to you, mistress, are not as strong as that original curse, but they are powerful in their way\u2014and newer.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the most basic and powerful parts of my enslavement to you is that I must come when you summon me. There is a chance that if you commanded me to come to you in the Yew Land, our bonds would be strong enough to bring me to your side\u2014even within that kingdom\u2019s borders.\u201d He paused again, this time for dramatic effect. \u201cOr there is the possibility I might not show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that ambiguous answer aside, the important part right now is that we really don\u2019t have any way of knowing exactly where in the Yew Land these objects are,\u201d I said. \u201cSo, if we send people after them, it would be a blind mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing,\u201d said Rurik.</p><p>Dorian smiled at him. \u201cCrudely put, but true. Our lands can\u2019t go on like this. We need to take some action, no matter how remote our chances are.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and leaned back in my chair, watching the flames of the fireplace dance. There were some ugly choices ahead. I didn\u2019t believe much in destiny, but I knew then that this was the reason I had returned to the Otherworld. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>Roland straightened up. \u201cEugenie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said. I gave him a gentle smile. \u201cI know you\u2019re worried, but you also knew when I came back that I\u2019d be signing on for something like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d he said wryly, \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d just do some hocus-pocus and fix things in a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would if I could,\u201d I said, a lump forming in my stomach. I wasn\u2019t an expert on the Yew Land\u2014not yet\u2014but knew the venture we were about to undertake would last a lot longer than a day. It could take us days\u2014even weeks\u2014 to get there. Those were all days I\u2019d have to stay away from Isaac and Ivy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go too, of course,\u201d said Dorian. \u201cNothing I love more than a winter\u2019s journey.\u201d</p><p>Rurik and Shaya exchanged glances at this. \u201cYour Majesties ...\u201d she said carefully. \u201cIs it wise ... is it wise for you both to go? For either of you to go? The risks ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather die trying to save my kingdom than watch it wither around me,\u201d said Dorian, in a rare show of fierceness. \u201cIf I die in the attempt, the land will simply find someone else to bond with. Perhaps he or she will then be able to succeed where I didn\u2019t. Either way, a triumphant ending.\u201d</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t so sure I\u2019d call that triumphant, but I could hardly chastise Dorian for going when I was signing up for the same risks. What I was not so open to was Jasmine volunteering.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked when I began to protest. \u201cI\u2019m pretty badass, you know.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cThat\u2019s not in dispute. Someone has to stay and commune with the lands. You\u2019re the only alternative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDorian\u2019s leaving his kingdom,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t have backup.\u201d</p><p>It was a fair point, one I didn\u2019t have a ready answer for. \u201cThe land can go well over a month without me,\u201d he remarked. \u201cEspecially in these conditions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it need more help in these conditions?\u201d I argued.</p><p>\u201cOh, it needs you, no question. But the land isn\u2019t thriving in its normal way. It\u2019s in a kind of stasis. If we\u2019re away longer than we expect, you and the land will miss each other ... but let\u2019s face it, the land can\u2019t get too much worse if we\u2019re a couple weeks late.\u201d Jasmine had hinted at that, I recalled now. The laconic smile on Dorian\u2019s face contrasted weirdly with his next words. \u201cBesides, these kingdoms won\u2019t survive in two months anyway. No harm done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, you have a cheery way of looking at everything,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>He grinned at me and nodded to Jasmine. \u201cOn a more practical note, we\u2019re going to have to travel through some pretty miserable conditions. Having two weather-working sisters along would be welcome.\u201d</p><p>It was another good point. Certainly I\u2019d eased my journey with Roland earlier. Jasmine\u2019s specialty was magic tied to moisture, which would come in handy with the snow. Dorian\u2019s comment also provided cover for something else I\u2019d wanted to bring up. I turned to Pagiel.</p><p>\u201cI suppose he\u2019s right. And by that same reasoning, we could really use you if your air magic can combat any of this,\u201d I said. I hesitated and frowned before continuing. \u201cAlthough, I hate to drag you into it. If your mother gave me grief for my doctor\u2019s visits, God only knows what she\u2019ll say about this.\u201d</p> <p>Pagiel\u2019s eyes were stormy. \u201cI\u2019m too old for her to tell me what to do! I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s dangerous. You need me, and I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>It was hard to keep a straight face. Something amusing flashed in Dorian\u2019s eyes, and I knew he\u2019d guessed my ruse. Score one for Eugenie and reverse psychology. In truth, I actually wasn\u2019t thrilled about exposing Pagiel to this dangerous journey. It was simply a matter of choosing the lesser of evils, however. If Pagiel was with me, he wasn\u2019t out attacking humans. I\u2019d been afraid suggesting he go with us to the Yew Land would make him suspicious, but he seemed pretty confident it was all his decision. I hoped this boded well for my future parenting skills.</p><p>After further discussion, the only two people not going were Roland and Shaya. Roland, though not a fan of the Otherworld, had volunteered to help. I\u2019d declined the offer and given him a look that said I\u2019d explain later. That was enough for him. Shaya, however, was much harder to convince. Although she was strong and a good healer, I wanted her back here to manage the fragile state of affairs in my kingdoms. Rurik, being the macho but good-hearted husband he was, simply wanted her kept safe. That was what she took issue with.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not made of glass!\u201d she exclaimed to him. \u201cI used to be a warrior in the Oak Land\u2019s royal guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re my wife, so trust me when I say you\u2019re better off here,\u201d Rurik said. I think he had noble intentions, but the heavy-handed words weren\u2019t the best thing he could\u2019ve chosen. She grew more incensed, and it was only my command that got her to back down. From the way she kept glaring at him, it was clear she held him responsible, and I suspected Rurik would be sleeping on the proverbial couch.</p><p>Once the rest of us, along with some handpicked fighters, were committed to go, our meeting dispersed. We planned on leaving tomorrow, and everyone had individual preparations to make. Roland intended to go back to Tucson now and reluctantly agreed to let some of my guards escort him to the gate so that he could go on horseback.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to have you in the Yew Land,\u201d I told him as I walked him out. \u201cBut honestly ... I\u2019m worried that while Pagiel\u2019s gone, some of his cronies might get the same idea about \u2018shopping trips\u2019 to the human world.\u201d</p><p>Roland grimaced. \u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t come to that. He\u2019s a bright boy, the kind others follow.... Hopefully none of them will have the initiative to act on their own. I\u2019ll be on watch, though.\u201d</p> <p>Outdoors, the same bitter cold greeted us. Roland was bundled up again, but I\u2019d foolishly ventured out in just my jeans and sweater. Not far from the door, his escort waited discreetly and patiently. I wrapped my arms around myself.</p><p>\u201cRoland ... if something happens to me ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEugenie ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. It sounds pessimistic, but well ... everything\u2019s changed. There are things we have to plan for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe twins,\u201d he said grimly.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIf something happens to me, then I totally trust you to do whatever you think is best. If that means leaving them where they\u2019re at, fine. If you and Mom want to take them, fine too. Whatever will give them a good life and keep them safe from my enemies.\u201d</p><p>Roland\u2019s face showed he didn\u2019t like this conversation but knew it was necessary. \u201cI hate to echo Dorian, but if something does happen to you, you probably won\u2019t have many enemies left to come after them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen something good comes out of this, right?\u201d</p><p>He gave his head a rueful shake. \u201cBe careful, Eugenie, so that we never have to find out the answers to any of these things.\u201d He hugged me and then shooed me inside. \u201cGet back in there and get warm. If you think about it, send that fiend of yours to me every once in a while with an update.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I said. It was difficult watching him go. He was my last bit of contact with humanity. I was now once again fully enmeshed in Otherworldly affairs.</p><p>Before I returned inside, I caught the attention of a sentry standing a little ways down the hall. She inclined her head politely at my notice. \u201cYour Majesty.\u201d</p><p>I glanced back at the door and frowned. \u201cWhen I first ruled here\u2014back when the desert took out all the crops and water\u2014we had refugees showing up here. And for the war too. Why hasn\u2019t anyone come this time? They\u2019re in just as bad a shape, right?\u201d</p><p>The sentry\u2019s face fell. \u201cI\u2019d say they\u2019re in worse shape, Your Majesty. The blight has killed more people than either of those times. For many, journeying here through these conditions would prove far more deadly than making do where they\u2019re at, no matter how miserable.\u201d</p><p>I thanked her and went upstairs, her words hitting me hard.</p><p>Since my party\u2019s plan was to depart from the Thorn Land tomorrow, I set out tonight for a quick journey to the Rowan Land to do what I could for it. An escort of guards went with me, and we again rode to save time. I also continued using my magic to clear the snow. Some part of me worried about expending my energy, but I felt strong and couldn\u2019t stand to watch the men and horses struggle.</p><p>The people in the Rowan castle bore the same looks of hope that their Thorn brethren had. I was glad to give them something positive in these dreary times but worried once more about whether I could deliver. They were equally excited to hear my children had been born safely and were hidden away among humans. The gentry nodded along as though there was nothing weird about this, and thinking once more about fairy tales, I wondered if maybe those stories had some basis in history.</p><p>Communing with the land had to be done outdoors, so while my men warmed up inside, I bundled up and sat down in the courtyard. I reached out to the land and received an answer\u2014and better understood what Jasmine and Dorian had described. It took a lot of energy to reach the land\u2019s heart and establish any sort of connection, explaining why she\u2019d been wiped out. But, I could also feel what she\u2019d meant about the land not burning through energy very quickly. It needed the power and welcomed my support, but in the blight\u2019s hibernation, the land mostly used my energy to keep its core strong. Nothing was being expended on the living, breathing, day-to-day maintenance of the kingdom. This saddened me, but I hoped it would mean the land really could survive a while without me.</p><p>Once that was done, we had little time to dally. My men and I traveled back to the Thorn Land, and there, in the evening darkness, I performed the same type of magical connection with my kingdom. The response was the same, and when I was finally able to trudge into my bedroom, I was certain I\u2019d fall right to sleep. Normally, I felt flustered when servants waited on me, but tonight I was grateful someone else was off packing and taking care of my supplies for tomorrow.</p><p>Those same servants had piled the fire high in my room, bringing the temperature to a level that might even be too hot later\u2014but which was wonderful now. The staff had also taken pains to pile my bed with blankets and pillows. What I was pretty sure they had not placed on my bed, however, was Dorian.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He was sprawled on top of the covers, propped up on some of the pillows with his hands resting behind his head. From the way he\u2019d been gazing upward, he had the look of someone lost in dreams and imaginings. Or world-dominating machinations. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI came to talk to you, of course.\u201d He stayed where he was, and I took a chair near the bed\u2019s side. \u201cYou didn\u2019t really think I would accept your cursory explanation about where you\u2019ve been all this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know where I\u2019ve been. And why I was there.\u201d</p><p>He managed a half shrug. \u201cYes, yes. But what about your children? Aren\u2019t you going to tell me more about them? I\u2019d hoped Shaya would do the womanly thing and interrogate you in detail, but she let me down. And of course I couldn\u2019t quiz you on such things in front of the others.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I agreed, rolling my eyes. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want to ruin your harsh, manly reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would take a lot more than talking about infants to do that, my dear.\u201d</p><p>I stretched out my legs, surprised at the small aches in them. \u201cOkay. What do you want to know? I\u2019m not going to tell you where they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d He turned his thoughtful gaze back up. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Tell me the essentials. What are they like? What are their names? Are they really in good health after being born so early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir names are Isaac and Ivy,\u201d I began.</p> <p>\u201cIsaac?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nice name. A human name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware. But it\u2019s not the name I\u2019d give to a conqueror of worlds,\u201d explained Dorian. He considered. \u201cI would\u2019ve gone with Thundro or Ragnor. I might just call him Thundro anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, and you know it. Their names are Isaac and Ivy. And my son\u2019s not going to be a conqueror of worlds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you say. Now go on.\u201d</p><p>I thought back to his questions and felt my stomach turn queasy as the twins\u2019 faces flashed to my mind. \u201cThey\u2019re like ... well, they look like me. So far. No trace of ... him. Other than that, it\u2019s hard to guess too much what they\u2019ll be like. And they\u2019re small, of course. Smaller than what\u2019s ideal. But everything\u2019s there\u2014there and perfect. Plus, they\u2019re growing more and more each day. Pretty soon they\u2019ll be able to go home.\u201d I didn\u2019t elaborate on what \u201chome\u201d meant\u2014partially because I wasn\u2019t even certain\u2014but did go on to explain what had happened in the NICU. Dorian bore the usual gentry look of surprise and confusion at the technical lingo, but when I was finished, he actually seemed impressed.</p> <p>\u201cWell, then, it sounds like it\u2019s a blessing they were somewhere that could help them get through all of this,\u201d he said. \u201cBut tell me, how are you handling all of it?\u201d</p><p>I stifled a yawn. \u201cNot looking forward to a long journey in the snow. Also not excited that we don\u2019t know exactly where we\u2019re going, but compared to the alternative, I guess it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d he interrupted, sitting up so that he could meet my gaze. \u201cNot this Yew Land nonsense. I\u2019m talking about being away from Ivy and Thundro. How are you coping with that? It can\u2019t be easy, being apart when they\u2019re both so fragile.\u201d</p><p>My answer was a long time in coming. Aside from Roland\u2014who had actually seen how difficult my parting from the twins was\u2014no one had asked much, so far, about how I felt about having to leave them. Everyone had wanted to know about their births and that Isaac and Ivy were safe and accounted for, but my feelings on the matter had never been brought up. I was Eugenie, Queen of Rowan and Thorn, Storm King\u2019s daughter. It was expected that I would slip easily into this new adventure and do my duty.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d I said at last, unable to look into his eyes. I hated when he turned all serious. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to come back, even when Roland told me how bad things were. Leaving their bedside was probably the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. I\u2019m wracked with guilt over every option. I hate myself for leaving them and would\u2019ve hated myself for abandoning all of you. I feel split between worlds.\u201d</p><p>Dorian swung his legs over to the side of the bed. \u201cYou\u2019ve felt that way since the moment I met you.\u201d</p><p>I thought about it. \u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll help you settle this blight problem so that you can get back to them soon.\u201d He stood up and caught one of my hands in his. \u201cI promise.\u201d His lips brushed the top of my hand, and then he released it. I stared dumbfounded as he walked to the door. Before he left, he glanced back at me. \u201cOh, and for what it\u2019s worth? I\u2019m sorry you had to come back under these circumstances, but I am glad to see you again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said stupidly, unable to formulate anything more eloquent. I wished I could say a hundred other things, like that I appreciated his compassion now and how he\u2019d tried to help me before I left. I wanted to tell him I was sorry for not confiding in him before ... but the words stuck on my lips.</p><p>He left me, and I was amazed. No snark, no innuendoes. Just honesty and sincerity. He\u2019d seen my pain and offered his comfort. I wasn\u2019t so sure cleaning up this \u201cnonsense\u201d would be as easy as he\u2019d made it out to be, but the sentiment still meant a lot to me. This wasn\u2019t the Dorian I\u2019d left two months ago.</p><p>Despite how awestruck his behavior had left me, I couldn\u2019t ponder it much longer. We had a big day tomorrow, and my body was exhausted. I had enough presence of mind to strip off my outerwear and then slide into the heavily layered bed. Just before I fell asleep, I thought I caught the lingering scent of apples and cinnamon from where he\u2019d been lying.</p><p>Dorian was back to his usual bantering self the next morning. It wasn\u2019t biting or sarcastic, though, and I could tell he was actually trying to boost everyone\u2019s spirits with his jokes and quips. Although tense, everyone in our party actually seemed excited about our venture. I think they\u2019d been inactive for too long and were grateful just to be doing something to try to rectify this problem.</p><p>Along with Dorian, Jasmine, Pagiel, and Rurik, I also had two of my own guards and one of Dorian\u2019s. All three were strong fighters, and Dorian\u2019s man\u2014Alistir\u2014was also a healer. Shaya came out to see us off, and from the way she and Rurik had to be pried apart, it was obvious they\u2019d long since made up their differences from yesterday.</p><p>We set out on horseback into another icy, blustery day. Jasmine, Pagiel, and I all wanted to use our magic to facilitate our journey, but Dorian cautioned against it so early on. \u201cThe road will be manageable. The horses are strong right now, and so are we. Don\u2019t start expending yourselves quite so soon\u2014especially since we don\u2019t know if there\u2019s worse weather to come.\u201d</p><p>The path did indeed grow a little easier once we reached one of the main roads, so I heeded his advice. From what they\u2019d told me, the blight could occasionally whip up into ravaging blizzards. That was when we\u2019d likely need magical assistance.</p><p>We\u2019d been on the road for about half a day, still maintaining our good mood, when the land shifted over to the Cedar Land. Its king was one of my allies, though I\u2019d rarely spent time here. The snowy landscape looked the same as the others, which is why I didn\u2019t really notice when someone stepped onto the road until he was directly in front of us.</p><p>I recognized him immediately. I yelled Volusian\u2019s summoning words as I climbed off my horse. By the time my feet touched the ground, I had my gun and silver athame out. Striding forward, I drew the air\u2019s power around me. It built up, tense and strong, waiting only for my command to be released. I heard swords drawn behind me but paid them no heed as I came to a halt before the newcomer.</p><p>It was Kiyo.</p><p>The last time I\u2019d seen him, he\u2019d been trying to kill me. He looked exactly the same, with his tanned skin and chin-length dark hair. A North Face coat covered his well-muscled body. He regarded me levelly and didn\u2019t flinch, not even when I put the blade to his throat.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019ve just walked into,\u201d I said, in a voice that rivaled the cold surrounding us.</p><p>The guards were in position around me now, but it was Dorian who spoke up. \u201cMy dear, you might not want to skewer him quite yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked, never taking my eyes off of Kiyo.</p><p>Dorian\u2019s voice was light and easy. \u201cBecause I asked him to join us.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>It took a lot of self-control not to turn around and see if Dorian was joking. My memories of past experiences with Kiyo\u2014like when he\u2019d tried to kill me\u2014were strong enough to make me keep my gaze fixed on him.</p><p>For his part, Kiyo remained calm and unmoving, though I didn\u2019t doubt his excellent reflexes would take over in an instant if I attacked. His dark eyes lifted from my face and glanced at something behind me, presumably Dorian.</p><p>\u201cDorian,\u201d I demanded, \u201cwhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>I heard the sound of feet hitting the ground, and a moment later, Dorian made his way to Kiyo\u2019s side. \u201cExactly what I said. I\u2019ve told you a number of times that this blight is a concern for all kingdoms affected. As such, Maiwenn wanted to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need her help,\u201d I growled. \u201cWe can take care of this ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Dorian tugged his cloak closer. It was violet, with ermine trim. Apparently even dangerous conditions required kingly style. \u201cMaybe. Maybe not. I told Maiwenn she could contribute something, and she suggested the kitsune here since his fox form will make an excellent scout. It seemed reasonable to put differences aside and make a truce for the greater good.\u201d</p><p>It was really hard to know where to start with that. Admittedly, there was some merit to using Kiyo as a scout. He was half kitsune, the son of a Japanese fox nymph. As such, he could shape-shift into a fox at will and would have speed and cold-resistance superior to the rest of us. Useful plan or not, I nonetheless had a few hang-ups about it.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Put differences aside?\u2019\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cHe tried to kill me! Why does everyone seem to forget that all of a sudden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s forgotten that,\u201d said Dorian. There was a glint of steel in his eyes, despite his lazy tone. It gave me hope that he hadn\u2019t completely lost his mind. \u201cAlthough, technically he was trying to kill your children. Since they\u2019re not here, you can now rest in relative safety.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kiyo spoke at last. \u201cYou have my word, Eugenie. I won\u2019t do anything to hurt you on this journey. I just want to put a stop to this blight.\u201d</p><p>I glanced between each man in disbelief. \u201cYour word means nothing,\u201d I said.</p><p>Rurik walked over to my side, sword in hand. \u201cMy lord Oak King is undoubtedly confused by the politics of diplomacy, Your Majesty,\u201d he told me. \u201cAllow me to rectify things by dispatching this miserable creature from the world so that he no longer troubles you and we can be on our way. Decapitation would probably be the most efficient method.\u201d</p> <p>It was the politest tone I\u2019d ever heard Rurik use. It was also the only time in memory that Rurik had sided with me against Dorian. Although Rurik had become my servant a long time ago, he\u2019d always behaved as though he was indulging me while reserving his true loyalties for his former king.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll do it if he won\u2019t,\u201d called Jasmine.</p><p>If Kiyo was cowed by these threats, he didn\u2019t show it. He remained where he was, face earnest. The rest of us, having stopped moving, were all feeling the cold, but Kiyo had a staunch look that said he could stand here all day.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being foolish, all of you,\u201d chided Dorian. \u201cNot to mention melodramatic.\u201d The irony of Dorian accusing others of being melodramatic wasn\u2019t lost on me. \u201cVaria\u2014her subjugated lands aside\u2014only represents one kingdom. We are many. Don\u2019t make me start quoting well-worn adages about uniting against an enemy and how turning against each other will only lead to our downfall. Clich\u00e9s bore me, and standing around is making me cold.\u201d</p><p>Kiyo looked at me unblinkingly. \u201cI have every reason in the world to help you lift this blight and none to betray you. I\u2019ll go scout ahead now.\u201d I wasn\u2019t so sure about the betraying part, but before I could make any further protest, Kiyo shape-shifted into a small red fox. In the blink of an eye, he turned around and scampered down the road, easily covering the snowy distance.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a bad idea,\u201d I warned Dorian.</p><p>\u201cSome would argue our entire plan is a bad idea,\u201d he retorted.</p><p>Our party moved out again, but the earlier energy and good mood were gone. With the exception of Dorian, everyone was either dumbfounded by the turn of events with Kiyo or completely outraged. I saw Rurik trot over to the soldiers from my kingdoms, Keeli and Danil, and murmur something to them that was received with grim nods. I had a feeling they\u2019d either been ordered to never let me out of their sight or to lure Kiyo off alone and decapitate him as soon as the opportunity came. With Rurik, it was hard to say which strategy would appeal to him.</p><p>\u201cVolusian,\u201d I called. The spirit was still lurking about from when I\u2019d summoned him earlier. \u201cYou go ahead too\u2014 but watch Kiyo. Make sure he really is alone and not meeting up with Willow soldiers.\u201d Volusian vanished.</p><p>Seeing Kiyo stirred up all sorts of troubling feelings. I was angry, absolutely, that I\u2019d somehow just acquired him as an ally, despite my protests. It was also hard not to resent him after everything he\u2019d put me through. He\u2019d tried to kill me and my children. Because of him and Maiwenn, I\u2019d spent the last six months hiding and on the run. Those were things I wasn\u2019t going to forgive. I wasn\u2019t even sure I could temporarily put them aside \u201cfor the greater good.\u201d</p><p>At the same time, I remembered that Kiyo and I had once been close. We\u2019d shared a connection. I\u2019d loved him. Nonetheless, I\u2019d had a long time to overcome those sentimental feelings, and they certainly wouldn\u2019t give me a moment\u2019s hesitation if he attacked me again. The other part I kept thinking about was that at the root of all of this, Kiyo was the father of my children. I thought they were wonderful, the most amazing things in either world. Yet, they were half him. What did that mean? Was there good in him? Bad in them?</p> <p>None of the above, Eugenie, I immediately realized. We were not our parents. Each individual was his or her own person, no matter the heritage. Jasmine and I were proof of that. Kiyo was in no way a reflection of who Isaac and Ivy were or who they\u2019d become.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t glare like that,\u201d remarked Dorian, leading his horse up beside me. \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done.\u201d</p><p>I fixed the aforementioned glare on him. \u201cYeah, well, it would\u2019ve been nice if you\u2019d maybe given me a heads-up on this. But no. Like always, you withheld information and decided to pull the strings without consulting anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was presumptuous, true.\u201d From Dorian, that was a big concession. \u201cBut I knew you wouldn\u2019t like it either way. If you\u2019d had notice, you simply would\u2019ve had more time to build up arguments. As it is, he\u2019s joined us and is now off helpfully scouting in a furry, smelly form. By which I mean his fox form. I know it\u2019s hard to tell the difference.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, amazed at his nonchalant attitude. \u201cAnd you think that\u2019s it? All is forgiven and he\u2019ll just be cool with me having Storm King\u2019s grandchildren because we\u2019re all united in some super team? That\u2019s na\u00efve.\u201d</p><p>Dorian\u2019s face suddenly hardened. \u201cEqually na\u00efve is the thought that I would carelessly allow him to do anything to you or your children. How many times do I have to convince you of my protection? Do you really think that if he comes back here and attempts to harm one hair on your head, I\u2019ll allow it? Eugenie, if he so much as looks at you in a way I don\u2019t like, Rurik and his conspirators over there won\u2019t have a chance to act because I\u2019ll have long since run that bastard kitsune through myself.\u201d Dorian\u2019s tone astonishingly became light and easy again. \u201cNow then. I wonder where we\u2019ll be making camp tonight.\u201d</p><p>He rode off to chat with the soldiers, leaving me in stunned silence.</p><p>We rode for most of the rest of the day, giving me a lot of time to think about Dorian and Kiyo, both of whom were troubling for entirely different reasons. Although bundled up, I was starting to feel the cold more and more, especially as the sun began getting lower. The horses marched on steadfastly, but we all knew they couldn\u2019t go as long as they normally would in warmer, easier conditions.</p> <p>Volusian returned and told me Kiyo had done nothing but scout the road as promised. Volusian also made it clear that watching him had been the most boring thing ever and a waste of the spirit\u2019s formidable talents. Kiyo himself came trotting back shortly thereafter, shape-shifting back to his human form as our group drew to a halt. He gestured over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cTwo more land shifts ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re the Elm Land and Palm Land, but it\u2019s hard to tell out here.\u201d</p><p>Elm and Palm. Neither were lands in my \u201cneighborhood.\u201d In fact, we hadn\u2019t been in any of the familiar kingdoms in a couple of hours. I\u2019d at least heard of these lands\u2014and knew they weren\u2019t Varia\u2019s allies\u2014but it was a stark reminder that our journey was taking us far out of our normal path.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a village just over the second border,\u201d Kiyo added. He hesitated before continuing. \u201cWe could possibly camp there... .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo possibly about it,\u201d said Rurik, urging his horse to a light walk. \u201cMuch better for us to be in some kind of civilization for the night than out here in the open.\u201d</p><p>Kiyo frowned. \u201cYeah, but this place ... well, it\u2019s not in great shape.\u201d</p><p>Dorian caught on where I didn\u2019t. \u201cDo you think they\u2019re desperate enough to attack and take our supplies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Kiyo. He nodded to the armed soldiers. \u201cThese people aren\u2019t in good enough shape to face them either, and I think they know it. I just wanted you to understand what we\u2019re walking into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d said Dorian. \u201cBut there are few other options.\u201d</p><p>We set out, and all the calm I\u2019d managed to achieve in Kiyo\u2019s absence vanished now that he was with us again. I think the only thing that made his presence bearable was that he accompanied us in fox form, since that was a quicker mode of travel.</p><p>The village really wasn\u2019t that far over the second border, which Dorian confirmed was the Palm Land. The settlement sat a little ways off the road and looked like something from the set of South Pacific, with lightly thatched huts that seemed completely absurd against the wintry backdrop. The palm trees that had given this land its name were unnaturally big, but that hadn\u2019t saved them from the cold. They were all dead, unable to cling to life as the trees in the Rowan Land had. Some of the Palm residents came out to watch our approach; some peered out at us from the safety of their snowy huts. I had a weird flashback to the time I\u2019d first inherited the Thorn Land, when my own villages had suffered from drought.</p><p>Some of them had been in pretty bad shape, but they were nothing compared to this. My people back in the Thorn and Rowan lands were on rations right now, but beside these gaunt, starving people, my own kingdoms were practically feasting every day. Likewise, the cobbled-together winter attire I\u2019d seen on my people was downright luxurious next to the pathetic scraps of the Palm Land\u2019s residents. The clothing barely covered their bodies. An uneasy feeling spread over me.</p><p>\u201cAre my villages like this?\u201d I asked to anyone who would answer. Since my return, I\u2019d only talked to those who worked in my castles, not those who lived elsewhere. Those in the castles always had a little more than those in the villages and towns.</p><p>\u201cNo, Your Majesty,\u201d said Danil, the guard, coming up beside me. \u201cI\u2019ve been to this kingdom in the past\u2014before the blight. It was prosperous and lush. The weather was so mild that fruit and plants grew in abundance. You could walk outside your home and pick dinner. They had no need to save for winter or trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so they had nothing when the blight came,\u201d I guessed. Things had been far from easy in my kingdoms, but a few things had helped us through this disaster. The Thorn Land had to import a lot of food normally, meaning there were always extra supplies in storage. When the blight had destroyed most of the food found in the wild, there had been some of that backup to go around and share between both of my kingdoms. Likewise, the Rowan Land\u2019s more temperate climate meant there\u2019d been warmer clothing and supplies already in production to share back to the Thorn Land, whose residents (like the Palm Land\u2019s) would normally never need anything more than the lightest of attire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey must be terrified of us,\u201d I murmured as we reached the town\u2019s center. \u201cMost seem to be hiding.\u201d</p><p>Rurik glanced at me, just before he dismounted. \u201cMost are probably dead.\u201d</p><p>He walked ahead to do our negotiating. I wondered if he was our wisest diplomatic choice, but no one else offered protest. I couldn\u2019t hear all of the conversation, but someone who seemed to be a leader gestured to some huts while talking to Rurik. The same man also kept glancing warily at our weapons.</p> <p>\u201cHe probably wants to demand food in exchange for lodging,\u201d said Pagiel. \u201cBut knows he doesn\u2019t have a way to stop us if we don\u2019t heed his demands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish we could give them food,\u201d I said. I saw a few children\u2019s faces watching us from inside the huts, and they broke my heart. I kept thinking of Isaac and Ivy and what it would be like if they too were in these conditions. \u201cI\u2019d take a cut in my rations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d encourage you to,\u201d said Dorian, not unkindly. \u201cThat is, if I knew exactly how long our journey will last. The supplies we brought were just a guess. If they were accurately measured out, you shorting yourself a day or two wouldn\u2019t matter. But for all we know, we\u2019re two weeks low on food. We can\u2019t risk it\u2014not when we have the chance to undo the blight altogether.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, knowing he was right, but that didn\u2019t stop me from feeling bad.</p><p>Rurik returned, looking puzzled. \u201cThey say we can stay in a bunch of huts they have. They\u2019re empty.\u201d He didn\u2019t need to point out the grim reason as to why there was so much empty lodging.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do they want in return?\u201d asked Kiyo.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the weird thing,\u201d said Rurik. \u201cThey didn\u2019t ask for anything\u2014just to protect them while we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow at this. \u201cProtect them from what, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they weren\u2019t exactly clear on that. Mostly all I got from them was \u2018the storm,\u2019\u201d said Rurik. This, naturally, made all of us glance skyward. Nothing too different showed itself above, and my senses didn\u2019t really pick up on any impending blizzard. With the blight\u2019s nature, it was hard to say what might happen. \u201cI agreed to whatever they wanted.\u201d Rurik glanced at us for affirmation.</p><p>\u201cYou did fine,\u201d I told him. I climbed down off my horse, unsurprised to find my body stiff and sore from riding. I knew I\u2019d adapt in a couple of days, but they were going to be long days. \u201cLet\u2019s check out our accommodations.\u201d</p><p>There were plenty of huts to go around. We each could have had our own, though Jasmine assumed she and I would share. I honestly think she didn\u2019t want to leave me alone with Kiyo around. The huts were deceptively small, but as we entered ours, it was obvious this had once housed a family. There was plenty of space and even partitions to create common and sleeping rooms. We had clean cots and a dining table, and mercifully, no personal items of the lost family remained. The walls and roof looked as though they\u2019d been built to keep out any breezes or tropical rain but had little effect on temperature control. A fire pit that had been intended for cooking was going to be our heat source.</p> <p>We\u2019d barely been in there a minute when a young woman came scurrying in behind us. She looked no older than Jasmine, yet at the same time had a haggard appearance from harsh living that had aged her beyond her years. She knelt by the cooking pit and began to deftly light a fire.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to bother with that. We know how to make a fire.\u201d It was a skill one had to acquire in a world devoid of lighters and kerosene.</p><p>\u201cIt is no bother, my lady,\u201d the girl replied, not meeting my eyes.</p><p>\u201cEugenie. My name\u2019s Eugenie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who you are, my lady.\u201d</p><p>The fire roared to life and caught so quickly that I suspected our helper probably had some sort of magical fire ability. Definitely a skill to possess in these times.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cRhona,\u201d she said, getting to her feet. With her facing me now, I was able to get a better look and could see just how harshly the blight had treated her. Her cheeks were sunken in, and there were bags under her eyes. The scraps she wore to stay warm were hardly adequate and showed a figure that was mostly ribs. I also noticed she was missing two fingers off of her left hand and wondered if that was the work of frostbite. The hand had bandages on it, indicating a recent injury.</p> <p>In that moment, I so badly wanted to give her food that my hands began to move of their own accord toward my travel pack. Dorian\u2019s words came back to me, and I forced myself to look ahead. Giving her something\u2014even a strip of dried meat\u2014seemed like such a small thing. But what if that meat would keep someone in my party alive when we reached the Yew Land? What if it meant the difference between stopping the blight and failing?</p><p>Making a decision, I reached for my pack\u2014and pulled out a sweater.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I said. \u201cTake this.\u201d</p><p>Rhona\u2019s brown eyes went wide. \u201cLady, I cannot. It\u2019s too fine.\u201d</p><p>Fine? It was one of the items I\u2019d scraped together at a secondhand store in Tucson, a red wool Christmas sweater with white snowmen on it.</p><p>\u201cI insist,\u201d I said, summoning my most imperious, queenly voice. \u201cIt will be a grave insult if you don\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><p>My bluff worked. Rhona snatched the sweater and clutched it to her chest. \u201cThank you, my lady. Thank you,\u201d she kept repeating. She backed out toward the door, bowing over and over. When she was gone, Jasmine sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that. What if you need it later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a couple others. And she needs it a lot more.\u201d Noting Jasmine\u2019s skeptical look, I added, \u201cHow can you see all that and not be affected by it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try not to see it,\u201d she said bluntly. \u201cOr think about it. It\u2019s the only way I\u2019ve gotten by these last couple months.\u201d It sounded harsh at first, but then I realized I could understand her reasoning\u2014and didn\u2019t like that I could. She tossed her pack unceremoniously on the floor and stretched. \u201cI\u2019m going to go hang out with Pagiel for a while.\u201d</p><p>I knew Pagiel had his own hut for the night and wondered if I should be attempting some sort of chaperoning. In the end, I let her go without a word. She\u2019d become a lot more responsible in our time together, and besides, who was I to deny her some happiness in these times? I pulled a chair as close to the cooking pit as possible and warmed myself while trying not to ruminate on what Isaac and Ivy were doing right now.</p><p>A knock sounded behind me and I called a welcome without even glancing back. A foolish move, as it turned out.</p><p>\u201cEugenie?\u201d</p><p>I jumped up and spun around as Kiyo entered. I had set down most of my weapons already but still had an athame in my belt. I pulled it out and held it out between us. \u201cDon\u2019t come any closer,\u201d I warned.</p><p>He shut the door and then held out his hands beseechingly. \u201cI don\u2019t want any trouble. I\u2019m just here to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no interest in talking to you,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any more explanations about how you\u2019re on this journey to help us and have buried the hatchet in order to save the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s not why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Then are you here to apologize for trying to kill me? Because I don\u2019t really want to hear that either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really here for that either,\u201d he said, crossing his arms over his chest.</p><p>Ouch. I\u2019d meant it that I didn\u2019t want to hear any pleading, and really, no apology could make up for what he\u2019d done. Still, there would\u2019ve been something, well, decent about an attempt at remorse. \u201cThen I really don\u2019t see why you\u2019re here.\u201d I sat back in the chair, turning it to face him, but kept the athame out. I wasn\u2019t about to let my guard down but wanted to project cool confidence.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to talk to you about your children,\u201d he said. \u201cWord is they were born early.\u201d</p><p>I gestured to my stomach. \u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re alive?\u201d The clinically detached way he asked that was shocking.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I replied. \u201cAlive and well.\u201d</p><p>Kiyo sighed in dismay. If he\u2019d said, \u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d I probably would\u2019ve punched him then and there. Instead he said, \u201cEugenie, you must know how dangerous they are. Especially the boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that, actually. What I know is that they\u2019re innocents who have come into the world with their whole lives ahead of them, lives which they\u2014not some prophecy\u2014will shape and which I intend to make happy and meaningful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice in theory but also na\u00efve. I\u2019m sure your father started out as an innocent too. Look how he turned out.\u201d</p><p>Anger was kindling in me, far hotter than the blazing cook fire. \u201cThey\u2019re nothing like him. Neither am I. And nothing you can say will convince me otherwise. It didn\u2019t work when I was pregnant. It\u2019s not going to work now.\u201d</p><p>He took another deep breath, like he was waging a mental battle to try to seem reasonable. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be cruel here. I don\u2019t want any of this. I\u2019m just trying to save this world and the human one from a lot of grief and destruction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not being cruel?\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019re all but suggesting the death of a child\u2014a baby! And for what? Some prophecy which probably isn\u2019t true? These two aren\u2019t even going to know about the Otherworld! They\u2019re far away from any of this, and I intend to see they stay that way.\u201d</p><p>A glint of annoyance showed in his eyes. Maybe whatever anger management he\u2019d been practicing wasn\u2019t working so well after all. \u201cThat\u2019s the attitude everyone has when they try to stop a prophecy. You know the old stories. Trying to avert prophecies just makes them happen. Destiny fulfills itself in ways you never expect.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOur actions and choices shape our destinies,\u201d I growled. \u201cOtherwise there\u2019s no point in living. I can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t see that! You were always so reasonable in the past\u2014at least until you decided to kill your own children. You have no business saying my son\u2019s the monster here.\u201d</p><p>He flinched at those words, as well he should have. A funny look came over his face, one I couldn\u2019t quite place. It wasn\u2019t guilt or chagrin, like I would have expected. Before I could ponder it further, the door opened without a knock and Dorian strolled in as though he\u2019d lived here for years.</p><p>\u201cWhy, hello,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cHope I\u2019m not interrupting anything. I was just passing by and thought I\u2019d see if your charming hovel needed any patching. My magic\u2019s quite good at summoning dirt and rocks for convenient household usage.\u201d</p> <p>He had that typically guileless look and tone, but I wasn\u2019t fooled for an instant. Dorian hadn\u2019t just wandered by. He\u2019d either seen Kiyo come in or heard about it from someone else. My suspicions were confirmed when Dorian put his hands on his hips in a way that opened his cloak and revealed the sword at his waist.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d I said, with a tight smile. \u201cKiyo was just giving me his latest explanation about how my son is a terror to be feared.\u201d</p><p>Dorian scoffed. \u201cLittle Thundro? A terror? Hardly, unless perhaps we\u2019re discussing diapers.\u201d</p><p>Kiyo\u2019s hardened expression momentarily faltered. \u201cWait. You named your son Thundro?\u201d</p><p>My response was preempted by a high-pitched shriek that split the night and made the hairs on my neck stand up. It was neither human nor gentry. I got to my feet and immediately began grabbing my weapons. Dorian and Kiyo were already moving for the door.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d I asked, knowing perfectly well they had no idea either.</p><p>Outside, darkness had fallen, with only well-placed torches to give us light. The terrible screech sounded again, echoed by smaller, terror-filled cries from the Palm residents as they scurried for shelter. A flash of red caught my eye, and I grabbed Rhona\u2019s arm as she ran past.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I demanded. Even in the flickering torchlight, I could see she was as pale as the snow around us.</p><p>\u201cThe storm,\u201d she cried. \u201cThe storm is coming.\u201d She tugged desperately against me, and I released her, more confused than ever. Others hurried past, and within a couple minutes, no one stood outside in the village\u2014except for me and my traveling companions.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d said Rurik, coming to my side. \u201cAre they being raided?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cThey keep saying that\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I heard the roar again, and this time, its owner came into view. My jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the storm?\u201d I asked.</p><p>If you could take every stereotype and caricature of the abominable snowman and roll them into one archetypal snow monster, you\u2019d have what was standing before me. It was about twenty feet tall, covered in white shaggy fur. Three curved horns\u2014one on each side and one in the forehead\u2014protruded from its head. Its eyes were large and black, as were the six-inch claws on its hands. When it roared, I caught a glimpse of a mouthful of razor-sharp teeth.</p><p>Dorian drew his copper sword. \u201cRurik, my friend. The next time you barter for our lodging, do get a bit more information on what exactly we\u2019re paying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sire,\u201d muttered Rurik.</p><p>Seeing as we were standing out in the open, I would\u2019ve thought the Storm\u2014because really, it deserved a capital S\u2014would come charging toward us. Instead it stopped by one of the huts and ripped off the building\u2019s roof in one fell swoop. I heard screams from within. It occurred to me then that perhaps cold and starvation weren\u2019t the only reasons for this place\u2019s low population.</p><p>Dorian made the smallest of motions, and the ground beneath the Storm began to ripple. It wasn\u2019t enough to make the creature fall over, but it did stumble and turn its attention away from the hut and its inhabitants. The fighters in our group\u2014Rurik, Alistir, Keeli, and Danil\u2014wasted no time in charging forward. They stabbed their swords into the Storm\u2019s leg\u2014or rather, they attempted to. Whatever the monster\u2019s hide was made of, it was too tough and thick for copper to pierce. I wasn\u2019t even sure steel would\u2019ve done it. The Storm glanced down irritably and knocked aside Danil and Rurik with one easy motion. Kiyo, in a large and vicious fox form, was right behind the fighters and attempted to sink his teeth into the Storm\u2019s leg. The monster brushed him off as well.</p><p>The Storm began stomping toward the rest of us. Dorian slowed it by manipulating the ground again. At the same time, I felt Jasmine\u2019s magic flare, and a sheet of snow flew into the creature\u2019s eyes, momentarily blinding him. It was clever. Her magic spoke to water, which responded to her even when frozen. Still, I knew this wasn\u2019t going to be enough.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re just annoying it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cCan you banish it to the Underworld?\u201d asked Dorian.</p><p>\u201cNot easily.\u201d Creatures in worlds they didn\u2019t belong in\u2014like gentry and spirits\u2014would be pulled into a gate back to their own worlds. I could also force entities somewhere else, like the Underworld, which would bring about instant death. \u201cFor something this big, I\u2019d need to mark him with a death symbol. I don\u2019t know that I can get close, let alone get the symbol on him. Her. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>As though proving my point, a brave Keeli jumped forward and again tried to slash the monster with her sword\u2014and again proved ineffectual. This time, at least, she was able to skillfully dodge his angry swat, thanks largely to more distraction from Dorian and Jasmine.</p><p>\u201cEugenie,\u201d said Pagiel, touching my arm. \u201cI have an idea.\u201d He quickly explained it to me. I grimaced.</p><p>\u201cCrude, but it might be effective,\u201d I admitted. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>We scanned the village, and I cursed the night since it limited the range of what I could see. \u201cThat one,\u201d said Pagiel, pointing. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d To Jasmine and Dorian, I said, \u201cYou guys do more of the same so it doesn\u2019t realize what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>I drew up the full force of my storm magic, forcing every air molecule I could (figuratively) get my hands on to obey me. Beside me, I felt Pagiel summon up his own air magic. Its feel was similar to mine, and we were able to sync up our forces. Joined with him, I was surprised at how strong he was. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been since Ysabel was pretty adept with air too. I was still stronger, but having his backup made me feel almost godlike.</p><p>Together, we ripped one of the dead palms from the ground, doing it in a way that left the roots behind and created a splintery end. Even among its unusually large kin, this palm was pretty huge. Careful to match each other, Pagiel and I used the air to lift up the palm and turn it on its side so that it hovered in a parallel line to the ground.</p><p>\u201cWe have to make this count,\u201d I said. \u201cWe need a hurricane- or tornado-worthy blast here, or it\u2019s just going to knock him over. Set your aim and get ready. On the count of three?\u201d Pagiel quickly nodded, lines of tension all over his face as he tried to keep up with me magically. \u201cOne. Two ...\u201d The air crackled with tension as I readied to unleash it all. \u201cThree!\u201d</p><p>Pagiel and I released the tree. It flew forward toward the Storm with insane speed. Not only that, it was backed by a lot of force. Maybe it wasn\u2019t honed to arrow sharpness, but when something that big, that fast, and that forceful hits you, it does some damage. Especially when it\u2019s aimed right for the chest.</p><p>Amazingly, we got the tree to pierce that tough hide. Pagiel\u2019s hope had been that the tree would go straight through him, but we weren\u2019t quite that good. Nonetheless, the tree lodged in the Storm\u2019s chest and heart, which was more than enough to kill the beast. It gave another roar, though this was of a very different nature than before. This was a death knell. The monster took a few unsteady steps and then fell to the ground. It twitched a little and then moved no more.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d said Jasmine.</p><p>\u201cAnd now,\u201d said Kiyo, who was human again, \u201cwe also know how to deal with any vampires that come along.\u201d</p><p>Villagers began spilling out of the huts, hurrying to see the outcome of the monster that had been terrorizing them. I glanced over at Pagiel, who was visibly shaking. \u201cYou okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He gave me a weak smile, but excitement glowed in his eyes. \u201cYes. I had no idea I could do that. I mean, I guess I didn\u2019t do it. You were doing a lot more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t too shabby,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got more strength than you know. Not sure I could\u2019ve gotten it through him without you.\u201d Pagiel beamed.</p><p>Beside him, Jasmine scowled. \u201cThey\u2019re so ungrateful,\u201d she said, pointing to the villagers. They had now completely encircled the fallen monster, their backs to us. \u201cNot even a thank-you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re too busy,\u201d said Kiyo, squinting at them with his superior eyes.</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d demanded Jasmine.</p><p>Kiyo grinned at her. \u201cButchering. That thing will feed them for weeks.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>The more we traveled, the more we learned something. Extreme cold and starvation weren\u2019t the only problems facing the Otherworld\u2019s residents. This world was full of all sorts of nightmarish creatures, most of which stayed away from the more civilized kingdoms. Creatures that were adapted to snowy climates also tended to live in obscurity since monarchs preferred to maintain pleasant conditions in their kingdoms.</p><p>Now, that had all changed. Monsters that had lived in ice and snow had just conveniently had their territory expanded exponentially, thanks to Varia. They began creeping out of their haunts, plaguing the bedraggled gentry. With so much infrastructure lost, monarchs were unable to muster much resistance to help their people fend off these threats. The Storm was only the first of many snow-loving adversaries we faced. Ice demons, albino trolls, more abominable knock-offs ... the variety seemed endless the farther we traveled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t we seen these kinds of monsters in our kingdoms since the blight started?\u201d I asked Dorian one day. It was midafternoon, and we rode our horses side by side. He didn\u2019t answer for a few seconds, and for the first time in a very long time, there was a weary\u2014though not quite defeated\u2014air about him. We\u2019d been on the road for a week, and it was taking its toll on all of us.</p><p>\u201cA couple reasons, I\u2019d imagine,\u201d he said at last. \u201cOne is a matter of logistics. These creatures tend to live on the outskirts of our world. It\u2019s simply taken them time to discover the feast the blight has created for them, and then of course, they\u2019d actually have to put in the time to spread out and make the journey. They may simply not have reached our lands yet.\u201d</p><p>That was a disheartening answer, its severity driven home by his sober look. \u201cWhat\u2019s the other reason we haven\u2019t seen them yet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were living in a state of war before this disaster struck. Our armies were built up, our lands regularly patrolled. Much of that has stayed in place, even though our forces have taken heavy hits from the blight. But other kingdoms? Like the Palm Land? They were living an idyllic, peaceful existence. Their armies were minimal, so they had less to work with when the blight fell\u2014and next to nothing now that the monsters are coming out of hiding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill ours be enough?\u201d I asked. \u201cWill our forces be able to protect our people?\u201d</p><p>He studied me for a few moments, and I got the impression he was debating whether to answer with truth or comfort. He opted for the former. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019re in better shape than most, and it\u2019s a rule of nature that predators prefer easy prey. I don\u2019t wish harm on any of these lands, but they\u2019re probably more appealing to snow monsters than lands that fight back.\u201d</p><p>His point was proved by the fact that many of the creatures we encountered tried to back off once they discovered the kind of fight we could put up. The smart thing on our part would have been to let them run ... but we, foolish or not, often pursued and took them out. It was hard not to when we kept passing more devastated villages. Leaving those people unguarded would have been cruel. It didn\u2019t matter if they were our kingdoms or not. We were all victims of Varia.</p><p>The occasional fight also broke the monotony of travel. Volusian and our own intelligence assured us we were on the right path, but our days were long and dreary. We weren\u2019t entirely sure how much farther we had to travel, and our rations were running low. I\u2019d overheard Rurik and the soldiers debating whether or not they should impose new food restrictions to ensure our supplies would last. They\u2019d decided against it at the time\u2014we were already weak from hunger\u2014but I\u2019d gotten the impression that things might change very soon. I didn\u2019t like that, but I disliked the thought of running out of food altogether even more.</p> <p>Kiyo continued to be a constant stress to me. Whenever he had me alone, he\u2019d attempt his absurd \u201creasonable\u201d arguments about why Isaac was such a threat. Fortunately, Kiyo rarely got me alone, since almost everyone else went out of their way to interrupt his attempts. When Dorian did it, he would always act as though he had something really important to ask me, which almost always turned out to be ridiculous\u2014like whether the purple in his cloak clashed with his tan horse. Others, like Rurik, made no such pretenses. He would simply force himself into the conversation and glare until Kiyo backed off.</p><p>Despite his nagging, Kiyo otherwise seemed to go to great pains to act like we were all civilized and friendly. I supposed this was better than him being aggressive or homicidal, but it seemed ridiculous after what he\u2019d done to me. I couldn\u2019t really believe he expected me to forgive and forget.</p><p>He scouted throughout most of the daylight hours, giving me some peace. One afternoon, he came tearing back toward us in fox form, with a sense of urgency that was obvious even as an animal. Immediately, we stopped and drew weapons, ready for an army of abominable snowmen around the bend. Kiyo reached us and turned human.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I demanded. I was tired and sporting a headache (probably from lack of food) but was ready to fight if need be.</p><p>Kiyo was panting, meaning he\u2019d run back to us at a pretty serious pace. His fox form was normally pretty hardy. \u201cYou ... you have to see this. You won\u2019t believe it.\u201d Recovering himself, he glanced around and seemed to notice our tension. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t need your weapons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it then?\u201d asked Rurik, who showed no signs of putting his sword away.</p> <p>\u201cYou just have to see it,\u201d said Kiyo wonderingly. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d He shape-shifted back to a fox and began trotting away. He paused after a few steps and glanced back to ascertain we were following. We set out at a cautious pace, none of us disarming.</p><p>\u201cThe kitsune\u2019s gone insane,\u201d said Dorian with mock sadness. \u201cI knew it would happen sooner or later. If cold or starvation didn\u2019t do it, I figured his own nature would bring it about. You can see these things coming, you know. I spotted it long ago, not that anyone bothered listening to me.\u201d</p><p>I smiled in spite of my apprehension. \u201cRight. You\u2019re a regular\u2014\u201d</p><p>I gasped. The land had shifted around us, as it did a few times each day. Only this time ... we weren\u2019t in a blighted kingdom.</p><p>Brilliant sunlight and a blue, blue sky nearly made me wince after spending so much time in the stark landscape of the blight. Chilling silence had been replaced by birdsong and the chatter of other animals. Trees\u2014with leaves\u2014spread out as far as we could see, radiantly green and alive. And the temperature ... that was the most amazing thing of all. Probably, it was only around seventy, but after being in the blight, we might as well have stepped into the tropics.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no blight here,\u201d exclaimed Jasmine, her gray eyes wide. \u201cIt\u2019s like\u2014plums! Holy shit! Plums!\u201d</p><p>She was off her horse in a flash, running toward the nearest tree. With dexterity I hadn\u2019t known she possessed, she scurried up the trunk and began picking purple and gold fruit as soon as she could reach the branches. She tossed several of the plums to the ground and then hopped down holding a huge one for herself. She bit into it, juice running down her chin, and looked as though she would faint in ecstasy.</p><p>The rest of us wasted no time. We dismounted too and joined in the plum feast. The crazy thing was, I don\u2019t even like plums, but in that moment, they were the most delicious things I\u2019d ever tasted. Our rations had consisted mostly of dried, salty goods that would travel well. Eating something so sweet and so fresh was exquisite. Plus, there were no limits here. We could eat as much as we wanted\u2014and we did. I didn\u2019t doubt I\u2019d regret it later, but for now, it was glorious to have a full stomach. I stretched out in the grass when I was finished, marveling in the warmth. Others joined me, also basking in the moment. It took Dorian to point out the obvious.</p> <p>\u201cYou realize, of course, why there\u2019s no blight here?\u201d he asked. No one responded. \u201cThis is one of Varia\u2019s subject kingdoms. If not the Yew Land itself.\u201d</p><p>That revelation certainly dampened the mood. I summoned Volusian, though it seemed like a shame on such a beautiful day. The only positive part was that this sort of cheery, bright location obviously bothered him.</p><p>\u201cMy mistress calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d I asked. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the Yew Land already, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, mistress. We are in the Beech Land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d asked Jasmine with a mouthful of fruit. \u201cSeems like the Plum Land to me.\u201d</p><p>Volusian regarded her with narrowed eyes. \u201cI am quite sure. This kingdom lies near the Yew Land, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d I said to Dorian. \u201cOne of Varia\u2019s subjects.\u201d</p><p>Dorian was sprawled on the grass, eyes closed and face tilted toward the sun. \u201cOf course I was right.\u201d</p><p>Kiyo tossed aside a plum pit. \u201cI checked where the road led. It crosses back to the blight in a few miles, then back to this land. Not sure after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good sign that we\u2019re on the right track. We should stay here for a little while. Stock up, wash up ...\u201d</p><p>A number of us had begun peeling off our layered clothing, and the effects of not having bathed in a while were kind of obvious.</p><p>Jasmine sat up and peered around us. She pointed off to her right. \u201cThere\u2019s a body of fresh water over\u2014\u201d</p><p>The sound of hooves on the road startled all of us. The impromptu plum picnic had made me feel lazy and content, but we\u2019d spent too much time on edge recently to go totally lax. We were all on our feet as a group of riders came into view. Just like the scenery, these gentry were a sharp contrast to those we\u2019d seen in the blight. This group was clean, well dressed, and obviously eating well. They looked strong and healthy\u2014and had weapons drawn. We followed suit, though I hoped an altercation wouldn\u2019t be necessary.</p><p>I also figured this probably wasn\u2019t the most ideal situation for Rurik to negotiate, so I stepped forward before he could attempt to take control. Dorian joined me, and I tried to look pleasant and nonthreatening as I faced the riders.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want any trouble,\u201d I called. \u201cWe just want to pass through peacefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can pay for the plums, if that\u2019s the problem,\u201d added Dorian helpfully.</p><p>\u201cWe know who you are,\u201d snapped one of the riders. She was a woman with graying, curly hair and bore the air and authority of a leader. \u201cAnd we know why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>That caught me by surprise, and I wondered what had given us away. Had someone leaked our plan to Varia? Had our descriptions been spread around? Did she have all of her kingdoms on high alert?</p><p>\u201cSo just turn back now,\u201d the rider continued. \u201cWe don\u2019t want your kind here.\u201d</p><p>I blinked in confusion. If Varia was on alert for us to attempt some ploy, she would hardly have her people simply send us away. \u201cI ... I don\u2019t understand,\u201d I said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re like all the others,\u201d she said in disgust. \u201cDragging yourselves in from your wretched lands, trying to steal our food. Go back to where you came from and reap what you\u2019ve sown for not acknowledging our queen as your mistress.\u201d</p><p>Dorian immediately figured out what was going on. \u201cDo we look like refugees simply here to steal food?\u201d That might not have been the best question since we had just stolen food and looked kind of tattered. Still, there was a big difference between us and the other gentry we\u2019d passed on this journey. \u201cThe reason we\u2019re here is to fall upon your queen\u2019s mercy. Our king sent us here to plead with her.\u201d</p><p>The riders exchanged questioning looks with each other. \u201cIt\u2019s true.... You don\u2019t look like the usual rabble,\u201d admitted the spokeswoman. It was a sign of our worn state that we didn\u2019t look like royalty either. We certainly looked more like servants than masters. \u201cWhat kingdom do you come from?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Lilac Land,\u201d said Dorian quickly. This was met with blank looks, largely because said kingdom didn\u2019t exist, to my knowledge. \u201cIt\u2019s very far away. We\u2019ve been traveling a long time and simply want to free our land from the curse.\u201d</p><p>The riders had a quiet conference with each other and finally came to a decision. \u201cWe\u2019ll escort you to our borders,\u201d said the gray-haired woman. \u201cJust to be certain. Once you cross into the next loyal kingdom, however ... be warned. You may not find such a warm reception. The Mimosa Land and its residents are not nearly so accommodating.\u201d</p><p>This was warm and accommodating? That didn\u2019t bode well for the next kingdom. I also found it sad that a place called the Mimosa Land was unfriendly. It sounded like a party waiting to happen.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d said Dorian, in the humblest voice I\u2019d ever heard him use. \u201cMay we rest here briefly? We promise not to take long. We wouldn\u2019t want to waste your valuable time, fair lady.\u201d He then diminished some of his meekness by flashing her one of his charming, come-hither smiles. To my astonishment, she actually blushed. Unbelievable.</p><p>We were granted our break, but it was hardly the long bath I\u2019d hoped for. I mostly managed to get the worst of the travel grime off and chose to stay in the clothes I\u2019d been wearing. By Kiyo\u2019s report, we weren\u2019t entirely free of the blight yet, so there was no point in getting rid of the warm clothing yet. In fact, our party had to manage some tricky maneuvers to get it on and off quickly once our journey resumed. The layers were too heavy for the Beech Land but instantly needed when the road took us across the blight. After about three crossings, we stepped from the Beech Land into a new kingdom. It was evening now, and I couldn\u2019t make out much in the darkness. The heat and humidity were immediately discernible, though. It kind of reminded me of Ohio.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the Mimosa Land,\u201d declared the Beech woman. We had never learned her name, though Dorian had certainly tried to woo it out of her with his shameless flirtation. \u201cAnd here we depart. If the road maintains the pattern it has recently, you won\u2019t cross the blight anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d said Dorian, sweeping her a bow. \u201cYour kindness will not be forgotten. Nor will your beauty. My dreams will be haunted by your starry eyes and glossy hair.\u201d</p><p>She merely grunted at that, but as the riders turned around, I caught sight of her smoothing back her hair in some weak attempt at styling. \u201cThat was ridiculous,\u201d I told Dorian, once she\u2019d left. \u201cShe\u2019s not the kind of person to fall for your flirting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d said Dorian. \u201cShe\u2019s exactly the kind of person to fall for it. I understand these warrior maids, you know. They live such harsh, cold lives, always trying to keep up with the men ... when really, they just need someone to make them feel like a woman. And that, of course, is an area in which I excel. Why, if I\u2019d had ten minutes alone with her\u2014\u201d</p><p>I groaned but couldn\u2019t help laughing too. \u201cJust stop,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d Dorian grinned back at me, supremely pleased with himself.</p><p>\u201cWe need to make camp,\u201d said Kiyo harshly, not looking amused at all. In fact, he looked downright disapproving. \u201cAnd post watches, if what she said was true about this being a hostile land.\u201d</p> <p>The levity vanished, and we were back to business again. The blight itself was more than enough proof that Varia and her allies weren\u2019t people we wanted to underestimate. We doubled our usual night watch, and even those of us who weren\u2019t on duty had trouble sleeping. The tropical setting was full of night noises, and I tossed and turned over each one of them, certain every insect or rustle of leaves was a combatant sent by Varia.</p><p>And yet, morning came uneventfully. I didn\u2019t know if our presence had gone undetected or if the Mimosa residents really weren\u2019t as dangerous as the Beech captain had claimed. Since this land didn\u2019t seem to border any of the blighted ones, maybe there wasn\u2019t such a need to protect against refugees. Regardless, we deemed ourselves reasonably safe enough to finally take our full break and get in some serious bathing in a nearby lagoon. We took the baths in gender shifts\u2014something most of the gentry found silly\u2014while the other half of the group gathered food. The Mimosa Land didn\u2019t have fruit immediately growing on the road, but in this climate, one didn\u2019t have to search far for sustenance.</p><p>Once I was stripped and in the water, I was able to get the first good look at my body that I\u2019d had in a while. All of my residual pregnancy weight was gone. Unfortunately, this was largely because of the stringent diet I\u2019d been on these last couple weeks. I wasn\u2019t showing quite as many ribs as the others, but it was clear gym time would have been a much healthier way to get my figure back than near-starvation. Still, provided we survived this adventure, I could hope for nutrition soon and some return to my former state. The scar from my C-section was still obvious, but that would be the case for the rest of my life. For now, it was enough to have a moment\u2019s peace and the luxury of submerging myself in water.</p><p>\u201cEugenie.\u201d</p><p>There was an odd note to Jasmine\u2019s voice as I emerged from underwater and tossed my soaking hair back. Blinking, I glanced over at her and saw that she and Keeli were focused on something off on the shore. I followed their gazes and saw nothing at first. Then, a slight movement revealed a lithe, female figure. I hadn\u2019t noticed her because she literally blended into her surroundings.</p><p>Ostensibly, she had the same features as any pretty gentry or human woman. It was her coloring that was remarkable. Her hair and eyes were a vivid emerald green, her skin tanned to a shade of nut brown. Her only garment was a short dress made of leaves and flowers. She watched us nervously, like a doe ready to flee.</p><p>\u201cDryad,\u201d said Keeli matter-of-factly. \u201cUsually harmless.\u201d</p><p>Dryads were rare in the human world, though sometimes they made it over. I\u2019d never encountered one myself but knew \u201cusually harmless\u201d was an accurate statement. Dryads were tree nymphs who preferred to be left alone in their woods. When threatened, they could get aggressive. Otherwise, they tended to be shy and were often in more danger from passing men who were attracted by that Otherworldly beauty. Dryads allegedly didn\u2019t welcome those advances and could be quite hostile to the opposite sex.</p> <p>\u201cI wonder if she could give us information about this place,\u201d Jasmine remarked. I raised an eyebrow. It was a good idea and a surprising one from Jasmine, who tended to run to extremes.</p><p>\u201cShe probably won\u2019t know much. It\u2019s unlikely she\u2019d have any loyalty to Varia,\u201d added Keeli. \u201cDryads usually stay out of our affairs.\u201d</p><p>We were using \u201cusually\u201d a lot here, but it was worth a try. I attempted what I hoped was a friendly smile at the dryad as I took a few steps toward the shore. \u201cHi there,\u201d I said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to hurt you. We\u2019re just passing through.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine decided to help as well. \u201cNice, um, trees you\u2019ve got around here.\u201d</p><p>The dryad regarded us thoughtfully with her long-lashed eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re human,\u201d she said in a voice that put one in mind of babbling brooks. She tilted her head. \u201cSomewhat.\u201d</p><p>I gestured to Jasmine and me. \u201cHalf human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met any human at all,\u201d said the dryad.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re harmless. I promise. What\u2019s your name? I\u2019m Eugenie. This is Jasmine and Keeli.\u201d</p><p>Again, the dryad considered her words. \u201cAstakana.\u201d It was a big name for someone so delicate, but at the same time, it suited her.</p><p>\u201cLeave her be,\u201d murmured Keeli. \u201cShe\u2019ll come to us on her own. Or won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>So, with a few more friendly smiles, we returned to our swim and ignored Astakana. Travel in the Otherworld had prepared me to carry a few essential toiletries, and once I was sufficiently scrubbed clean, I sat on a rock and began untangling my hair with a plastic comb. I felt rather mer-maidlike. Also, considering I was sitting here naked with three other women around, I also kind of felt like something from a Penthouse letter.</p><p>\u201cYou have lovely hair.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been so intent on playing casual that I had almost forgotten the dryad\u2019s presence. Glancing up, I was surprised to see she\u2019d come closer to me. I hadn\u2019t noticed her moving. Keeli hadn\u2019t either, and even if she thought Astakana was \u201cusually harmless,\u201d the guardswoman still swam over to stay near me. Jasmine soon followed.</p><p>\u201cUh, thanks,\u201d I said. \u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I braid it?\u201d asked Astakana.</p><p>I glanced around at the others. They shrugged. Braiding? That was unexpected. I guessed we were now moving into slumber-party territory. Still, the dryad looked so hopeful that I held out the comb. \u201cKnock yourself out.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and sat behind me. \u201cI can\u2019t touch that. And I don\u2019t need it anyway.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough. Her deft fingers began sorting and arranging my hair, working out any residual tangles with touch alone. Jasmine and Keeli moved in closer, enthralled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d said Jasmine, cocking her head to get a better view. \u201cCan you do mine next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d said the dryad sweetly.</p><p>Astakana didn\u2019t massage me or anything like that, but her workmanship had the same soothing quality as she began braiding small sections of my hair. I sighed contentedly, feeling more relaxed than I had in months, and it was only halfway through that I remembered I was supposed to be getting information out of her.</p> <p>\u201cHave you lived in the Mimosa Land for long?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAll of my life,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSeems like a nice place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d she assured me.</p><p>\u201cMuch better than other places,\u201d I added. \u201cLots of other lands are having a terrible winter right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen any other lands,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI\u2019ve never left this glade.\u201d</p><p>I stifled a yawn, feeling mildly disappointed. If she\u2019d never been outside this parcel of land, it seemed unlikely she\u2019d know much about the world around her.</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about Varia?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cVaria.\u201d Astakana said the name with a slightly puzzled tone. \u201cShe rules the shining ones of a neighboring kingdom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this kingdom, from what I hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps that is what the shining ones say. My people keep free of their affairs.\u201d</p> <p>I looked over at Keeli and Jasmine to see if they had anything to add that might provide more information. So far, Astakana didn\u2019t seem to have much to offer. But my two companions looked as though they weren\u2019t even listening. They were too fixated by Astakana\u2019s braiding skills and bore a dreamy, languid look. When the dryad finally finished with me, I discovered I had long since dried from the bath. She moved on to Jasmine while I sought clean clothes. After so much time bundled up, it was nice to just put on jeans and a T-shirt. When I returned to the others, I watched Astakana\u2019s clever hands work and found myself just as fascinated as the others.</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s hair was longer than mine, so it took Astakana a while to arrange it. When Keeli\u2019s turn came, the dryad still took great pains with her hair, even though it was only chin-length. I sighed happily, watching the strands of hair go in and out, up and down. It was hypnotic. My eyelids felt heavy, and the afternoon heat and humidity were making me sleepy.</p><p>Afternoon?</p><p>I blinked myself awake and squinted up at the blue, blue sky. The sun was at its peak, and for a moment, I thought I was imagining things. We\u2019d come here early this morning, and even with a \u201cleisurely bath,\u201d we\u2019d only intended to spend about an hour.</p><p>\u201cHow ... how long have we been here?\u201d I asked. A seed of panic was rising in me over the fact that I even had to ask a question like that. I honestly wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cDunno,\u201d said Jasmine, not taking her eyes off of Astakana\u2019s hands in Keeli\u2019s hair.</p><p>I stood up and began pacing, trying to get my thoughts in order. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t any of the guys come looking for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey probably didn\u2019t want to bother us,\u201d said Keeli. \u201cThey know how you feel about male and female nudity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut after, what, four hours? I think they would\u2019ve risked it.\u201d The more I walked around, the more I returned to myself. Keeli and Jasmine seemed lost in their own worlds, though. \u201cYou guys? What\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>Astakana glanced up from her work and gave me a pretty frown. \u201cWhy are you so agitated? Come back and join us. Once I finish her, I\u2019ll find some flowers to put in your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time for that!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for this. You guys ... we need to go.\u201d</p><p>Neither of my companions moved. I hurried back over and jerked Jasmine to her feet, dragging her away from the dryad. \u201cHey!\u201d exclaimed Jasmine, with the first spark of energy I\u2019d seen all day. \u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to snap out of this. We need to get back to the camp. We\u2019ve been here half the day!\u201d</p><p>At first, Jasmine looked disbelieving. Then, glancing up, she deduced what I had about the time. She frowned, and I could see clarity returning to her eyes. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>I tossed Jasmine her satchel. \u201cKeeli,\u201d I called. \u201cKeeli, we need to go.\u201d</p><p>Keeli didn\u2019t respond, and I strode toward the dryad, grabbing my silver athame along the way. \u201cWhat have you done to her? What have you done to us?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d replied Astakana with another sweet smile. She finished the last of Keeli\u2019s braids and stood up. \u201cNothing but spend a pleasant morning with you. It\u2019s what we do. We bring peace and joy and leave happy memories\u2014at least for women. With men, we leave nothing at all.\u201d</p><p>The men. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to them?\u201d I suddenly felt cold all over. \u201cWhy were you distracting us? Never mind. Just get the hell away from her.\u201d</p><p>I advanced with the athame, but Astakana moved with all the speed of the doe I\u2019d likened her to earlier. She sprinted away, laughing merrily.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done you a favor,\u201d she called. \u201cYou don\u2019t need those men. Men cause war. Now you can pass through our land serenely and maintain Varia\u2019s great peace.\u201d</p><p>Before I could attempt to figure out what that meant, Astakana bounded off into the woods and melted away. It was unclear if she simply slipped into the trees or became one, but I had no more time to care. She was gone, and I turned back to my friends. Jasmine was dressed, and Keeli was staggering to her feet.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get back,\u201d I told them. Assuming they\u2019d follow, I set off at a hard run back to where we\u2019d left the guys.</p><p>If our experience had resembled a slumber party, the men\u2019s was about two steps away from an orgy. I found the five of them exactly where I\u2019d left them\u2014only, they weren\u2019t alone. Half a dozen dryads were there, performing the same kind of spa treatment Astakana had been giving us. Kiyo sat shirtless while a dryad rubbed some kind of flower oil into his back. Another dryad twined flowers into Danil\u2019s hair. Still another held Dorian\u2019s head on her lap and crooned to him as one of her cohorts rubbed his feet. All the men had the same dreamy, glazed-eyed looks we\u2019d had at the lagoon.</p><p>I hurried forward with the athame, not entirely sure of my strategy, save that it would likely end in some dryad ass kicking. \u201cGet away from them!\u201d I yelled, hoping either silver or a pissed-off woman would scare them. \u201cLeave them alone!\u201d</p><p>The dryads scattered like a flock of birds, offering no resistance and disappearing into the trees with more merry laughter. After what Astakana had insinuated about men, I had thought there might be a fight ahead of us, as though the dryads would be busy slitting throats. All the men seemed to be alive, though, and I breathed a sigh of relief. We\u2019d made it in time. Jasmine and Keeli soon joined me, also looking relieved.</p><p>\u201cWell, that could have been a lot worse,\u201d I said, putting the athame away. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize this would be the danger we\u2019d face from the Mimosa residents.\u201d</p><p>None of the men responded. None of them even looked my way. I\u2019d assumed that, like us, they would come back to themselves once the dryads\u2019 druglike presence was gone. Yet, all of the guys were staring off into space with dopey looks on their faces, oblivious to us and the world.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with them?\u201d asked Jasmine.</p><p>\u201cNot sure,\u201d I said. I hurried over to Rurik and shook his shoulder. \u201cHey. Wake up. Walk it off, okay?\u201d He said and did nothing. Frustrated, I attempted to rouse the others and received similar results. Astakana\u2019s words came back to me: We bring peace and joy and leave happy memories\u2014at least for women. With men, we leave nothing at all.</p><p>I stared around in disbelief, clueless what to do. The men were still alive, but for all intents and purposes right now, they were dead to the world.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>\u201cThis is stupid,\u201d said Jasmine. Her usual condescension was tinged with a hint of uncertainty. \u201cYou\u2019re just not trying hard enough.\u201d She stormed over to Pagiel. A dryad had been giving him a shirtless massage, and he lay sprawled where she\u2019d left him. Jasmine grabbed his arm and pulled him to a sitting position. She leaned close to his ear. \u201cHey! Wake up!\u201d After a little awkward struggling, she actually managed to get him to his feet. To my astonishment, he not only remained standing but also took a few steps forward.</p><p>I gaped. Jasmine had been right. I hadn\u2019t tried hard enough. Except, Pagiel soon came to a stop. He stood where he was, still gazing off with that blank expression that saw nothing of the world. He was like a sleepwalker. Jasmine\u2019s brief grin of triumph crumpled, and she looked at me beseechingly.</p><p>\u201cEugenie?\u201d</p><p>There it was again, the idea I could fix anything. I sighed and studied our men, searching for some clue that might undo this. Noting the flowers and flower oil, I momentarily hoped removing them would do the trick. But not everyone had flower exposure. There was just something intoxicating and deadly about the dryads\u2019 presence that created this enchantment. I\u2019d certainly experienced it.</p><p>Out of answers, I summoned Volusian. He appeared in the shade of a magnolia tree and took in the scene at a glance.</p><p>\u201cMy mistress has been visited by dryads.\u201d</p><p>I nearly sagged in relief. Identification had to be a good sign. \u201cDo you know how to fix this? Can we bring them back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would think my mistress would appreciate the peace and quiet,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cVolusian! Answer the damned questions!\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed\u2014in thought or irritation, I couldn\u2019t say. \u201cI don\u2019t know, mistress. Many men don\u2019t recover from dryad magic. There are ways to combat it, but they don\u2019t always work. Dryad victims usually starve to death or wander off of cliffs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeez,\u201d said Jasmine. \u201cThey must really hate men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we have to do?\u201d I asked Volusian.</p><p>\u201cYou can start by placing mistletoe berries under their tongues. A single one will do,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I frowned. \u201cI\u2019m sketchy on my botany ... but isn\u2019t mistletoe poisonous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot always fatally so,\u201d Volusian replied. \u201cEspecially in such a minute amount. At most, they will get fantastically ill, but that hardly seems worse than their present condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Fantastically ill.\u2019 What a great image,\u201d I said. \u201cThen what? They\u2019re cured?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Mistletoe simply weakens the dryads\u2019 magic\u2014but it cannot break it. To fully pull them out of the spell, you must give them a reason to come back. The dryads weave an enchantment of perfect contentment. Most don\u2019t want to leave that.\u201d</p><p>I thought back to our waterside slumber party. I wouldn\u2019t exactly say I\u2019d been perfectly content, but I had been charmed enough by simple hairstyling to obliviously waste part of the day. If we\u2019d felt that way from just a brush of dryad magic, what would the full force of it do?</p><p>\u201cSo ... when you say give them a reason, do you mean talk to them? Can they even hear us?\u201d I glanced at the blank gazes around me. \u201cIt sure doesn\u2019t seem that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf what you have to say is meaningful enough to them, they will hear it. That and the mistletoe may be able to free them of the enchantment. Much depends on the individual\u2019s will. The weak rarely escape.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t like the implications. \u201cWell, this is a pretty strong group. If anyone can break free, they can. So ... we need mistletoe and a pep talk.\u201d</p> <p>Keeli stepped toward Volusian and crossed her arms. \u201cSpirit, what kind of mistletoe is required? White?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would work best,\u201d he confirmed.</p><p>Whoa. I hadn\u2019t even known there were multiple types. I only knew about the kind you kissed under at Christmas, which was usually plastic in my experience. \u201cYou know plants?\u201d I asked Keeli.</p><p>\u201cEnough to get by,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd enough to know that we\u2019re not likely to find white mistletoe in this climate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt grows in the Yew Land,\u201d said Volusian. \u201cAnd we are very close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow close?\u201d I asked, a bit startled by this news.</p> <p>\u201cFive miles down the road perhaps. At least, that\u2019s what I observed earlier. The road may have shifted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d said Keeli eagerly. \u201cAllow me to ride on ahead and find the mistletoe. I know what it looks like.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cYou can\u2019t ride into enemy territory alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet we can\u2019t leave them alone either.\u201d She gestured to our slack-jawed men. \u201cI won\u2019t raise notice if I slip in alone.\u201d</p><p>I considered. We needed to get the mistletoe, but she was right that we couldn\u2019t leave the men alone. Who knew what else might come along in this land? I weighed everyone\u2019s abilities and then came up with the best division of labor I could.</p><p>\u201cJasmine will go with you,\u201d I said. \u201cVolusian and I will stay here with the guys and try to talk some sense into them.\u201d No matter her brave words, I couldn\u2019t send Keeli alone, nor could I leave Jasmine alone on defense. This seemed the best option. \u201cBut I, uh, might need your help first to move them.\u201d</p><p>Much like Pagiel, the rest of the men could be coaxed to their feet and made to walk, so long as someone was there every step of the way. We ended up taking them back to the lagoon since it was relatively sheltered and not near the road. We brought the horses and supplies next, and I was surprised to find myself sweating when all was done, thanks to the heat. It was a welcome change after the blight. Keeli and Jasmine mounted their horses and prepared to go.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d I warned.</p> <p>\u201cWe will,\u201d said Jasmine. She eyed the men, whom we had sat down in an almost artful arrangement near the water\u2019s edge. \u201cYou know, this would be the perfect time to kill Kiyo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cJust throwing it out there. You know he\u2019s going to keep being a pain in the ass. Toss him in the lake and claim he wandered in there and drowned. No one would know, and we wouldn\u2019t tell.\u201d Keeli nodded emphatically.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said. It was a bit alarming that I could understand their reasoning\u2014but there was no way I could go there. \u201cBelieve me, I wish I could get rid of him. But doing it to him in this state would be as bad as what he tried to do to me.\u201d</p><p>The two of them rode off, leaving me and Volusian behind. I gave him orders to patrol the area and let me know immediately if he heard or saw something concerning. Of course, it was hard to imagine anything much more concerning than my present situation. Despite all the life and noise of the forest around us, there was an eerie silence at the lagoon. It just didn\u2019t feel right to be sitting with five other people and have none of them make a sound. Those freaky, glassy-eyed stares also creeped me out.</p><p>Still, I had a job now. Volusian had said I needed to give them all a reason to come back. That sounded more like a job for my mom the therapist. I wasn\u2019t a prickly person, not exactly, but I hardly had that easy bedside manner for exploring feelings and making others feel better. The guys had apparently had a chance to gather food before the dryads came, and I\u2019d helped carry their haul when we transferred everything to the lagoon. Most of it was fruit, but the blight was still too fresh in mind for me to even think about eating any more dried meat. Finding a banana, I sat cross-legged and studied each guy in turn, trying to think what would appeal to him.</p><p>When I finished eating, I decided to start my therapy with Rurik. I sat down beside him, feeling a little foolish at first, but knew I just had to jump right into it.</p><p>\u201cRurik, I know those dryads didn\u2019t really enthrall you. You\u2019re too crazy about Shaya to let those tree strumpets have any effect. If Shaya was here, I bet she could\u2019ve kicked all their asses. I mean, she controls plants ... so maybe her magic would\u2019ve done something to them since they\u2019re into trees. Or maybe she would\u2019ve just walked up and punched them. That\u2019s what I\u2019d probably do. Wipe those smirks off their little nymph faces. You have to get better so you can go back to her, you know. I\u2019m still not sure what you did to win her over, but it must have been a lot of work. You can\u2019t let that all go to waste, and no matter how \u2018frivolous\u2019 she thinks it is, I still think you guys need a honeymoon. I\u2019m going to order it once we\u2019re all home and this blight is put to rest. I can do that because, you know, I\u2019m queen. So, if she\u2019s not reason enough to snap out of this, I don\u2019t know what it is. I mean, I suppose I\u2019d miss you too if you die here. You don\u2019t always have the most respectful attitude, but you do get things done. I hate to admit it, but I\u2019d have a hard time replacing you. I guess I\u2019d have to appoint Davin in your place.\u201d</p><p>I stopped talking, suddenly wondering if I wasn\u2019t doing more harm than good. While Rurik was unquestionably the leader of my forces, Davin was another soldier and kind of Rurik\u2019s rival. I\u2019d inherited Davin with the Rowan Land, and he\u2019d proved remarkably loyal and competent\u2014and made it abundantly clear that he thought he\u2019d do a better job than Rurik. It didn\u2019t help matters that they were polar opposites. Rurik was a soldier to the heart, rough and efficient. Davin served well but also had a great appreciation for the finer things that Rurik scoffed at. Studying Rurik, who had had no reaction since I began talking, I reconsidered my doubts. Rurik was just contrary enough that maybe a little tough love was the real tactic here.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I continued, \u201cmaybe that\u2019d be easier for you in the long run. I know how much you hate it when your job makes you dress up and go to diplomatic functions. Davin doesn\u2019t mind that stuff, though. Have you ever seen his wardrobe? It\u2019s pretty amazing. I think he spends more time on his hair than I do. Even if you do get out of this enchantment, I might just have him start doing that high-level stuff anyway. It\u2019d be a favor to you, really, since you\u2019re not that good at it. Plus, I know how much you hate going to some of those balls and parties with Shaya. I\u2019m sure Davin wouldn\u2019t mind escorting her. He\u2019d probably even coordinate his clothes to match hers. That way, you could just stay home or go hunting or whatever.\u201d</p><p>Still no reaction. Volusian had given me the impression that even if the guys heard me, they might not show it. Furthermore, it still might not be enough without the mistletoe to counteract some of the magic. I decided to give Rurik a rest and move on to the others. I\u2019d keep making the rounds, and maybe, bit by bit, I\u2019d chink away at the dryads\u2019 enthrallment.</p><p>Danil was next. I didn\u2019t attempt the cruel reverse psychology I had on Rurik, but I did put the same emphasis on his loved ones. Danil had been with me since I took over the Thorn Land, so I knew something about his life, like that he\u2019d been married for a year and just had a baby. I talked to him about his family, pointing out how happy they\u2019d be to see him. I even briefly mentioned Isaac and Ivy, saying that it\u2019d be great if our children could play together someday.</p><p>I nearly skipped Alistir. He was Dorian\u2019s man, and I didn\u2019t know much about him. Still, I took the time to chat about what I did know, like how much Dorian valued him and how we needed Alistir to save our kingdoms. Hopefully, Keeli would know something more after having talked so much to him on this trip. Or, Dorian himself might help once he was restored.</p><p>Kiyo was difficult, and I nearly skipped him for an entirely different set of reasons. Jasmine\u2019s parting words really didn\u2019t help because they were all I kept thinking about as I sat next to Kiyo. Maybe he was our ally now, but he\u2019d made it clear he wasn\u2019t about to let the prophecy go. Even if our blight quest had a happy ending, what then? There\u2019d be no peace for me. Far easier to get rid of him now when Dorian couldn\u2019t come to his defense.</p><p>But as I\u2019d told Jasmine, taking advantage of Kiyo\u2019s situation would be as despicable as what he\u2019d done to me. I wouldn\u2019t stoop to that level, and even though I intended them to grow up without him, he was still the father of my children.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Maiwenn will want to see you again,\u201d I began awkwardly. Were they romantically involved? Those two were always on and off again, but I wasn\u2019t up on the latest gossip. Talking about her wasn\u2019t my favorite topic, but Kiyo\u2019s young daughter with her was a bit easier. \u201cAnd I know Marta will too. She must be so big now. Does she walk and talk? Maybe I\u2019ll see her someday. Regardless, you have to break this spell so you can get back to her. Even being on this journey must be hard. You\u2019re probably missing all kinds of neat things she\u2019s doing. I know how you feel. I keep thinking about Isaac and Ivy and how every day keeps me from something amazing. So hurry up and come back to us so we can get you back to the Willow Land.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Some cynical part of me noted that I could probably inspire him if I started reminding him that he had to break the enchantment and keep hunting me and my children. It might very well work, but there was no way I could hint at him harming my children\u2014even if it might save his life. I\u2019d refused Jasmine\u2019s offer to kill him outright, but I\u2019d gladly let him die from the dryads\u2019 magic before giving any acknowledgment to his crazy attitude about the prophecy.</p><p>So I stuck to Marta and Maiwenn and how Kiyo had to help us defeat Varia. I even mentioned the menagerie of pets he had back in Arizona. When I felt I\u2019d made a decent effort, I moved on to Pagiel, who was a bit easier. I praised his bravery and loyalty and talked about his family, even saying kind words about Ysabel and Edria. After Kiyo, those two women no longer ranked so high on my list of despised people.</p><p>That left Dorian. It was weird because I probably knew him the best, and yet ... I really wasn\u2019t sure exactly which words would get through to him. As it was, I had a hard enough time making myself say anything. It was too weird seeing him so lifeless. Dorian was always in motion. Even when he was deceptively calm, there was an energy that crackled within him. He was always thinking something, always planning ahead. But now? This wasn\u2019t right. This wasn\u2019t how he was supposed to be. How many times had that little smirk of his infuriated me? I\u2019d give anything now to see it replace this listlessness.</p> <p>I stared at him for a long time. Panic seized me, mostly because I was suddenly afraid I would fail. There was so much between us that I\u2019d been putting off. Had I lost my chance forever? It took me three tries to finally talk to him because I kept choking up.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do this without you,\u201d I managed at last. \u201cEveryone talks about my powers, but you\u2019re the badass here. We need you to pull this off\u2014and for more than just your magic. Who else is going to be smart enough to get us to those gifts? Even Volusian\u2019s not sure where they\u2019re at. We need you for the planning\u2014and I know you\u2019re sure as hell not going to let that Varia bitch get the best of you. The Oak Land means too much to you. It\u2019s everything to you.\u201d</p><p>I exhausted those topics as much as I could, praising his strength and cleverness. I knew there were deeper topics to address but couldn\u2019t quite get myself to go there. I was about to start the rounds again with the other guys when I heard someone coming through the woods. I turned, silently cursing Volusian for not warning me, and then saw it was Jasmine and Keeli. They and their horses looked as if they\u2019d been traveling at breakneck speeds. Keeli climbed down practically before her horse even came to a halt and proudly showed me several vines of mistletoe.</p><p>\u201cMore than enough,\u201d I said in approval. \u201cAny trouble? Were you spotted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever saw anyone,\u201d said Jasmine, joining Keeli. \u201cWe were lucky enough to find some oaks not far from the border that had this stuff growing.\u201d</p> <p>I took one of the vines. \u201cOkay, then. Let\u2019s try this. Remember\u2014just one berry. We want \u2018fantastically ill,\u2019 not dead.\u201d</p><p>We went around and carefully placed a berry under each man\u2019s tongue. It was a little gross but not much weirder than half the things I did on a daily basis. Part of me had kind of hoped for a miraculous transformation the instant the mistletoe was placed, but it was obvious this enchantment was still a ways from being broken.</p><p>\u201cWe should keep talking to them,\u201d I told Jasmine and Keeli. \u201cDo either of you know anything about Alistir? Like his personal life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in love,\u201d said Keeli, expression softening. \u201cWith a girl back in the Oak Land. She loves him too, but her father doesn\u2019t approve. That\u2019s why he joined the king\u2019s guard\u2014to prove himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMovie quality,\u201d I murmured. \u201cCan you go talk to him? Remind him of all he\u2019s got?\u201d</p><p>She did, and Jasmine went on to Pagiel. I decided to repeat my pattern and start with Rurik again, hoping that Shaya and Davin would have more impact with the mistletoe. The other women and I rotated through the men, each hoping we might think of something that would be the key to unlocking this spell. Neither Keeli nor Jasmine would talk to Kiyo, however. That was all on me.</p> <p>The sky was turning red when we finally called a dinner break. The three of us were exhausted mentally and physically. We\u2019d lost a day here in the Mimosa Land, but that was nothing compared to the fact that none of our efforts had yielded any results. The men sat there, unchanged. There\u2019d been no time to search for other food, so dinner was simply more fruit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Volusian soon and see what else we should do,\u201d I said, biting into a papaya. \u201cMaybe we have to replenish the mistletoe or something.\u201d It sounded lame, even to me, but I didn\u2019t know what other options we had.</p><p>\u201cI hope those dryads come back,\u201d growled Jasmine. \u201cAfter I make them fix all of this, I\u2019m going to rip their hair out and wreck their pretty little bitch faces.\u201d Jasmine had even gone as far to unravel some of her braids while riding to and from the Yew Land. They\u2019d been bound tightly, though, and her haphazard efforts had left her hair looking pretty ratty. I appreciated the zealous initiative, though. Both Keeli and I had been too busy to bother with our hair.</p><p>\u201cI doubt they\u2019ll be back,\u201d I said. \u201cThey did what they intended. Got revenge on men and took out strangers to their land at the same time.\u201d</p><p>This was merely met with nods. We were all too disheartened to make much conversation and simply ate in silence as night fell. The hum of the forest made a background of white noise I hardly even noticed anymore, which was why it was so startling when a voice spoke out of the shadows.</p><p>\u201cYou are not going to replace me with that pretty boy Davin.\u201d</p><p>I nearly choked on my berries. Hastily swallowing, I spun around to look at Rurik. He was still sitting but no longer in a frozen, blank way. He was shifting, working the kinks out of his arms as he blinked the world into focus.</p><p>\u201cRurik!\u201d I ran over and knelt before him, Keeli and Jasmine right behind me. \u201cRurik, are you okay?\u201d</p> <p>He started to speak, and then a grimace came over his face. Turning, he spat onto the ground. \u201cWhat was in my mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA necessary evil,\u201d I said, grinning like a fool. \u201cOh my God. You have no idea how happy I am to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear that a lot from women,\u201d he said, wincing as he shrugged his undoubtedly stiff shoulders.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember anything?\u201d asked Jasmine. \u201cFrom this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember ...\u201d He frowned and suddenly looked confused. \u201cThose women ... the green-haired women. I remember them coming to us, and then ... I don\u2019t know. It was like I was in a tunnel, and there were voices coming to me from a long ways away.\u201d He glanced at the three of us. \u201cYour voices.\u201d</p><p>I was so happy that I didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cThis is the best news ever. Now that we know the enchantment can be broken, we can get the others out of it too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe others ...\u201d Rurik looked around him and noticed his fellow men. The sun was nearly gone, but our campfire clearly illuminated the statuelike quality of the others. Rurik jumped to his feet with amazing speed for someone who\u2019d been catatonic all day. \u201cWhat the\u2014? My lord! My lord, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He flew to Dorian\u2019s side with a devotion that almost brought tears to my eyes. Much as we\u2019d first tried, Rurik began shaking Dorian in an effort to wake him up.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work,\u201d I said.</p><p>Rurik turned to me, and I think it was the most scared I\u2019d ever seen him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him? With them?\u201d</p><p>We explained, and Rurik wanted to waste no time in helping. I urged him to take a moment to recover from his ordeal, but he\u2019d hear nothing of it. His energy and awakening inspired the rest of us, and we continued our efforts with new vigor.</p><p>And miraculously, over the next couple hours, the men began to wake up one by one. Blessedly, only Danil got sick from the mistletoe, and it was hardly \u201cfantastically ill.\u201d Like Rurik, all the men were eager to help, and before long, we had everyone restored to their original states\u2014except Dorian.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t he wake up?\u201d I asked. The flickering firelight cast weird shadows on his face. \u201cVolusian said it was tied to strength and will. Dorian\u2019s probably the strongest person I know.\u201d</p><p>Alistir frowned as he sipped water from a skin. \u201cI seem to recall ... I feel like there were two of those dryads with him?\u201d There was uncertainty in his words, but they sparked a memory.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I said. \u201cThere were two with him when we approached. Would that do it? Two dryads\u2014double the power?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d said Keeli. \u201cEspecially if they tagged him as the strongest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll have to work twice as hard,\u201d said Rurik, feeling no shame at just having been declared second best. He finished off a banana. All of the men had been starving and thirsty. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him now.\u201d</p><p>Rurik jumped to it with zeal, and others followed in shifts. As midnight came around, the effort faded a little, mostly from exhaustion. Watches were set, and the rest of my companions began settling down for sleep. Keeli and Jasmine had offered to take the first watch. They were tired but still felt the men needed some true rest. Kiyo stopped me when I passed where he\u2019d spread out his blanket.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s not better by morning, we\u2019re going to have to make some hard decisions.\u201d Kiyo nodded toward where Dorian sat straight and still.</p><p>It took me a moment to follow. \u201cWhat? No. We\u2019re not leaving until he\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if he\u2019s not? You\u2019ve been trying all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was hit twice as much as the rest of you! He just needs longer to recover,\u201d I said, working hard not to shout.</p><p>\u201cOr, he may not recover at all,\u201d said Kiyo ominously. \u201cDepending on how strong the magic is. What then? How long do we wait here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as it takes! We have plenty of food.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kiyo sighed. \u201cBut again\u2014what if he simply isn\u2019t going to wake up? How much time do we waste? Every day means others suffer in the blight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t leave him,\u201d I said stubbornly. \u201cI know you don\u2019t like him, but this isn\u2019t negotiable.\u201d</p><p>Irritation crossed Kiyo\u2019s features. \u201cMy personal feelings have nothing to do with this! He\u2019s a huge asset on this trip. I don\u2019t want to go to the Yew Land without him. But I don\u2019t want to waste valuable time either.\u201d Kiyo rested a hand on my arm. \u201cEugenie, please. Just think reasonably.\u201d</p> <p>I jerked away. Whenever he talked about me being reasonable, it usually involved harm to my children.</p><p>\u201cDorian\u2019s going to get better,\u201d I said. \u201cJust wait until morning. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kiyo said grimly. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>I stormed off to where Dorian sat and managed to get him upright. I walked him a little ways from where the others were sleeping and tried to ignore that he moved much more stiffly than he had earlier. Once I was satisfied we were still within safety but wouldn\u2019t interrupt anyone\u2019s sleep with talking, I settled him back down in the grass. After a moment\u2019s thought, I laid him down and curled up by his side. His green eyes looked dark in the poor lighting and stared up at the stars without seeing them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me with him,\u201d I whispered fiercely. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me alone. You\u2019re the only one who really understands me in all of this, and I know Kiyo\u2019s wrong. You\u2019re going to get better. We need you too much. I need you.\u201d</p> <p>I nearly started in on the same spiel I had before, about how we couldn\u2019t pull this mission off without Dorian\u2019s skills. Then, I reconsidered. I\u2019d been going on with that song and dance all day\u2014and it had had no effect. You must give them a reason to come back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, still keeping my voice low so that only Dorian could hear. And I was certain he could. He had to. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t been very nice to you ... for a while. You\u2019ve done a lot for me\u2014probably more than anyone else\u2014and I threw a lot of it back at you. That was wrong. I mean, I don\u2019t agree with the philosophy of the Iron Crown\u2014you know I don\u2019t\u2014but I understand why you did it. And I know it wasn\u2019t done to be manipulative. Not intentionally, anyway. I know how you are. You need to get things accomplished, and when you see the most efficient way, you do it. It\u2019s why you\u2019re such a great leader. It\u2019s why people will follow you anywhere.\u201d</p><p>No response, of course. I felt tears spill out of my eyes and was again overcome with the wrongness of this. Things like this didn\u2019t happen to Dorian. Others, maybe. But not him.</p><p>I rested my cheek against his arm. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who asked, you know. About the twins. And leaving them. I miss them, Dorian. I miss them so much. All the time we\u2019ve spent trudging down this miserable road, lying out in the cold ... they\u2019re always on my mind. What are they doing? Are they okay? I keep wondering if they\u2019re out of the NICU. I hope so\u2014and it\u2019s not just because it means they\u2019re better. I don\u2019t want them spending any more time than they have to with machines. They need people and love. And the people I left them with? They\u2019re wonderful. They\u2019ll be good to Isaac and Ivy, but still ... I wish I could be there with them.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to me I was doing therapy more for myself than him. Yawning, I tried to get back on track. \u201cI want you to meet them. I don\u2019t know if I can ever bring them to the Otherworld, but maybe we can find a way to get you to them. We both know their father\u2019s useless, but I want them to have men in their lives who are good and strong. You and Roland are probably the greatest men I know, and I want you both around to help Isaac and Ivy\u2014especially Isaac. He\u2019ll need good role models.\u201d</p><p>I nearly added that Isaac needed guidance to protect him from the prophecy, but that wasn\u2019t a good idea for Dorian. \u201cAnyway, you have to come back to me. There\u2019s too much I need you for. Too much we still have to do. Not just the blight. You said you wanted to fix things between us and bring back the trust. I want that too\u2014but I can\u2019t do it without you.\u201d</p> <p>In a movie, this would\u2019ve been the optimal moment for him to come back to life a la Prince Charming. No such luck. He stayed exactly as he was. Feeling defeated, I wiped away my traitorous tears. The day\u2019s weariness was taking its toll, and I couldn\u2019t muster any more encouraging words. Nonetheless, I refused to leave his side. Maybe I was too tired for pleading, but I wanted him to know I was there. I snuggled in closer, keeping my face close to his sleeve in case any more tears broke free.</p><p>Sleep found me in spite of my sorrow. The body always knows best, even if the mind doesn\u2019t. I slept heavily, and no one woke me for my watch\u2014which they really should have. I stirred in the morning, when I felt the sun\u2019s first rays warming my skin.</p><p>Something brushed my face, and I opened my eyes, thinking a butterfly had landed on me. Instead, I found Dorian\u2019s fingertips touching my cheek and his eyes regarding me fondly. They were green and gold\u2014and full of all the life and cunning I remembered.</p><p>\u201cDorian?\u201d I whispered, barely daring to believe it. A happiness and wonder I hadn\u2019t even known I was capable of spread through me.</p><p>\u201cThe same,\u201d he said, just before pressing a kiss to my forehead. \u201cDid you miss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Maybe a lot.\u201d</p> <p>A smile lit his features, more glorious than the sunrise around us. There was a joyous shout from the other side of the clearing. Someone had noticed he was awake. Dorian\u2019s smile turned rueful.</p><p>\u201cNever a moment\u2019s peace, is there? Well, then.\u201d He shifted himself up, wincing a little from being inactive for so long. \u201cLet\u2019s go do great things, shall we?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>None of the men seemed to show any serious aftereffects from the dryad magic, aside from dehydration and distaste for mistletoe. I watched them all with concern, especially Dorian. I thought I was managing it covertly\u2014but apparently not.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to break, you know,\u201d he told me. We were getting ready to set out, and I was packing up my bag near him. \u201cYou can let me out of your sight once in a while\u2014not that I mind the touching show of concern. It\u2019s almost like you care.\u201d</p><p>I flushed and focused on my packing. \u201cOf course I care. I mean, you know, because you\u2019re my friend. And we need you. And you were hit the hardest by the dryad magic. It\u2019s perfectly normal to be worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfectly normal,\u201d he agreed. His face was the picture of innocence, but I caught the amusement in his voice. There was no mention of that brief, golden moment when I\u2019d woken up with him, but the warmth of it stayed with me for the rest of the day.</p><p>Based on Keeli and Jasmine\u2019s mistletoe run, we knew we could expect to cross into the Yew Land today, which sent a whole new sort of tension through us. Thus far, our journey had concentrated on the specific stages we needed to accomplish at the time\u2014first crossing the blight, then Varia\u2019s subjugated kingdoms. Those were big enough obstacles, and there\u2019d been little time to talk about anything more. Now we had decisions to make.</p><p>\u201cNo idea yet if you can cross the border?\u201d I asked Volusian.</p><p>\u201cNo, mistress.\u201d The rest of our party was gathered in a circle, but he stood slightly apart. \u201cAt least, I don\u2019t know yet if I can cross with you. I know I can\u2019t alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so now we figure out where we actually have to go,\u201d mused Kiyo. \u201cWhat\u2019s your best guess about where Varia would be keeping the talismans?\u201d</p><p>Volusian eyed him with disdain. \u201cI do not guess. I make logical assumptions based on my considerable knowledge and experience.\u201d</p><p>I hid a smile. \u201cThen what\u2019s your logical assumption about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat there are two options, mistress\u2014straightforward ones that even most of you could deduce. Varia will either keep the objects as close to her as possible so that she can rest assured of their safety\u2014or she will hide them in the most remote spot possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s straightforward,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s stating the obvious. You\u2019re dangerously close to the latter. Is it really split that evenly? I mean, should we just flip a coin about where they might be?\u201d</p><p>Volusian considered. \u201cI would recommend you assume they\u2019re near her. Likely she\u2019s in her capital or some other well-situated place, which will give you a more concrete goal to search. It also seems likely she\u2019d need the objects somewhat accessible to her magic users\u2014which would be more convenient for them in a place that didn\u2019t require a considerable or difficult journey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we go to the capital then,\u201d said Pagiel eagerly. The long journey had made him restless, and he was ready for action. \u201cYou can lead us, right?\u201d</p><p>Volusian usually came off straight-faced, but I could often pick up on certain nuances now and then that indicated his true feelings. I got a distinct you\u2019re-wasting-my-time vibe as he answered Pagiel: \u201cOf course I could lead you\u2014were I certain I can go into the Yew Land. Which I am not. As I just stated moments ago.\u201d</p><p>Pagiel scowled, and I quickly spoke before he tried to pick a fight with Volusian. \u201cThen we\u2019re going to need you to give us directions or a map or something to help us once we cross, just in case we lose you. I\u2019m sure the layout\u2019s changed since your day, but a few guidelines will help\u2014and I can\u2019t imagine the capital\u2019s exactly inconspicuous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d Volusian agreed. \u201cAnd it\u2019s called Withywele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith-a-what?\u201d asked Jasmine.</p><p>It seemed kind of a lighthearted name for the lair of someone so conniving. Volusian gave us what info he could, and before long, we were finally ready to head out for real. Between this planning and yesterday\u2019s \u201cincident,\u201d we\u2019d lost almost a day and a half of travel time. Having food and warmth made the delay easier to cope with, but we were always aware that a day had much more impact on those still suffering in the blight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>About five miles down the road, we crossed into the Yew Land and paused to look around. The climate was temperate, a hair cooler than the Rowan Land (when not blighted), with big deciduous trees that reminded me of the Pacific Northwest. The forest had its own set of chattering insects and animals and gave off the same rich vibe of life and fertility that the Mimosa Land had had. Both were miraculous after the snowy kingdoms we\u2019d left behind. I was so entranced that I didn\u2019t notice the obvious until Kiyo pointed it out.</p><p>\u201cVolusian\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>I glanced to my side, where Volusian had been hovering along earlier. Sure enough, he\u2019d vanished at the border. \u201cNo need to panic yet,\u201d I said. \u201cHe seemed to think that would happen. I can re-summon him.\u201d</p> <p>I spoke the words and waited. I felt the magic stir within me and then spread out when I called for him. As I did, I had the impression the magic was breaking apart and scattering, like dandelion seeds on the wind. Usually, that magic was like an arrow heading straight for him and bringing him back to me. Frowning, I took out my wand and attempted it again. I\u2019d grown so strong in the last year that I\u2019d no longer had to use the wand for summoning him. Now, its extra power might help.</p><p>The magic spread out from me again, this time feeling more cohesive and stabilized ... at first. Then, after several moments, I felt it start to fracture again. No Volusian. The fact that I\u2019d felt a change at all inspired me, and I refused to give up. Tightening my grip on the wand, I made a third attempt, using a focus and harnessing of power I hadn\u2019t needed with him in ages. The effort made me tense all my muscles and begin to sweat, but I felt the magic hold. At long last, Volusian appeared, but he was a shadow of his former self. Often, spirits looked different between the human world and Otherworld, with a more solid form in the latter. Volusian was so strong that he appeared the same in both worlds\u2014usually. Now, although his features were the same, he was translucent and wavering, like I\u2019d expect to see from a weak spirit in the human world.</p><p>\u201cIt seems my mistress\u2019s bonds have overridden those of the Yew Land,\u201d he said. I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say he sounded impressed, but he definitely seemed a little less scathing than usual.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but not without a lot of effort,\u201d I pointed out. Although I didn\u2019t constantly have to pump magic through the bond to hold me, I had a feeling that slipping up even a little would cause me to lose him again.</p><p>\u201cToo much effort,\u201d he replied. \u201cI would recommend my mistress not call me until absolutely needed. If you exert this kind of power continuously, you may weaken yourself for Varia or not be able to command me anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d I said. I didn\u2019t feel as though he was close to breaking his servitude, but there seemed no point exerting unnecessary effort. \u201cAnd now we at least know it works. You can go.\u201d He vanished, and I breathed a little easier.</p><p>We continued on, all of us on high alert as we watched the forest for any sign of trouble. Dorian brought his horse up beside mine and said in a low voice, \u201cWas I the only one who noticed Volusian actually advised you of a strategy that would keep you bound to him? Unless things have changed, I\u2019m fairly certain he loathes and wants to destroy you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, thinking back to Volusian\u2019s words. \u201cOh, that hasn\u2019t changed. But as hard as it is to believe, I think he hates the Yew Land more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cIf I did keep him with me nonstop here, it\u2019s possible I would grow too weak to bind him as my servant anymore. True, he\u2019d be able to kill me then\u2014but not while I was in the Yew Land. Because as soon as he broke free, there\u2019d be nothing to pull him back. He\u2019d be banished once again. I think he wants to be here, and I\u2019m the only way to make that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he wants revenge?\u201d asked Dorian.</p> <p>I recalled Volusian\u2019s animosity when he\u2019d first seen the ambassador\u2019s statues. \u201cAbsolutely. Although ... I\u2019m not sure on whom since everyone from that era is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, you might be courting trouble in allowing him to be here. He might act out on his own\u2014and you might not be able to keep him in check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, wondering what Volusian on a rampage would look like. Not something I wanted to ponder too much. \u201cBut he\u2019s still useful to us, which is something I don\u2019t think we can put aside. Besides, this sounds terrible ... but all of us have the same end goals, even him. None of us like the Yew Land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrection. Volusian doesn\u2019t like the Yew Land. We don\u2019t like Varia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. Does that mean you think I\u2019m making a mistake in keeping him around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Dorian, shaking his head. \u201cHe\u2019s an asset. And I know how much those mean to you. You certainly told me that enough when I was entranced.\u201d</p><p>I groaned and looked away. \u201cI\u2019d been wondering how much you\u2019d remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably more than you\u2019d like,\u201d he said, sounding far too cheerful. \u201cBut I found it quite delightful. In fact, I\u2019m very pleased to be invited to train up little Ivy and Thundro. That was most kind of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d I turned back to him and was treated to a full-on Dorian smirk. \u201cThat is not what I said. Not exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s very reasonable,\u201d he teased. \u201cI have skills no one else can teach your children. And it\u2019d be a shame not to pass my legendary charm and charisma on to the next generation. A tragedy, even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegendary, huh? That might be an exaggeration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s truth, my dear. And I\u2019m willing to put it all at your disposal\u2014I\u2019m willing to put anything at your disposal\u2014if it\u2019ll help you and yours. As I keep saying: What wouldn\u2019t I do for you?\u201d</p><p>I met his eyes, expecting to see some Dorian sarcasm, but he was utterly serious. I was uncomfortably reminded of this morning, when I\u2019d woken up and seen him alive and well. Something inside of me had opened and felt more joyous than I\u2019d been in a while. I was starting to feel that way now, and it frightened me.</p><p>We kept our conversation to ourselves, but our growing rapport was noticeable to others. Kiyo had a lot to say about it.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said to me as we took a midday break, \u201cI see you and Dorian are allies again.\u201d</p><p>I took a long drink from a water jug as I contemplated my answer. We\u2019d just crossed into another kingdom, as was typical when traveling. It was always a little disconcerting to leave the place you were going to, but Volusian had assured us we\u2019d be back in the Yew Land before long.</p><p>\u201cDorian and I have always been allies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the way I remember it,\u201d said Kiyo darkly. \u201cDidn\u2019t he lie and trick you into winning the Iron Crown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d I agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t like it, but I\u2019ve become more understanding of why he did it. It was for the greater good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was for his own selfish ambition!\u201d Kiyo cast a glance over his shoulder to see if anyone was listening. \u201cYou know that. You know how he is. He wants to use you for his own ends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I said, thinking back on recent conversations with Dorian. \u201cBut I also think he wants what\u2019s best for me and my children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants what he thinks is best for you.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes. \u201cWell, considering that involves my children staying alive, I\u2019ll gladly take that over you advising on what you think is best. You really have no business preaching to me about this, especially after I was the only one yesterday who even bothered to\u2014\u201d</p><p>A shout from Rurik immediately turned me from Kiyo. The others in my party were already looking in the direction we\u2019d just come from, and I quickly spotted what they had. I leapt to my feet and drew my weapons as a group of people on horseback emerged around a bend in the road. Seeing us, they came to an abrupt halt and drew weapons of their own.</p><p>\u201cStay right where you are,\u201d warned one of the men in the strange group. He had a curly blond beard and wielded a worn but effective-looking copper sword. \u201cAttack us, and you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><p>Rurik grinned at him, but there was no genuine humor to it. \u201cIf you don\u2019t lower your weapons, you\u2019ll regret it. Set them on the ground now before we have to take them from you.\u201d</p><p>All this did was make the strangers tense and brace for battle. My group did the same, myself included. Yet, as I did, I took the opportunity to study our combatants more closely. They were all gentry, all armed, but their weapons didn\u2019t have the uniformity or maintenance of the Beech soldiers\u2019. This group wore nothing resembling uniforms either. Their clothing was worn and, in some cases, mismatched. Cloaks and furs were draped in front of them on their horses, like they\u2019d been hastily pulled off when the climate had changed. Some of their faces were smudged, and all looked like they hadn\u2019t been eating well.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I said, hurrying forward.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t advise it,\u201d said Rurik, gaze fixed on the strangers. \u201cStay back for your own safety.\u201d</p><p>I halted in the middle of our two groups. \u201cWho are you? Where are you from?\u201d</p><p>The new group eyed me suspiciously. \u201cWho are you?\u201d asked the blond-bearded man.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re from one of the blighted lands, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I asked, positive I was right.</p><p>Nobody changed their stance, but the bearded guy regarded me with new interest. \u201cWhat of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are we,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019re from ...\u201d What was that absurd name Dorian had come up with the other day?</p><p>\u201c... the Lilac Land,\u201d he said, coming to stand beside me. He held his sword still, but his posture was more relaxed. I think he\u2019d come to the same conclusion I had about these people.</p><p>\u201cNever heard of it,\u201d said a woman from the newcomers. A spotted falcon sat upon her shoulder and watched us with equal suspicion.</p><p>\u201cMost haven\u2019t,\u201d said Dorian, deadpan. \u201cIt\u2019s very far away.\u201d He glanced between her and the blond man and must have decided she was a better bet. Dorian gave her one of his charming smiles. \u201cWhat\u2019s your kingdom called?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a moment\u2019s hesitation, and then she said, \u201cThe Hemlock Land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve suffered considerably,\u201d said Dorian. \u201cJust as we have.\u201d</p><p>My next leap was drastic, but again, I felt pretty confident of my instincts. \u201cYou\u2019re going to surrender to Varia, aren\u2019t you?\u201d It seemed logical. They weren\u2019t a big enough force to stage a rebellion, but underneath the wear and tear, something about this group said they weren\u2019t commoners. I was certain they were here to negotiate. \u201cSo are we.\u201d</p> <p>Some of them shifted uncomfortably. \u201cIt\u2019s the best thing for our people,\u201d the woman said, almost defensively. \u201cThat\u2019s what matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d I agreed, hoping I sounded compassionate. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be ashamed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never said we were,\u201d she said. Clearly this was a sensitive topic, which I understood perfectly.</p><p>The blond man lowered his sword, which I took as an excellent sign. \u201cAre you going to Withywele?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Dorian quickly, before anyone could mess up the story. He lowered his sword too. \u201cWe assumed that would be the place to find the queen. A guide gave us directions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The spokesman turned and murmured a few words to his group. Most of them nodded, though a couple\u2014like the woman\u2014shook their heads emphatically. At last, the blond man turned his attention back to us. \u201cWe know the way. If you wish, you may travel with us. It will certainly help to have more of us to face the peacekeepers.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Dorian and was met with a puzzled shake of the head. \u201cWhat are the peacekeepers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA jest of a term,\u201d said the Hemlock woman, scowling. \u201cQueen Varia leaves certain enchantments and obstacles in her subservient kingdoms to keep them in line. The residents are given ways to avoid them and be safe ... unless they displease her. The peacekeepers also discourage outsiders.\u201d</p><p>Kiyo spoke up. \u201cWould you consider a group of dryads part of this, uh, peacekeeping?\u201d</p> <p>The woman nodded gravely. \u201cMost certainly. They\u2019re an excellent force to be used against strangers\u2014but can be coaxed to leave natives alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive us a second,\u201d I said.</p><p>Hoping I wouldn\u2019t be attacked in the back, I turned and walked back to the group with Dorian. \u201cI don\u2019t trust them,\u201d said Rurik promptly.</p><p>\u201cNor should we,\u201d said Dorian. \u201cNot entirely. Though, they may be useful if they know the Yew Land\u2014and about these \u2018peacekeepers.\u2019 That certainly would\u2019ve been helpful information earlier when we met those wenches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVolusian couldn\u2019t have known,\u201d I said, barely believing I was defending my minion.</p><p>Kiyo sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of traveling with strangers, but we certainly need all the intel we can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t look any happier about traveling with us than we do with them,\u201d said Pagiel. It was a remarkably observant statement. \u201cWe could probably pretty much keep to ourselves until we got to Withywele. Even there, they might be able to help us with the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we agreed then?\u201d I asked, looking at each of my friends\u2019 faces. Seeing Rurik\u2019s scowl, I added, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You can keep your weapons handy. And we\u2019ll double the watches.\u201d</p> <p>That mollified him slightly, and when we told the Hemlock leader\u2014whose name turned out to be Orj\u2014our decision, I got the impression their group had also been having a similar conference for traveling procedure and defense. So, we all set off together, the air heavy with wariness but also with a sense of solidarity. There was comfort in numbers.</p><p>We spoke little to our new companions at first. When we settled down to camp for the night, a bit of the tension lifted. Each group offered up food, and there\u2019s something about a shared meal that encourages friendliness, particularly among the gentry with their strong ideas about hospitality. The soldiers in our group\u2014though always on guard\u2014had the easiest time bonding. When your life involves constantly being shuffled to new situations and fighting with those you don\u2019t know, I think it becomes easier to make friends where you can.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, each party contributed its own people to the watches. Mine was later in the night, and as I spread out my blanket near the campfire, Alea\u2014the woman with the falcon\u2014came and sat beside me. The bird sat on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSpots is surprised you aren\u2019t sleeping with him,\u201d she said.</p><p>It took me a few seconds to dissect that statement. First, I realized Spots must be the falcon\u2019s name. Then, I thought she meant the bird wanted to sleep with me\u2014until I saw her gaze on Dorian.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I said in understanding, staring at the opposite side of the fire. Dorian caught my eye and smiled. I quickly looked back at Alea. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he your man?\u201d she asked curiously. \u201cIt seemed like it from what I observed today.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t recall Dorian and I doing much more than our usual chatting while traveling, but maybe others saw things I couldn\u2019t. \u201cHe used to be,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut not anymore.\u201d</p><p>She arched an eyebrow. \u201cWhy ever not? He\u2019s very attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d I said, a bit more wistfully than I intended. \u201cAnd smart and powerful and resourceful.\u201d I thought about it a moment more. \u201cAnd kind.\u201d</p><p>The bird made a couple of clicking sounds. Alea tilted her head to listen and then nodded. \u201cSpots says he sounds like an ideal mate and can\u2019t understand what your problem is.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cIt sounds like Spots has a lot to say about romance.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHe sees things we sometimes miss. Often, his view of the world is much simpler than ours. That\u2019s why he has trouble understanding your comments.\u201d She murmured something to him that sounded like squawks, and the falcon flew off into the night.</p><p>\u201cI guess because it\u2019s not simple,\u201d I said, trying not to look at Dorian again. \u201cWe had some disagreements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone has disagreements,\u201d she said dismissively. \u201cOnly fools think otherwise. And only fools allow their pride to hinder reconciliation, especially in these times.\u201d</p><p>The bitter note in her voice wasn\u2019t lost on me. \u201cHas your kingdom suffered a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s the only thing that would drive us to this course of action.\u201d She stared off into the night, face filled with anger and frustration. \u201cI\u2019ve been to war, you know. And nothing I saw there matched the horror of children starving and freezing to death. Or of entire villages being slaughtered by monsters from the frozen reaches.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that too.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t like bending the knee to Varia. But I like seeing my people and king suffer less. So. Here we are. As I said, only fools refuse to put their pride aside.\u201d</p><p>I said nothing right away. Even without talking to Orj or the others in the Hemlock party, I\u2019d picked up on this same angry vibe\u2014people pushed into a corner and out of options. Traveling with them was good for us because it ensured we\u2019d get straight to Varia\u2019s capital. Yet, I also wondered if some other good might come out of it. I\u2019d have to tread cautiously, though.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever thought of any other options?\u201d I asked. \u201cLike not giving into her?\u201d</p><p>Alea glanced back, irritation in her dark eyes. \u201cI already told you. It\u2019s not worth my kingdom\u2019s suffering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014I don\u2019t mean bravely refusing and letting the blight go on. Have you ever thought about openly opposing her? Rebelling? Attacking?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, and I couldn\u2019t read her thoughts. \u201cHave you?\u201d she asked at last. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem possible.\u201d</p><p>I was careful not to directly answer the question. \u201cMaybe it is. Maybe it isn\u2019t. Maybe it would depend on how many people were willing to work together against her.\u201d</p><p>Various emotions played across Alea\u2019s face, as though this was a debate she\u2019d had with herself many times. A resigned expression fell over her, and I suspected she\u2019d reached the same conclusion she had countless times before, the one that had led to this path.</p><p>\u201cNo. The stakes are too great.\u201d She rose abruptly to her feet. \u201cForgive me. I\u2019ve delayed your sleep too long.\u201d</p><p>She stalked off to her own blanket without another word. I curled up in my own, more exhausted than I realized. Just before I fell asleep, I opened my eyes and caught sight of Alea. She sat on her blanket, staring at the fire, pain and indecision all over her.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>When the Hemlock group had first described \u201cpeacekeepers,\u201d the dryads had become the model in my mind. I figured we could expect to see more of the same type of obstacle: creatures or monsters that had to be overcome by magic or brute force. In some ways, the various arctic creatures we\u2019d encountered in the blight met this description. They preyed on those who weren\u2019t Varia\u2019s cronies. So, I was on the lookout for living foes, not inanimate ones, which made it that much more of a surprise when the road turned into a lake the next morning.</p><p>We had just crossed into a subjugated kingdom, but such crossings were growing fewer and fewer as we approached the heart of the Yew Land. Most of our travels were now strictly in the Yew Land. Our new companions had told us that we could expect to find a road branching off this one soon that would lead toward the capital. Volusian\u2019s rough directions matched this, so I was optimistic about finding it the next time we were back in the Yew kingdom.</p><p>Like many things in the Otherworld, the lake appeared out of nowhere. One moment we were trotting down the road, the next there was water as far as the eye could see. My horse shied and came to a halt, and I shared its unease. The water was unnaturally smooth and still, like a sheet of glass spread out before us. I couldn\u2019t see its end.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an optical illusion, right?\u201d I asked, gesturing vaguely forward. \u201cThe water can\u2019t go on forever. It\u2019s like when a kingdom seems to extend ahead, and two steps later, you walk into another one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes and no,\u201d said Dorian. \u201cThe water most certainly doesn\u2019t go on forever. What\u2019s wrong here is that the main roads of this world don\u2019t naturally have these kinds of obstacles and impediments. Think about how even in the blighted lands, the roads stayed semi-clear. That\u2019s their magic. They cross the Otherworld unbound. For this lake to be here, someone went to a lot of trouble to put it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Varia,\u201d guessed Rurik.</p><p>Orj nodded as he dismounted and walked to the water\u2019s edge with a sneer. \u201cThis is a peacekeeper. Most likely there\u2019s a word or charm that the residents here use to bypass this or make it clear up. The rest of us ... we either have to turn around or find a way through.\u201d</p> <p>Pagiel tilted his head. \u201cIs it really even that deep? Maybe we can just ford it with horses.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine spoke before I could. \u201cIt\u2019s deep. It gets deep really fast, actually ... but it doesn\u2019t go as far as it looks.\u201d She glanced at me. \u201cCan you feel it?\u201d</p><p>I opened up my magical senses and called to the water, trying to feel what she had. Sure enough, my illusion suspicion was correct. The water didn\u2019t extend \u201cforever,\u201d but it was very deep and still enough of a distance across that it would delay us.</p><p>\u201cToo much for me to move,\u201d added Jasmine.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I agreed quickly.</p> <p>Her eyebrows rose. \u201cNo way. You could wipe this whole thing out if you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said firmly, hoping she caught my tone. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine bit her lip and said no more. The truth was, I had a feeling I could have parted this water in classic Bible style. It would take a lot of power ... but I had it. The problem was, I didn\u2019t want to do it in front of the Hemlock people. Maybe they weren\u2019t our enemies, but there was only a handful of people who could work magic like that with water, and I wasn\u2019t ready to reveal my identity. We\u2019d even given false names.</p><p>Dorian had dismounted and was pacing around. To my surprise, he\u2019d stopped paying attention to the lake and was instead checking out the terrain we\u2019d just come through. The kingdom\u2014none of us were sure which one it was\u2014had a stony landscape, with a heavy, silt soil. Vegetation was sparse, and off in the distance, rocky foothills rose from the land and eventually gave way to far off mountains. Dorian seemed to be murmuring something to himself and then gave a satisfied nod. He turned to one of the Hemlock people, a young man who looked to be a little younger than Pagiel.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d said Dorian. \u201cYou have some sort of earth magic, correct?\u201d</p><p>The boy blinked in surprise. \u201cEr, yes. I\u2019m able to manipulate stones and rocks. I\u2014I sculpt them sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d said Dorian. \u201cYou may have to lower yourself to something a little less refined, but hopefully your skills will be adequate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d asked Kiyo. He made no attempt to hide the mistrust in his voice. Maybe he felt Dorian had a lot to offer on this quest, but Kiyo wasn\u2019t about to accept Dorian\u2019s decisions blindly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to build our own road,\u201d explained Dorian. \u201cMy young friend here and I\u2014what\u2019s your name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKellum,\u201d squeaked the boy.</p><p>\u201cKellum,\u201d repeated Dorian. \u201cRight. Kellum and I are going to use dirt and rocks to create a road across. Or, well, I\u2019ll use dirt and rocks. He\u2019ll assist with the rocks. There\u2019s plenty of raw material out here to work with.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNot to reach the bottom. It\u2019s too deep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll build it on the surface then,\u201d said Dorian. \u201cA floating bridge of sorts. Keeping the materials suspended there is well within my powers. Once everyone begins walking across it, however, it would be nice if, say, we could get a little support from the water.\u201d He looked meaningfully at Jasmine and me.</p><p>\u201cWe can do that,\u201d I said. Dorian and Kellum would suspend the earth and stones over the water, and Jasmine and I would control the water to keep the \u201cbridge\u201d from sinking. Between the four of us, it was doable, and it didn\u2019t give away the full extent of my power.</p> <p>Dorian conferred for a few minutes with Kellum, and then they set to their task. Despite how powerful he was, I hardly ever saw Dorian wield his magic. He rarely needed to since his subjects were well aware of its strength. When he went into battle, he stuck to his sword, and although his earth magic enhanced the copper blade, that was a very different act from what I was observing now. There was an art to what Dorian did. Just as my senses sang out to water and air, he could call to all the elements within the earth and make them obey him. I\u2019d once seen him use that power to rain destruction on enemies, and it had been terrifying. This act of creation, on the other hand, was mesmerizing.</p><p>The two of them summoned rocks and stones to lay across the water, effortlessly arranging the various sizes so that they fit together like a game of Tetris. Once a section of rock was laid across the water, Dorian would then call up the dirt. It floated up from the ground in chunks, almost like a storm cloud, and then spread itself neatly over the stone foundation in layers to create a smooth surface. Dorian and Kellum did this for about a half hour, and although Dorian did it with his usual smirk and quips, I could see the lines of tension on his face and sweat along his hairline. This was a huge feat of magic, much greater than I\u2019d realized when the plan was initially proposed.</p><p>At one point, Dorian told Kellum to stop and glanced at the rest of us. \u201cI need a volunteer to try it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see if it\u2019ll sink?\u201d asked Kiyo dryly.</p><p>Dorian smiled. \u201cTo see how far it\u2019s needed. My guess is that after walking on it a bit, there\u2019ll be a land shift and we won\u2019t need to build this out as far as we think.\u201d He gave Kiyo a once-over. \u201cYou\u2019d be an excellent volunteer, seeing as in a pinch, your fox form would be light enough to scurry out of there or be lifted with Pagiel\u2019s air power.\u201d Pagiel\u2019s expression told me there was a good possibility he\u2019d let Kiyo sink.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be a volunteer when someone suggests you,\u201d said Kiyo.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cStop being contrary and just do it, please? I\u2019ll be guiding the water, so you don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d</p><p>Alea seemed impatient with our delay. \u201cWhile you debate, I\u2019m going to send Spots ahead to scout.\u201d She crooned more nonsensical words to the bird and then set him free. He took off, powerful wings carrying him over the water. He flew in a straight line over Dorian\u2019s bridge, cleared it, and then soon vanished out of view.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d said Dorian. \u201cThat\u2019s where the land shifts. We\u2019re almost there already. Wait just a moment, volunteer.\u201d</p><p>Kiyo rolled his eyes. Dorian and Kellum resumed their bridge-building, stopping when they reached a point that was just past where Spots had disappeared. To our eyes, the bridge ended abruptly in the lake, but those on it would cross into the next kingdom before reaching the water.</p><p>Dorian admired his work and then nodded to Kiyo. \u201cWell, then, go ahead. Try it out.\u201d</p><p>Kiyo hesitated only a moment, as though trying to decide for sure if Dorian had done all of this as part of some elaborate ruse to drown him. Finally, deciding this was a necessary part of the mission, Kiyo set out and stepped onto the bridge. Jasmine and I both were connected to the water and were using our combined strength to make sure the bridge didn\u2019t sink. Between us and the earth wielders, the bridge didn\u2019t budge. Kiyo relaxed slightly and walked out the rest of the bridge\u2019s length. Just before he reached the water, he vanished. A couple seconds later, he reemerged.</p><p>\u201cIt worked,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course it did. No need to sound so astonished,\u201d chastised Dorian.</p><p>\u201cThe Yew Land\u2019s on the other side,\u201d said Kiyo. \u201cYou can\u2019t even see the water from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo there and wait for us,\u201d I said. Kiyo gave me an incredulous look. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do here! And we can\u2019t have extra weight on the bridge.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, he agreed and vanished once more. Slowly, single file, the others began to cross as well. I was a little nervous when the horses stepped out, but those of us who were working magic here were strong enough to keep everything steady. In fact, before long, the four of us were the only ones who remained since we were needed to maintain the bridge\u2019s integrity.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Dorian told Jasmine and Kellum. \u201cWe can hold it without you, enough to cross right after.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine looked reluctant to go, but Kellum didn\u2019t have to be told twice. He seemed nervous at being left alone with us. The two of them hurried over and disappeared into thin air, just as the others had done. Dorian held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cShall we, my dear?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s too narrow for that. We have to go single file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he said, with a small frown. \u201cOversight on my part. I\u2019ll have to work on that the next time I build an amazingly brilliant impromptu bridge to save us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>Ever the gentleman, he let me walk first. Our horses had already gone on ahead, so we didn\u2019t put much weight on the structure. Plus, he was right that our magic was more than enough to keep the bridge in its suspended state. Unfortunately, there wasn\u2019t much we could do when a huge green-and-red-scaled serpent emerged from the lake\u2019s surface and roared a challenge to us. Along with the tacky Christmas-color scheme, it had pointed gills radiating out from its body. Its mouth was full of sharp teeth and was more than big enough to swallow one of us whole.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked with dismay. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have gotten a break just once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d said Dorian, with no trace of his earlier levity. \u201cWe\u2019re nearly there.\u201d</p><p>It was true. We were over two-thirds of the way across. Still remembering to keep the water in check, I sprinted forward. I could see the bridge\u2019s end and knew I was about to reach the other side when the serpent roared again\u2014practically right behind me. I turned and was just in time to see it make a lunge for Dorian. He dodged the attempt and dropped to the ground. Unfortunately, doing so broke his concentration on keeping the bridge up. I had enough presence of mind to continue making the water reject the earth but only where we stood. Behind us, all that rock and dirt crumbled away into the water. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I held out my hand to Dorian. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Dorian started to rise, and then, with speed that seemed too great for its size, the serpent struck out again and knocked Dorian back to the ground. One of its pointed gills or fins or whatever it was called made contact with Dorian\u2019s forehead, and I saw blood appear. More pieces of the bridge started to fall, and I adamantly ordered the water not to accept them. Still, as I watched the serpent come back for another strike, I knew maintaining the bridge wouldn\u2019t be enough. I acted quickly, doing the first thing that came to mind.</p><p>I removed all the water around the serpent.</p> <p>One instant the water was there, the next it wasn\u2019t. Part of the water I simply pushed aside with magic, creating the Red Sea effect I\u2019d speculated about earlier. For the rest of it, I simply caused evaporation. It created a considerable amount of steam, but I could still clearly see the results. The serpent had nothing to swim in, and as Jasmine and I had noted, the lake ran deep. With said lake no longer there to support the serpent, the creature immediately dropped into the chasm created by the water\u2019s absence.</p><p>\u201cImpressive,\u201d Dorian managed as he staggered to his feet with my help. I wanted to check his head wound, but there was no time. I couldn\u2019t both hold the bridge and keep the water away for long.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just glad everyone else was gone so there were no witnesses to that,\u201d I remarked as we scurried across the last few feet of the disintegrating bridge. We were single file, but I still managed to keep hold of his hand nonetheless.</p><p>The land shifted, and suddenly, we were both on solid\u2014very solid\u2014ground. The tall evergreens of the Yew Land surrounded us, and the Otherworld\u2019s familiar road was beneath us. I laughed with relief. A smile started to break out over Dorian\u2019s face too, but then his expression shifted to one of horror. Spinning around, I looked for what he\u2019d seen.</p><p>Two dozen uniformed soldiers stood ahead of us on the road. Standing with them, tied up and restrained, were our friends. Notably not bound were those from the Hemlock Land. They stood off to the side, weapons drawn\u2014against us.</p> <p>One of the soldiers stepped forward and gave us an icy smile, along with a mock bow. \u201cQueen Eugenie, King Dorian. Allow me to introduce myself. I\u2019m Gallus, general of Her Majesty Queen Varia of the Yew Land\u2019s forces. We\u2019ve come to escort you to her.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>I was dumbfounded for only a moment until I pieced together what had happened.</p><p>I glared at Orj and his companions. \u201cThat\u2019ll teach me to give people the benefit of the doubt.\u201d</p><p>Gallus chuckled. \u201cIf it makes you feel better, you were identified as soon as you crossed into the Beech Land.\u201d So much for Dorian charming the Beech squadron\u2019s leader. \u201cEven if this lot hadn\u2019t helped us, we would have seized you through other means before you reached Withywele. They simply reported on your magic and descriptions to help us further verify who you are.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over at Alea, whose spotted falcon now rested on her shoulder again. I\u2019d paid little attention each time she sent him off ahead and only now thought about how he\u2019d never returned this last time when he was allegedly only scouting a short distance. It had been sloppy of me\u2014as was my confidence that not working any great feats of magic would protect my identity. If they already had us flagged because of our physical descriptions, any use of water or air\u2014even if it wasn\u2019t monumental\u2014would tip them off. I\u2019d also been so arrogantly concerned about my own prowess that I hadn\u2019t realized Dorian\u2019s remarkable bridge-building would also be telling.</p> <p>One of Gallus\u2019s men stepped forward holding silver chains laced with sporadic iron links. \u201cI know these won\u2019t truly restrain you,\u201d Gallus told me. \u201cBut I trust you\u2019ll be accommodating about them, in light of this ... situation.\u201d He nodded toward my captive friends, and I saw that aside from being tied up, Keeli and Danil also had copper blades at their throats. Binding gentry with even a little iron was usually enough to stunt their magic, but my human blood protected me. Even chained, I could call on my magic and summon a storm that would wipe out half this group. But I didn\u2019t know if I could do it before Keeli and Danil had their throats slit.</p><p>Accepting this momentary defeat, I nodded with a grimace and extended my arms. Dorian held his out as well. The iron would bind him, as it would the rest of my party\u2014even Jasmine. I was the only one capable of magic, but it would do no good until we reached our destination. No\u2014that wasn\u2019t entirely true, I realized moments later. Kiyo would be unaffected by the iron too. His only magic was shape-shifting, and the gentry aversion to iron wouldn\u2019t stop that. I wondered if Varia\u2019s people knew that. Still, like me, Kiyo risked getting someone killed if he acted. We would both have to bide our time.</p><p>The Yew soldiers confiscated our horses and weapons, forcing us prisoners to travel on foot. We walked along sullenly, and I knew that each one of us was trying to figure out an escape plan. The only bright side, I supposed, was that now we knew we were getting a direct ticket to Varia. One of the prevailing theories was that if the gifts were indeed in Withywele, they\u2019d be kept in Varia\u2019s own palace\u2014which was likely to be heavily guarded. Now, I thought bitterly, we didn\u2019t have to break in.</p><p>At one point in the trip, Alea passed near me. I glared up at her and Spots. \u201cYou guys make convincing refugees.\u201d Along with everything else, it irked me that I could have so misjudged them. Their appearances and frustration had seemed genuine.</p><p>\u201cWe are refugees,\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou have no idea the things our people have suffered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure about that.\u201d</p><p>She stared stonily ahead. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done here has bought us favor with Varia and will lift the blight from our land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t betrayed us, we could have worked together to lift the blight and keep your self-respect.\u201d</p> <p>With a scowl, she left me and rode on ahead.</p><p>Withywele was impressive when it came into sight. The Otherworld had few cities, and while they were hardly strewn with concrete or skyscrapers, there was still an urban feel to them. Stone and wood buildings were built closely together and had multiple floors, something rarely seen outside of castles. The cobblestone streets were busy with horses and people. Vendors were everywhere, hocking their goods. A few buildings were true works of art, with marble and fanciful architecture. Nobody paid much attention to us captives as we went by, though the crowds quickly made way for the guards to pass. Maybe prisoner transport was a common thing around here.</p><p>Varia\u2019s palace was one of the pretty buildings. It had rounded domes adorned with that white and green stone the Yew people seemed to like. Damarian jade, that was it. The palace spread out over extensive gardens, which were adorned with statues and fountains. As we passed them, I occasionally caught glimpses of name placards. One statue, of a sharp-faced woman with a beehive hairdo, was labeled Ganene the Great.</p><p>Ganene. The name was familiar, and I rifled through my memories to try and figure out where I\u2019d heard it. Soon, it came to me. When Volusian had first seen the ambassador\u2019s statues, I\u2019d mentioned they were from Varia. She must be Ganene\u2019s daughter, he\u2019d said.</p><p>Volusian!</p><p>Volusian might be my ace in the hole here. Of course, there was one slight problem. I couldn\u2019t summon him in this kingdom without the help of my wand, and the guards had taken that from me.</p><p>Inside the palace walls, our party dispersed. The Hemlock people were escorted to \u201cguest quarters\u201d to rest before making some appeal to Queen Varia. As they left, I saw Alea giving me one last look, which turned to a glare when she realized I\u2019d noticed her. I figured the rest of us would be taken to prison cells. What I didn\u2019t expect was that we\u2019d be taken to different ones. Dorian and I were led one way, the rest of our party another.</p><p>\u201cHey, wait,\u201d I protested, coming to a halt despite my escort\u2019s attempts to move me forward. \u201cWhere are you taking them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the dungeon, of course,\u201d said Gallus.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cThen ... where are you taking us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo confinement more suited to your stations,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe\u2019re not complete savages, you know. We want you to be comfortable so that you\u2019re in good shape when you surrender your lands to Her Majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d I said, \u201cis not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>Gallus shrugged and gestured toward those going to the dungeon. \u201cProtest all you want, but never forget we have them in our grasp. Step out of line, and they die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget us,\u201d growled Rurik. \u201cSummon a storm that\u2019ll blast this place to pieces. We\u2019d gladly die to see that bitch ripped apart.\u201d</p><p>One of the guards slammed the hilt of his sword into Rurik\u2019s head. \u201cDo not talk about Her Majesty that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe patient,\u201d I told Rurik. I didn\u2019t want him killed for any reason, certainly not through guard brutality. I spoke my words confidently, like I had a plan, and I hoped it would give him faith. I also hoped it would give me an idea or two.</p><p>Dorian and I were taken to the palace\u2019s third floor, to a forlorn-looking hallway. There, we split again and were led in opposite directions. Even if we were going to royal accommodations, I supposed they wouldn\u2019t want us too near each other, lest we carve holes in the wall to talk. He met my eyes before he was led away, giving me a fleeting smile. It gave me hope because I knew he would never stop planning a way out of this. It also inspired me to keep up my own courage and be a worthy match to his dedication.</p><p>But being separated from him made me feel terribly alone, especially when I saw my \u201croyal\u201d cell. If this was one of their nicer lodgings, I couldn\u2019t imagine what the rest of our friends were in. The cell was cramped, with dreary gray stone walls and a tiny, high window that barely let in light through its bars. A straw-filled mattress lay on one side of the room, while a few other \u201cniceties\u201d\u2014like water and a rickety wooden chair\u2014sat on the other.</p><p>\u201cMake yourself presentable,\u201d one of the guards told me, after he\u2019d undone the chains. He tossed my travel satchel, which had been stripped of weapons, to the floor. \u201cWe will come for you when the queen calls you into her exalted presence. And remember\u2014don\u2019t get any foolish ideas. We have magic users out here too who will sense if you act.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They shut the door, and I heard a heavy lock slide into place. I gave the door a good solid kick, mostly to ease my frustration. It didn\u2019t work. It was maddening because I was in full possession of my gentry magic and could do nothing with it so long as they held the others hostage. I stared at my satchel. At first, I had no intention of becoming \u201cpresentable.\u201d I had no desire to impress that bitch. After a little thought, though, I decided it was less about impressing her and more about presenting myself as more than a bedraggled prisoner. I was a queen of two lands, lands I\u2019d earned\u2014unlike her and her blackmail.</p><p>Not that I could do much preparation with such limited means. My recent bath had gone a long way to help, and the water in here let me clean up any smudges I\u2019d since acquired. I combed my hair into a semi-neat ponytail and changed into my last clean sweater, which was green with snowflakes on it. Honestly, did all sweaters have to contain holiday decorations? At least I still had all my jewelry, which gave me some air of regality.</p><p>Jewelry ...</p> <p>A strange, slightly crazy idea came to me. Quickly, I stripped off my rings, bracelets, and necklace and spread them out on the bed. I took an assessment of the jewels I had. Moonstone, amethyst, citrine, quartz, obsidian, and a few others. Worn as jewelry, their powers were passive, mostly offering protection and occasional clarity for focusing shamanic magic. I separated out the ones that could be manipulated into objects of power and put the remaining jewelry back on. Then began the arduous task of prying out the jewels I\u2019d set aside. Stripped of all truly useful tools, I had to rely on the hard plastic edges of my toothbrush and comb. Amazingly, I was able to make it work, but the process wasn\u2019t graceful.</p><p>Next, I went to the pathetic chair and attempted to break off one of the legs. The wood looked so old and rotten that I was certain I could do it with my bare hands. Nope. I couldn\u2019t. So, I gave it a few thwacks against the wall\u2014hoping no one outside overheard\u2014that successfully weakened the wood, allowing me to finally pull off a leg.</p><p>Returning to my bag, I found a long knee sock (a dirty one, unfortunately) and stuffed all the jewels inside it. I then wrapped the sock around the chair leg, knotting it so that the bundle stayed affixed to the wood without any of the jewels escaping. Satisfied, I stared at my creation.</p><p>I had just made the tackiest, most pathetic wand in history.</p><p>It would in no way match my confiscated one, but a lot of the principles remained the same. The wood would allow me to focus my magic through the jewels, drawing on their inherent properties. It would\u2019ve been better if the jewels had been properly charmed, but then, there were a lot of things about this wand that could be better.</p> <p>Casting a wary glance at the door, I stood and held the wand straight out. This magic was shamanic and human. It should be undetectable to the gentry outside. I spoke Volusian\u2019s summoning words and felt the magic falter as it went through the wand. Still, it was stronger than if I\u2019d summoned him unaided. Remembering the effort I\u2019d needed before, I channeled every bit of focus I could into the magic, trying to break through the land\u2019s enchantment blocking his bond to me.</p><p>Against all reason, just when I thought I\u2019d failed, Volusian appeared in the cell. He had that flickering appearance again but didn\u2019t look like he was going anywhere. The bond between us had been hard to summon, but I didn\u2019t feel it was going anywhere either. His red eyes took in the scene and then came to rest on my \u201cwand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mistress summoned me with ... that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy options were kind of limited,\u201d I said, sitting on the mattress.</p><p>\u201cI would feel insulted,\u201d he said, \u201csave that it\u2019s a greater slight to those who cursed me that their wards could be overcome so easily.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cWell, don\u2019t get too cocky because we\u2019re still in kind of a mess. Varia\u2019s people have us all prisoner here in her palace.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are still in possession of your magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I use it, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll kill off my friends before I can actually accomplish anything.\u201d</p><p>Volusian said nothing but gave me a look that clearly stated he didn\u2019t see what the problem was.</p><p>\u201cIs there any way you can free them?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat would take a lot of stress off me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me, mistress, it would remove a lot of stress if I freed you.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sure I can free myself. Well, maybe. I mean, I\u2019m not the one with a handicap here. The rest of them are bound and blocked off from their magic. I\u2019m not because Varia knows I won\u2019t risk their lives. Once they\u2019re out of trouble, though, I can start doing some serious damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat plan is ill-conceived and ill-advised, mistress. Fortunately for you, I am unable to comply. I can\u2019t stray vary far from you in this land.\u201d It was kind of what Dorian and I had talked about, how Volusian needed me and our bond to overcome the magic that would normally bar him from the Yew Land.</p><p>\u201cCan you go to Dorian?\u201d I asked. \u201cI think he\u2019s down the hall.\u201d</p> <p>Volusian tilted his head as though listening to something. \u201cYes. I can probably reach the Oak King. Do you want me to go now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not until I have a plan to\u2014\u201d</p><p>There was a click outside my door as the lock was undone. I hissed for Volusian to disappear as I shoved my half-ass wand into my satchel. I\u2019d placed the broken chair as far as it would go into a corner earlier and hoped no guards would notice it.</p><p>They didn\u2019t. Their concern was getting my chains back on. Maybe Varia didn\u2019t think I\u2019d do anything drastic with my friends\u2019 lives on the line, but that didn\u2019t mean I could walk around her palace free and unencumbered. My guards escorted me back to the main floor and then into what could only be called a throne room.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have a throne room. My predecessors might have, but I\u2019d ordered my people to strip down the rooms in my castles and make them utilitarian. When I had official visits, it was usually in cozy sitting rooms with little pretension. Dorian didn\u2019t technically have a throne room either, though he did have a raised throne sitting high in his dining hall, which he would sometimes sit in when he wanted to look impressive.</p><p>But this ... this was another story. The room was huge and could have doubled as a ballroom. Larger-than-life portraits of past monarchs lined the walls. The wide, smooth floor was made of more damarian jade, and pillars lined the room in a way that drew the eye toward the front. There Varia\u2019s throne sat, even higher than Dorian\u2019s dining room throne. The chair itself was fantastically huge, its back made of elaborate gold filigree and bedecked with gems. Despite the room\u2019s enormity, that throne was the only furniture in the entire place. It again made sure all attention went to the front\u2014and that those who came to see the queen were uncomfortable.</p><p>I had a feeling this room probably filled up regularly with petitioners and courtiers. Today, it was just me and my guards. Our footsteps echoed around the room as we approached the stairs leading up to the throne. I refused to be awed by the throne and instead studied the paintings on the walls. The names were meaningless until I saw Ganene again. Only, she wasn\u2019t alone in her portrait. An inscription read Queen Onya and Her Daughters, Ganene and Nissa. Queen Onya was a stern-looking figure with a giant crown, providing a contrast to the woman on her left. That one was young and delicate-looking, very beautiful with a nervous expression. The woman on Onya\u2019s right had a hard look to her and a very strong resemblance to the woman sitting before me.</p><p>That would be Varia. She was seated grandly on her throne, wearing a dress of ruby red velvet with a skirt far too big for practical movement. I suspected servants had spread it out and draped it over the throne in an artful way. She had brown eyes and brown hair arranged in another of those high hairstyles I kept seeing among Yew women. Her age was difficult to guess, but she was certainly older than me. Jewels adorned almost every free spot: fingers, wrists, neck, ears, and hair. It was a dazzling display that walked a very, very fine line between regal and gaudy. On her lap were two tiny, furry little dogs that looked suspiciously like the annoying yappy kind I despised.</p><p>\u201cKneel,\u201d one of the guards said. He started to shove me down, but Varia made a small, delicate motion with her hand, and he immediately stopped.</p><p>\u201cNo need for that,\u201d said Varia, stroking one of the dogs. She pitched her voice in a way that was well received by the room\u2019s acoustics, something she\u2019d probably practiced quite a bit. \u201cQueen Eugenie here is a fellow sovereign. We don\u2019t kneel to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we often take each other prisoner?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>She smiled sweetly. \u201cWell, now, that depends on whether or not we are staging coups into each other\u2019s lands. You can hardly expect me to take no action when you and your cohorts come with plans to assassinate me in some feeble attempt to end the Winter Enchantment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe call it the blight,\u201d I said. \u201c\u2018Winter Enchantment\u2019 sounds like some kind of ice-skating show.\u201d I didn\u2019t really expect her to catch the reference. What had seized my attention was her accusation that we\u2019d been coming to take her out personally. She didn\u2019t know about our actual plans. She didn\u2019t know about Volusian\u2019s help and the deductions we\u2019d made about the gifts she was holding.</p><p>\u201cIt makes no difference what you call it,\u201d she declared. \u201cAnd don\u2019t flatter yourself by thinking you\u2019re the first monarch who has tried to take matters into her own hands. The watchers I keep in my lands have descriptions of most of the kingdoms\u2019 royalty. That\u2019s the charming thing, you see. Monarchs who plan to surrender send emissaries. Monarchs with grand plans of rebellion come in person. Some delusion of personal greatness, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr,\u201d I said bitterly, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s because those monarchs care about their people and are willing to risk themselves.\u201d I was guessing Varia and her dogs rarely dirtied their hands.</p><p>Varia shrugged. \u201cPerhaps. Whatever the reason, it\u2019s foolish. Far smarter to join my united kingdoms. I was quite disappointed when I heard reports that you and King Dorian had entered my lands with your nefarious plots. You\u2019re both quite conspicuous, you know. I\u2019d hoped you two\u2014particularly you\u2014would come to your senses and join me. Especially after the kind offer my ambassador made you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTo run away from my problems and hide out here?\u201d I scoffed. \u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I hear, that\u2019s exactly what you did do, however. You just picked a different venue and were probably on guard the entire time.\u201d She gestured around her. \u201cHad you been here, you could have relaxed and enjoyed the final months of your pregnancy. Perhaps if you hadn\u2019t been so stressed and afraid, your children wouldn\u2019t have been born early and in danger.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened, not liking the implication that my actions were responsible for the twins\u2019 risky delivery. \u201cThat\u2019s not why they came early. It just happens with twins sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you say. I\u2019m a mother too, so I can relate to these niceties we try to convince ourselves of. And as a mother, I was quite sincere in my invitation to protect you. I think it\u2019s appalling what the Willow Queen and others tried to do to you. Appalling and cowardly. I would\u2019ve helped you on principle alone. That, and I have so wanted a friend I can talk to and be on equal terms with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIlania mentioned that too,\u201d I said, not really buying it. \u201cSome kind of female-solidarity thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to someone, don\u2019t I? Aside from my little darlings here.\u201d She paused to scratch the dogs\u2019 chins. Both had jeweled collars and little bows on their heads. \u201cAnd men have proved far too disappointing. I gave up on them years ago, except for the necessary pleasures, of course. Mostly, they bore or irritate me. I would greatly welcome smart female companionship. It\u2019s lonely having all this power.\u201d There was a wistful, melodramatic way to her delivery of that last line that made me want to punch her.</p><p>\u201cSorry if I don\u2019t feel bad for you. It\u2019s hard for me to muster a lot of empathy for someone who\u2019s been responsible for so much innocent death and destruction.\u201d</p><p>Varia laughed merrily. \u201cInnocent? There are few who can really claim that. And what would you think if I told you that I can focus the Winter Enchantment more harshly on specific kingdoms? You find me cruel, but the enchantment as it currently stands still allows life to go on in your kingdoms.\u201d The laughter died, and she leaned slightly forward. \u201cI have the means to focus the spell and increase its intensity. If you liked, I could focus on the Willow Land and completely destroy it.\u201d</p> <p>I gaped. \u201cYou\u2019d completely destroy a kingdom full of innocent people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncluding Queen Maiwenn,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cThat would be terribly convenient for you. And a nice bit of revenge after all she\u2019s done to you\u2014she certainly hasn\u2019t balked at hurting innocents. Why not return the favor?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t have a great opinion of the person who\u2019d created the blight, but this conversation was making her credibility deteriorate even more rapidly.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s revenge ... and then there\u2019s madness and cruelty,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I would never kill off her entire kingdom for what she\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy to say with your children alive and well. Still, I hope it emphasizes what a great friend I could be to you. Believe me, I really do prefer it that way. This situation only has a couple of possible outcomes for you, and you willingly signing on as my ally would be preferable to all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure,\u201d I said, not bothering to hide my sarcasm. \u201cAnd all you\u2019d ask in return for these friendly feats of destruction is us being pals and having a little girl time now and then.\u201d</p> <p>Varia\u2019s lips quirked. \u201cWell, as an important ally, I have no doubt you\u2019d want to help me out now and then.\u201d</p><p>Gentry wheeling and dealing. At least it was familiar territory.</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d I said. \u201cLet me guess. You want to help lead my son\u2019s armies when we conquer the human world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman world?\u201d She shook her head in amazement and looked as though she was ready to burst into laughter again. She lifted one of the dogs and peered into its face. \u201cDid you hear that, Lady Snowington? How silly.\u201d She returned the dog to her lap and looked back at me. \u201cWhy on earth would I care about humans when there\u2019s plenty to entertain me here in this world? This is the world I want. The problem is, it\u2019s such a nuisance keeping my subject kingdoms in line. Even though they surrender and allow my forces within their borders, I\u2019m constantly having to reassert my power with dramatic shows of force. It\u2019s very tiring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow terrible for you.\u201d</p><p>She continued, either not noticing or no longer caring about my sarcasm. \u201cThat\u2019s the nature of the game, however ... unless I had a more permanent way to bond to all of these lands, one that would give me unbreakable authority without the constant maintenance.\u201d</p><p>I gave a harsh laugh. \u201cSounds pretty easy then. Just kill off all the monarchs and take the lands\u2019 bonds and\u2014\u201d My smile faded, as a terrible, sinking realization hit me. \u201cThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s why you want to be my \u2018friend.\u2019 You want the Iron Crown.\u201d</p><p>Varia didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cIt makes things so much simpler.\u201d</p> <p>What made the Iron Crown so deadly was that it broke the bond between a monarch and his or her land. As I was constantly reminded, that bond ran deep. It was tied into my life and being, and short of death or a monarch inexplicably losing power, there was no way to end that bond or pass it on. If there had been, I likely would\u2019ve given the Thorn Land away when I first won it. Then, the discovery of the Iron Crown had changed everything. With the Iron Crown, I\u2019d ripped away Katrice\u2019s connection to the Rowan Land. Left unclaimed, the land had then been ripe for me to bond with it and take control.</p><p>My earlier joke had been right to a certain extent: Varia could just kill off all those monarchs. But that wasn\u2019t easy, seeing as monarchs, by their nature, were usually among the most powerful magic users in their kingdoms. It would make for long, taxing battles, and no matter how badass Varia wanted to seem, I knew she wasn\u2019t all-powerful. Magic for magic, whatever hers was, I doubted she was stronger than me. What made her remarkable was that she had a league of magic users to work with, creating the kind of power that had led to the blight. Organizing a group for a passive enchantment was one thing. Getting them all together to go hunt down monarchs in outside kingdoms was an entirely different matter.</p><p>\u201cNo. There is nothing you can do that would get me to give you the Iron Crown\u2014not that I could if I wanted to,\u201d I added. \u201cIt can only be used by the person who won it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I hear,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that\u2019s fine. I\u2019d only need you to shatter the bonds. I\u2019d take care of the rest.\u201d</p><p>I thought about all the kingdoms near me and the many I\u2019d heard about under her control. \u201cYou can\u2019t bond with that many. It\u2019s not possible. No one\u2019s that strong, not even you. Two is taxing enough.\u201d</p><p>Varia looked at me like I was crazy, which was saying something. \u201cWell, of course I wouldn\u2019t bond them all! That\u2019s absurd. I\u2019d simply make sure they were claimed by those I could trust. My daughters, for example, would make excellent queens. If you stayed on my good side\u2014and I must admit, you aren\u2019t endearing yourself very much right now\u2014I might give you a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I repeated. \u201cI\u2019m not using it on your behalf. I\u2019m never using it again, and I\u2019m not telling you where it\u2019s at. You want it? Kill me off so it\u2019ll return to its resting place. Then you can go get it and do whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly practical, and you know it.\u201d The Iron Crown\u2019s resting place was in a land packed with so much iron that most gentry couldn\u2019t set foot in it.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, we\u2019re at an impasse,\u201d I said triumphantly. \u201cI have something you want, and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m giving it to you. End of story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, child,\u201d she said, shaking her head with mock sympathy. \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re mistaken. Really, you have nothing at all\u2014and I have everything.\u201d She paused for dramatic effect. \u201cLike your friends in my dungeon.\u201d</p><p>I went perfectly still. \u201cWhat are you saying? That you\u2019ll kill them if I don\u2019t use the crown for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly an option. The fact that you have yet to attempt any magic to fight me has already given away how much they mean to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, my heart sinking. \u201cBut they would all willingly die to prevent the enslavement of countless other kingdoms or abuse of the Iron Crown.\u201d I knew the words were true as I said them, but they still hurt. I\u2019d held back on using magic, not just because my friends\u2019 lives were on the line, but also because I didn\u2019t have an entirely clear plan on what to do with my magic. But something like this? Varia\u2019s world domination? No question. None of my companions would be able to live with themselves knowing the scope of what their freedom had cost others.</p><p>\u201cAt some point, you have to decide what number of lives tips the scale. So, you\u2019re saying these, what, six or seven individuals aren\u2019t worth the crown\u2019s cost? What about your kingdom? Kingdoms? What I offered to do to the Willow Land\u2014by focusing the enchantment\u2014can be done to yours instead.\u201d Her smile grew particularly cunning. \u201cOr maybe it\u2019s less about quantity than quality. Your children are out there somewhere. Do you think they can stay hidden forever? Even in the human world, I can find them. I have many subjects, and you and your sister aren\u2019t the only ones who can pass through with ease.\u201d</p><p>The room threatened to spin around me, and I had to focus myself to stay calm and not give away how hard her words had hit. \u201cAre you really so heartless?\u201d I demanded. \u201cListen to yourself! You\u2019re threatening to wipe out two entire kingdoms and hunt down my children!\u201d Seeing her smirk, I had to restrain from clenching my fists. \u201cDo you enjoy this? Do you get some kind of sick thrill from these kinds of psycho threats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she told me, still smiling and petting the dogs. \u201cI simply take satisfaction out of pointing out the obvious, and it\u2019s exactly as I already said: you hold nothing here, and I hold everything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 20</p><p>Then, much as though I were a naughty child, Varia told me she was sending me back to my cell to \u201cthink about what I had to do.\u201d Before I left, she added, \u201cAnd lest you think me too lenient, let me emphasize to you that I\u2019m most anxious to have this friendship of ours settled. I don\u2019t like loose ends. Besides, some of these kingdoms are becoming an absolute nuisance. Much tidier for all of us if we can take care of this soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted,\u201d I muttered as the guards grabbed my arms to lead me away.</p> <p>\u201cAnd so,\u201d she continued, \u201cwhen I say I\u2019m going to emphasize the point to you, I mean that I will soon start taking action to encourage you to do the right thing. Starting with the elimination of your lesser companions. Then moving on to your kingdoms. Then your children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friends haven\u2019t done anything to you,\u201d I said, panic seizing me over how quickly the threat had escalated. \u201cThey\u2019re potential subjects.\u201d</p><p>Varia shrugged. \u201cI have plenty of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I at least talk to them?\u201d I asked. \u201cMake sure they\u2019re okay so I know you haven\u2019t killed them already?\u201d</p><p>She gave me a tight, knowing smile. \u201cMy dear, how foolish do you think I am?\u201d</p> <p>And with that, I was led out of the throne room. At the door, we ran into a slight traffic jam. A number of petitioners were lined up to see Varia, but a sentry held them all back and explained why they couldn\u2019t be allowed entrance.</p><p>\u201cHer Majesty has a meeting with the Oak King,\u201d the guard said. \u201cThat takes priority. She will see no one else until after that\u2014and that\u2019s if she feels up for it. She\u2019s had a very taxing day, so you may have to wait until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The Oak King. I would\u2019ve killed to be a fly on the wall for that audience and wondered if Dorian would opt for charm or mockery. Sometimes with him, there was a fine line between the two. I was also skeptical of just how \u201ctaxing\u201d Varia\u2019s day had been. Considering the impracticality of that dress, it didn\u2019t seem like she could even walk without assistance. I really wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to learn she and her dogs were carried around in a sedan chair.</p><p>Among the disgruntled petitioners were my \u201cpals\u201d from the Hemlock Land. They appeared as though they too had done a bit of hasty cleanup but otherwise possessed the same worn appearance they\u2019d had on the road. Orj\u2019s face hardened at the sentry\u2019s words but nonetheless managed stiff politeness.</p><p>\u201cWe were told that if we assisted Her Majesty in her task ...\u201d His eyes flicked nervously to me and then back to the guard. \u201cWe were told she\u2019d release our king and allow him to return to our land. We did all she asked.\u201d</p><p>The guard looked unconcerned. \u201cThen you\u2019ll get him tomorrow. Or the next day.\u201d</p> <p>Alea stepped up beside Orj. \u201cBut he\u2019s been imprisoned for two months! He and the land are both suffering from being apart. What good is it being freed of the curse if our land is simply going to die off this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it makes no difference then,\u201d said the guard, \u201cI\u2019m sure Her Majesty would be happy to return the Winter Enchantment to you.\u201d</p><p>I heard no more because my guards finally managed to push me through the bottleneck. I was taken without incident to my cell, but as the guards unlocked it, I glanced at the other closed doors in the hallway. I knew Dorian was there somewhere. Was the Hemlock King as well? These were the \u201cnicer\u201d chambers, after all. How many monarchs were imprisoned around me? It may have been egotistical presuming all these guards and magic users were just for me. Varia couldn\u2019t maintain her subjugated kingdoms without the monarchs occasionally bonding with the land, but keeping them apart for great lengths of time certainly created a new element of vulnerability that she could manipulate. She also now had a hostage system that probably worked well to keep the conquered kingdoms in line. Most gentry loved their rulers with fierce devotion and, as Orj had shown, would go to considerable lengths for them.</p><p>As soon as I was locked up and alone again, I summoned Volusian with the makeshift wand.</p><p>\u201cAre there other monarchs locked up in this corridor?\u201d I demanded. \u201cAside from me and Dorian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other shining ones here, yes,\u201d Volusian said. \u201cOnes I can sense considerable power from, though they are forced to wear their iron, even when locked up. They apparently don\u2019t have the luxuries you do.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and sat down on the cot. \u201cI might as well be in iron for all the good I can do! That bitch was right. She has everything, and I have nothing. And now she\u2019s threatening to destroy my friends, my kingdoms, Isaac and Ivy... .\u201d</p><p>My heart lurched at that last one. I valued my own life, certainly, but I never went into any of these crazy Otherworldly missions without the understanding that I might not come back. It was something I\u2019d had to come to terms with a long time ago. I didn\u2019t relish the thought of my traveling companions dying\u2014especially Jasmine and Pagiel\u2014but I knew they too had accepted certain dangers.</p> <p>The twins? They were a different matter. They were innocents. They had nothing to do with any of this, and just thinking about Varia hurting them filled me with a mix of rage and fear. With the prophecy taking backseat to the blight, I\u2019d thought Isaac and Ivy were out of danger, but it seemed, once again, someone wanted to use them against me.</p><p>\u201cThere are guards and magic users out there,\u201d I murmured, thinking aloud. \u201cObviously enough to subdue an escape\u2014or so Varia thinks. But she can\u2019t be thinking past a single person trying to break out. What about all of us? If we managed to free the other monarchs here, we\u2019d have a force of some of the most powerful gentry in this world. The guards here couldn\u2019t stand against that. This palace couldn\u2019t stand against that. Plus, there\u2019d be such a commotion that my friends in the dungeon would probably be low priority.\u201d</p><p>I thought I detected an eager glint in Volusian\u2019s eyes, though his face otherwise remained typically smooth. \u201cAs much as I would love nothing more than to start laying waste to this place, I must point out that if my mistress truly wishes to lift the blight, you should probably first make sure you know where the talismans are. Your conquest of Varia will be more effective if you can strip her of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. Except, we have no way of finding out. I mean, they\u2019re probably in this palace, but it\u2019s huge! Damn. I wish you could wander freely. We need someone to scope out this facility.\u201d My breath caught as an idea came to me. I straightened up. \u201cVolusian! Go to Dorian\u2019s cell right now. You have to give him this message... .\u201d</p><p>I quickly relayed it, and Volusian vanished. I bit my lip the entire time he was gone, praying Dorian hadn\u2019t been taken to Varia yet. Why hadn\u2019t I thought of this sooner? If I\u2019d missed my chance, I didn\u2019t know what we would do. I just hoped Varia had to take a bonbon break or have her dogs\u2019 hair restyled between sessions. Even if Volusian did make it in time, this idea was still pretty shaky.</p><p>I jumped up when Volusian reappeared. \u201cWas he still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, mistress. I relayed your message. The Oak King said he would try what you asked and idiotically asked what he wouldn\u2019t do for you.\u201d A distinct look of distaste crossed his features. \u201cHe also said to tell you ... that he isn\u2019t surprised at all that you\u2019re planning a way out. He says he has never once doubted you and has the utmost faith in whatever you do.\u201d</p><p>I almost smiled. \u201cBoy, relaying something that sentimental was pretty terrible for you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Volusian didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>The truth was, Dorian\u2019s warm words had unsettled me too\u2014but probably for very different reasons from Volusian. Still wanting to conserve the power it took to keep him within the Yew Land, I sent Volusian away and then stretched out on my cot to wait. I didn\u2019t know how long it would take to get results from my plan\u2014if I\u2019d even get them. I was also worried about Varia acting on her threats to start killing off my companions in the dungeon. I could only hope that like any good super villain, she\u2019d give me fair warning and try to kill them in front of me in order to force my hand. That wasn\u2019t a fate I wanted, but at least I could be reasonably confident they weren\u2019t dead already.</p><p>Hours passed. The guards brought me a meager meal, again making me wonder what those in lesser accommodations had. I didn\u2019t think Varia had reason to poison me, but I still summoned Volusian briefly to see if he detected anything magical about the food. He didn\u2019t, so I took the risk of eating in order to keep my strength up.</p><p>I was just finishing the food up when something caught my eye in the tiny window near the ceiling. Spots, Alea\u2019s falcon, had just landed. With a bit of maneuvering, he worked his way through the bars so that he could look down at me but otherwise didn\u2019t leave the sill.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be damned,\u201d I breathed. \u201cYou actually made it.\u201d</p><p>My gamble had been that the Hemlock people would still be hanging around the throne room, hoping for an audience with Varia. In the message I\u2019d sent with Volusian, I\u2019d told Dorian to see if he could manage any private words with Alea when he went to see the queen. There were guards everywhere, but if ever there was someone who could cause distraction and misdirection, it was Dorian. If he pulled it off, I\u2019d asked that he tell Alea to send her falcon to me. The only directions I had were to look for a small window on the third floor, but I figured Spots could fly from window to window in search of me\u2014provided there were no enchantments on the windows. The entire plan had been tenuous, and yet, here I was, with a semi-intelligent falcon watching me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cSo, um, thanks for coming,\u201d I said to Spots. He blinked and said nothing, not that I really could have expected otherwise. \u201cAnyway. I know you have some connection to Alea. I don\u2019t know if you relay messages through bird language or if she sees through your eyes, but I need you to convey something to her. Can you do that? Is there some sign you can give me?\u201d</p><p>If staring without a sound was the way birds said, \u201cYes,\u201d then Spots gave me a resoundingly affirmative answer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I was starting to feel stupid. \u201cI\u2019ll just talk and hope this gets to her. Tell Alea that I have the means to free her king. I also know how to break Varia\u2019s hold on all of us, but I need help. I know Alea and her people are willing to give in to Varia to keep their land safe, but if they work with me, I really believe we can overpower Varia and be free of her tyranny. Here\u2019s the thing. Somewhere in this palace, there is a very heavily guarded room. I mean, there\u2019s probably a bunch of rooms like that. The dungeons, Varia\u2019s bedroom, her dogs\u2019 kennel, whatever. But I feel like this is going to be really guarded. I don\u2019t expect Alea to get anywhere near it, since I\u2019m guessing subjects\u2019 access only goes so far. That\u2019s the thing. Alea probably won\u2019t even see the masses of guards because this room is going to have a huge perimeter around it. That\u2019s probably one clue. The other is that it won\u2019t be obvious why it\u2019s so guarded. Dungeons make sense. This won\u2019t. So, if there\u2019s any way she can figure out where this is at and let me know, that would be huge.\u201d</p><p>I paused then, wondering about that last part. I was banking on the bird magically communicating my words to Alea. How hers would get back to me was less obvious. Well. That was a problem for later, and we had plenty of others before we reached that point.</p><p>\u201cHaving some idea of that place\u2019s location will make a big difference when I bust out her king. And I will, by the way. Him and all the other captive monarchs. So, if she knows any other disgruntled emissaries from other lands, tell them to be ready for a huge coup in the next day or so.\u201d Until that moment, I hadn\u2019t realized I was truly going to stage one ... but, well, why else had I come here? \u201cBut again, the key is figuring out this stronghold of Varia\u2019s. We can still stage a nasty rebellion, but the threat of the blight isn\u2019t going to go away until we get to what she\u2019s hiding.\u201d</p> <p>Spots groomed his foot. I wasn\u2019t sure if he was simply listening and multitasking or had grown bored.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell her that?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, I thought nothing would happen, and then Spots made some kind of chirping noise. He worked his way back out through the bars and flew off.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I remarked. \u201cNot the weirdest thing I\u2019ve ever done by far ... but it\u2019s up there.\u201d I then realized I was talking to myself and wondered if that was better or worse than speaking to a bird.</p><p>It was hard for me to sit still and wait. My nature usually required that I do something; it was why I\u2019d had such a difficult time in Alabama. At least while there, I\u2019d known my patience would pay off for the twins\u2019 safety. Here, I was constantly pressed with the knowledge that every day meant more of Varia\u2019s reign, more suffering in the blight, and more dangers for my friends.</p> <p>As evening fell and my cell darkened, I summoned Volusian back. Maybe it was a trick of the lighting, but his appearance seemed more substantial now. \u201cYou can move around this hallway. I want you to go and talk to each of the monarchs and give them a heads-up on what\u2019s going on. Tell them there may be a commotion soon and that we\u2019ll be freeing them from their chains to go take on Varia and the blight once and for all. Let them know I\u2019ll have more details when the time comes.\u201d God, I hoped that was actually true. \u201cGive them my description so they know I\u2019m the one with instructions. And Dorian. Give them his description too. In fact, go to Dorian first and catch him up on everything. He may not know about our fellow cellmates. And tell him I talked to the bird.\u201d</p><p>Volusian gave me a long-suffering look. \u201cThis may be a new low for me, mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s necessary for the bigger plan. Besides, I figured you\u2019d be all about getting closer to our endgame with Varia. I thought you wanted to prove something to these Yew people.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cMistress, you have no idea just how much I want that.\u201d</p><p>He vanished, and I was left alone again. I didn\u2019t know how many monarchs were in the hall exactly, but it took a while for Volusian to make the rounds to them and Dorian. I had actually dozed off when my minion returned. Waking up to those red eyes in a dark room is not a fate I\u2019d wish on anyone, not that I let him know how much it freaked me out.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I asked. \u201cHow\u2019d it go? Did you talk to everyone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many others are there besides Dorian and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are five.\u201d</p><p>Five. Somehow, I\u2019d been hoping for a dozen or so. Still, five gentry with magic on par with Dorian and me were nothing to scoff at. We could do some serious damage to this place. \u201cDid they say they\u2019ll help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree were quite zealous. I believe they would have attempted an escape right then, with or without a plan. The other two have been here a considerable time. Their spirits are broken. They were listless in responses, seeming to have little hope that we could actually accomplish anything.\u201d</p><p>An uneasy thought occurred to me. \u201cThey aren\u2019t so desperate that they\u2019ll report on me in some attempt to buy favor, are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not believe so, mistress. I believe they have simply given up altogether. Should the opportunity for revenge and escape arise, it\u2019s possible they may regain their momentum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope so,\u201d I muttered. We\u2019d gone from five to three allies. I still thought those were good odds, but I preferred \u201coverwhelming\u201d to \u201cgood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlso,\u201d added Volusian, with what I was certain was a note of displeasure, \u201cI have a message from the Oak King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says that in addition to finding the talismans\u2019 location, you should also consider that they will have some sort of magical protection on them. Finding them and defeating their guards may not be enough if there is a shield or enchantment in place that you don\u2019t know how to defeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent point\u2014not that I should expect less from Dorian. Do you think that\u2019s likely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost certainly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo spell\u2019s permanent, of course. Someone powerful enough could blast through it\u2014or several someones. And that\u2019s the thing. She probably had multiple people helping set up these defenses, just like with the blight. This thing\u2019s going to be a bitch to crack.\u201d</p><p>Volusian considered. \u201cYes, but there is probably a trick or simpler way of undoing any protective magic around the gifts. No one wants to be locked out of their own spell, and she must get through her defenses occasionally to move new objects in.\u201d</p><p>My head was hurting from all the growing complications. \u201cSo, there\u2019s something else we have to figure out. Unless we can just make it work with brute magical force.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is still an option,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cThanks. You can go.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and stretched back out on the bed, trying to figure out how I was going to stage a master escape plan when my allies consisted of a bunch of restrained prisoners, a spirit confined to a hallway, and a bird that may or may not understand me. Glancing over, I saw that Volusian was still standing there and watching me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs there something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Oak King had another message for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? What was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said ...\u201d I again got that vibe of distaste from Volusian. \u201cHe said to tell you he misses you and takes comfort in knowing your room is close to his\u2014though it\u2019s still not nearly close enough. He says he will lie in bed tonight and imagine the distance between you is gone and that you are there with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God ,\u201d I said, nearly bursting out laughing. \u201cI thought it was bad for you before.\u201d</p><p>Volusian made no response. I tried to adopt some seriousness but knew I was grinning.</p><p>\u201cTell him that\u2019s very sweet but awfully presumptuous, in light of our history.\u201d</p><p>Volusian disappeared and returned about a minute later. \u201cThe Oak King says that in light of the current situation, he imagines you might be more open to such suggestions. He said\u2014and I quote\u2014\u2018Daring escapes do wonders for passion. What would ordinarily be deemed presumptuous might actually seem quite reasonable in troubled times. Perhaps the blight wouldn\u2019t have been so cold, had we come to that conclusion sooner.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I scoffed. \u201cWell, tell him that remains to be seen, seeing as we haven\u2019t pulled off any daring escape yet.\u201d</p><p>Volusian hesitated. \u201cMistress, I have never asked anything of you in my servitude. But now, I beg you this: do not make me keep passing these adolescent sentiments back and forth all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d I said, feeling a smile start to return. \u201cGo ahead and tell Dorian that too. This is the last note you pass tonight. I need some sleep, and it takes too much power to keep you here.\u201d</p><p>Volusian didn\u2019t thank me\u2014that would be asking too much\u2014but he did look relieved. He vanished into the darkness and didn\u2019t come back that night.</p><p>I tried to sleep in earnest, knowing I\u2019d need my strength for whatever wacky mishaps were to come. That\u2019s easier said than done in enemy hands\u2014especially for an insomniac like me\u2014and I tossed and turned a fair amount. Sleep did finally come after a couple of hours, mercifully free of dreams. I didn\u2019t wake until something pulled at my hair. At first, I shrugged it off in my sleepy state. Then, it happened again, a tug so painful I yelped and opened my eyes.</p><p>And found Spots the falcon staring at me, about two inches from my face.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d I jumped up, certain my eyes were about to be pecked out. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you just squawk from the window? Or tap the wall with your beak?\u201d</p><p>Spots made no reply, save to preen his wing.</p><p>\u201cI assume you\u2019re here for a reason,\u201d I said. \u201cBut you probably can\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>He looked back up at me and extended a leg. Peering closely, I saw a teeny-tiny roll of paper tied there. Carefully, unsure if he\u2019d decide to gouge me with his claws, I removed the miniature scroll from his leg. The paper was very fine and delicate, and I was half afraid it would tear before I could unroll it. When I finally got a good look at it, I could see a handful of words scrawled in tiny writing: </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>ROOM IS UNDERGROUND. SCOUT IS INVESTIGATING.</p><p>Cryptic but promising overall, I decided. I was about to give the bird a return message when I suddenly heard the lock being opened on my door.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here!\u201d I told Spots. \u201cCome back ... er, later.\u201d</p> <p>He was already up in the window before I could finish talking and wiggled his way out through the bars just as some guards entered. Their faces were grim. One jerked my hands forward while another bound them with chains.</p><p>\u201cHer Majesty wants you. Now.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, I thought the time I\u2019d been dreading had come. Varia was going to give me some terrible ultimatum. Yet, something about her and her flair for the dramatic told me there would have been a lot of setup and fanfare. This had a hurried feel. An urgency, like something was wrong.</p><p>The feeling further intensified when I wasn\u2019t marched to the throne room. Instead, I was taken to Varia\u2019s own chambers, shoved roughly inside a posh sitting room done entirely in periwinkle velvet. Varia was there, lounging on a divan, looking as though she\u2019d gotten out of bed in the last hour. She wore a robe that matched the room, as well as some furry slippers. Her brown hair was worn down but didn\u2019t look like it had been brushed. She stayed in that reclined position, as though trying to present an unconcerned air, but the anger in her voice betrayed her when she saw me.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d she demanded. The dogs were at her feet and began yipping. She silenced them with some treats.</p> <p>I glanced around, looking for some kind of assistance or context for her question. \u201cUm, where are what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe people you traveled here with.\u201d She sat up and fixed me with a glare so icy that it was easy to see her as the blight\u2019s creator. \u201cWhere are they, and how in the world did you break them out?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>I said the first thing that came to mind.</p><p>\u201cSooo ... you lost them?\u201d</p><p>Varia glared, not nearly as serene and commanding as she\u2019d been yesterday. \u201cThis is not a game! Tell me how you accomplished it. You are still in possession of your powers. How did you escape and set them free?\u201d</p> <p>I put my hands on my hips. \u201cI may still have my powers, but I\u2019m also being kept in a locked room surrounded by guards and magic users! The kind of magic I\u2019d need to escape would involve me blowing out the door, and I think someone would\u2019ve probably noticed that. Besides, why the hell would I then go back to my cell? I would\u2019ve walked out with my friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d said Varia. \u201cNo one can escape those dungeons. They must have had assistance.\u201d The dogs started their racket again. More treats.</p><p>I shrugged and tried not to look too smug. \u201cMy friends are pretty resourceful. Maybe your security\u2019s not as good as you think.\u201d</p><p>Inside, I was jubilant. Jasmine and the others had gotten away! At a basic level, I was simply happy they were safe. In the greater scheme of things, it also meant my hands were no longer tied. I could summon a storm right now and have no fears of retribution. Of course, that would be pre-emptive since the rest of my plan wasn\u2019t yet fully developed. The more I studied Varia, though, the more it became obvious I wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d reached this conclusion about my new freedom.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so arrogant if I were you,\u201d she said. \u201cAs I said before, I hold a lot more game pieces than you do and control a lot that\u2019s dear to you.\u201d</p><p>I kept my face neutral, but inside, my heart was racing. I remembered her previous lists of threats. Right now, my friends were off the table, and I sincerely doubted she\u2019d found Isaac and Ivy. What did that leave? My kingdoms. She was pissed off enough about the escape to do something drastic, and nightmare scenarios ran through my mind. What if she blasted one kingdom to show me she was serious about the other? There was a staggering amount of innocent lives in my hands, and if she did attempt to hurt them, I really would blow her apart now, storm or no storm.</p><p>Varia smiled cruelly. \u201cSoon you\u2019ll see just how much I control when\u2014oh, for the gods\u2019 sake! Get them out of here!\u201d</p><p>Her moment of drama had been derailed when those wretched little dogs began barking again. A servant quickly scooped them up and scurried out of the room. She swore when one of them bit her.</p> <p>\u201cNow then.\u201d Varia nodded toward a guard. \u201cBring him in.\u201d</p><p>The guard gave a curt salute and hurried out the door. He returned a moment later with a prisoner\u2014Dorian.</p><p>Apparently, I wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d gotten an early wake-up call. Dorian looked a little worn around the edges but otherwise showed no signs of injury or distress. Indeed, he wore his typically indolent look, as though he\u2019d wanted to come here in chains and Varia had been kind enough to oblige him. His eyes flicked briefly to me before focusing on Varia. He gave her one of his charming smiles.</p><p>\u201cYour Majesty. How nice of you to call me to breakfast. And I must say, you look very fetching this morning. I\u2019m always saying women don\u2019t go to enough trouble to match their d\u00e9cor. I also always say that brushes are overrated. Right, Eugenie?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer, mostly because I was too preoccupied with what Varia\u2019s next move was going to be. I didn\u2019t think Dorian\u2019s presence here was a good sign. She studied him for several long moments and then turned her attention back to me.</p><p>\u201cI should not have given you the night to think things over,\u201d she said crisply. \u201cThat was an indulgence on my part, one I won\u2019t repeat. I want your fealty. I want the Iron Crown. If I don\u2019t get them, I will execute the Oak King as part of my dinner entertainment later.\u201d</p><p>I laughed in spite of myself. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill him. You need him. You want him to sign his kingdom over to you.\u201d I didn\u2019t know the exact details of yesterday\u2019s conversation, but I had to assume she\u2019d given him the same ultimatum about surrendering his kingdom to her. I also assumed he\u2019d refused.</p><p>\u201cTrue, it\u2019s simpler when I have a land\u2019s monarch on hand, but his is only one kingdom. His death will serve me better than his surrender. Someone else will simply claim the land, and although it may take longer this way, the Oak Land will become mine once that new king or queen swears allegiance.\u201d</p><p>Dorian was still smiling, though there was a tightness in his features that hadn\u2019t been there earlier. He narrowed his eyes. \u201cSay what you want, but even if the lowest scullery maid in my castle seizes control of the land, she still won\u2019t surrender to you. And Eugenie certainly isn\u2019t going to yield the Iron Crown to your control simply for my sake. She doesn\u2019t like me nearly that much. This is an absurd waste of time. Why don\u2019t we all just sit down for a delightful morning meal of tea and pastries and put this absurdity behind us? Where are your charming pets, by the way?\u201d</p><p>There was some truth to his words. I wasn\u2019t going to give up the Iron Crown, even to save his life\u2014but that decision wasn\u2019t nearly as carefree as he made it sound. It was a head-over-heart choice, one that I knew accomplished the most good but which would probably kill me in the application.</p><p>\u201cThis is no joke. The Oak King will die if my request is denied. And,\u201d Varia continued to me, \u201cas I said, I\u2019m not going to let you debate in luxury.\u201d</p><p>Was my cell considered luxury? I really had to see what passed for dismal lodging around this place. Before I could question her further, a slight gesture from her brought a guard striding toward Dorian. In one smooth motion, he halted before Dorian and punched him hard in the stomach. Dorian doubled over, and a spasm of pain crossed his face, but he otherwise made no sound. Me, on the other hand ... well, I had a few things to say.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking bitch!\u201d I exclaimed, straining forward. Guards were already in place to restrain my arms, probably having anticipated my reaction. \u201cI am going to kill you!\u201d Without further thought, I had drawn the magic of air and water around me. The room grew thick with humidity and tension. All I needed was a source to blast it into.</p><p>\u201cEugenie,\u201d said Dorian sharply. All mirth was gone. \u201cDo not do anything rash. You have a lot to think over.\u201d</p><p>I met his eyes, which were greener than ever in the morning light streaming through Varia\u2019s windows. I caught the subtext. If I unleashed my magic now, it would be without a well-formed plan. Again, I had a head vs. heart decision here, and my head\u2019s argument didn\u2019t seem so compelling just then. Still, after a deep breath, I dropped my magic and fixed a glare on Varia.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps the Oak King is more reasonable than I suspected,\u201d she mused. She nodded toward the same guard again. He stepped forward and punched Dorian in the face, hard enough that I heard a thwack.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d moaned Dorian, wincing from the pain. \u201cMy greatest asset.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip so hard that I tasted blood. But I had to do something to stop myself from striking Varia down with lightning. \u201cWhat is the point of this?\u201d I asked Varia, once I had some semblance of control. \u201cTo convince me what a badass you are? That you can bully a chained-up man? Or is it just so I\u2019ll believe you really will kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can rest assured that I will kill him. Mostly this is to emphasize what I said before: no more time to lounge around and decide with no consequences. For every moment you waste deliberating today, the Oak King will be in the hands of my torturers, experiencing the most excruciating pain. Your delay extends that agony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, irony,\u201d murmured Dorian.</p><p>I stiffened. This was not good news, first because I simply didn\u2019t want Dorian suffering. What also sucked was that I was certain the torturers were not on the same floor as my cell, meaning I wouldn\u2019t have Dorian on hand when I attempted my great coup. Jasmine and the others\u2019 escape had given me one less variable to worry about inside the palace. Dorian being taken out of my sight was a brand-new complication.</p><p>Varia continued. \u201cAnd believe me when I say that my professionals make Garik\u2019s attempts here seem quite childish. No offense, Garik.\u201d The punching guard gave a bow of acknowledgment to his queen. \u201cFortunately for the Oak King, his pain will be short-lived\u2014either because you\u2019ll make the right decision or I\u2019ll be forced to kill him at suppertime.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRemember\u2014nothing rash, Eugenie,\u201d said Dorian, far too cheerful for someone whose face was swelling rapidly. \u201cI can take as much pain as I can dole out\u2014and you certainly know how much I can dole out. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>Again, I caught the message to carry out the other plans with caution. There was also, I suspected, a joke in there about some of Dorian\u2019s sexual preferences, which tended to run toward BDSM. I had little appreciation for the weak attempt at humor just now, however. It took every ounce of strength I had to remain hard and impassive to Varia. Otherwise, there was a good chance I\u2019d fall to my knees and beg for Dorian\u2019s release.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not swearing any loyalty to you,\u201d I told her. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to use the Iron Crown on your behalf. That answer\u2019s not going to change.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what you say later today.\u201d She gave us a wave of dismissal. \u201cTake them to their respective locations.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t able to exchange another word with Dorian because we were both hurried out too quickly. The urge to unleash a storm surged within me one last time, and I again fought it back. I would do this right. So, I allowed my escort to take me back to my cell on the third floor. They again gave me the faux courtesy of removing my chains before locking the door. Glancing around, I saw that someone had left a covered meal tray on my palette. I lifted the lid and found a piece of bread and some water\u2014and a rat that quickly darted off the tray. Talk about adding insult to injury.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s just lovely.\u201d</p><p>Yet, before I finished speaking, I noticed something weird about the rat\u2014mainly, that it wasn\u2019t actually a rat. Instead, it was a rat-sized miniature red fox. I caught my breath.</p><p>\u201cNo way. Kiyo?\u201d</p> <p>The rat-fox scurried to the center of my cell. Within moments, he transformed, and I had a full-sized Kiyo standing before me. I cast a wary look behind me, half expecting guards to come busting in. Then, I had to remind myself that his kitsune magic would not be readily detectable to gentry.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you do that?\u201d I asked Kiyo. \u201cDid a mad scientist give you a shrink ray?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, but his eyes looked tired. \u201cAfraid not. It\u2019s just another variation on the shape-shifting, just like I can turn into a super-sized fox. I\u2019ve just never had much reason for the small size. Turns out it\u2019s terribly convenient for poking around a palace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were a rat,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cSo did one of the cooks in the kitchen. I have a new respect for brooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how you guys escaped? Where\u2019s everyone else? Are they okay?\u201d</p> <p>He leaned against the wall and ran a hand through his dark hair. \u201cThe chains couldn\u2019t stop me, especially once I shape-shifted. Once I had a moment to free myself, I got the chains off everyone else, and then we just kind of busted our way out in the night. Why haven\u2019t you done that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould if I could,\u201d I muttered. \u201cVaria\u2019s keeping me in check with a few things. First, it was you guys. Then she tacked on the destruction of my kingdoms and finding Isaac and Ivy for good measure. Now she\u2019s got Dorian with torturers and his execution penciled in.\u201d I gave him a brief recap of my morning meeting.</p><p>\u201cYou were smart not to act then,\u201d said Kiyo, when I was finished. \u201cDorian\u2019s strong. He\u2019ll hold out.\u201d</p><p>I wondered if Kiyo meant that or if he just didn\u2019t really care about Dorian suffering. \u201cYou never told me where the others are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHidden in the city,\u201d Kiyo said. \u201cYour Hemlock friends helped us find a safe place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHemlock ...\u201d A light went off. \u201cYou\u2019re Alea\u2019s scout, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been looking for the room with the talismans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFound it,\u201d he said, in a manner far too casual for the importance of those words. \u201cLike I said, you can get to a lot when you\u2019re rat-sized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it in the basement, like Alea said?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, yes, but there are a bunch of basements here. This place goes as far underground as it does above. The room\u2019s about four floors down and has lots of guards. The objects are inside, in two collections, surrounded by some magic I can\u2019t really figure out. But then, gentry magic isn\u2019t my specialty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo collections ... let me guess. One for the lands actually in the blight and one for those who\u2019ve sworn allegiance. But obviously, she\u2019d still keep their tokens around as leverage.\u201d</p><p>Kiyo nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought too. Not sure if this makes you feel better or worse, but the blighted pile was much larger. More are resisting than giving in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know it was the blighted pile? Did you recognize Maiwenn\u2019s gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but there was a marble bust of Dorian in there, which I figured must have been his kingdom\u2019s \u2018humble\u2019 gift.\u201d</p><p>That normally would\u2019ve brought a smile to my face, but thinking of Dorian only served to remind me of the trouble he was in because of me. The image of him being punched in the face was etched in my mind.</p><p>\u201cWe have to expedite things and get out of here,\u201d I said. If Kiyo had talked to Alea, she probably would\u2019ve mentioned me telling Spots that I would free her king. But, obviously, there was a lot more to the plan that Kiyo needed to be caught up on. I quickly explained about the other captive monarchs and how Volusian had been in contact with them. Kiyo\u2019s eyes were aglow as he listened.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s brilliant,\u201d he said. \u201cSo long as they haven\u2019t been badly treated, they\u2019ll be a huge force to have on our side.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cVolusian didn\u2019t give me the impression that they\u2019d been physically harmed ... just that some were kind of defeated mentally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable,\u201d said Kiyo. \u201cBut if they can fight, we may not need to figure out the key to the enchantment around the objects. You guys can just overpower it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked about that too. It\u2019s an option. Still, if there\u2019s any edge we can get, I want it. I don\u2019t want to go down there with my little posse of six or so, only to find out Varia used six hundred to cast her spell and that we can\u2019t even come close to matching that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can ask Orj and the rest of the Hemlock group about it. Along with some dissidents from other kingdoms, it seems Varia has a number of malcontents within her own borders.\u201d</p><p>That was a surprise. \u201cEveryone I\u2019ve met sure seems devoted, though. She\u2019s massively powerful and controls lots of other kingdoms. Seems like her subjects would be happy about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re devoted because they\u2019re afraid of her,\u201d Kiyo pointed out. \u201cAnd from what I\u2019ve been hearing, the people in her own kingdom don\u2019t always fare much better than those she subjugates.\u201d</p><p>That also surprised me, since I regarded protecting my subjects as my main job as queen. Of course, Varia and I were coming from very different points of view, seeing as I also didn\u2019t really feel the need to blackmail the innocents of other kingdoms with death and suffering in order to expand my empire. So, it was reasonable she and I would have different ruling styles in general.</p><p>\u201cWell, find out what you can,\u201d I told him. \u201cOne thing I know for sure\u2014we need to get Dorian out before we launch our master attack.\u201d</p><p>Kiyo shifted uncomfortably. \u201cWe might not have time for that. We can get him once everything else is taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe may not have the chance! The whole reason she\u2019s holding him is to ensure my good behavior. If we start some commotion up here, he could end up dead before we get back to him.\u201d</p><p>I admit, part of me had been a little amazed this whole time that Kiyo and I had been having such a civil conversation. It was almost\u2014almost\u2014like we didn\u2019t have this history of blood and betrayal between us. Nonetheless, I think I\u2019d been subconsciously waiting for something to pick a fight over, some reason for our tenuous alliance to fall apart. Kiyo, to his credit, seemed to take his time in forming a civil response.</p><p>\u201cIf you go after Dorian beforehand and something goes wrong, you could end up dead before you ever get a chance to free the hostage monarchs and go after the objects. Or, even if you bring the monarchs with you, there\u2019s still the chance something could go amiss.\u201d He gave me a wry look. \u201cYou aren\u2019t all-powerful, Eugenie. You keep talking like all you really need to do is walk out of here, and everything will be taken care of. You\u2019re a badass, but this place is packed full of magic users and soldiers. That can wear even you down.\u201d</p><p>He was annoying because he was right. It was entirely possible we could achieve everything\u2014destroying the talismans and freeing Dorian\u2014but the former had to take first priority. We couldn\u2019t risk losing our shot at that. It\u2019s what Dorian would want. And yet ...</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t abandon him,\u201d I said in a small voice.</p><p>Kiyo studied me for a long time before responding. \u201cI\u2019ll rescue him.\u201d</p><p>I looked up sharply. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll rescue him. You don\u2019t need me for when you break this group out, and really, you don\u2019t need me when you go after the objects. You need magic users for that, not a fighter. In fact, if I go after Dorian when your breakout starts, it might pose a neat distraction to take the heat off you. I can even probably recruit some of the rest of the gang to help me\u2014though you\u2019d probably be better off if Jasmine and Pagiel were with you.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him in amazement. \u201cYou could be killed.\u201d</p><p>Kiyo gave me a dry smile. \u201cI knew that when I set out from the Willow Land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019d be on Dorian\u2019s behalf. I can\u2019t really say I saw that coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy priority\u2019s always been the mission. There\u2019s nothing personal about Dorian\u2014that\u2019s what I tried to tell you when he was in the dryads\u2019 trance. If I can save him and help us achieve our goal at the same time ... well, then. So much the better.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said. \u201cThat ... that really means a lot.\u201d</p><p>Kiyo arched an eyebrow. \u201cYou care about him a lot, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always have,\u201d I said, not meeting his eyes. \u201cEven when we were mad at each other over something, we\u2019ve always been there for each other.\u201d</p> <p>Until those words left my mouth, I hadn\u2019t realized how powerful they were. When Kiyo and I had disagreed on things, it had almost always resulted in a breakup\u2014hence the on-and-off-again nature of our relationship, and its eventual degradation into way off. I\u2019d noted in Alabama how idyllic things were with Evan ... how peaceful and easy. And they were\u2014because we never disagreed. He never contradicted me or told me what to do. Some might argue that\u2019s a good thing, but I wasn\u2019t sure it was a realistic thing. Of course it\u2019s easy to like someone who always agrees with you. The trick is still standing united with someone who will tell you things you don\u2019t want to hear. That\u2019s how Dorian and I had always been. With very few exceptions, we\u2019d always worked as a strong team, even when totally pissed off at each other.</p><p>If Kiyo knew the thoughts churning within me, he didn\u2019t let on. He switched back to strategy. \u201cThe trick\u2019s got to be in the timing. We need to sync up rescuing him and the other monarchs\u2014but still allow enough time to see if we can figure out the key to the enchantment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too much time, though,\u201d I warned. \u201cThat bitch wants to execute him for her dinner entertainment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo watches or clocks to go by either.\u201d Kiyo glanced at the small window. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t have much of a sense of the sun here either. That window\u2019s really not good for\u2014wait. The falcon. We\u2019ll send Alea\u2019s falcon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpots?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s his name?\u201d Kiyo asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cYou have cats named after the Four Horsemen. What\u2019s wrong with Spots?\u201d</p><p>Kiyo shook his head, having no time for such debates. \u201cI have to see the Hemlock gang anyway. I\u2019ll make arrangements for Alea to send, uh, Spots here when we go in to rescue Dorian. So, when the falcon arrives ... wait, oh, ten minutes and then go for it.\u201d</p><p>It was as good as we were going to get with our limited options. Kiyo and I hashed out as many other details as we could in our time together, including very specific directions on how to get to the palace\u2019s lower levels from here. We talked until we finally heard my door unlock. Quickly, he transformed into the rat-fox again and crawled onto the plate, just in time for me to put the lid down and hand the covered tray to the servant doing cleanup. Kiyo had seemed pretty confident that he\u2019d have no trouble getting out of the kitchens, so I had to trust him from there.</p><p>The servant swapped the tray for a new one, which I realized was for my midday meal already. Time went a lot faster when you had company and weren\u2019t staring at the walls. Once I was alone again, though, I recalled Varia\u2019s comment that every minute I delayed meant more time for Dorian in the hands of the torturers. A good part of the day had gone by, and as more of it passed, I grew restless wondering if she\u2019d be calling me for her deadly ultimatum.</p><p>Time passed, though, with no word from her. Maybe she had changed her mind. After three hours, I was actually starting to get worried for a whole other set of reasons. The light coming in my window still told me we had plenty of day left, but if Kiyo was going to make good on his word to rescue Dorian, he needed to act soon before the \u201cdinner show.\u201d</p> <p>A flutter of wings in the window made me jump. Spots wiggled his way in and hopped down right next to me on the cot. Adrenaline surged through me. After a day of waiting on any action to happen, things were finally about to get moving.</p><p>\u201cShowtime, huh?\u201d I asked Spots.</p><p>His answer was to extend his leg, which again had a tiny scroll affixed to it. I removed the scroll and found when I unrolled it that it had a lot more writing than the last message. As such, it was nearly impossible to read since microscopic writing had been required to contain it all. After much squinting, I deduced the two main points of the message. One was that all was in place, and I could commence with the plan. The other was that the objects\u2019 protective enchantment could be weakened by an incantation spoken by someone wielding a considerable amount of power. The incantation, which wasn\u2019t long, was also listed.</p><p>\u201cSeems awfully easy,\u201d I muttered. \u201cToo easy.\u201d Conscious of the time, I retrieved my half-ass wand and summoned Volusian. I quickly got him up to speed on the latest developments and showed him the incantation.</p><p>\u201cIt does seem easy,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cCould my friends have been misled? Maybe their so-called Yew dissidents lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the language of a Yew spell,\u201d said Volusian. \u201cSo that much is accurate, mistress. What I wonder is if part of it is missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a problem for later,\u201d I said. That seemed to be my operating procedure here. I put the scroll in my pocket and tried not to let his words bring me too down. \u201cFor now, we\u2019ve got to get moving. The clock\u2019s ticking and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Again, I heard the sound of the door unlocking. \u201cGo,\u201d I told Volusian as I hid the wand under my shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s probably for the tray. You go too, Spots. Tell your mistress things are about to get going.\u201d</p><p>But when the door opened, it wasn\u2019t the servant who entered. It was my usual escort of guards. \u201cHer Majesty has summoned you,\u201d said one of them. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>What? I was being ordered to Varia now, seconds before I staged my great escape? I stood where I was.</p><p>\u201cWhat for? I thought I didn\u2019t have to make any decisions until dinnertime,\u201d I said, crossing my arms. Much of the day had passed, but I was pretty sure it wasn\u2019t quite that late in the evening.</p><p>\u201cHer Majesty wishes you to see the Oak King,\u201d explained the guard.</p><p>Irony strikes again. I\u2019d wanted nothing more than to go bust Dorian out myself, and Kiyo had volunteered to free me up for the monarchs. Here were the guards, offering to take me straight to Dorian\u2014but I needed to dodge it. I was needed up here.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said haughtily. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019m not going to play her game and let her try to psych me out with her ability to inflict pain. That\u2019s not how I work.\u201d Even as I spoke, it occurred to me I would just have to start my breakout now. What was the difference if the guards were in or out of my cell? I\u2019d have to contend with them one way or another. I was on the verge of summoning my magic when the guard\u2019s next words drew me up short.</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure the Oak King\u2019s still alive.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>My heart stopped.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>The guard remained blas\u00e9. \u201cSome of the torturers were a little too zealous in their art, it seems. When Her Majesty discovered this, she graciously decided to allow you the opportunity to visit before the Oak King passes. I don\u2019t know his current status. It\u2019s not really my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing gracious about that!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cAnd that wasn\u2019t part of the plan. Varia told me he was going to be executed later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur lady doesn\u2019t answer to you, nor is she required to keep her word to her inferiors. She may do whatever she likes.\u201d</p><p>My heart was working again, only to start beating in double-time. In deviating from her plan, Varia was ruining mine. Dorian ... dead? I\u2019d known he was in danger, but in the back of my mind, that danger had always been \u201clater.\u201d And, with the way I normally operated, \u201clater\u201d always meant I had a chance to intervene. An internal voice kept saying Stick to the plan, stick to the plan. If Dorian was dead, there was nothing I could do. If he was still alive, then Kiyo and the others could rescue him.</p><p>And yet ...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d I said.</p><p>It went against every kind of logic. It played into Varia\u2019s hands. And yet, there was no way I could abandon Dorian if he was near his last breath.</p><p>They took me to the torturers\u2019 chamber, which was every bit as terrible as one might imagine. Wicked-looking weapons\u2014most of which seemed to favor spikes\u2014lined the walls. But when they took me to Dorian, I didn\u2019t see a single mark on him\u2014aside from the ones inflicted earlier\u2014making me think gentry forms of torture were far more insidious than I knew. He lay on his back, on a long stone table, like a corpse in a morgue. I hurried to his side, and even without any ostensible signs of injury, it was obvious he wasn\u2019t in good shape.</p><p>Dorian had always been pale, but it was the natural marble complexion that came with red hair and caution with the sun. This ... this was something different altogether. It was the unhealthy white of near death. His skin was clammy, and his breathing was shallow. Still, that last one filled me with hope. He was breathing. I rested a couple fingers on the side of his neck and felt a faint pulse. That was about the extent of my medical knowledge, but again, the fact that there was a pulse had to be a good sign.</p><p>I glared around at the others in the room, unsure of whom I should direct my righteous fury to since Varia apparently couldn\u2019t be troubled to come see me. Probably it was the dogs\u2019 bath time. My contingent of guards had received reinforcements, but they were mostly there as precautions to keep me in line. The real culprits, I assumed, were two gentry standing in long brown robes with gold embroidery, watching me in silence. One was a man, one was a woman.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d I asked.</p><p>The male torturer spread his hands out in an absurdly serene way. \u201cWhat our queen asked of us. She wished to make a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, that she\u2019s a raging psychopathic bitch? She made that point a long time ago when she started exploiting other kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>A few of the guards frowned at my language, but no one came forward to stop me. \u201cShe wished merely to show her power,\u201d said the female torturer. \u201cAnd encourage you to choose a wise course of action.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am not helping her with her insane plans,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd she damned well knows it.

I turned back to Dorian and gently brushed hair away from his face. \u201cStay with me,\u201d I murmured. \u201cIt was bad enough with the dryads.

He arched an eyebrow. \u201cWhat exactly did you expect? That you could refuse and Her Majesty would free him? If you want him healed, comply with her requests. Those are your only choices.\u201d</p> <p>No, I actually had a couple of other choices. One was to fake them out and claim I would give in to Varia. After all, that was hardly the kind of decision I had to immediately act on. I didn\u2019t have the Iron Crown with me. It was hidden far away in my own lands. If I claimed I would give it to her, I had plenty of time to figure out the rest of this before I actually had to produce said crown.</p><p>Just then, Dorian started coughing. No, not coughing. Gasping. Like he couldn\u2019t get enough air. His eyes fluttered open, a frantic and desperate look in them as he fought to breathe.</p><p>\u201cDorian!\u201d I cried, grabbing hold of him. \u201cDorian, breathe! Relax. You can do it.\u201d</p><p>Yet, it was clear he couldn\u2019t hear me or see me. He was somewhere else, somewhere locked in pain that had done so much damage, it was now about to finish him off. I looked up at all the gathered people in the room, unable to believe they were all just standing around.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d remarked one of the torturers. \u201cI wondered when his lungs would give out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo something!\u201d I yelled. \u201cHelp him.\u201d</p> <p>Dorian suddenly stilled, a look of horror on his face. I shared his feelings because I realized he was no longer breathing. A new sort of panic shot through me, as well as frustration and a terrible aching sadness. I possessed a power that could bring many to their knees, a power that was widely envied. What good was it, I wondered angrily, when it left me completely helpless to defend those I cared about?</p><p>\u201cWe do nothing until you make your choice,\u201d replied the male torturer.</p><p>Choice? Yeah. I was going to make my choice\u2014and it wasn\u2019t going to be giving in to Varia. It wouldn\u2019t even be faking her out. It was going to be the choice I\u2019d wanted to make from the very beginning.</p><p>I was going to blow this room apart and get Dorian out of here.</p><p>Magic surged within me, the power of water and air that surrounded all living things. The room grew thick with humidity as the air swelled and tensed, just as it had in my morning meeting with Varia. Now, I went further. The scent of ozone spread around us, and I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up from the electrical charges in the air. Some of those gathered sensed me pulling on my magic. Everyone else simply felt the obvious signs of a storm about to break loose. People tensed, weapons were drawn. Good luck with that, I thought.</p><p>A huge burst of air, reaching a breaking point, suddenly exploded and took out one of the room\u2019s walls. Stone and debris flew everywhere, and I barely had the presence of mind to lean over and shield Dorian with my body. My own injury didn\u2019t matter. Others in the room didn\u2019t have such protection.</p><p>The funny thing was, though, I wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d blown the wall apart.</p><p>From a now-visible room next door, Kiyo and Rurik surged in, the rest of our soldiers right behind them, along with some Hemlock fighters. And behind them were Jasmine and Pagiel, tipping me off about what had happened to the wall. Immediately, the Yew soldiers jumped forward to engage this new threat, forgetting all about me.</p> <p>\u201cAlistir!\u201d I yelled, somehow making my voice heard above the fray.</p><p>Dorian\u2019s soldier jerked his head toward me. I beckoned him over. He gave a curt nod, after first dispatching a Yew warrior. Dodging a few others, Alistir soon made his way to me. I gestured frantically to Dorian.</p><p>\u201cHelp him. He hasn\u2019t been breathing for almost a minute.\u201d</p><p>Alistir blanched. Quickly he put his hands on Dorian. I couldn\u2019t sense his healing magic, but from the look on Alistir\u2019s face, he had a struggle ahead of him. I didn\u2019t doubt Alistir was gifted, but I also wished just then that we had brought a sure healer like Shaya after all.</p><p>\u201cEugenie!\u201d Kiyo\u2019s voice drew me from the healing drama. He punched a Yew soldier and then gave me an incredulous look. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here? Get out! You know what you have to do!\u201d</p><p>Feeling conflicted, I cast an anxious look at Dorian. How could I leave him? I couldn\u2019t tell what Alistir was doing or if Dorian was even breathing again.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d screamed Kiyo.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do, Your Majesty,\u201d said Alistir through clenched teeth. \u201cGo. Leave him to me.\u201d</p><p>I knew he was right, and again, that frustration filled me, the sense of being superpowerful and yet completely devoid of power. I could do nothing here, but there was a lot I could do upstairs.</p><p>The entrance I\u2019d come in through was completely congested with fighting, so I hurried over to the impromptu door Pagiel had made in the wall. Someone fell in step beside me, and I braced myself for a fight until I realized it was Jasmine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d she said before I could utter a word. \u201cThey\u2019ve got that under control. What are you doing here anyway? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be leading a revolution?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got sidetracked,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Making our way back to the third floor was easier than I thought. A lot of guards ran right past us, only knowing there was a fight in the basement they had to get to. It never occurred to them that they were going right by their star prisoner. Those who did challenge us were easily knocked aside with our combined magic, falling over like dominos as we cleared them out of our way.</p><p>Back in the royal holding hall, I saw the number of guards had lessened, probably because they\u2019d been dispatched downstairs. Most of the magic users were still there, giving Jasmine and I quite the fight. One of the first soldiers I took out was someone I recognized as the chief jailer.</p><p>\u201cGet his keys and start freeing the others,\u201d I told Jasmine. \u201cI\u2019ll handle this group.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate, and I made sure to make such a spectacle that I drew all the attention. The magic users who\u2019d been left on duty ran a wide gamut of powers. Some I was able to toss around with wind before they even struck. One sent a wave of fire at me, inadvertently singeing one of his colleagues. As the fire raced toward me, I called on the moisture around me. The air around us went bone dry, but a wall of water materialized to stop the fire. I followed it up with a gust of wind to ensure he didn\u2019t repeat the act.</p><p>The hall\u2019s space limited me in some ways. Normally, I would\u2019ve kept hurricane-worthy winds churning nonstop, in an effort to stop my adversaries from even standing. I couldn\u2019t do that easily without affecting Jasmine, however. Likewise, I was hesitant to use lightning in such a confined space. I was pretty good at controlling it\u2014and it was an excellent weapon\u2014but it had the potential to get out of control. Again, I had to consider Jasmine and the prisoners\u2019 safety.</p><p>So, I stuck to wind and water, which were effective but took a little more time in these quarters since those powers had to be wielded carefully. I\u2019d gotten down to just one magic user when something hard, big, and solid slammed into me from the side. One of the doors of the cells had been ripped off its hinges and thrown at me. I stumbled to the ground. Judging from the satisfied look of the gentry advancing on me, that had been her doing. She must have some affinity to trees or wood in general. I would\u2019ve sensed air magic and had warning.</p><p>I scrambled to my feet and reached for my power. Before I could do anything, what looked like a net of blue light flew out and wrapped her up like a cocoon. She screamed in pain as the net contracted tighter and tighter around her. It enveloped her torso\u2014as well as her neck. Soon her screams quieted as her oxygen was cut off. She fell to the ground, dead or unconscious I couldn\u2019t say. I was reminded uncomfortably of Dorian.</p><p>Looking around, I saw a tall man with shoulder-length black hair and a pointed beard standing in the doorway to one of the cells. He made a small motion with his hand, and the net of light disappeared. He surveyed his victim for a few moments and seemed satisfied with what he found. He then glanced up and gave me a nod of acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Eugenie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m indebted to you,\u201d he said gravely. \u201cI\u2019m Hadic, King of the Hemlock Land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh man,\u201d I said. \u201cI know some people that are going to be glad to see you.\u201d</p><p>We were soon joined by Jasmine and the rest of the monarchs. There was no time for extensive introductions, but I quickly understood what Volusian had meant about the variety of attitudes. A few, like Hadic, looked ready to take on Varia singlehandedly. The others seemed dazed, like they had just woken from a dream. Still, as they took in their surroundings, I saw sparks of life in their eyes that I hoped would grow. All looked thin and worn, no doubt the result of a long time of eating prisoner rations and being deprived of their lands.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I said, not waiting to see if they would all follow. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to defeat Varia and get rid of this blight once and for all.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d memorized Kiyo\u2019s directions and found running downstairs was much like the journey up\u2014a mixture of obliviousness and challenges on the parts of the soldiers. One thing that had changed was that the situation had grown increasingly chaotic. Guards and civilians alike were in a panic. I guess when you were ruled by a powerful despot like Varia, you just didn\u2019t expect many challenges to the status quo. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The torture chamber had been one floor down. There was a big temptation to go check on the situation there, but I\u2019d already deviated from the plan once today. So, I kept going down the stairs, down to the fourth subterranean level. We met little resistance on the stairs but were swarmed with guards as soon as we headed down the corridor toward the room holding the gifts. It was closed with double doors, just as Kiyo had described to me. Hadic\u2019s hands blazed with blue light.</p><p>\u201cYou know how to stop the blight?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen do it. We\u2019ll hold them off.\u201d</p><p>All five monarchs seemed to be on board now, much to my relief. I had to assume their powers, even a little weakened, were more or less comparable to mine and Dorian\u2019s. Could the two of us have taken on this force of soldiers? Probably. Or at least made a damned good showing. That seemed to favor the odds of this group handling everything.</p><p>\u201cThe room\u2019s at the end of the hall,\u201d I said. \u201cCome to us when you can.\u201d If the incantation didn\u2019t work, I was going to have to try the brute-force method to shatter the enchantment.</p><p>Jasmine and I had to squeeze our way past the mob of guards and magic users, but fortunately, the monarchs did a good job covering us. Once we reached the double doors, we encountered a few more sentries, but the bulk of the forces were engaged elsewhere. Jasmine and I easily took this handful out and tried to open the doors. Unsurprisingly, they were locked. Rather than search for keys on the guards, I simply blasted the doors open. It was kind of therapeutic after my recent frustrations.</p><p>We hurried inside and came to a halt. It was exactly as Kiyo had described. A wide vault of a room with high ceilings. Two piles of objects sat before us, ranging from statues to jewels to cloth. One collection was quite small, the other sickeningly large. Each of those objects represented a kingdom held in thrall by the blight, every single one of those kingdoms suffering as badly as my own.</p> <p>Jasmine darted toward them, the desire for destruction written all over her features. \u201cWait\u2014\u201d I called.</p><p>Too late. She hit one of the invisible walls protecting the stash and bounced off it, stumbling back and hitting the floor. Flushing, she got back on her feet and glared.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really there, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d My ability to sense various types of gentry magic was erratic, but I could feel this, even though I couldn\u2019t see it. It was strong\u2014very strong. I wondered again how many it would\u2019ve taken to build it.</p><p>Reaching for the scroll in my pocket, I cleared my throat. \u201cLet\u2019s hope this knocks it down for us.\u201d I had to squint again to read the incantation, most of which was nonsensical syllables in an ancient language of magic. When I finished, I looked up at the objects. Nothing had changed, to my senses. That powerful magic was still in place.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t pronounce it correctly,\u201d said Jasmine.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I said skeptically. It was written pretty much like it sounded, and Volusian had listened to my recitation in my cell, correcting me when needed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because you weren\u2019t born in the Yew Land,\u201d said a voice behind me.</p><p>I spun around, instinctively reaching for the only weapon I had\u2014which was the crappy wand. Varia stood in the doorway, wearing a sensible dress for a change, as she regarded us with that annoyingly condescending expression she excelled at. So help me, those ridiculous dogs were at her feet, wearing their bows, barking at us.</p><p>\u201cWhatever spy got you that charm did an excellent job,\u201d she continued. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether to be impressed or annoyed. It\u2019s perfect, word for word. Unfortunately, what he or she failed to discover is that it must be performed by a magic user of significant strength\u2014one who is from the Yew Land. You don\u2019t really think I would have gone to all this trouble so that anyone could come along and destroy it with a little chant? Everything you see, everything having to do with the Winter Enchantment has been the result of years of preparation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I said, realizing this needed an upgrade in profanity.</p><p>There was nothing to be done now but hope the monarchs and I could simply blast our way through the shield. Well, that and I could also take out Varia while I was killing time. She certainly wasn\u2019t going to stand by when the rest of us attempted to destroy the gifts. Besides, after everything she\u2019d put me through, I was kind of\u2014</p><p>My thoughts grew disoriented as a wave of dizziness hit me. I shook my head to clear it and readjusted my stance. Too much exertion today, I supposed. I focused back on Varia, who was watching me with an amused curl of her lips. Beside me, I heard a surprised cry from Jasmine. She took a few steps forward and suddenly fell to her knees. She clasped her hands to her head and winced, as though she was being subjected to some terrible noise.</p> <p>As for me, the disorientation returned, again messing with my sense of balance. I nearly joined Jasmine on the floor but just barely managed to stay upright. I didn\u2019t do so gracefully, however, and probably looked like some kind of drunken ballet dancer. With only Varia for an audience, I didn\u2019t really care.</p><p>\u201cWhat ... are you doing?\u201d I asked through clenched teeth, still fighting to keep control.</p><p>\u201cWhat I do naturally,\u201d Varia replied. \u201cCome now. Did you think that I had no power of my own? That I only organized others into doing my errands?\u201d</p><p>To be honest, I hadn\u2019t thought much about it. We\u2019d talked a lot about the complex group spells worked in the Yew Land. The fact that she ruled a kingdom implied she possessed considerable magic, but the specifics had been less important in the face of the blight\u2019s greater threat. Now, as a grating buzzing filled my ears, I realized Varia must have some ability to affect a person\u2019s equilibrium and neurological functions. In less scientific gentry terms, she could \u201cmess with your head.\u201d</p><p>It was astonishing and frustrating how crippling this was. In some ways, it was a lot like my helplessness with healing. Gentry magic expressed itself in a wide variety of forms, and mine was primarily a physical manifestation. If she\u2019d started hurling fireballs at me, I could\u2019ve answered her in kind with tangible elements. This kind of attack\u2014invisible and almost psychic in nature\u2014wasn\u2019t anything I could throw a lightning bolt at. I could throw a lightning bolt at her, but that was going to require me pushing back against this mind melt\u2014and right now, that was pretty damned difficult. The best I could hope for was that the others in the hall would show up before she killed us. Surely she couldn\u2019t exert this kind of control over a bunch of people, and maybe someone would be more resistant than\u2014</p><p>I gasped as a revelation came to me. Mustering my strength, I tried to ignore her mental attack as best I could in order to extend my homemade wand. I managed to recite Volusian\u2019s summoning words, unsure if I could actually get him when I was in such a compromised state. Miraculously, he appeared.</p><p>\u201cVolusian!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cHelp us.\u201d</p><p>Volusian didn\u2019t respond right away. He didn\u2019t even look at me, really. Despite his shifting, flickering form, his red eyes burned bright and steady as he fixed them on Varia.</p><p>\u201cVaria, daughter of Ganene,\u201d he said, almost politely. \u201cYou resemble your mother.\u201d</p><p>Varia frowned, and I felt the slightest easing of the magic she was working on me. Apparently, she could only focus on a limited number of things, which boded well for when my reinforcements arrived. Which I hoped would be soon.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Varia demanded. \u201cWhat are you? There\u2019s something about you ... familiar and not familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be familiar, as I still bear the brand of your mother and grandmother\u2019s magic.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flicked to me, as though recalling my words when I\u2019d called him. \u201cVolusian? Surely not ... not that Volusian. He died long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead and not dead,\u201d he said. \u201cPer the terms of the curse.\u201d</p><p>While I was sure Volusian\u2019s life history was fascinating, we had no time for it. \u201cVolusian, enough small talk! Do something to help us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladly, mistress.\u201d</p><p>Volusian moved as though to attack but didn\u2019t get far when Varia shrieked, \u201cNo!\u201d Her mental attack on me disappeared, and instead, I felt a ripple of invisible power go through the air and threaten to unravel the bonds that held me and Volusian together. His image flickered, and I could barely believe what was happening.</p><p>\u201cImpossible,\u201d I murmured. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to banish him.\u201d Considering I couldn\u2019t even banish him alone, I at first thought this must mean Varia was far more formidable than I\u2019d suspected. Then, thinking about the conversation I\u2019d just overheard, I reconsidered. If she had some sort of familial connection to Volusian\u2019s curse, she might also possess an inherent ability to shatter it and send him from this world. Volusian was a pain in the ass, but I couldn\u2019t risk losing an ally like him\u2014especially now. I was in possession of my powers once more and used them to slam Varia into a wall with a blast of wind. At the impact, her grip on Volusian loosened, and my bonds to him reestablished themselves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing you a favor!\u201d she hissed to me. \u201cYou want nothing to do with a black wizard like him! He\u2019s evil and traitorous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can thank your mother and grandmother for that,\u201d returned Volusian smoothly. \u201cI would have been the most loyal of servants if they hadn\u2019t betrayed me. Had I been able to then, I would\u2019ve made them pay. Instead, I had to wait all these centuries until I was bonded to someone strong enough to bring me back to this wretched land. I would rather take my revenge on Ganene and Onya than you, but I\u2019ve long learned to make do with what I have.\u201d</p><p>I thought for sure that Volusian was going to rip her apart with his bare hands, just as he\u2019d threatened to do to me on countless occasions. I wondered if I should stop him. Before he made any more advances, however, he paused and glanced at me.</p><p>\u201cThe cost of me being here, of course, is that I must still serve you, mistress. You asked me to help in some way. From what I can see, the enchantment on the talismans holds.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe incantation didn\u2019t work,\u201d I said. \u201cIt has to be recited by a Yew magic user\u2014\u201d</p><p>Volusian was already chanting. I hadn\u2019t been aware that he\u2019d memorized the incantation in my cell, but he knew it word for word. Power radiated out from him as he spoke. Varia let out a strangled cry and pushed forward against the wind I was still using to hold her in place. With more strength than I\u2019d known she had, she sent another blast of that disorientation to Jasmine and me. We lost our balance again, and I dropped the magic. Varia didn\u2019t waste a moment once freed. As soon as she wasn\u2019t fighting my elements, she directed all her strength into banishing Volusian. Doing so meant she had to let up on Jasmine and me again, probably hoping her last attack would delay us from acting in the time it\u2019d take us to recover.</p><p>She was right because it took me several moments to get back to my feet and clear my head. As I did, a couple of things happened. Volusian finished his incantation, and although there was no visible indication, I felt the power that had been shielding the objects vanish. Maybe there was some residual protective force left, but it was nothing that couldn\u2019t be broken. The other thing that happened was ...</p> <p>Varia banished Volusian.</p><p>\u201cBe gone, you wretched traitor!\u201d she cried. I felt her magic swell, and the bonds that held Volusian and I together disintegrated. \u201cGo to the Underworld and never return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall see you there soon,\u201d said Volusian, undaunted as he began to fade. His gaze turned to me. \u201cI have served you dutifully. Now help me. Destroy her... .\u201d</p><p>He said no more because he disintegrated into sparkles, which soon faded into nothingness. Volusian was gone from this world forever.</p><p>She\u2019d barely finished that banishing when she unleashed another brain blast at me and Jasmine, even stronger than previous ones. I cried out as that buzzing sound shifted to more of a screech. I felt like my ears would explode. Even through it, I could still hear Varia when she spoke.</p> <p>\u201cYou really think you\u2019ve accomplished anything? Just because your minion took down the shield? Once I gather my conclave, we can have it back up in an instant. Nothing has changed. All of those objects\u2014and your kingdoms\u2014are still in the thrall of the Winter Enchantment.\u201d She took a few menacing steps toward us. \u201cNot that it\u2019ll be your concern before long. Know this, before I make the blood in your head burst: Your lands will suffer terribly for this insult. It won\u2019t matter who succeeds after your death. I will strip those lands of all life, they will freeze and suffer as no other\u2014ah!\u201d</p><p>The buzzing and wailing in my ears stopped as one of the objects from the piles came flying over and hit Varia in the head. And when I say hit, it nailed her. There was an audible crack, and she went down instantly, eyes staring vacantly ahead. Her dogs\u2014which had been yapping nonstop\u2014fell silent in astonishment.</p><p>I heard a sharp intake of breath and saw Jasmine struggling to shake off the lingering effects of the disorientation. Blood ran from her ears, but she didn\u2019t look like she\u2019d suffered any other ill effects. I caught her hand and helped her up. Once on my feet again, I peered back at Varia\u2019s still body and got a good look at what had hit her. It was the marble bust of Dorian that had been the Oak Land\u2019s gift.</p><p>A tremor ran through the room, and I immediately looked up at the ceiling, afraid some earthquake was about to bring the whole place crashing down. Four floors underground was not a great place to be during seismic events. The shaking stopped after a few seconds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the land reacting to her death,\u201d said a pleasant voice. \u201cIt\u2019s now unclaimed and seeking a new master or mistress. You could add on to your empire, if you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDorian?\u201d I asked incredulously.</p> <p>Sure enough, he was leaning in the doorway, looking as though that was all that was keeping him upright. He actually didn\u2019t look much better than when I last saw him, fresh out of the torturers\u2019 hands. The only difference now, of course, was that he was breathing and conscious. Otherwise, he still looked sickly and broken.</p><p>He glanced down at Varia. \u201cThat was rather clumsy of me to hit her so hard, I suppose. And a very brutish tactic to boot. I didn\u2019t have much time to think and had to decide on the spot how best to stop her from hurting my two favorite sisters.\u201d He suddenly looked very pleased. \u201cI did, however, manage to do it without hurting those dogs. Very considerate of me. Don\u2019t let it be said I\u2019m not an animal lover\u2014that wretched kitsune aside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDorian!\u201d It was all I could keep managing to say. Assured of my footing, I ran over to him and threw my arms around him. He returned the hug as best he could while still managing to support himself in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Eugenie. Once again, I almost think you\u2019re happy to see me. Surely you didn\u2019t expect me to let you keep being the hero, did you? You\u2019ve saved me far too many times. I needed to pull my share.\u201d</p><p>I was so happy he was alive and mostly well that I still struggled to say anything coherent. I carefully disentangled myself from him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d I laughed. \u201cI feel like I should cry or slap you.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cNeither, please. If you like, I\u2019ll provide you with several other more acceptable alternatives for later. But first ... I believe we have a blight to deal with.\u201d</p><p>Dorian stretched out his hand, and the marble bust floated to him, compelled by his power over stone and earth. He held the bust in his hands and gazed admiringly at himself. \u201cSuch a fetching likeness, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>And with that, he hurled the bust to the tiled floor. The marble sculpture smashed into a hundred fragments and shards. Far away in the Otherworld, the Oak Land woke up.</p> <p>Chapter 23</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for the Yew Land to be claimed. The same magic users that had aided Varia with the blight were all quick to scramble and seize a piece of her former land. As a result, the kingdom ended up reshifting into three smaller kingdoms. I\u2019d been told that was possible in the Otherworld, but I\u2019d never seen it happen. The three kingdoms shaped themselves to their new masters, becoming the Cork Land, the Cottonwood Land, and the Hickory Land. The Yew Land was no more.</p><p>Despite their involvement in Varia\u2019s schemes, the new monarchs\u2014two queens and one king\u2014were quick to make pledges of peace and friendship to my party and the Hemlock contingent. These offers were legitimate, unlike Varia\u2019s absurd \u201cfriendly\u201d offer. The new monarchs were concerned with consolidating their power and establishing a rule. Alliances were far more beneficial than conquests.</p><p>The new monarchs would\u2019ve hosted us for a while, but my group was anxious to return to our own lands and begin the healing there. We declined all the offers, promising to send ambassadors soon to set up trade agreements and treaties. Considering it might take a while before food production was back up in my kingdoms, this was actually a pretty solid plan.</p><p>Before we left, however, I had a very interesting conversation with Magia, the newly crowned Hickory Queen. As someone born and raised in the Yew Land, she was well versed in its history and legends.</p><p>\u201cOf course I know about Volusian, Slayer of Souls,\u201d she told me.</p><p>Dorian was with me, sitting with Magia in an inn that she\u2019d made her headquarters until a castle could be built. I exchanged surprised glances with him.</p><p>\u201cSlayer of Souls?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely an impressive title,\u201d mused Dorian. \u201cI might start calling myself that.\u201d He looked tired but had recovered by leaps and bounds, thanks to Alistir and a healer lent to us by Hadic of the Hemlock Land.</p><p>\u201cI admit,\u201d Magia added, \u201cthat I thought most of it was legend. According to the stories, Volusian was one of Onya\u2019s most trusted advisers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnya?\u201d Moments later, I remembered the portrait I\u2019d seen in the throne room, depicting a queen of the same name and her two daughters.</p><p>Magia nodded. \u201cOnya the Magnificent. Ganene\u2019s mother. Varia\u2019s grandmother. One of the Yew Land\u2019s most powerful leaders. Their whole family was powerful. It was how they were able to keep passing the land down through the generations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemarkable,\u201d Dorian agreed. I\u2019d learned enough to know that lineage didn\u2019t affect who controlled Otherworldly kingdoms. Power did. Monarchs certainly wanted their children to inherit, but many times, those offspring simply weren\u2019t strong enough to claim the land.</p><p>\u201cOnya had a younger daughter, Nissa the Fair.\u201d I remembered the pretty girl in the painting and wondered if this use of nicknames was a Yew custom or simply a product of that era. I wondered also if history would remember me as Eugenie the Badass. \u201cNissa didn\u2019t possess nearly the power of her sister and mother, but she was beautiful and kind and loved by many\u2014including Volusian.\u201d</p><p>I stared in disbelief. \u201cVolusian\u2014in love?\u201d I think that was more unbelievable to me than any of the crazy acts of magic I had witnessed in the Otherworld.</p><p>\u201cHe was alive back then,\u201d Dorian reminded me. \u201cNot an undead creature forced to wander the worlds without peace. I imagine that would change a person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNissa loved him too, even though he wasn\u2019t of the same rank,\u201d continued Magia. \u201cOnya didn\u2019t approve, but she valued him and desperately needed his powers in a war she was waging with a neighboring kingdom. She and Ganene came up with a plan to convince the couple that they could marry after the war, once Volusian had helped lead Onya\u2019s forces to victory. It was all a lie, though, and while he was gone, Ganene and Onya forcibly made Nissa marry a king that they were hoping to secure as an ally. Shortly after the wedding, Nissa committed suicide.\u201d</p><p>I was totally hooked now and had nearly forgotten that Volusian\u2014my Volusian\u2014was the hero of this tale. It was rapidly taking on the status of a Shakespearean tragedy.</p><p>\u201cVolusian returned to find not only that his betrothed had been given to another man but that she was dead. He was so enraged that he turned to the dark arts and ended up aiding Onya\u2019s enemies. They brought a level of horror and devastation to the Yew Land without compare.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thinking of the blight, I questioned that. Of course, Volusian couldn\u2019t have earned the \u201cSlayer of Souls\u201d title without doing some pretty awful things.</p><p>Magia\u2019s eyes grew thoughtful. \u201cIt\u2019s almost certain the Yew Land would have been completely destroyed, but Onya and Ganene were finally able to trap and capture Volusian. They decided simple execution wasn\u2019t a great enough punishment for what he had done, and so he was killed and cursed into the state you found him. Without his assistance, the Yew Land\u2019s enemies backed off and made peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, still a bit stunned, \u201cthat certainly explains why he hated the Yew Land and Varia so much. I can\u2019t say I approve of his actions, but it is a little sad that in the end, Onya\u2019s line defeated him after all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. Varia met her end,\u201d Dorian pointed out. \u201cSurely that will give him some peace in the Underworld.\u201d Dorian sighed. \u201cThat really was an inelegant way to kill her. That\u2019s what happens when you act in the heat of passion.\u201d</p><p>It may have been inelegant, but it had most certainly saved my life. I didn\u2019t know how long it would have taken him and the others to subdue Varia through other means, and the odds were good that she might have really made our heads explode. I was happy to be alive and have Dorian err on the side of crudeness in accomplishing the task.</p><p>In some ways, the journey home felt longer than the initial one. The conditions were much better\u2014and actually made for faster travel\u2014but we were all anxious and impatient to see how our kingdoms had recovered. Traveling through the blighted lands we\u2019d passed before was actually pretty inspiring. Most had returned to their initial temperatures, facilitating the melting of snow. Of course, that offered another set of problems. Mud and floods became commonplace, and the food situation couldn\u2019t be remedied overnight. When we passed through the Palm Land, I looked at the giant trees with regret. The blight\u2019s end wouldn\u2019t bring them back to life.</p><p>\u201cThose won\u2019t grow back anytime soon,\u201d I murmured regretfully.</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019ll grow back faster than you think,\u201d said Kiyo. \u201cRemember where you\u2019re at.\u201d</p> <p>Around the eighth day of travel, the road shifted and brought us into the Rowan Land. The land sang to me, its energy radiating out to me in a palpable wave that brought me to a halt. I gasped, overwhelmed by that force and life pouring into me. I jumped off the horse and ran off the road, falling to my knees on the muddy ground. I sank my fingers into it, closing my eyes in ecstasy as I felt the land\u2019s welcome.</p><p>I breathed in the air around me, which was back to its typically mild temperature. There was an overwhelming scent of water and dirt, but as a light breeze ruffled my hair, I sensed something else ... the promise of growth and new life. Opening my eyes, I saw little but a dark, muddy landscape, but I could tell the plants and trees were on the verge of making their comeback. Kiyo had been right. I had to remember which world I was in.</p><p>I got to my feet and found the rest of my companions watching me indulgently. Dorian even had a wistful look on his face, no doubt yearning for his own land. \u201cIt\u2019s recovering,\u201d I said. \u201cSlowly but surely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d asked Rurik. \u201cCut across country or follow the road?\u201d</p><p>I understood what he was asking. In the Otherworld\u2019s bizarre layout, it would take us longer to turn off into the Rowan Land and reach my castle. The road would be shorter but would crisscross through other kingdoms. I admit, I just wanted to lose myself in this land but opted for practicality instead.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stick to the road,\u201d I said. \u201cI want to see the Thorn Land if I can.\u201d</p> <p>It was early evening, and we\u2019d have to camp soon, even though all of us were eager to push forward. We traveled as long as the light allowed and finally made camp just over the border of the Oak Land, much to Dorian\u2019s delight. As was the case with me, this wasn\u2019t an ideal spot from which to go to his castle, so he was content to stay overnight with us.</p><p>Honestly, I think it was enough for him just to be home again. I\u2019d never seen him so entranced by something. Usually he was always watching the people around him, always on top of whatever plots were developing. Now, he had eyes only for the land. He paced around, examining the dirt and touching the trees. Whenever he walked away, I saw shoots and buds on the trees. He and I had taken to having bedtime talks near the fire, but I left him alone tonight.</p><p>Kiyo sat beside me as I unfolded my bedroll. \u201cI\u2019ll likely be leaving tomorrow,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe should reach the Willow Land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of surprised you haven\u2019t tried to kill me, now that we\u2019ve ended the blight,\u201d I remarked lightly.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re not the problem anymore, Eugenie. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither are my children.\u201d</p><p>The end of the blight had allowed me to hope I might be seeing Isaac and Ivy soon. Nearly a month had passed, which was huge for infants their age. So much could change, and I yearned to hurry back before I missed much more. After the way Kiyo and I had worked together in the Yew Land, I\u2019d kind of hoped things might improve between us. I hadn\u2019t forgiven him, but it had seemed like we had the potential to establish some sort of civility now. Apparently not.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything at all that would change your mind?\u201d Kiyo asked. \u201cAnything at all to convince you of the danger he represents?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs there anything that would convince you that your son is a real person with the right to live and not some pawn of destiny?\u201d I returned.</p><p>He frowned and wouldn\u2019t meet my eyes. \u201cWe won\u2019t stop looking for them, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be looking forever,\u201d I said.</p><p>Kiyo said no more and left me. Thinking back to when he\u2019d been ensnared by dryads, I couldn\u2019t help but again see Jasmine and Keeli\u2019s reasoning about letting him die. It really would\u2019ve made things simpler. He was Maiwenn\u2019s main contact in the human world. Her search wouldn\u2019t get far without him.</p><p>The next day, he departed from our group, his fox form scurrying off across the muddy landscape of the Willow Land. All the recovering kingdoms had a similar appearance right now, but I knew they\u2019d show their true natures soon.</p><p>Dorian and I split shortly thereafter in the Thorn Land. Even though the land\u2019s song burned within me, I was reluctant to leave him. I suspected he felt the same way, though it was hard to tell with his poker face and gallantries.</p><p>\u201cWell, here we are,\u201d he declared. Alistir and Pagiel were by his side. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to go get my subjects out of trouble, I suppose. Thank you as always for a lovely time. You always arrange the best soirees.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll try to come see you as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>That was unexpected. \u201cI figured you wouldn\u2019t want to leave your land for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t, but you and I still have a lot to discuss. Seeing as you\u2019ll have twice as much work on your hands, it\u2019ll be easier for me to come to you.\u201d I caught his eye and wondered what exactly he wanted to discuss. Maiwenn and the twins were the obvious topic, but I got a sense there might be more.</p><p>Pagiel and Jasmine were equally formal in their parting, but I saw them watch each other longingly. Ah, young love. So much simpler than grown-up love.</p><p>Although, when I saw Shaya and Rurik\u2019s reunion, I had to admit that was a pretty touching example of grown-up love. It had total movie-quality epicness, including them racing into each other\u2019s arms. I tried not to watch, but it was kind of hard not to. I even felt a little misty-eyed, and this time, I couldn\u2019t blame it on hormones since I was well over those.</p><p>Thinking of hormones again brought Isaac and Ivy to mind. I still wanted to go to them, but one look at the state of my kingdoms told me I\u2019d be here for a while. At the very least, I wanted to let Roland know everything had worked out ... but I had no means to, short of traveling to Tucson myself. I certainly didn\u2019t miss Volusian\u2019s biting personality or constant threats to kill me, but he\u2019d had his uses in my service. After his story, I even felt slightly sympathetic. But only slightly. Ganene and Onya had wronged him, but he\u2019d taken out his revenge on innocents. Why, I wondered, did this seem to be such a recurring theme among those I encountered?</p><p>One of the first things I did upon my return to my lands was start arranging those delegations to Varia\u2019s freed kingdoms. We needed food badly, and our copper supply gave us an unharmed currency other blighted kingdoms weren\u2019t lucky enough to have. After meeting the new monarchs, I knew there\u2019d be no more price gouging either. Shaya excelled at organizing this sort of thing. She actually would\u2019ve been a great choice to lead the groups, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to part her and Rurik so soon. I trusted her judgment to find others who were capable.</p><p>Along with the food shortage, we simply had to deal with the aftermath of the blight\u2019s devastation. People were sick. Homes and other structures were damaged. And despite how much we could repair, nothing could make up for the loss of life. Both kingdoms\u2019 populations had suffered, meaning we had less help to rebuild. It was disheartening some days.</p><p>Along with the lands\u2019 natural magic, I also discovered I could speed along the healing and regrowth. Just as I\u2019d seen Dorian healing his oaks, I was able to coax the plants and trees of my kingdoms to grow again. Most of my efforts were focused on the Rowan Land, which contained more food-bearing plant life. In particular, I worked on the cherry trees since they were so plentiful. I sped them through their leaf and flowering phases, and after a few weeks, we began to see the first signs of fruit. Cherries weren\u2019t exactly the most filling food, but they were welcome to everyone after what we\u2019d endured.</p><p>Even though the Thorn Land wasn\u2019t a priority for food production, I still worked to restore some of the plants and trees there. It brought hope to the land\u2019s residents, who had gotten used to their desert kingdom. Each flower that bloomed on a cactus was a sign that we were on our way to recovery, and the land radiated its gratitude to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Healing the vegetation wasn\u2019t easy or fast. I often had to spend a lot of alone time with one tree or plant, and then frequent visits were required to keep aiding each step in the process. One day, I was sitting in an orchard near the Rowan castle, painstakingly encouraging each tree to grow its fruit. The day was sunny, and the grass\u2014which had returned quickly\u2014was green and lush beneath me. There was less birdsong than there used to be, which was a little weird. The animals had been hit as hard as the people, but many assured me that within a year, we could expect our furry and feathered countrymen to replenish their numbers.</p><p>I rested my hand on the bark of a cherry tree, my eyes closed. I felt the pulse of the tree\u2019s life and tried to join it with both myself and the land so that we could lend the tree our strength. A thump in the grass beside me snapped me out of my trance, and I looked down to see a bright red apple in the grass beside me. I smiled and picked it up.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t one of mine,\u201d I said as a familiar shadow fell over me.</p> <p>Dorian eased himself down beside me, sitting cross-legged. He carried an apple of his own and bit into it. He swallowed and smiled back at me. \u201cOur second harvest. I would\u2019ve brought you some from the first, but we needed them too badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve kept these too.\u201d I bit into the apple. It was delicious. \u201cSecond, huh? I\u2019m behind.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at the cherry tree. \u201cYou seem to be doing just fine. Besides, you\u2019ve also had to do twice as much work as me, remember? You\u2019re not overtiring yourself, are you?\u201d</p><p>I leaned back in the grass and swallowed another bite of apple. \u201cNothing I can\u2019t handle. After that crazy journey to the Yew Land, hanging out here with trees all day feels downright lazy.\u201d</p><p>Dorian stretched out beside me so that our shoulders touched. \u201cDo you have plans to go back to the human world? I know you must be burning to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am,\u201d I admitted. \u201cWe\u2019re pushing two months. Two months, Dorian! Isaac and Ivy have to be out of the NICU now. I need them to know who I am. And I need Roland to know I\u2019m okay too. I\u2019m nearing a point where the lands will be okay without me, but then ... well, I\u2019m not sure of my next move. When I last saw Kiyo, he made it clear they weren\u2019t giving up on preventing the prophecy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel pretty confident that Maiwenn\u2019s preoccupied with exactly the same kinds of tasks we are in restoring our lands,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt it. But I also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Kiyo\u2019s out there watching and waiting. If I go to the twins, there\u2019s a good chance I\u2019ll compromise their location.\u201d I sighed. This had been something I\u2019d had a lot of time to think about while tending my lands. \u201cI\u2019m in the same bind as before they were born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot entirely,\u201d said Dorian. \u201cBefore, you were a moving target because you always had to be in multiple places. Now? Your children don\u2019t have to move around. You keep them in one place, and you keep them safe. Go to them and bring them back with you. Put them in a stronghold somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut will they ever have peace?\u201d I asked sadly. \u201cEven if they grow up surrounded in bodyguards, their identities will be known here. There\u2019ll always be people trying to kill them\u2014or at least trying to kill Isaac.\u201d</p><p>Dorian was adamant. \u201cI have no doubt they\u2019ll be powerful once they\u2019re older. They\u2019ll be able to look after themselves. And until then, I swear, I\u2019ll give you half my forces to keep them safe in whatever location you choose.\u201d</p> <p>I turned to him, unable to hide a smile. \u201cHalf? Isn\u2019t that kind of extreme?\u201d</p><p>His eyes, completely serious, studied me for several moments. \u201cNot for you.\u201d</p><p>My smile faded, and I suddenly felt confused. My heart leapt in my chest. \u201cWhy would you do that for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat wouldn\u2019t I do for you?\u201d</p><p>His voice was husky, and he propped himself up so that he could lean over me. I closed my eyes and felt his lips touch mine. It was a sweet kiss, a kiss as warm and lazy as the sunny day around us. It filled my body with a life and light not unlike what I felt from my kingdoms. There was a rightness to the feel of his body against mine, and I wrapped my arms around his neck, entwining my fingers in his hair and drawing him closer. His kiss picked up in intensity, and I welcomed it, parting my lips to taste more of him.</p><p>With as much caution as I\u2019d ever seen Dorian exert in amorous affairs, his hand slid up my shirt and lightly grazed my breast. I gasped and arched my body toward his, giving him more than enough encouragement to grow bolder. He pushed my shirt up altogether and then brought his mouth down to my nipple. I gasped again, my own hands moving toward his pants. After unplanned pregnancy, childbirth, and near-starvation, I hadn\u2019t thought my body would ever feel like this. Now, it was as though none of those things had ever happened. My body was alive again. It wanted him.</p><p>The problem was, I wasn\u2019t sure if I did.</p><p>\u201cNo ... wait ...\u201d With great reluctance, I gently pushed him up. He complied immediately, still hovering over me but halting in his advances. A regretful look came over his face.</p> <p>\u201cToo soon,\u201d he guessed.</p><p>\u201cEh, well, not exactly ... I mean I have no problem doing it,\u201d I said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know where we stand with ... other stuff.\u201d</p><p>He considered this. \u201cI assume we stand in a much better place than before.\u201d</p><p>I almost laughed. \u201cWell, yes, but there are things we need to figure out.\u201d</p><p>Dorian stared at me and brushed hair from my face. \u201cNot me. I already know everything I need to know.\u201d</p><p>I fell into that gaze and felt something start to open in my heart. I began to reach toward him, wanting to kiss him again when\u2014</p><p>\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d</p><p>The perfect, golden moment shattered as I heard voices and running feet. Well, it shattered for me, at least. From the way I had to get out from under him, it was clear that Dorian could have continued kissing through a war zone. I sat up in the grass, dazzled by the sun and my pounding heart and the myriad feelings churning within me. I fixed my shirt and hoped I didn\u2019t look too disheveled. It took my soldiers a moment to find me, since I no longer traveled with a bodyguard at all times. They looked relieved to see me.</p><p>\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d exclaimed the leader, giving me a quick bow. \u201cYou have a visitor. Roland Storm Slayer is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoland!\u201d</p><p>He was walking out across the green toward us, in no haste to keep up with the guards who had heralded his arrival. I ran to him with my arms outstretched and heard Dorian say ruefully, \u201cA man can never compete with a woman\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>Roland lifted me up and spun me around as he returned the hug. His eyes shone, and I actually think he looked more relieved to see me now than he had in Alabama.</p><p>\u201cEugenie, you\u2019re alive,\u201d he said, once he\u2019d set me down. He still kept his arms around me. \u201cWhen so much time went by without any news, I thought ... well, I thought the worst.\u201d He glanced around at the verdant landscape. \u201cI take it you fixed the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d I said happily. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a lot of recovery to do, but things are on the mend. That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t been able to get back to you. Plus, Volusian\u2019s gone\u2014banished\u2014so I couldn\u2019t send a message.\u201d</p><p>That earned me raised eyebrows. \u201cI wondered why I hadn\u2019t heard from him. Though I can\u2019t say I\u2019m disappointed he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Dorian reached us then and gave Roland a nod of greeting. \u201cI agree with you on that,\u201d Dorian said. \u201cThough, as much as I hate acknowledging it, Volusian was the reason we were able to destroy the blight in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d said Roland. \u201cI guess something positive came from that fiend. I knew something had happened here when I saw the boy, but I wasn\u2019t exactly sure if it was good or bad.\u201d</p><p>Roland\u2019s happy expression had dimmed a little, which I couldn\u2019t understand. I didn\u2019t know what his comment had meant either. \u201cThe boy?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThe one I met before. The one who was raiding Tucson and Phoenix.\u201d</p><p>I exchanged puzzled glances with Dorian. \u201cYou mean Pagiel?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s back,\u201d said Roland. \u201cAnd since I knew you took him with you on your quest, I figured either you\u2019d succeeded and freed him up to come back or else failed and forced him to more of the same.\u201d</p><p>For a few moments, I was totally confused. When I was finally able to parse what Roland was saying, I nearly reeled. I was certain I\u2019d misunderstood.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean ... you don\u2019t mean Pagiel\u2019s back in Arizona?\u201d</p><p>Roland nodded. \u201cBack with more people. Back for more raids.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>I immediately turned to Dorian.</p><p>\u201cI know nothing,\u201d he said, quickly guessing my question. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve heard anything about this.\u201d He turned to Roland. \u201cForgive me for any doubts ... but I have to ask: are you certain you saw him?\u201d It was amazing how quickly Dorian had recovered from my romantic mixed signals to dealing with the task at hand. I was reminded of my discussion with Kiyo: no matter the problems between Dorian and me, we always put them aside to work as a team.</p><p>\u201cPositive,\u201d said Roland. \u201cI was on the scene at one of the raids. He\u2019s hard to miss with that hair. The others have made the news, and each time, the footage showed these crazy haboobs that just didn\u2019t look natural. That, and we don\u2019t generally get four of them in two weeks. The boy controls wind and air, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said with dismay.</p><p>Dorian arched an eyebrow. \u201cHaboob? Isn\u2019t that slang for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of sandstorm,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cThey occur all over the world, and Arizona gets them every once in a while. The Thorn Land theoretically could, but I\u2019m too in sync with its weather to let one happen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShortly after our return from the Yew Land, Pagiel left to visit the village he\u2019d grown up in, on the far edge of my kingdom,\u201d said Dorian thoughtfully. \u201cYou knew he lived out there before Ysabel dragged him to my court, right? He was worried that those villagers hadn\u2019t fared as well as the people in my castle during the blight and wanted to help them rebuild. I haven\u2019t heard from him since and just assumed he was preoccupied with the rebuilding.\u201d</p><p>My guards were still hovering around, waiting for orders. I gestured to one of them. \u201cGo find the Lady Jasmine and bring her here.\u201d When he was gone, I turned back to Roland and Dorian. \u201cThere must be some mistake. Pagiel wouldn\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did it before,\u201d pointed out Roland.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, when the land was blighted and his people were starving,\u201d I countered. \u201cEverything\u2019s fixed now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d said Dorian reasonably, \u201cnot everything. None of us are in quite the same shape with food as we were before. My people will be eating leanly for a while, and I assume the same is true with yours.\u201d</p><p>Roland glanced between us. \u201cLeanly enough that the boy might get it into his head to do a little supplementing from the human world?\u201d</p><p>I started to deny it but reconsidered. As Roland had said, Pagiel had done all this before. Maybe the Oak Land wasn\u2019t in the same dire situation, but those Pagiel cared about were still suffering. Pagiel had made it perfectly clear he thought humans were overweight and had too much\u2014which was true to a certain extent. Really, his feelings on the matter had never changed. He\u2019d only stopped his actions because I\u2019d brought him with me to the Yew Land.</p><p>Jasmine joined us shortly thereafter, not looking thrilled that she\u2019d been summoned by a guard. Her face brightened when she saw Roland since he usually brought her little luxuries from the human world.</p> <p>\u201cJasmine, when was the last time you talked to Pagiel?\u201d</p><p>She looked startled by my harsh tone. \u201cUh, I don\u2019t know. Not since we all got back. He was supposed to get in touch but never did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean that?\u201d I demanded. \u201cYou\u2019re telling the truth?\u201d</p><p>Hurt shone on her face, and a bit of that old dark temperament leaked through. As our relationship had grown, we\u2019d established a lot of trust, and me asking a question like that was insulting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said before she could answer. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to accuse you of lying. I just need to be sure you don\u2019t know anything that\u2019s going on with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d she said, looking slightly pacified. A note of bitterness laced her next words. \u201cI wish I had heard from him. I don\u2019t know what his problem is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom the sounds of it,\u201d I said, \u201che may actually have a few problems.\u201d</p><p>We told her what had happened, and I studied her face carefully as she listened. Her shock was genuine; she\u2019d been telling the truth. Unlike me, however, her initial response wasn\u2019t a denial or insistence that there was a mistake.</p><p>\u201cHe talked about it a lot,\u201d she said with dismay. \u201cWhile we were on the road. All about the wealth humans had and how it was our legacy\u2014you know, from when the shining ones walked the earth. He never wanted to hurt anyone, but he didn\u2019t think it was right that we\u2019re denied the surplus in that world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA classic Storm King sympathizer,\u201d mused Dorian. \u201cNo wonder he was so eager to serve you, Eugenie.\u201d</p><p>I made a face, not liking the implications. \u201cHe\u2019s a confused boy, caught up in propaganda and stories of greatness he hears from others. And, unfortunately, he\u2019s also a boy who can easily cross worlds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not bad,\u201d exclaimed Jasmine. \u201cOr evil. Or even ... stupid. He just wants to help people, that\u2019s all. He had to take care of his family growing up, you know. His dad died early, and the only person around to help his mom was that witchy grandmother of theirs. He had to be the man in his family. No one else would do it.\u201d</p><p>Dorian gave her a kind smile. \u201cEasy, there. No one\u2019s doubting Pagiel\u2019s bravery or devotion. I\u2019ve heard a little about his early years too and can understand why he\u2019d have some of these beliefs. That doesn\u2019t make them right, however.\u201d</p><p>I shot Dorian a questioning look. I don\u2019t know if he just didn\u2019t see me or if he was ignoring me, but he kept his attention on Jasmine. Before, Dorian had been rather blas\u00e9 about Pagiel\u2019s raids, and I\u2019d kind of expected more of the same this time. I let it go because honestly, it was kind of nice to have him on my side.</p> <p>\u201cSpeaking of his family life,\u201d I said, \u201cthat\u2019s the place to start. We need to find him, and I have a feeling he\u2019s lying low in whichever world he\u2019s in. Ysabel and Edria might know where he\u2019s at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I know where they\u2019re at since I saw them just before I left,\u201d replied Dorian. His forehead wrinkled with a frown. \u201cWhich brings up the disturbing realization that they\u2019ve probably known about this and weren\u2019t telling me.\u201d Dorian\u2019s seemingly carefree attitude often fooled people into thinking he was a lax ruler. He wasn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t like having his authority undermined or people keeping secrets from him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go back with you to talk to them,\u201d I said. Leaving my kingdoms wasn\u2019t easy, and the only reason I\u2019d imagined doing it had been because of Isaac and Ivy. A trip to the Oak Land to investigate the return of Pagiel\u2019s Robin Hood ways had never been on the table. I turned to Roland. \u201cYou want to go?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou two are better suited for that. I\u2019ll go back and do damage control if they strike again. There\u2019s no real predicting where they\u2019ll be, though, and I\u2019m usually too late. If I do find them ...\u201d He hesitated and studied me carefully. \u201cWhat would you like me to do?\u201d</p><p>I grimaced, but it was a question that had to be addressed. \u201cIdeally, banish them to this world. If something happens ... I mean, if there are innocent human lives in danger ...\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t finish, but Roland gave a curt nod. \u201cUnderstood. I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d</p><p>We all made preparations to leave that day. My kingdoms were back in capable hands, and it was a relatively simple affair to head over to Dorian\u2019s\u2014especially now that I wasn\u2019t under the constant threat of attack. Traveling to the Yew Land had made me a pro at horseback riding, and I felt pretty confident my body had returned to its former state. Thinking of that made me think of making out with Dorian earlier. Yeah. My body was definitely recovered. Watch it, Eugenie, an inner voice warned me. Look what happened the last time you did that. Besides, aren\u2019t you mad at Dorian?</p><p>Watching him sidelong as we traveled, I really didn\u2019t think I was anymore. My feelings for him were muddled, and I was glad that he was too preoccupied with Ysabel and Edria\u2019s deceit to pay much attention to my pensiveness.</p><p>When we arrived, I saw that the Oak Land was well on its way to healing too. Most startling was how green everything was. It was the first time (aside from the blight) that I\u2019d seen Dorian\u2019s land not in the throes of a magical autumn. Instead, all the plants and trees bore the look of late summer, green and bursting with fruit.</p><p>I received a lot of curious glances from his staff as we entered the castle. I was well known to them, and the ups and downs of our alliance and romance had been a source of gossip that rivaled Hollywood starlets. People never knew what to expect when Dorian and I surfaced together. This was no exception.</p><p>He was all business and ordered his guards to bring Pagiel\u2019s family to one of his receiving chambers immediately. Before Dorian left for his own rooms, he gave me a once-over. \u201cDamn. Should have had you bring a dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this?\u201d I asked, gesturing to my jeans and Peter Frampton T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cNothing really,\u201d he said with a small smile. \u201cAs always, I like the view of your legs. But I think it\u2019d be better if we carried the weight of our full royal status when staring down Ysabel and Edria. You, come here.\u201d A servant passed by and immediately came to a halt at Dorian\u2019s command. \u201cTake the Queen of Rowan and Thorn to someone who can dress her properly. Then bring her to the east room when she\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d grumbled Jasmine as she and I followed the servant. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care how I look, apparently.\u201d</p><p>I patted her back. \u201cYou\u2019re already in gentry clothes. Besides, if you want something nicer, I\u2019m sure they can rustle a dress up.\u201d</p><p>We were escorted to a group of maidservants who were all too eager to dress Jasmine and me. I didn\u2019t know if they were in the service of some noblewoman in Dorian\u2019s court or if he just always kept them on hand to beautify women passing through. I decided it wasn\u2019t worth pondering too much.</p><p>I traded my jeans and T-shirt for a long dress with a lace-up V neckline. It had short sleeves, which I preferred to the latest gentry trend in bell sleeves, and was made of a light material perfect for summer. I kept calling the color \u201clightish greenish,\u201d but Jasmine and the maids kept correcting me and saying it was \u201cceladon.\u201d Whatever. My hair was pinned up in a simple bun\u2014nothing like the crazy towers of hair from the Yew Land\u2014and I had to admit the final result was rather queenly. Jasmine wore a similar dress in dark blue.</p><p>Dorian nodded in approval when we were taken to him. \u201cCeladon. Excellent choice.\u201d</p><p>He was also in regal attire. He\u2019d traded his traveling clothes for a robe of black with silver embroidery. His attire usually consisted of pants and linen shirts, paired with rich, flamboyant cloaks. Apparently, he\u2019d been serious about throwing around his royal status.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a badass robe,\u201d I said as I sat down. \u201cDorian, Slayer of Souls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I did tell you I was envious of that nickname,\u201d he said, stretching back in an ornate armchair. \u201cYou two are lovely, as always.\u201d</p><p>I glanced around. \u201cAren\u2019t Ysabel and Edria here yet?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He waved dismissively toward the door. \u201cOh, yes. We found them right away. I just like making them wait. Like I always say, the more you can unsettle someone, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard you say that,\u201d I remarked.</p><p>He flashed me a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m usually practicing it on you, my dear.\u201d Jasmine rolled her eyes, and he turned toward a sentry waiting near the room\u2019s entrance. \u201cAll right. Go fetch them.\u201d</p> <p>The brief levity faded, and dresses and robes suddenly seemed irrelevant compared to what we had to contend with. I couldn\u2019t believe Pagiel was back in the human world. Worse, before Roland had left, he\u2019d told me that Pagiel\u2019s range had actually expanded last time. He\u2019d been spotted in New Mexico too.</p><p>Ysabel and Edria were soon ushered in, with an unhappy-looking Ansonia. Much like before, I got the impression she\u2019d been dragged along against her will. Her mother and grandmother displayed an interesting mix of emotions. Irritation, fear, and ... a trace of guilt.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it,\u201d I said, not even letting Dorian start whatever grand, intimidating speech he had planned. \u201cYou guys do know. You\u2019ve known for a while.\u201d</p><p>Ysabel gave me a tight smile. Her lips were painted as red as her hair today. \u201cI beg your pardon? I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d The fact that she was being polite convinced me even more that she was lying.</p><p>\u201cBefore you say another word,\u201d said Dorian, with a terrifying look I\u2019d rarely seen him wear, \u201cyou will show the proper respect to me and Queen Eugenie. The lot of you have gotten lazy and disrespectful in your time here, and you\u2019ll be lucky if I just turn you out and don\u2019t imprison you for treason.\u201d</p> <p>Ysabel\u2019s smile vanished, and she and the others quickly dropped into the lowest, most respectful curtsies I\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d said Edria. \u201cI don\u2019t understand this talk of treason. We are your most loyal subjects, and you need only ask us to serve.\u201d</p><p>Dorian rose to his feet and stormed over to Edria, leaning only a few inches from her face. \u201cIf you were my \u2018most loyal servant,\u2019 you would\u2019ve told me immediately that Pagiel had resumed raiding humans! Now. Where is he? And I warn you, I\u2019ll know if you lie, so save yourselves while you can.\u201d</p><p>Ansonia was guileless and wide-eyed and probably would have spilled whatever she knew then and there. Ysabel and Edria were a different story, and I could practically see the wheels spinning in their heads as they tried to figure out what strategy would get them in the least trouble.</p><p>\u201cWe thought Your Majesty approved of such actions,\u201d said Ysabel at last, apparently deciding truth mingled with faux ignorance was the way to go. \u201cAfter all, you\u2019ve always spoken out in favor of Storm King\u2019s prophecy. We didn\u2019t tell you, simply because we thought it didn\u2019t matter. We certainly weren\u2019t trying to hide anything.\u201d</p><p>Dorian had backed off and returned to his chair. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s all there was to it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou never answered the other question,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cWhere is Pagiel now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d Belatedly, Ysabel added, \u201cYour Majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYsabel ...\u201d warned Dorian.</p><p>She blanched. \u201cIt\u2019s the truth, sire. We\u2019ve hardly seen him since he returned from the Yew Land. He comes back every so often from the human world to distribute his goods\u2014only to those in need, I assure you\u2014but otherwise, I don\u2019t know where he stays. Perhaps here, perhaps there.\u201d</p><p>I weighed the truth in her words and knew Dorian was doing the same. Studying all their faces, I actually believed Ysabel was being honest. She really didn\u2019t know where Pagiel was. Perhaps that was intentional on his part. Plausible deniability.</p><p>Dorian\u2019s voice was very, very quiet when he spoke, which added a surprisingly menacing feel. \u201cIf he makes contact, you are to let me know immediately. If he actually surfaces, you will alert my guards and restrain him until they can seize him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRestrain him?\u201d exclaimed Ysabel. \u201cHe\u2019s my son! And to be frank ... I\u2019m not sure any of us could restrain him. He ... he\u2019s far more powerful than we are, Your Majesty.\u201d She actually sounded uneasy about that.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t have believed her if I hadn\u2019t seen Pagiel in action myself. He\u2019d grown much stronger in the time I\u2019d known him, partially thanks to me since I\u2019d helped him better his magic in our travels. I hadn\u2019t asked Roland much about the dust storms in Arizona, but I knew how large that type could grow. That was serious magic.</p> <p>\u201cNonetheless,\u201d said Dorian, \u201cyou will do what you can. Is this understood?\u201d</p><p>Ysabel and Ansonia murmured assent. Edria cleared her throat. \u201cIt is understood, Your Majesty ... but begging your pardon, may I ask why this is so troubling to you? What do you care for humans? You know they took our world. They have much while we have little. Pagiel is only doing what many\u2014including yourself\u2014think we deserve. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything wrong with it, so I\u2019m just having trouble understanding your commands, sire.\u201d</p><p>Dorian hesitated only a moment before answering, his eyes flicking briefly to me. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to understand my commands. You simply need to obey them. Now. Is there anything else that you have to tell us about Pagiel\u2014aside from your justifications? Any idea of his plans? Who his followers are?\u201d</p><p>They swore they knew nothing of his plans but did give us a list of several accomplices. Dorian dispatched a guard to find them, though none of us were optimistic about the success of that. After a few more threats and warnings, he sent the family away. Once we were alone again, his fierce countenance faded and he leaned back with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cBy the gods,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhat a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnsonia knows something,\u201d said Jasmine. It was the first time she\u2019d spoken since before the audience. \u201cI can see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe definitely looked scared out of her mind,\u201d I agreed. \u201cNo surprise with that group. They sure do push her around a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that,\u201d Jasmine said. \u201cI swear, there was something she wasn\u2019t telling us. I have really good intuition, you know.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t known that but didn\u2019t push it. \u201cI can believe that she doesn\u2019t know where Pagiel is,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s our biggest issue right now. I\u2019ll go back to Tucson tomorrow and see what I can uncover there. You want to go?\u201d</p><p>Jasmine shook her head, still lost in her own thoughts. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe. I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>Dorian could hardly resist the opportunity to show us off at dinner. We were gentry celebrities and dressed up to boot. Dinnertime at his castle was always a huge affair, a big party in the dining hall. His court liked the novelty of having other royalty around and was too excited by their own boisterous celebrating to notice the three of us just weren\u2019t into the festive atmosphere. Jasmine left early, and Dorian and I followed shortly thereafter, going to his rooms so we could debrief the Pagiel situation in private.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go with me, do you?\u201d I asked him, settling down at a little table. I was reminded of that dinner he\u2019d arranged for me ages ago, the one with the Milky Way cake.</p><p>He poured wine for both of us, the first alcohol I\u2019d had since the twins. \u201cIn theory, yes. But I\u2019m not too proud to admit I can\u2019t function in that world as efficiently as I\u2019d like.\u201d Dorian was strong enough to cross over intact, but he suffered the same adverse reactions to technology as most gentry. \u201cI trust you and Roland can deal with the situation initially. I\u2019ll deal with Pagiel when you get him back here.\u201d</p><p>I sipped the wine. It was fruity and strong, reminding me that I should probably exercise caution since I was out of practice. Then again, if ever there was a time to drink, it was now. \u201cWhy are you helping me?\u201d I asked after taking another gulp. \u201cI mean, I know you help me all the time, but Edria had a point. Why are you helping me with this? You\u2019ve never had any qualms about invading the human world. You still call Isaac Thundro and talk about him conquering humanity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThundro really is an excellent name.\u201d Dorian drank some of his own wine, composing his thoughts. \u201cAs for the why? It\u2019s simple. You don\u2019t want Pagiel raiding that world.\u201d</p><p>I waited for more. Nothing came. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat more is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just ... it\u2019s just hard for me to believe.\u201d I downed my glass of wine, hoping to hide how flustered I felt. I actually could feel the start of a buzz, driving home that I really had lost my tolerance. I used to take down half bottles of tequila. With as confused as I was, the buzz was welcome. Once, Dorian offering to do something for me would have made me suspicious of ulterior motives. Now, I wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>Dorian set down his goblet and walked over to me, surprising me by kneeling so that he looked up at my face. \u201cI told you earlier. What wouldn\u2019t I do for you? I don\u2019t know what else I can say to convince you. I\u2019ve tried to make amends for the Iron Crown, Eugenie. I guess I\u2019ve failed.\u201d</p><p>My heart lurched, and I sank to the ground beside him. I caught hold of his hands. \u201cNo, you haven\u2019t. It\u2019s not your problem anymore. It\u2019s mine. I\u2019m the one who has to get over the past and start trusting again.\u201d</p><p>He ran his fingers over mine. \u201cWith everything that\u2019s happened to you, I don\u2019t blame you for not trusting anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust lots of people,\u201d I said. A memory of this afternoon came to me, and traitorous lust coursed through my body. \u201cIncluding you.\u201d</p><p>I brought my lips to his and was flooded with that warmth and sweetness from earlier, that sense that Dorian and I belonged together. He wrapped his arms around me and pulled me so that I practically sat on his lap. I increased the intensity of the kiss, nipping his lip with my teeth. He responded in kind, reaching up to grab my hair and jerk my head back so that he could bring his hungry mouth down to my throat. I wondered if I\u2019d have marks there tomorrow but didn\u2019t really care one way or another. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His other hand slid up to the bodice of my dress, deftly undoing the laces. He pulled back the fabric, exposing a breast, and brought his mouth down to it, finishing what he\u2019d started this afternoon. I cried out as his teeth and tongue played with my nipple and shifted so that I sat up right on my knees and gave him better access. He freed the other breast and sucked on it while also attempting to hike up the dress\u2019s skirt. I tried to pull him on top of me and lie back on the floor, but he stopped me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he gasped out. \u201cNot here. I need to take you to ... somewhere else ... the bed or something... .\u201d He started to get up, and I pushed him down.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, wrapping my arms around his neck. \u201cRight here. Right now. Just like it used to be.\u201d I don\u2019t know what urgency drove me. Maybe it was the wine. Maybe it was the fear of another interruption like we\u2019d had earlier. Maybe it was just the constant threats I seemed to face that made me want to grasp on to this moment before it could slip away. Or maybe I just hadn\u2019t had sex in too long.</p> <p>He studied me for a moment, and I thought he might refuse. Then, he made his decision and came forward to kiss me even harder than before. His body pushed me down so that my back was on the floor. That ridiculous \u201cslayer\u201d robe turned out to be pretty easy to get off, and so help me, he was completely naked underneath. He pushed my skirt up over my hips and tsked when he saw I had underwear on. This had been a longtime debate between us, seeing as gentry women rarely wore any with dresses.</p><p>He quickly took mine off and then lowered his body on top of me. His hands caught hold of my wrists, pinning me to the floor with the same domination he\u2019d always shown in bed. A moment later, without further warning, he was in me, just as hard and long as I remembered. I let out a small cry of surprise, a cry he muffled with a kiss. My body seemed startled at first, seeing as it hadn\u2019t had a lot of action in a while. It didn\u2019t take long to recover, particularly since I was wetter than I\u2019d expected.</p><p>He held me down and thrust himself in and out of me, awakening the desire we\u2019d once shared. I grew lost in it, and soon it was as though no time had passed at all between us. I think he would\u2019ve gone slow and easy if I had asked. I didn\u2019t. I urged him on to take me harder and not hold back. My body reveled in it, loving the feel of him in me. I arched up when I finally came, and he pushed me back down, thrusting harder still as the orgasm wracked my body. He came almost immediately after, his face exquisite in the throes of ecstasy. I had a feeling it had taken every ounce of control he had to wait for my climax.</p><p>He collapsed down on me when he was done, panting and sweaty. I pulled him to me, running a hand over that brilliant, fiery hair. In the afterglow, lying half dressed on the floor seemed a little ridiculous\u2014but only a little. I tried to think of something funny to say, but my brain was lazy and tired with bliss and affection.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I might have just been used,\u201d he said with amusement. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I mind.\u201d It was a fair point, considering my earlier talk about not knowing where we stood.</p> <p>A knock at the door interrupted any response I might have made. Dorian groaned and nuzzled against my breast. \u201cIgnore it.\u201d</p><p>The knock sounded again, this time more urgently. When the knock digressed to what was obviously kicking at the door, I suggested that maybe Dorian should answer it after all.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a servant,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd hey, at least they waited until after we were done.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, he got up and put the robe back on. I managed to do the same with my dress as he walked to the door, though anyone with a sharp eye would guess what had been going on. At least the gentry didn\u2019t judge much.</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d he said when he opened the door. \u201cVery unexpected.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine and Ansonia stood there. Ansonia\u2019s face looked as scared as before, but it was Jasmine\u2019s that truly alarmed me. She was so pale, so terribly distraught that I thought she was going to pass out. I jumped up and hurried over to them.</p> <p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, sit down,\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Are you okay?\u201d There was no water in sight, so I poured two glasses of wine, figuring underage drinking was better than nothing.</p><p>Jasmine took a sip, though hardly seemed aware of it. There was a robotic quality to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d I repeated. \u201cJasmine, talk to me. One of you, say something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send for a healer,\u201d said Dorian.</p><p>That seemed to wake Jasmine up. \u201cNo, wait. That\u2019s not\u2014that\u2019s not the problem. I\u2019m just ...\u201d She shook her head and drank more wine. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think. Ansonia, tell them. You have to tell them.\u201d</p><p>Ansonia regarded us with big scared eyes that were a lovely shade of gray-blue, almost the same as Jasmine\u2019s. \u201cDo you know where Pagiel is?\u201d I asked hopefully.</p><p>Ansonia shook her head. Her hands trembled so much that I thought she\u2019d spill the wine, so I took the glass from her.</p><p>\u201cYou have to tell them,\u201d Jasmine urged. \u201cThey have to know.\u201d</p> <p>Ansonia opened her mouth to speak, but nothing came out. A few moments later, she tried again. \u201cA ... a few days ago, I overheard Mother and Grandmother talking at night. They thought I was asleep. They\u2014they were talking about Pagiel and his raids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d I muttered. \u201cThey do know where he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no.\u201d Ansonia shook her head. \u201cThey don\u2019t. Truly. None of us do. But they were talking about how they\u2019d been expecting this from him but never thought it would happen so soon. Grandmother said it wasn\u2019t the right way, that he needed to go in with a real army and that he was acting without even realizing what he was doing. Then they started talking about you too, Your Majesty.\u201d Those nervous eyes flicked to Dorian. \u201cAbout whether you\u2019d support him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSupport the raids?\u201d asked Dorian, puzzled. \u201cThey know I don\u2019t. It\u2019s why they didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, support Pagiel. Fulfilling Grandfather\u2019s legacy.\u201d</p><p>I tried to dredge up what I knew about their family, vaguely remembering how Ysabel\u2019s father had run out on her and Edria. \u201cWhat legacy?\u201d</p><p>Ansonia swallowed. \u201cI swear, I never knew! I never knew who he was! Neither did Pagiel. He still doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine had recovered enough to no longer have patience for the length of this story. \u201cDamn it, just spit it out!\u201d Not waiting for a response, she turned to me and Dorian. \u201cYsabel\u2019s dad was Storm King. Our dad. Edria\u2019s been hiding it this whole time.\u201d</p><p>I could only stare. Even Dorian was speechless.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d said Jasmine. \u201cYou aren\u2019t the oldest, Eugenie! Ysabel is. And Pagiel is Storm King\u2019s first grandson.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>There were only a handful of moments in my life where my world had been so irrevocably altered that time stood still and I was trapped in my own shock. I could count those times on one hand. Discovering I was pregnant had been one such moment. Another had been learning I was Storm King\u2019s daughter.</p><p>And now ... this.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said at last. \u201cThat can\u2019t be right.\u201d</p><p>There were tears in Ansonia\u2019s eyes. \u201cI heard them,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when I look back ... there were a lot of conversations I never understood, hints of something big between my mother and grandmother. They didn\u2019t make sense ... but now they do. It started, I don\u2019t know ... maybe a year ago. I remember one day my mother was in shock. She wouldn\u2019t speak to anyone. I think that\u2019s when she found out. I don\u2019t think Grandmother told her until then.\u201d</p><p>Dorian pulled up one of the chairs and sat down. He still looked stunned, but it was fading as his quick mind began analyzing everything. He picked up the wine I\u2019d snatched from Ansonia and took a gulp. \u201cThe whole family works weather. Or at least wind and air. Ysabel, Pagiel ... you?\u201d</p><p>Ansonia nodded at the query. \u201cBut not as strongly as them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may not mean much,\u201d I said. \u201cMagic isn\u2019t always passed down in families.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot always,\u201d Dorian agreed. \u201cBut often. And certainly in Storm King\u2019s line, if you and Jasmine are any indication. She got water. Ysabel got air. You were the lucky one to inherit it all, furthering our thoughts that you\u2019d be the heir\u2019s mother. But look ... look at the resemblance. You and Ansonia were mistaken for each other.\u201d</p><p>He was right, I realized with a sickening feeling. Up close, Ansonia and I didn\u2019t look alike, but from a distance we shared similar features. All of us did: me, Jasmine, Ysabel, Pagiel, and Ansonia. I\u2019d thought it was funny that the clinic in Ohio had accepted my siblings so easily. Suddenly, that was no longer a joke.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d I said.</p><p>Dorian\u2019s gaze was far away. \u201cAnd Pagiel\u2019s power has grown\u2014considerably. We haven\u2019t noticed it because of everything else going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my nephew,\u201d said Jasmine in despair. No one paid much attention.</p><p>I closed my eyes as something else occurred to me. \u201cAnd he\u2019s already begun his invasion of the human world. None of us knew it. He doesn\u2019t even know it.\u201d I opened my eyes. \u201cKiyo was right. Prophecies do fulfill themselves in unexpected ways.\u201d</p><p>And speaking of Kiyo ... the most startling thing of all hit me. Isaac and Ivy. If this was all true\u2014and I was beginning to think it was\u2014Isaac wasn\u2019t Storm King\u2019s heir. He wasn\u2019t the first grandson. He really was an innocent, not a conqueror of worlds. He was free of the prophecy. Free to live his life.</p><p>Hope and joy blossomed within me, though I kept it to myself. This revelation was dearer to me than anything else we\u2019d discussed ... but it wasn\u2019t relevant to the larger problem. There would be time to bask in this news later.</p><p>\u201cHis raids just got a lot more serious,\u201d I said. \u201cIf there really is truth to the prophecy ... well, then. What he\u2019s doing has the potential to develop into a lot more.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dorian said nothing, and I wondered what he was thinking. He\u2019d agreed to stopping Pagiel before, as a favor to me. Now that Pagiel\u2019s activities had become something more ... what then? Where did Dorian\u2019s loyalties lie? He\u2019d just professed all this devotion to me, swearing he\u2019d do anything for me. But that was before he\u2019d found out the cause he\u2019d long supported was under way. I couldn\u2019t read him, and that made me nervous. My walls went back up.</p><p>Jasmine used the silence to again interject, \u201cPagiel\u2019s my nephew. Isn\u2019t anyone else freaked out about that? We were practically dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep together?\u201d I asked bluntly.</p> <p>She looked taken aback. \u201cWell, no ... but you know, we like kissed ... and did other stuff... .\u201d</p><p>I decided not to investigate the \u201cother stuff.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI think you\u2019re okay then. Seems like it could be a lot worse.\u201d Jasmine\u2019s expression said she didn\u2019t agree, but she let the matter go.</p><p>The situation escalated after that in a way I never could have imagined. The first order of business was to call in Ysabel and Edria again to verify Ansonia\u2019s story. Dorian put on his tough face, but I think even he was amazed at the casual way Edria talked about having been one of Storm King\u2019s mistresses years ago. She acted as though being at the center of a prophecy was no big deal and she thought Pagiel\u2019s actions were a justified part of his legacy. Ysabel\u2014my sister\u2014stood by her mother\u2019s side and defended her son too ... but I sensed a little uneasiness from her. I remembered Ansonia saying that Ysabel had only recently learned the truth. Despite Ysabel\u2019s love for attention and status, I wondered if perhaps this new development was a bit more than she\u2019d ever wanted.</p><p>Nonetheless, once the cat was out of the bag, Edria had no qualms about spreading the news in the gentry world. Like so much gossip, everyone seemed to know in a very short time. The kingdoms were abuzz. People were shocked to learn that not only had my son been superseded, but that the new heir was already fulfilling his destiny. Divisions that had been quiet in the wake of the blight began to form again, those vehemently against and for Pagiel.</p><p>So, it was no surprise when, a couple days later, Kiyo showed up at Dorian\u2019s castle wanting to speak to us. There was some delay before Dorian agreed. Kiyo\u2019s last visit had involved a spectacular attempt to kill me, and Dorian had consequently banished him with strict orders for the guards on what to do if Kiyo surfaced again. Dorian and I conferred and decided I was safe, though my feelings toward Kiyo hadn\u2019t changed much, even after our Yew Land alliance.</p> <p>\u201cI assume you\u2019re going to do something?\u201d Kiyo said immediately, once we were in a private room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to Tucson today,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to be easy to find, though. From what Roland told me, by the time you hear about one of his raids, he\u2019s already gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find him,\u201d growled Kiyo. \u201cI\u2019ll find him and put an end to this.\u201d</p><p>I felt my eyes widen. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>Kiyo met my gaze levelly. \u201cWhat do you think? We need to stop this before it gets worse. Unless you had other plans.\u201d That was directed to Dorian, the subtext obvious.</p><p>Dorian had been very quiet on his opinions of everything. He\u2019d supported my intentions of finding Pagiel but hadn\u2019t elaborated on what was to be done after the fact.</p> <p>\u201cPagiel doesn\u2019t even realize what he\u2019s doing,\u201d I said. \u201cThere are other ways to stop this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just touched on the problem,\u201d said Kiyo. \u201cHe\u2019s doing something. You berated me over and over about going after your son, about how he was an innocent and had done nothing. Well, here we are. Pagiel\u2019s pretty much a grown man, with a lot of power, and he\u2019s doing exactly what the prophecy said he would do. You can\u2019t claim there\u2019s a chance to change fate now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a chance,\u201d I said stubbornly. \u201cWe aren\u2019t destiny\u2019s pawns. Pagiel can still change the future. He\u2019s smart. He\u2019s compassionate. And I believe he\u2019ll do the right thing. He deserves a chance. I\u2019m certainly not going to kill him outright without talking to him!\u201d</p><p>Nothing Kiyo did should have shocked me anymore, but I was amazed at how lightly he referred to his efforts to hunt down Isaac. No remorse, no apology. No \u201cHey, Eugenie, I guess I was wrong. Sorry about the grief I subjected you to for the better part of a year.\u201d</p><p>Instead, Kiyo\u2019s focus was solely on Pagiel now. \u201cYou talked to him before we went to the Yew Land. That didn\u2019t stop the raids. I really doubt anything you can say or do will change things now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to try,\u201d I said.</p><p>Kiyo shrugged. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to stop you.\u201d</p><p>Dorian stiffened at the subtle threat. \u201cAnd suddenly, I regret offering you hospitality.\u201d</p> <p>Kiyo rose. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll show myself out. I\u2019ve heard all I needed to.\u201d</p><p>He stormed out, eyes flashing with anger. I kind of agreed with Dorian and wished I wasn\u2019t under the bonds of hospitality either. \u201cI could send guards after him, once he clears the entrance,\u201d Dorian remarked.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cDon\u2019t bother. He\u2019ll turn into a fox and slip away before they can do anything. All we can do now is make sure we find Pagiel first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>I eyed him uncertainly, hesitant to speak my mind. \u201cDorian ... when I find him, are we going to have the same goals?\u201d</p><p>He arched an eyebrow. \u201cI think we can both agree we don\u2019t want that kitsune to kill Pagiel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but what about after that? Are you going to help me talk sense into Pagiel or give him an army?\u201d</p><p>Dorian\u2019s expression was still damnably unreadable. He took a long time to answer, which didn\u2019t reassure me. \u201cI told you before, I stand with you and support you. I should think the events of the other night would have convinced you.\u201d</p><p>I almost smiled. \u201cThe events? Mostly that convinced me we can still have good sex.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThat was never in dispute. But I wasn\u2019t the only one who made pledges, Eugenie. You said you trusted me. Do you trust me now?\u201d</p><p>Now I was the one groping for an answer. \u201cI want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do.\u201d</p><p>He started to reach for me, then pulled back. I didn\u2019t know if I was disappointed or relieved. \u201cWhat do you need before you leave?\u201d he asked, back to all business.</p><p>I need you to touch me, I thought, deciding I regretted his reticence after all. I need you to hold me and make me feel like you really do love me more than any prophecy.</p><p>Instead, I matched his serious air. \u201cNothing on the other side. But once we get back ... well. Then I\u2019ll need your help to talk Pagiel down.\u201d</p><p>Jasmine came to Tucson with me. Her reaction surprised me. I\u2019d expected her to go wildly in one direction, either to adamantly support him or else hate him for the familial confusion in their romance. But she adopted neither attitude. She was serious and focused, united with me on talking sense to him.</p><p>The hardest part about being in Tucson was the waiting. I split my time between Roland\u2019s house and my own\u2014the latter delighting Tim and Lara. Jasmine, Roland, and I scoured the news obsessively, waiting for any sign of Pagiel\u2019s band of merry men. The whole time I wondered if it would be futile, if we\u2019d hurry to wherever he was and be left with only a trail of dust. While he had been recently spotted in Arizona, his range also meant he could very well appear in another state. If he showed up in Texas or something, we\u2019d never reach it in time.</p><p>While the grocery store and farmers market thefts didn\u2019t go unnoticed, most of the media attention was on the haboobs. They were big and sensational\u2014and not common here in such great numbers. They were great distractions from the paranormal nature of the robberies and gave rise to all sorts of theories. Thankfully, it was a human trait to find \u201creasonable\u201d explanations for weird events before jumping to crazy ones. Well, kind of. There were those who thought the dramatic sandstorms were a sign of the coming Apocalypse. Others blamed climate change and warned of worse to come. No one had suggested a supernatural invasion.</p><p>I thought a lot about Dorian in my free time as well. I missed him more than I expected and was torn over whether I could trust him. I wanted to. Badly. He seemed so sincere in his change ... but I\u2019d believed him before, only to be deceived. I\u2019d loved him once and wanted to again, but how could you love someone without trust?</p><p>\u201cEugenie!\u201d</p><p>Jasmine\u2019s cry rang through my small house, making me jump. I had been sitting in my bedroom one afternoon, trying to soothe my troubled thoughts by putting together a narwhal jigsaw puzzle. Footsteps came tearing down the hall, and Jasmine appeared in my doorway.</p><p>\u201cEugenie,\u201d she gasped. \u201cOn TV ... a haboob.\u201d</p><p>I ran to the living room nearly as fast as her. I was just in time to see footage of the haboob, as it rolled over a small city south of Phoenix. Even as someone who had done insane things with the weather, I was a little taken aback. The sandstorm was huge, stretching high in the air and spanning nearly forty miles. The cloud rolled into the city, engulfing it. The storms caused little direct damage but could be lethal for drivers suddenly deprived of visibility. The storm was also an excellent cover for a raid.</p><p>\u201cThis is live,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s got to be there right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over an hour away,\u201d she said with dismay. \u201cHe\u2019ll be gone before we get there.\u201d</p><p>My mind raced. \u201cYeah, but gone where?\u201d</p><p>Fishing through my kitchen drawers, I dug out an old map of Arizona that Roland and I had marked up with gates a long time ago. I had most of them memorized but wanted to double-check. I put my finger on the city Pagiel was in and then looked for the closest gates.</p><p>\u201cThe nearest is in Phoenix proper,\u201d I said. \u201cWhether they\u2019re on horseback or foot, they probably aren\u2019t going to risk going through the city. There\u2019s another north of Phoenix that goes to the Willow Land, but they\u2019d have to ride around the city. This one, though ...\u201d I tapped my finger on a spot closer to Tucson but off the main roads. \u201cIt\u2019s remote and easier for them to get to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou think they\u2019ll jump back to the Otherworld?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive. They won\u2019t risk being caught by humans, and we know they give away their goods to the gentry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPagiel\u2019s probably strong enough to jump without a gate,\u201d Jasmine reminded me.</p> <p>\u201cHis followers aren\u2019t,\u201d I said with certainty. \u201cHe\u2019ll go to the gate. And we\u2019ll be waiting for him. We can beat him if we leave now.\u201d This was a chance we weren\u2019t going to get again. Any number of places would have too many gates to choose from or else be too far away.</p><p>Jasmine followed me as I grabbed my car keys and headed for the door. \u201cWhere\u2019s the gate open up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Thorn Land, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBallsy,\u201d she said.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI suppose so. But I think it\u2019s a pretty remote part of the kingdom. Easy for him to hide out and also close to an Oak Land border.\u201d</p> <p>I wanted to double the speed limit but knew a ticket would slow me down. Still, we made good time on the interstate. It was once we had to turn off and head into the desert that we slowed. I watched the clock anxiously, constantly running calculations on how long it would take his posse to get there. The odds seemed in our favor, but I\u2019d learned not to assume anything when it came to the Otherworld.</p><p>We reached the gate, and I parked the car a little ways from it. Pagiel wouldn\u2019t know it was mine, but I didn\u2019t want him getting spooked if he thought humans were in the area. It was late afternoon, in the middle of desert country, and the heat was in full effect. Jasmine and I had had the sense to bring water bottles, but they didn\u2019t stop the sweat from rolling off of us as the sand radiated back the sun\u2019s merciless rays. We found a spot near some saguaro cactuses. They didn\u2019t offer much shade, but they gave us a sheltered view of the gate. Again, I didn\u2019t want our presence to be obvious to Pagiel.</p><p>The afternoon wore on, and I began to doubt myself. Maybe I\u2019d guessed wrong on the gate, especially if Pagiel decided not to risk crossing into one of my kingdoms. Or maybe he\u2019d somehow made better time than I expected and was already gone. Our water was running low, though both Jasmine and I could pull water out of surrounding plants if necessary. I felt bad about that sometimes, but it occasionally had to be done for survival.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d said Jasmine, straightening up. I followed where she was pointing and saw sand being kicked up as a group of horses and riders came into view.</p><p>\u201cUnbelievable,\u201d I said. \u201cThey rode horses from Phoenix. He really is a modern-day Robin Hood.\u201d</p><p>Pagiel was in the lead, easily visible with the way the sun lit up his red hair. There were about a dozen riders with him, which made my heart sink. His initial raids had only contained a handful. A dozen was hardly an army, but it still signified an increase in support. After seeing the passionate reactions back in the Otherworld, I had a feeling he could have recruited more if he wanted. It was a small mercy that the majority of gentry had trouble crossing over to this world.</p> <p>I waited until he was closer but not close enough to cross through the gate. I jumped up and strode forward, Jasmine right beside me.</p><p>\u201cPagiel!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>He flinched in the saddle, and instantly, I felt the wind pick up. It stilled when he saw us, though the wary expression on his face clearly showed he didn\u2019t quite trust us as friends. His riders regarded us with equal caution, and I saw the flash of a few copper blades.</p><p>\u201cYour Majesty? Jasmine?\u201d Pagiel glanced between us. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know,\u201d I said, trying to present an air of peace and calm. \u201cWe need to talk about these raids you\u2019re on. Pagiel, you know they\u2019re not right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans have plenty!\u201d exclaimed one of his followers. \u201cWe\u2019re entitled to reap our share.\u201d</p><p>Pagiel silenced him with a look, and the guy cringed. Somehow, the boy sidekick I\u2019d befriended had become more of a formidable leader than I\u2019d suspected.</p><p>\u201cThe people in my kingdom are hungry,\u201d said Pagiel. \u201cThey are in yours too. Can you honestly say you don\u2019t want to help them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one\u2019s starving anymore,\u201d I argued. \u201cWe\u2019re on rations, yeah, but at least we\u2019re surviving honorably.\u201d</p><p>Pagiel shook his head. \u201cWe talked about this before. Honor doesn\u2019t enter into it\u2014only survival. Besides, isn\u2019t this what I\u2019m supposed to be doing?\u201d</p><p>I winced at the bitterness in his voice. So. He knew. Somehow, I wasn\u2019t surprised. If he\u2019d been back and forth between the worlds in the last few days, word would have gotten to him about his heritage.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t \u2018supposed\u2019 to be doing anything,\u201d I said gently. \u201cYou make your own choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I hear,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard what everyone said when I was back there. They\u2019ve all got plans for me. Even my grandmother does. Why else wouldn\u2019t she have told me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admitted. There was a raw pain on his face that broke my heart. Maybe he\u2019d technically reached manhood by gentry standards, but he was still a boy in many ways. He\u2019d been thrust into a world he wasn\u2019t ready for, had his life irrevocably changed. I knew the feeling, and I ached for him. \u201cLet me help you. Come back with me so we can talk.\u201d</p><p>That set off alarms for him. The wind rose again, whipping my hair around. \u201c\u2018Talk\u2019? I\u2019m not stupid. I know what that means. You\u2019ll put me in iron and lock me away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d I snapped. With barely a thought, I killed his wind magic. He might be strong, but Auntie Eugenie was stronger. He cringed a bit, feeling my magic dwarf his. \u201cI\u2019ll win if we fight, and I don\u2019t want it to come to that. We\u2019re family, Pagiel. And in a lot of ways ... it feels right, you know? You\u2019ve stood by me since we met. I want to do the same for you. I swear to you, I won\u2019t hurt you. Neither will Dorian. We\u2019ll work this out together.\u201d</p><p>Indecision warred on Pagiel\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t know who to trust, and I didn\u2019t blame him. I\u2019d been in that position. In a chaotic world, he\u2019d carved out this outlaw niche for himself, one that at least gave him control of something.</p><p>\u201cPagiel, please,\u201d I said. Panic was building in me. I was afraid it was going to come down to a fight, and I really didn\u2019t want that. \u201cI know what you\u2019re going through. I\u2019ve been fighting the destiny that was allegedly laid out for me too. You are your own master, not some prophecy made before you were born.\u201d</p><p>Pagiel still didn\u2019t respond. It was Jasmine who cracked him. \u201cPagiel, please,\u201d she said, echoing me. \u201cPlease come with us.\u201d</p><p>His gaze flicked to her, and I saw a new pain cross his features. Like her, he\u2019d come to realize the family connection that had killed their romance. Nonetheless, I knew that as he studied her, he still cared about her and probably always would.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said at last. He turned his attention back to me. \u201cI trust you, Eugenie.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time he\u2019d called me by my given name, and I smiled. It was fitting, since we were related. A few of his followers grumbled about this decision, but again, a command from him silenced them. I also noted that a few of them actually looked relieved. I wondered if maybe what had started off as a fun, madcap adventure had become too much for some.</p><p>Pagiel glanced back to where a couple of horses simply carried packs and supplies. \u201cDistribute those goods among everyone so that my aunts can ride,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>His riders jumped to obey. I hoped desperately we could work out all of this because he had so much potential. He was powerful in presence and personality. If he was put on the right path, he could become the kind of leader who did great things in the Otherworld. He could inherit a kingdom someday.</p><p>I hoped my abandoned car would be okay and crossed with Pagiel\u2019s riders into the Otherworld. It wasn\u2019t one of the strongest gates I\u2019d ever used, but none of his party seemed to have difficulty with it. He\u2019d picked a strong group. We reached the Thorn Land and then turned down the road for the Oak Land. As we rode, I occasionally saw the other gentry going through the packs of stolen goods. A few of them started munching on candy bars, like Butterfinger and Heath. Once Pagiel\u2019s stopped his raids, I thought, this will all be funny someday.</p><p>It was still weird seeing the Oak Land so green. The trees held the fruits of both summer and autumn now, and I hoped Pagiel would soon realize there was a lot to love here in the Otherworld. He and his followers didn\u2019t need the human world. This was where they belonged.</p><p>We reached a part of the road that I knew well, a bend that would soon put us in sight of Dorian\u2019s castle. I breathed a sigh of relief. We had done it. We would bring Pagiel home and fix all of this.</p><p>Suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, an arrow zinged by Pagiel, only just barely missing him. It was followed by two more, one of which took one of Pagiel\u2019s riders in the chest. I pulled out my athame and gun. The air swelled around us\u2014a result of both my magic and Pagiel\u2019s\u2014and his riders drew weapons. Shouts from the trees around the road told me we were rapidly being surrounded, but I couldn\u2019t see by whom yet. I looked around frantically, trying to decide how we could best defend ourselves.</p><p>Before I could say anything, Pagiel gestured to me and Jasmine with his sword. \u201cSeize them! Use them as hostages! They\u2019ve led us into an ambush!\u201d</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cThey aren\u2019t with us! I don\u2019t know who they are!\u201d</p><p>Pagiel didn\u2019t seem to hear me. Neither did his followers. A few of them advanced on me, which was pretty foolish on their part. I held out my silver athame in a warding gesture and summoned a sudden rush of dark clouds and flickering lightning above us that was mostly for show. I didn\u2019t want to hurt them, not when a third party was attacking us. The trick worked, and his riders hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your enemy,\u201d I told them. \u201cDeal with me later. Worry about them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Our attackers conveniently chose that moment to finally show themselves. They were a mixed group of warriors, with no real uniformity to their attire. They could have been ordinary brigands, but on a few of them, I caught the flash of a golden willow tree pin. To round out the mix, they\u2019d recruited a few wandering spirits and trolls.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re Maiwenn\u2019s people,\u201d I said to anyone who would listen.</p><p>Finally, one of the riders was smart enough to realize the danger. \u201cThe Willow Queen has sent her assassins to kill our lord!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cAttack! Defend Pagiel!\u201d</p> <p>Many of his followers were his age. So young, I thought sadly. But from the fierce looks on their faces, they were more than willing to defend their leader. I respected that. Me, I didn\u2019t have much concern for Pagiel. He could take care of himself, so I left it to others to fret over him as I charged forward to help thin out the opposition.</p><p>Most of Pagiel\u2019s warriors could handle one-on-one physical or magical combat with the Willow attackers, so I focused on the monsters and spirits. A lot of them I could dispatch with shamanic magic, keeping my distance and ousting them before they even realized what was happening. I traded my athame for my wand. It was a real wand, not the homemade contraption from the Yew Land\u2014though I had kept that as a souvenir.</p><p>Some of the spirits sensed what I was doing and attacked me directly. It occurred to me then that I hadn\u2019t really been involved in a true fight for a while. Despite all the dangers we\u2019d faced on the Yew Land journey, there\u2019d been very few physical confrontations. The closest had been when I freed the monarchs, but even then, my storm magic had kept most of them at bay. I hadn\u2019t gotten down and dirty in a while.</p><p>Like so much after the birth of the twins, I was excited to see that I really had recovered. Part of my fear when pregnant had been that my body was lost to me forever. Time had healed everything, and I was just as fast and effective as I used to be. Sure, I got a few bruises and burns from the spirits (this group had an acidlike touch), but I took it in stride and fought my way through.</p><p>Our group was making good progress when a group of Oak Land warriors, led by Dorian himself, came charging down the road. That pretty much cinched the odds for us, and in a very short time, Maiwenn\u2019s people were either dead or had fled.</p> <p>I wiped sweat off my brow and put away the wand as I rode over to Dorian. Having come at the end, he looked remarkably fresh and energetic, though I saw blood on his sword. \u201cWell, well,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cAmbush. I found Pagiel in Arizona and convinced him to come back with me to see you. Then these guys showed up. Kiyo acted like he\u2019d be hunting Pagiel, but my guess is he knew I\u2019d have better luck and simply had Maiwenn\u2019s forces stake out likely places we\u2019d return.\u201d</p><p>Dorian glanced around, a small frown creasing his features. \u201cWhere is Pagiel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right\u2014\u201d I turned around and stared. There were all of Pagiel\u2019s riders, alive and well. But no Pagiel. \u201cWhere the hell is he?\u201d A moment later, I noticed something else. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jasmine?\u201d</p><p>His disappearance was as much a surprise to his followers as it was to me\u2014well, most of them. A couple exchanged knowing looks, and I could see mild guilt on their faces.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d demanded Dorian. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p> <p>One of them gave a half bow from his saddle. \u201cForgive us, sire. When the attack started, we thought ... well, we thought it was a betrayal.\u201d He shot me an apologetic look. \u201cWe urged Pagiel to leave since we knew he was the target. And ... we, uh, encouraged him to take the Lady Jasmine with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t run away,\u201d added the other guy hotly. \u201cHe\u2019s no coward. He would\u2019ve stayed if not for our insistence.\u201d His friend nodded fiercely.</p><p>I stared in disbelief. \u201cHe took Jasmine as a hostage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart thing to do when you\u2019re scared and think you\u2019ve been set up by those you trust,\u201d muttered Dorian. \u201cI doubt he\u2019ll hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d better not!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cHow\u2019d he even subdue her? She\u2019s strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s stronger,\u201d Dorian reminded me. He turned toward Pagiel\u2019s compatriots. \u201cI trust you\u2019re convinced we\u2019re on his side now. Which way did he go?\u201d</p><p>They hesitated only a moment. \u201cI believe he cut across the woods, Your Majesty,\u201d one said, pointing. \u201cI think that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s the way you and I will go,\u201d Dorian told me. \u201cNonetheless, we can\u2019t be certain he didn\u2019t change course. The wounded will go to my castle. The rest will split up and fan out in other directions to find him. If you do, convince him of our support and bring him back.\u201d He gave a sharp look to those gathered. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p> <p>There were meek murmurs of agreement. They might support Pagiel, but most were Oak Land subjects. Dorian was impressive, and it was hard for them to refuse him.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d I muttered, once Dorian and I had split from the others. \u201cAnd damn me for not thinking Maiwenn and Kiyo might do something like this. I should\u2019ve known they wouldn\u2019t take the proactive approach. They\u2019re riding off of our success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they were proactive enough in setting up these ambushes,\u201d Dorian pointed out. \u201cI\u2019m guessing similar parties are waiting elsewhere on our borders. This group got lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot lucky enough,\u201d I realized. \u201cKiyo and Maiwenn themselves weren\u2019t here. They were only guessing at which group might catch Pagiel on his return.\u201d</p><p>Dorian nodded agreement. \u201cTheir presence would have added an extra complication. Ah, this is promising.\u201d He stopped and pointed to where some grass and bushes had been recently trampled.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have even noticed that.\u201d</p><p>He flashed me a grin. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here. An excellent hunter of all manner of difficult prey.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes at the double entendre, and we continued on. Joking aside, Dorian did have a good tracker\u2019s eye for small signs of Pagiel\u2019s passing. And, the farther we journeyed, I began to notice some signs of my own.</p><p>\u201cThe air\u2019s not natural through here,\u201d I said, for lack of a better description. \u201cIt\u2019s faint, like residual effects, but magic\u2019s altered it recently.\u201d</p><p>Dorian gave me a concerned look. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s a trap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, after a moment\u2019s consideration. \u201cNot nearly strong enough. If I had to guess ... it\u2019s probably part of what he used to carry Jasmine off. Even if he\u2019s stronger, she wouldn\u2019t be easy to just slip out of there. Air can be used for binding, if you know the right tricks. You can almost create a kind of \u2018air rope\u2019 or\u2014in extreme cases\u2014cut off someone\u2019s breathing enough to make them compliant. I really hope it hasn\u2019t come to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, like I said, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d hurt her. I think she was just an easy choice, one he thought would hold you off.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, knowing that he was right. Even at a brisk pace, it seemed unlikely we\u2019d catch up with Pagiel anytime soon. He\u2019d undoubtedly taken off as fast as he could to avoid pursuit. Our one stroke of luck came when we found Jasmine\u2019s horse nibbling on some grass.</p><p>\u201cToo difficult to bind her and force her on her own horse,\u201d I guessed. \u201cHe must have just pulled her onto his.\u201d</p><p>Dorian\u2019s eyes were aglow the thrill of the hunt. \u201cThis will slow him. It\u2019s our chance to catch up.\u201d</p><p>We continued off at that same fast pace for a couple more hours, hoping we could take advantage of them riding double. The residual air magic grew stronger and stronger, giving me hope, until we finally emerged into a clearing and found Pagiel and Jasmine sitting on logs. He jumped up when he saw us.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come closer,\u201d he warned. \u201cI ... I\u2019ve got her.\u201d</p><p>There was a tremulous note in his voice, backing up Dorian\u2019s assertion that Pagiel would have trouble hurting her. Studying Jasmine, I saw that she sat nearly immobile, her arms held tightly at her side. I\u2019d been right as well. She was bound with ropes of air. Meanwhile, the wind around him stirred.</p><p>\u201cPagiel, I told you before\u2014you won\u2019t win in a fight. Especially against the two of us,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease let her go. I know you care about her and don\u2019t want to hurt her.\u201d</p><p>The earlier pain and confusion returned to Pagiel\u2019s face. \u201cYou lied to me. You arranged the ambush.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIf you\u2019d stuck around, you would have seen that they were Maiwenn\u2019s people. We got rid of them. Your riders put up a great fight. They\u2019re really loyal to you and fought for your honor, even with you not there.\u201d</p><p>It was a subtle dig. I didn\u2019t actually blame him for leaving but knew it troubled him. If he was confused enough, I hoped he would come back with us and listen to reason.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t trust you,\u201d Pagiel said. \u201cI can\u2019t trust anyone. Even those who claim to support me ... they ask so much, more than I\u2019m ready for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPagiel,\u201d said Dorian gently. \u201cHave I ever given you reason to doubt me? Haven\u2019t I always been there for your family?\u201d</p><p>Pagiel wouldn\u2019t meet his eyes. \u201cYes, sire. Once I would have trusted you implicitly, but now ... now I know your loyalties are with her. I don\u2019t question your choice. It\u2019s your right. But it also means I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ll always act in my interest.\u201d He sighed and then looked up with a grim and unhappy resolve on his face. \u201cForgive me,\u201d he said.</p><p>That was my only warning. He wove his spell too quickly, more so than I would have imagined possible. A forest hardly provides the right conditions for a haboob, but he created a complex wind pattern that was nearly the same. And it was strong. Dirt flew up from the ground. Trees were ripped up. We were affected as well, blown backward and forced to scramble for our footing. I caught hold of a tree whose roots were still holding it strong and managed to keep myself upright. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pagiel used the diversion to flee. I couldn\u2019t address him right away because I devoted all my energy to stopping the maelstrom he\u2019d created. My magical senses burned, and I could detect every thread of magic, every molecule in the air around us. The magic was a mirror of my own, courtesy of our shared genes. I matched it, answering each glimmer of the magic with a nullifying force. It was a complex process, like trying to unravel a tapestry. I hated the delay but needed to undo this magic before it killed me, Jasmine, and Dorian. When I finished and the world stilled, I glanced around, expecting to find Pagiel gone.</p><p>Instead, I found him encased in a prison of earth and stone that had risen up from the ground, cocooning him up to his neck. I sensed him pulling his magic to him, probably in an effort to blast Dorian\u2019s handiwork away. I quickly slammed up walls of air, turning the air pressure up to crazy heights that were uncomfortable for the rest of us but ensured Pagiel wouldn\u2019t bust out anytime soon.</p><p>Pagiel fixed his eyes on Dorian. \u201cYour Majesty. Please let me go. You said you would help me!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am,\u201d said Dorian, a hard expression on his face. \u201cI could easily keep building this structure until you suffocated. I don\u2019t want that. I want you alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen free me,\u201d Pagiel begged. \u201cYou always supported the legacy in my family. Will you really drag me back like a prisoner?\u201d</p><p>Dorian hesitated long enough to glance briefly at me. \u201cThings change. This is the better fate.\u201d</p><p>My heart swelled, and the last piece of fear within me shattered. Dorian had been telling me the truth. He could have easily let Pagiel go, letting him continue on with the prophecy. Instead, Dorian had stood by me. His love for me really was greater than the dreams of conquest he once held.</p><p>My epiphany was short-lived when a giant fox came tearing out of the woods. He leapt straight for Pagiel, jaw open for the boy\u2019s semi-exposed neck. In an instant, all the plants and trees in a huge radius withered and water shot from all directions toward Kiyo. It wasn\u2019t enough to incapacitate him, but it did throw his attack off course. He harmlessly hit the side of the rock formation and was knocked back, skillfully landing a short distance away. He blinked the water out of his eyes and then shook droplets off his muzzle.</p> <p>Jasmine, who had been freed in the earlier storm, was on her feet and allowed the water she\u2019d summoned to fall to the ground. \u201cLet him go, Dorian!\u201d</p><p>It was probably the most conflicted I\u2019d ever seen Dorian. Letting Pagiel go might mean we\u2019d never catch him. Keeping him imprisoned made him an easy target for Kiyo.</p><p>\u201cDo it!\u201d I cried.</p><p>Like that, the walls of rock and earth shattered, giving Pagiel just enough time to dodge Kiyo\u2019s next attack. The boy fell to the ground, but by then, I was back in control. I pulled up the water Jasmine had called, turning it to a mist that swirled in the wind. I moved the whole creation, surrounding Kiyo in a thick cloud he couldn\u2019t see through. A moment later, I felt the wind and air pressure intensify. Pagiel, whom I\u2019d expected to disappear, was still around, adding his magic to mine. Maybe he didn\u2019t trust us, but he also wouldn\u2019t leave us to Kiyo\u2019s attack.</p><p>As the mini windstorm increased, I could sense the pressure closing in on Kiyo. That was Pagiel\u2019s doing too, and I realized there was a very good chance Pagiel would kill Kiyo in the process. In fact, I had no doubt that was Pagiel\u2019s goal. I was still a gray area for Pagiel, but he knew with black-and-white certainty that Kiyo was a threat. I could\u2019ve counteracted the magic but was struck with a dilemma: Should I? After all the problems Kiyo had caused, wouldn\u2019t it be better to be rid of him? And wasn\u2019t it Pagiel\u2019s right to defend himself against an assassin?</p><p>I had once loved Kiyo and had a connection to him. That was a hard thing to overcome, but I daresay he\u2019d done plenty to make it possible.</p> <p>These thoughts flashed through my mind in the blink of an eye. Before I could act, Pagiel fell to the ground, eyes wide. The magic supporting mine abruptly stopped. Pagiel clasped his neck, gasping for air. For a moment, all I could think was that air magic was suffocating him ... except, there was no one who could wield it here except me and him.</p><p>\u201cPagiel!\u201d Jasmine hurried to his side, where he was twitching and flailing on the ground. Still keeping my hold on Kiyo, I joined her and fell to my knees. Pagiel was no longer making a sound, which was a bad sign. He was clearly still desperate for breath, and I could see now that his face and throat were swelling, like some sort of anaphylactic shock.</p><p>I tried to steady him, frantically wondering what I could do. But I possessed no healing magic, no modern EpiPen. His face was turning a weird purplish-pinkish color, and I knew we were losing him.</p><p>\u201cDorian?\u201d I asked. He had joined us and looked down at Pagiel, anguish all over his face.</p><p>\u201cThis is beyond me,\u201d said Dorian. He lifted his head and gazed around the clearing. \u201cThere\u2019s someone else here.\u201d He got back on his feet and began to make the ground ripple and shake, in the hopes of scaring out whomever we couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>But despite his efforts, it was a little too late. Pagiel had stopped struggling for air. Pagiel had stopped struggling altogether.</p><p>Storm King\u2019s heir was dead.</p><p>Chapter 27</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d screamed Jasmine. Tears ran down her face as she shook him. \u201cCan\u2019t we do CPR or something? Use the air! Give him some!\u201d</p><p>I stared mournfully down at the boy. His face and neck were so swollen now that I knew there was no way I could force air into him, not when all the passages leading to his lungs were so blocked. I couldn\u2019t control the body.</p><p>A smooth voice suddenly came from the woods. \u201cI\u2019m right here, Dorian. You might as well stop with the showmanship.\u201d</p><p>Maiwenn appeared, gliding forward in a silvery blue dress that seemed out of place in this scene. Her golden hair cascaded down her back, and she looked like the California girl I always thought of her as. Dorian did stop the earthquake, but I could tell from his rigid stance that he held his magic at the ready. She released a tree she\u2019d been holding onto.</p><p>\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d I asked. \u201cYour magic ... it\u2019s healing magic.\u201d</p><p>She gave a small shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of the same system. My magic understands the way the body works. It\u2019s as easy to hurt as to heal.\u201d</p><p>I was appalled at how casually she could speak about it after what she had done. Dorian had no such qualms. \u201cWill it be easy,\u201d he asked quietly, \u201cto sleep at night knowing you\u2019ve killed an innocent boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was nothing innocent about him,\u201d Maiwenn replied bluntly. \u201cI\u2019ve saved both of our worlds a great deal of trouble. You should be grateful. Now, if you\u2019ll release Kiyo, I\u2019d be much obliged. I\u2019d like to be on our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrateful?\u201d I hissed. \u201cGrateful ? I\u2019ll show you gratitude!\u201d</p><p>In an instant, I pulled the charges in the air together and created a bolt of lightning to send straight toward Maiwenn. Just before I released it, I heard Jasmine scream behind me. I had no idea what had happened, but I was just able to barely divert the lightning in time so that it struck a tree inches from Maiwenn instead. Thunder cracked deafeningly around us, and the tree exploded in a spectacular show of fire and wood. My ears hurt, and Maiwenn\u2019s were probably bleeding from the noise.</p><p>I immediately turned toward Jasmine and saw her writhing on the ground. Her face was contorted in pain. \u201cIt\u2019s like ... pins and needles ... like my body\u2019s on fire... .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d I glared at Maiwenn. Dark clouds rebuilt up above, and the wind swirled restlessly around us. The elements answered my anger. \u201cI should\u2019ve let it hit you! Let her go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You were actually wise to spare me,\u201d Maiwenn said. \u201cI\u2019ve already worked the spell. Her body\u2019s right on the edge of tearing itself apart. Only my control right now keeps it in check. Kill me, and the spell will seize hold with nothing to stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d said Jasmine through clenched teeth. \u201cWhy ... am I ... always ... the hostage?\u201d I watched her worriedly, but thus far, the spell mostly seemed about pain. She didn\u2019t seem in danger of dying as Pagiel had just done\u2014yet.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d continued Maiwenn. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make me ask again. Free Kiyo.\u201d</p><p>Without Pagiel\u2019s added pressure, Kiyo had simply been trapped in my misty whirlwind. Inconvenient, but not lethal. Angry and frustrated\u2014but out of options\u2014I let him go. He was still in giant fox form, his fur soaked in water. His eyes assessed the situation quickly, and then he trotted over to Maiwenn\u2019s side. She rested a hand on his head. He stayed in fox form, and I knew from past experience that the larger the fox, the longer it would take him to switch back.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to leave now,\u201d said Maiwenn. \u201cI can hold on to the spell a fair distance and will nullify it once I feel secure. If I see any sign of you following me before then, I\u2019ll release what\u2019s holding it back. The only good thing that will happen then is that she\u2019ll die quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you become such a monster?\u201d I demanded. It was hard to believe she and I had once been friends and allies. \u201cBoth of you? What you\u2019ve done is worse than anything Pagiel could have accomplished. Even if you escape today, do you really think I\u2019m going to let you get away with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d she asked, with an amusement that made me want to rip her hair out. \u201cDeclare war on my kingdom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly could,\u201d said Dorian coldly. \u201cYou\u2019ve killed one of my subjects within my borders. That\u2019s certainly an act of war by most people\u2019s standards. In fact, you sent a force of armed men on my land just hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut are either of you ready to plunge yourselves into war again? None of us have the resources for that, not after the blight. And I doubt you\u2019ll find many allies, not even from those who supported the prophecy. Pagiel thankfully hadn\u2019t established himself enough for anyone to pursue revenge on his part.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d I said. Around us, the air burned with the rising storm that had responded to my emotions. \u201cThere\u2019s one person who would do it right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo,\u201d said Dorian.</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d gasped Jasmine.</p> <p>Maiwenn smiled again. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d She began to back up, Kiyo at her side. \u201cRemember\u2014any sign that we\u2019re followed, and she dies.\u201d</p><p>The two disappeared into the trees. I caught hold of Jasmine\u2019s hand and gave her as reassuring a smile as I could manage. \u201cIt\u2019ll be over soon.\u201d I glanced up at Dorian, and my smile disappeared. \u201cShe was bluffing, right? Her range can\u2019t be that far. We can go after her once she releases Jasmine. If she does. She\u2019s hardly given us reason to trust her.\u201d</p><p>Dorian brushed some hair out of his face. He looked weary. \u201cNo, but I think she\u2019ll avoid another kill if she can. She had some brave words about how killing Pagiel was nothing, but she knows each offense carries consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPagiel ...\u201d I murmured.</p><p>I looked over at where he lay near Jasmine and felt a sickening sensation in my stomach. I reached out and closed his eyes, then ran a finger over his cheek. It wasn\u2019t fair what she\u2019d done to him. None of this was fair. He was technically older than me in human years, but for all intents and purposes, so much younger. Young and so full of potential. He\u2019d been thrust into a fate he hadn\u2019t asked for, confused by what he wanted and what others expected of him. He\u2019d been killed because of words spoken long before he was born, and now all the wonders he might have done in the world were extinguished.</p> <p>Dorian slipped an arm around me and kissed the side of my head. \u201cI know,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>Jasmine suddenly gasped, like she\u2019d been under water and could only now take a breath. \u201cShit,\u201d she said, examining her arms and legs critically.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d I asked, brushing aside my tears. It only freed up space for more.</p><p>She nodded, but her entire face crumpled when she looked over at Pagiel. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be true. Not really ...\u201d She shook his arm, willing him to wake up, but as the truth slowly dawned on her, she burst into sobs that made my stray tears look like nothing. Moments of true affection had been rare in our relationship, but I knew then that she was young and she needed me and that I would be there for her.</p><p>I wrapped my arms around her, and she cried into my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I told her, stroking her hair. \u201cYou\u2019re okay. Everything\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d I didn\u2019t really know if that was true or not. At the moment, it seemed unlikely. But as I held her, I realized I was grateful that she was alive and still in my life. Her words about \u201calways being the hostage\u201d echoed in my mind, and I met Dorian\u2019s sympathetic eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy loved ones are always used against me,\u201d I said softly. \u201cWhy?\u201d It had been a recurring theme. Varia had used it to keep me in check in the Yew Land. Jasmine had been held hostage twice today. It was again one of those moments where I marveled that I could still control a storm above us and be so helpless in other situations, especially when it came to those I cared about.</p> <p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s what heartless people do,\u201d Dorian said. \u201cThey prey on those who love.\u201d</p><p>Taking Pagiel back to his family was one of the hardest things I\u2019d ever had to do. I couldn\u2019t hold animosity against Ysabel and Edria, not for their bitchy personalities and not even for withholding the truth about Pagiel\u2019s heritage. Their grief was too great, and underneath all their schemes, they were ordinary women who had loved and lost someone. I would\u2019ve wailed and lashed out at the world too if it had been Isaac in Pagiel\u2019s place\u2014which it very well could have been.</p><p>It was understandable that part of their grief would transform to rage. They wanted to blame everyone for his death, me especially. The thing was, I\u2019d already beaten myself up over the events of that day, wondering if I could have done something differently. Dorian talked them down, finally convincing them that Maiwenn was the culprit here. The method of Pagiel\u2019s death, gruesome as it was, was proof of that, at least. Ysabel and Edria demanded war on Maiwenn\u2019s kingdom, but he kept his own counsel on that.</p><p>I kept my own counsel on him. There was a lot to contend with in the aftermath of Pagiel\u2019s death, giving me little time to talk to Dorian. I watched him a lot and found that I missed the time we\u2019d had together. I hadn\u2019t forgotten that he\u2019d stood with me in the end. He\u2019d proven himself time and time again. Now it was up to me.</p><p>Still, the timing proved difficult. We were both always so busy. The most I was able to talk to him was the day I left for Tucson, and even that was short-lived.</p><p>\u201cI have to go back for a while,\u201d I told him. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long. There are a lot of loose ends to tie up.\u201d</p><p>Dorian nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>I glanced away. \u201cI wanted to say ... well, thank you. Thank you for everything, for standing by me. I never should have doubted you. And I know there\u2019s still a lot to figure out\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He cupped my face, forcing me to look at him. \u201cEugenie, Eugenie. I told you before. There\u2019s nothing for me to figure out. I know what I want. I want you. Not just as a bedmate or war ally. I want you with me, always. I want to share the same jokes and look into your eyes when I wake up. I think someday\u2014hopefully sooner rather than later\u2014you\u2019ll want this too. Until then, I\u2019ll be here, waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a light kiss, and that was our good-bye. It left me breathless and continued to haunt me as I returned to Tucson. Even so, I still had plenty of other things to distract me. Mom and Roland and I were making plans about bringing the twins to Tucson, something that filled me with eagerness. I was anxious to see them and had little patience for all the things that needed to be done first.</p><p>Not all of my loose ends were unpleasant, though. Although I was sure Candace and Charles would happily give us all the baby gear they\u2019d acquired, my mom and I still spent a lot of time stocking up on our own. Those moments were some of the most peaceful I\u2019d had, and I would spend ages in stores touching and examining baby clothes, wondering how big Ivy and Isaac had grown.</p><p>I was at an outdoor mall one day with my mom, scoping out cribs. They\u2019d all looked fine to me, but she\u2019d gotten into a lengthy discussion with the salesperson, grilling him on every safety detail. I\u2019d begged out to grab a cup of coffee, promising to return soon. I don\u2019t think either noticed I had left. I found a coffee shop on the other side of the shopping center and had just received my latte when a familiar voice behind me said, \u201cEugenie.\u201d</p><p>I spun around so quickly that half of my coffee sloshed out. Kiyo stood before me.</p><p>The throngs of people around us disappeared, and the focus of my world narrowed down only to him. All the anger and grief I\u2019d felt, as well as watching others cope with their own sorrow these last couple weeks, surged up in me. Maybe Kiyo hadn\u2019t dealt the killing blow, but he might as well have. I couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d even had the audacity to cross my path. I\u2019d figured he was smarter than that.</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d he warned, glancing upward. I was doing the subconscious storm thing again, and a few people had stopped to stare in amazement at the dark clouds that had literally come out of nowhere. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to create a panic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t be the weirdest weather phenomenon that\u2019s happened around here,\u201d I said. \u201cNeither would you being struck by lightning.\u201d</p><p>He smiled without humor. \u201cYou won\u2019t do it, though. Not in this crowd.\u201d</p><p>He was right. I could call lightning with pretty perfect precision, but even so, we were in the thick of humanity, with people brushing past us to get where they needed. I could hit him but might inadvertently hurt someone else along the way. These aren\u2019t even people I know or care about, I thought bitterly. But once again, my hands are tied.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you arranged this,\u201d I said. \u201cWaited for a chance to approach me in public?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, actually. I figured I wouldn\u2019t get a warm reception at one of your castles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou figured right.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cEugenie ... there are a couple things I need to tell you. I debated a long time about whether I should, but ... well, I don\u2019t know. I feel bad about what happened with Pagiel ... and everything else.\u201d</p><p>I had to repress the urge to slap him. \u201cYeah? Maybe you should\u2019ve thought about that before your fucking girlfriend killed him!\u201d My profanity got a few surprised glances from passersby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry it turned out that way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was better for everyone.\u201d</p><p>I started to turn away. \u201cMaybe I have to let you live today, but I don\u2019t have to listen to your \u2018greater good\u2019 bullshit again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, Eugenie\u2014\u201d He grabbed my shoulder. I immediately jerked his hand off but did come to a stop. \u201cPlease. There are two things you have to know.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms over my chest. \u201cHurry up.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cFirst ... your children ... they may still be in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... what? How?\u201d I demanded. \u201cIsaac\u2019s no longer part of the prophecy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaiwenn\u2019s not so sure. She\u2019s afraid that maybe the prophecy will simply roll to Storm King\u2019s next oldest grandson.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t even speak right away. \u201cOut of all the fucked-up things I\u2019ve heard\u2014and believe me, I\u2019ve heard a lot\u2014that has got to take the prize. Do you know how nuts that sounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I felt that way,\u201d he said. There was enough uncertainty in his voice to kill his credibility.</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t feel that way, you\u2019d stand up to her and stop running her errands.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t abandon her. Not yet. We agree on a lot of other things, and I\u2019m not going to go hunting your kids anytime soon. I\u2019m just trying to warn you that others might.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAgain, that means little when you can sit by and still be pals with the woman who very well may hunt them,\u201d I growled. \u201cWhat\u2019s your other \u2018important\u2019 piece of info? Is it just as crazy?\u201d</p><p>Kiyo look distinctly uncomfortable now. \u201cI ... well, it depends. Yes. No. I don\u2019t know.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cEugenie, I should have told you this a long time ago. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t. I mean, I had reasons ... but well, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>I had no patience for this, no matter how pathetic or conflicted of a show he was putting on. \u201cKiyo, I\u2019m tired of hearing about your \u2018reasons\u2019 because they all suck. Just get on with it.\u201d</p> <p>Resolved, he gave a quick nod and rushed forward. \u201cEugenie ... I\u2019m not the father of your children. Dorian is.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>Alabama reminded me a bit of the Oak Land\u2014or rather, the old Oak Land\u2014when my plane touched down. Autumn had come since my last visit, bringing rain at last to the grass and shades of red and gold to the trees. It was beautiful, but I only spared it a brief thought before my mind returned to other, more pressing matters.</p><p>Two weeks had passed since Kiyo found me at the mall. I\u2019d lived those two weeks in a daze, reeling from what he\u2019d told me. I hadn\u2019t believed him at first, of course. I had stared at him in disbelief and then laughed outright. It was hard not to. His words were too ludicrous.</p><p>\u201cOf course you are,\u201d I had said at last. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep with anyone else around that time\u2014I mean, except Dorian. But that was before I took the antibiotics. Then I was with you.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t trade Isaac and Ivy for anything, but it still bothered me that I\u2019d gotten pregnant from the idiotic mistake of mixing antibiotics with birth control pills.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was the total time span there between us?\u201d Kiyo had asked calmly. \u201cAbout a week?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d nodded. \u201cAbout that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough time. Even if you weren\u2019t fertile at that exact moment, you can still conceive shortly thereafter. Find a health book and read up on it.\u201d His lips had quirked. \u201cIt probably mentions antibiotics in the same chapter.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t liked his smirk. \u201cSupposing that\u2019s true, how can you know for certain that it wasn\u2019t you instead of Dorian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well. Because I, uh, had a vasectomy.\u201d</p><p>That had been the moment my life transformed from a fairy tale to a daytime talk show. It wouldn\u2019t have surprised me if the crowd around us had turned into a studio audience and a host with a microphone had appeared, ready to show us paternity results. It was too unreal. Too out there, even for me.</p> <p>Kiyo had told me the story. Shortly after Maiwenn had gotten pregnant, he\u2019d decided to ensure there were no more unplanned pregnancies in his life. This had been particularly important while he was dating me. Our relationship had been pretty serious, and we\u2019d both expected to be together for a long time. As much as he had wanted that then, he still couldn\u2019t risk me accidentally begetting Storm King\u2019s heir.</p><p>\u201cI can dig out medical records if you want,\u201d he\u2019d added. \u201cOr I\u2019m guessing if you just look at the kids, you won\u2019t see much of me.\u201d</p><p>Yes ... I had already noticed that. I\u2019d simply assumed the twins had taken after me, but if Dorian really was their father ... it would be hard to say whose genes were dominant, seeing as we both had red hair and pale complexions.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know which is the craziest part of this,\u201d I\u2019d told Kiyo. \u201cThat you were so adamant about birth control while we were together and never mentioned that you couldn\u2019t have kids or that you let me think you were actually going to kill your own children!\u201d Not that him killing someone else\u2019s children was much better. It was horrible any way you looked at it.</p><p>\u201cI thought ... well, Dorian was already on your side. But I thought\u2014no, I knew\u2014that if he found out they were his, I\u2019d have a much harder time of getting to them.\u201d</p><p>No doubt. Dorian would level a city to keep his children safe. Still, the fact that Kiyo could have been sitting on a lie like this was mind-boggling.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you telling me now?\u201d I had asked. \u201cWhy tell me any of these things?\u201d</p><p>Kiyo had shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do, especially after you helped me on the Yew Land trip. Besides, some of the pressure\u2019s off now that the prophecy\u2019s immediate threat is gone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot according to your pal Maiwenn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And probably not in the eyes of others. Even people who don\u2019t care about the prophecy are still scared of you, Eugenie. Those kids are leverage against you.\u201d</p><p>Kiyo had left shortly after that, disappearing into the throngs of oblivious shoppers. I\u2019d let him go, both because I could do little to him in public and because I was really too stunned to react anyway. When I\u2019d finally recovered enough of myself, I\u2019d immediately sought out a book on pregnancy and learned he\u2019d been telling the truth, that having sex a week before you were fertile could still result in pregnancy. I learned more about eggs and sperm than I\u2019d ever wanted to know, but with my track record, maybe a little education wasn\u2019t so bad.</p><p>And so, here I was, about to see my children at long last. We were pushing nearly three months since my last visit, and some part of me half expected them to be all grown up and on their way to college. I hadn\u2019t told anyone the news about their paternity. I was keeping that close to my heart, unsure what to do with it. It could have a lot of consequences.</p><p>I rented a car and drove out to the country to see Candace and Charles. The little house looked the same, aside from its landscape no longer being dried and burned out. I\u2019d given them a heads-up about my arrival, and they were practically waiting at the door when I arrived. Candace whooped with joy and barreled into me with a huge hug. Even normally reticent Charles embraced me. Evan was with them too, equally welcoming.</p><p>Isaac and Ivy were everything I could have hoped for and more. They were bigger but certainly a long way from college. They looked like the kinds of roly-poly babies you see on TV. No more tubes, no more oxygen masks. Just chubby cheeks and curious eyes that were constantly learning something new about the world. Those eyes made me do a double take. They\u2019d been the dark blue of most newborns back in the NICU. Now, they were still bluish, but I could see hints of green coming in\u2014green like Dorian\u2019s. I almost started crying then and there.</p><p>\u201cLook how much they\u2019ve grown,\u201d said Candace proudly, putting Isaac in my arms. There were no attempts at gender equality in this household. Isaac was in pajamas decorated with rocket ships. Ivy was in a frilly dress. \u201cThe doctors said the early birth might put them behind in developmental milestones, compared to other babies their age. But look\u2014they can practically hold their heads up.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d never thought of holding one\u2019s head up as a milestone, but as Isaac\u2019s little neck muscles fought to accomplish the feat, I saw that it truly was an amazing thing.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not really behind in anything,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe doctors are kind of amazed at how well they\u2019ve turned out.\u201d</p><p>Was that the result of gentry blood? Once they passed out of the dangers of early infancy, gentry were remarkably hardy. It was hard to know for sure what was at work here, but I didn\u2019t care. The twins were healthy and happy, which was all that mattered.</p><p>They hardly left my arms for the rest of the day. I even stepped up to change diapers because I didn\u2019t want to be apart from them. Everything about them was perfect. Every coo, every toe, every breath. Small talk abounded, but always, the discussion wound back to the twins. No one asked where I\u2019d been. It was obvious the Reeds worshipped everything about Isaac and Ivy, and they never tired of telling me even the smallest details about the twins\u2019 lives. I never tired of hearing about them.</p><p>Candace finally convinced me to put them in their cribs later that night. Both had fallen asleep, and she cited some book she\u2019d read about the early stages of infant sleep training. I didn\u2019t follow it all but figured she knew what she was talking about. The twins had matching cribs in a bedroom that had been converted to a full-fledged nursery. There were lambs and rabbits on the walls and pastel colors everywhere.</p><p>I stayed there after she left and watched the twins sleep. Every tiny movement enchanted me. I was so caught up that I didn\u2019t hear Evan enter the nursery until he was standing right behind me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to take off for the night,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI wanted to say good-bye. Will you be around tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back then.\u201d His kind blue eyes drifted over to Ivy\u2019s sleeping form. \u201cPretty amazing, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing doesn\u2019t even cover it,\u201d I said truthfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do now?\u201d he asked. It was his usual easygoing tone, but there was a trace of worry under it. \u201cStill thinking you might stay here? Or will you take them with you?\u201d</p><p>I watched Ivy\u2019s fingers twitch in her sleep and felt an ache in my heart. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI thought when I came back ... well, I thought I had this all figured out. I thought the danger would be gone, but it turns out maybe not.\u201d</p><p>Surprise lit Evan\u2019s features. \u201cIf they\u2019re in trouble, you know we\u2019ll do anything to keep them safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cBelieve me, I know.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s where things got difficult. I\u2019d intended to bring them back to Tucson with me. When I\u2019d finally accepted what Kiyo had told me about Dorian, I\u2019d even begun plans for introducing Ivy and Isaac to their Otherworldly heritage. Then ... as time passed, I began to doubt myself. Kiyo\u2019s words came back to me, about how Maiwenn still thought Isaac might be a potential threat. Worse than that were the insinuations that the twins could be at risk simply from those seeking to make a power play against me.</p><p>I could almost dismiss that last fear. After all, with the Otherworld still recovering from the blight, conquest wasn\u2019t on many people\u2019s minds. And yet ... I knew enough of gentry nature to know some might think it an acceptable risk to take advantage of weaker kingdoms. I also had the haunting examples from recent times of those I loved being used against me. I\u2019d scoffed at Varia\u2019s attempt to blackmail me for the Iron Crown, but what if she\u2019d held Isaac in her arms when she\u2019d made the threat? What if she\u2019d done that weird mind melting on him? Yielding the Iron Crown\u2019s power to her and helping her conquer kingdoms would have seemed like very unimportant things in that moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dorian\u2019s words came back to me, when I\u2019d lamented about those I cared about being used as hostages: That\u2019s what heartless people do. They prey on those who love.</p><p>\u201cI can probably protect them if I take them with me,\u201d I told Evan. \u201cI have lots of ways to keep them safe.\u201d A castle, rings of guards and magic users ... the Otherworld was filled with all sorts of protective means. \u201cBut I\u2019m almost certain they\u2019ll be safer here. I also think they\u2019ll have a more normal life here.\u201d Safety, as I\u2019d found with my pregnancy, had come at a cost. Isaac and Ivy would spend childhoods in the Otherworld tailed by guards. Most royalty did. But did I want that? Here, in obscurity, they could run around outside without shadows looking over them. \u201cHow do you choose as a mother? How do you choose between \u2018probably safe\u2019 and \u2018safer\u2019? It\u2019s really only a tiny difference, but ...\u201d</p><p>\u201c... but you feel like that tiny bit is crucial,\u201d he finished.</p> <p>I nodded and sank down into a rocking chair. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to. I really can\u2019t ignore even the tiniest detail when it comes to their safety.\u201d</p><p>He put his hands in his jeans and strolled over to lean against the wall near me. \u201cYou could visit anytime you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. I\u2019d taken another convoluted path to get here. That would likely be the norm if I left the twins in Huntsville. Not ideal, but worth it. \u201cThese last couple months have been awful, you know. I thought about Isaac and Ivy all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go through that again, especially since we\u2019d be talking about a much longer time.\u201d It could be years before I felt they were safe enough to emerge from this retreat. \u201cAnd yet ... I keep thinking I could make that sacrifice if it\u2019ll help them. It\u2019ll hurt me, no question. And I\u2019ll hate it ... but I can do it. The problem is their father... .\u201d</p> <p>There it was. After the joy of realizing my children hadn\u2019t been fathered by someone who wanted to kill them, a few realities had set in. Dorian wanted children of his own\u2014wanted them fiercely. Part of me wanted to run to him right now and tell him the good news. He would be ecstatic\u2014beyond ecstatic. It would be a dream come true.</p><p>It would also be a dream he would not allow to hide away here in the human world.</p><p>He would want to bring them to the Otherworld\u2014not for any grand schemes, but simply to love them. I\u2019d noted earlier that he would level cities to keep them safe. He would exercise every power he had to protect them in the Otherworld, and I doubted any argument I could make about safety here would win him over. He hadn\u2019t believed that when my safety had been on the line. He wouldn\u2019t accept it for his own children. Once again, probably they would be safe. But if something went wrong, our enemies would then have two powerful monarchs to blackmail.</p><p>I could already foresee the arguments that would come when I told Dorian I was leaving Isaac and Ivy where they were. I doubted he\u2019d have any luck finding them. A search in the human world was difficult enough for someone like Kiyo and nearly impossible for a gentry. But there would be no peace for me. Dorian would never stop trying to get me to tell him where they were. Any attempts at rebuilding our former relationship would always be affected by this, and that hurt me in a different way.</p><p>\u201cIs he a danger to them?\u201d asked Evan.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d It took me a moment to remember I hadn\u2019t elaborated on why the twins\u2019 father was \u201cthe problem.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cAbsolutely not. He would love them. He would do anything for them\u2014except leave them here, even if it\u2019s for the best. He would want them too badly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can understand that,\u201d said Evan earnestly. \u201cYou keep using \u2018would.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s the father.\u201d I sighed. \u201cIf I tell him ... it\u2019ll be the happiest day of his life. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m the only one who suffers from being apart from them. He\u2019ll be in blissful ignorance.\u201d</p><p>Evan shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s an ugly choice.\u201d</p><p>I stared off at the dark window without really seeing it. \u201cNot telling him now eases a lot of problems\u2014except, one of the biggest issues between us has been about the importance of honesty and rebuilding trust. I\u2019m especially always going off on that. What kind of hypocrite would I be to push for that and then keep something like this from him?\u201d</p><p>Evan was silent for a few moments. \u201cSo ... you\u2019re getting back together.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him, only then realizing what my words meant. Evan still wore that everything-is-okay look, but I caught a glimpse of disappointment in his eyes. There\u2019d been no promises between us, but he\u2019d still had his hopes pinned on me when I returned.</p><p>\u201cEvan, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He held up his hand and gave me a kind smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s what you want, and I\u2019m happy for you. It has no effect on what I do for these kids.\u201d</p> <p>I still wanted to apologize but instead held back and respected his wishes. Going on and on about how sorry I was, making excuses ... well, that wouldn\u2019t make him feel better. It would only make me feel better. He would have to process this in his own time.</p><p>\u201cHow long would you keep them from him?\u201d Evan asked, returning to my dilemma.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Years. Maybe until their teens.\u201d I groaned. \u201cGod, that sounds awful just saying that. What kind of person even considers something like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone who loves their children,\u201d he said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cWould he forgive me when he finds out?\u201d I asked bleakly. \u201cWould you? You wouldn\u2019t be happy to find out your girlfriend had been hiding something like this for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Evan agreed. \u201cI\u2019d be pretty upset. But I\u2019d also be overjoyed to see my children healthy, safe, and well.\u201d</p><p>I stood up and paced toward the cribs. \u201cWould that be enough? Would it make up for the lie?\u201d</p><p>He thought about it. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>I looked between the two sleeping forms, and that\u2019s when the tears started. I wasn\u2019t a crier. With Pagiel\u2019s death and even in some of the more hormonal moments of pregnancy, my tears had been pretty minimal. Now, they were an onslaught as all the hurt I\u2019d been holding within me for so long burst out. I cried for Dorian, for the secret I would have to keep from him. I cried for Isaac and Ivy, who would spend a good part of their life never knowing the truth about their parents. And I cried for myself, because I was going to hurt every day I was apart from my children.</p><p>Evan put his arms around me and let me cry into his chest. He didn\u2019t try to tell me everything would be okay, and I was grateful for that.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave them,\u201d I sobbed.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said.</p><p>I sniffed. \u201cI\u2019ve never had to make decisions this hard before ... and believe me, I\u2019ve had to make some pretty tough ones.\u201d</p><p>Evan nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s because they were always about you. Everything changes when someone else\u2019s life is in your hands.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>My kingdoms welcomed me back, both the lands themselves and the people. Everyone was in good spirits. Most of the destruction had been repaired, and increases in both our own crops and those imported from the unblighted kingdoms were making rations less strict. In the Otherworld, the relationship between monarch and land was viewed as a sacred bond. In many ways, people saw their monarch as an extension of the land\u2014which perhaps wasn\u2019t so far off. What it meant was that much of the credit for the land\u2019s rebirth was laid at my feet. I wanted to brush off the praise\u2014particularly since I felt a lot of our success was the result of my clever servants\u2014but I was told it was a futile goal.</p><p>I\u2019d spent a couple joyous\u2014but bittersweet\u2014weeks in Huntsville before a quick stay in Tucson led me back to the Otherworld. I\u2019d left Alabama with a gift from Candace: a baby book with records of early development, pictures, and even tiny locks of the twins\u2019 wispy hair (which definitely looked reddish). Through a system nearly as complicated as my travel there, she promised to send regular pictures for my book so that the twins wouldn\u2019t be strangers when I saw them again. Dorian might not find out about his offspring for a while, but I planned on checking in on them when I could.</p><p>No one mentioned him at all in the Thorn Land, so I finally cracked and brought him up to Shaya while we were inspecting a garden filled with flowering cacti. The mesquite trees were also in bloom, filling the air with a sweet, heady scent. Tucson was heading into winter soon, and while that was a pretty mild season for them, it made me appreciate the Thorn Land\u2019s perpetually perfect climate that much more.</p><p>\u201cHas Dorian, um, asked about me?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been studying a retaining wall with a critical eye and looked up in surprise. \u201cNo, not that I know of. I\u2019ve only seen him once since you left. Someone else asked him about you, though, and he simply said that you had important things to tend to and would return in your own time.\u201d She hesitated, never one to really advise on my personal affairs. \u201cI think ... I think he\u2019s waiting for you, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s waiting for you. He\u2019d told me that before I left. Dorian had laid everything out for me. He\u2019d proved his love and loyalty over and over. I\u2019d told Evan I was getting back together with Dorian. I\u2019d even sort of accepted it in my head. But something inside me kept holding back. I had yet to act and needed to. Dorian had opened his heart to me. It was time for me to answer.</p><p>I skipped protocol and traveled to the Oak Land by myself. My safety might not be an immediate concern anymore, but status said I should have an escort. I liked the alone time, though, and smiled when I saw some of the Oak Land\u2019s trees touched with the fiery hue of autumn. Dorian wasn\u2019t quite ready to let it slip into the season he loved, but it was getting closer.</p><p>As I approached his castle, I spared a brief moment to wonder if I should have worn gentry attire. I was in one of my favorite outfits, jeans and a Def Leppard shirt. No, I decided. This was who I was. I wouldn\u2019t try to create an image that was more than that. Just before entering the castle, however, I did put on a crown he\u2019d once given me. It was a delicate little thing, tiny gold roses and emeralds. I liked it because it was from him and because it wasn\u2019t too showy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I received a warm welcome from the guards and was led outside through one of the back entrances. I expected to find Dorian in one of the many courtyards he spent his time in but was instead taken farther out on the grounds, finally ushered into a small, pretty clearing ringed in the trees that had given the Oak Land its name. Several members of Dorian\u2019s court sat around in the grass on blankets, making a picnic of the sunny day. Their focus was on the clearing\u2019s center, which contained a medium-sized pond. A path of very small stepping stones extended across the water, stopping at about the middle. There, balancing on one foot on the farthest stone, was Muran. He was sweating visibly, but I doubted it was from the heat.</p><p>Dorian stood near the edge like some kind of mad ringmaster, the sunlight setting his long hair ablaze. With an elegant gesture, he made a rock float through the air and settle in the water in front of Muran. The servant\u2014who had been starting to waver\u2014gratefully jumped onto the new rock with his other foot.</p><p>\u201cEugenie, Queen of Rowan and Thorn,\u201d announced the herald.</p> <p>Dorian looked over at me with surprise that quickly turned to joy. It was such a rare outpouring of affection from his normally lazy smile that I felt weak in the knees.</p><p>\u201cMy dear,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re just in time. I was demonstrating the amazing bridge feat we conducted on our journey to the Yew Land. Muran is assisting me.\u201d Another rock landed in front of Muran who immediately jumped on it one-footed.</p><p>It was perhaps one of the more ridiculous things I\u2019d seen Dorian do with Muran\u2014and I\u2019d seen some pretty ridiculous things. I laughed out loud. I was suddenly so happy to see Dorian, I thought my heart would burst. Our life had been filled with so many complications that I hadn\u2019t allowed myself to really feel or acknowledge how I felt. I had loved him for some time, I realized, and wasn\u2019t going to deny my feelings anymore.</p><p>Ignoring propriety, I ran up to him and threw my arms around him. I kissed him hard, a kiss he didn\u2019t hesitate to return with equal ardency. One of his hands rested on my hip, the other on my hair. He pulled me as close as we could possibly get while clothed, and my whole body turned to fire from that kiss. I felt like it would consume me, and I welcomed it.</p><p>Public displays of affection were perfectly normal among the gentry, but I had never made any secret of my disdain for them. I\u2019d always rejected them, no matter how much Dorian tried to coax me. Right now, I really didn\u2019t care who was watching. It was actually kind of a surprise that he was the one who pulled back from the kiss, though his grip on me didn\u2019t lessen at all.</p> <p>\u201cThis,\u201d he said, \u201cmight be the most astonishing thing that\u2019s happened in a while.\u201d</p><p>I gazed up at him, momentarily caught in the green of his eyes that our children were already starting to inherit. \u201cI missed you,\u201d I said simply.</p><p>His lips twisted into a smile. \u201cEven so, I\u2019m not quite sure what I\u2019ve done to deserve a welcome like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat haven\u2019t you done?\u201d I asked, echoing his constant \u201cWhat wouldn\u2019t I do for you?\u201d rhetoricals.</p><p>\u201cUm, Your Majesty ...\u201d</p><p>Muran\u2019s voice was tremulous, and glancing over, I saw he was dangerously close to falling into the water. Dorian studied my face a few moments longer before finally turning to see what his servant wanted. \u201cEh? Oh, that.\u201d With an impatient gesture, Dorian sent a whole set of rocks across the water, completing the path. Muran sprinted across it, sagging with visible relief when he reached the other side. Dorian returned his attention to me.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you were coming back,\u201d he said. \u201cI figured you had a lot to occupy you in the human world.\u201d</p><p>I smiled back. \u201cYup. But I have a lot to occupy me here too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d Dorian traced my cheek and then touched the edge of my crown. \u201cJeans and emeralds. Quite the fashion statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStory of my life,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can give up either world. And I can\u2019t give you up either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course not,\u201d he scoffed, as though I had just said the most absurd thing in the world. \u201cWho could?\u201d</p><p>I silenced any more witty Dorian quips with another kiss. His court sighed happily, as though it were the best thing they\u2019d ever seen. It was certainly one of the best things I\u2019d experienced in a while. My life was split by two worlds, but he kept me whole. Lost in his arms and his kiss, I could see a whole glorious future with him. The secret of Isaac and Ivy burned within me, and I regretted that dishonesty. At the same time, now that I was with him again, I had serious doubts about whether I\u2019d actually be able to keep the truth from him. Dorian was kind of irresistible.</p><p>Whatever decisions I made, however, would be because I chose them. I chose to be with him. I chose to be an Arizona shaman.
