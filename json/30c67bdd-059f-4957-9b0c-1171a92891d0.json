She\u2019d spent the last ninety minutes standing in two-inch heels at a charity art auction in a swanky studio in downtown Chicago. She couldn\u2019t understand how shoes that matched her black dress so beautifully could be this painful. Vanity, thy name is fashion.</p><p>\u201cMy name is spelled with two l\u2019s,\u201d the middle-aged woman, dripping in diamonds, reminded her. \u201cThat\u2019s Michelle, with two l\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Carrie underlined the correct spelling. Michelle, spelled with two l\u2019s, had just spent thirty thousand dollars for the most ridiculous piece of art Carrie had ever seen. True, it was for a good cause, but now she seemed to feel her name needed to be mentioned in the news article Carrie would write for the next edition of the Chicago Herald.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be wonderful to have my husband\u2019s and my picture to go along with your article,\u201d Michelle added. \u201cPerhaps you should take it in front of the painting.\u201d</p><p>Carrie looked over her shoulder at Harry, the photographer who\u2019d accompanied her from the newspaper.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Lloyd and I would want approval of any photograph you choose to publish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Carrie said, doing her best to keep a smile in place. If she didn\u2019t get out of these shoes soon, her feet would be permanently deformed. She wiggled her toes, hoping for relief. Instead they ached even worse.</p><p>Harry, bless his heart, dutifully stepped forward, camera in hand, and flashed two or three photos of the couple posing in front of what might have been a red flower or a painting of a squished tomato or possibly the aftermath of a murder scene. Carrie had yet to decide which. The title of the work didn\u2019t offer a clue. Red. Yes, the painting was in that color, but exactly what it depicted remained a mystery.</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it stunning?\u201d Michelle asked when she noticed Carrie staring at the canvas.</p><p>Carrie tilted her head one way and then another, looking for some clue as to its possible significance. Then, noticing that Michelle, spelled with two l\u2019s, was waiting for her response, she said, \u201cOh, yes, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>Harry didn\u2019t bother to hide his smile, knowing that all Carrie really wanted was to get out of those ridiculous shoes. And to think she\u2019d gotten her journalism degree for this!</p><p>Carrie knew she was fortunate to have a job with such a prestigious newspaper. A professor had pulled a favor and gotten her the interview. Carrie had been stunned when she\u2019d been hired. Surprised and overjoyed.</p><p>Two years later, she was less so. Her assignment was the society page. When she was hired, she\u2019d been told that eventually she\u2019d be able to write meatier pieces, do interviews and human-interest stories. To this point, it hadn\u2019t happened. Carrie felt trapped, frustrated, and underappreciated. She felt her talent was being wasted.</p><p>To make matters worse, her entire family lived in the Pacific Northwest. Carrie had left everything she knew and loved behind, including Steve, her college sweetheart. He\u2019d married less than six months after she took the position in Chicago. It hadn\u2019t taken him long, she noted. The worst part was that Carrie was far too busy reporting on social events to have time for much of a social life herself. She dated occasionally, but she hadn\u2019t found anyone who made her heart race. Dave Schneider, the man she\u2019d been seeing most recently, was more of a friend than a love interest. She supposed after Steve she was a bit hesitant to get involved again. Maybe once she left the Herald and moved home to write for a newspaper in the Seattle area, like she planned, things would be different.</p> <p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>Back inside her condo, Carrie gingerly removed her shoes and sighed with relief.</p><p>This was it. She was done. First thing in the morning she would hand in her two-week notice, sublet her condo, and take her chances in the job market in Seattle. If the managing editor, Nash Jorgen, refused to give her the opportunity to prove she had what it took, then why stay? She refused to be pigeonholed.</p><p>That decided, Carrie limped into her bedroom and fell into bed, tired, frustrated, and determined to make a change.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d argued Sophie Peterson, her closest friend at the newspaper, when Carrie told her of her decision.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m totally serious,\u201d she said as she hobbled to her desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your foot?\u201d Sophie asked, tagging behind her.</p><p>\u201cStupidity. This gorgeous pair of shoes was only available in a half-size smaller than what I normally wear. They were so perfect, and they were buy one pair, get the second half off. I couldn\u2019t resist, but now I\u2019m paying for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCarrie, don\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have no intention of wearing those heels again. I tossed them in a bag for charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that,\u201d Sophie argued. \u201cDon\u2019t hand in your notice! You\u2019re needed here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as a reporter,\u201d Carrie assured her, dumping her purse in her bottom drawer and shucking off her thick winter coat. \u201cSorry, my mind is made up. You and I both know Nash will never give me a decent assignment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re your own worst enemy.\u201d Sophie leaned against the wall that separated their two cubicles and crossed her arms and ankles.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for one thing, you\u2019re the perfect fit for the society page. You\u2019re drop-dead gorgeous, tall, and thin. It doesn\u2019t hurt that you look fabulous in a slinky black dress and a pair of spike heels. Even if I could get my hair to grow that thick, long, and curly without perming the living daylights out of it, Nash would never consider someone like me. It isn\u2019t any wonder he wants you on the job. Give the guy a little credit, will you? He knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf looks are the only criterion\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d Sophie said, cutting her off. \u201cYou\u2019re great with people. All you need to do is bat those baby blues at them and strangers open up to you. It\u2019s a gift, I tell you, a real gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m friendly, but this isn\u2019t the kind of writing I want to do. I\u2019ve got my heart set on being a reporter, a real reporter, writing about real news and interesting people.\u201d In the beginning, Carrie had been flattered by the way people went out of their way to introduce themselves at the events she covered. It didn\u2019t take long for her to recognize that they were looking for her to mention their names in print. What shocked her was the extent people were willing to go in order to be noticed. She was quickly becoming jaded, and this bothered her even more than Nash\u2019s lack of faith in her abilities.</p><p>The holidays were the worst, and while it was only early November, the frenzy had already started. The list of parties Nash assigned her to attend was already mammoth. Halloween decorations were still arranged around her desk, and already there was a Christmas tree in the display window of the department store across the street.</p><p>Determined to stick with her plan, Carrie went directly into Nash Jorgen\u2019s office.</p><p>A veteran newsman, Nash glanced up from his computer screen and glared in her direction. He seemed to sense this wasn\u2019t a social visit. His shoulders rose with a weary sigh. \u201cWhat now?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m handing in my two-week notice.\u201d If she\u2019d been looking for a response, she would have been disappointed.</p><p>He blinked a couple of times, ran his hand down the side of his day-old beard, and asked, \u201cAny particular reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hoped to prove I can be a darn good reporter, but I\u2019ll never get the chance writing anything more than copy for society weddings. You said when you hired me that you\u2019d give me a shot at reporting real news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember what I said. What\u2019s wrong with what you\u2019re writing now? You\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t what I want to write.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? You make the best of it, pay your dues, and in time you\u2019ll get the break you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p>Carrie was tired of waiting. She straightened her shoulders, her resolve tightening. \u201cI know I\u2019m fortunate to work for the Herald. It was a real coup to get this position, but this isn\u2019t the career I wanted. You give me no choice.\u201d She set her letter of resignation on his desk.</p><p>That got Nash\u2019s attention. He swiveled his chair around to look at her once more. His frown darkened, and he ran his hand through his thinning hair. \u201cYou really are serious, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>A chill went down her spine. Nash was actually listening. \u201cYes, I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, then.\u201d He reached across his desk and picked up a hardcover book and handed it to her. \u201cFind Finn Dalton, get an interview, and write me a story I can print.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed hold of the book, not recognizing the author\u2019s name. \u201cAnd if I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, first, there\u2019s a snowball\u2019s chance of you even locating him. Every reporter in the universe is dying to interview him. But if you get lucky and he\u2019s willing to talk and we print the piece, then I\u2019ll take you off the society page.\u201d</p><p>Carrie wavered. He seemed to be offering her a chance, as impossible as it might seem. Now it was up to her to prove herself. She dared not show him how excited she was. \u201cI\u2019ll find him.\u201d</p><p>He snickered as though he found her confidence amusing, and then sobered. He regarded her with the same dark frown he had earlier before a slow, easy smile slid over his harsh features. \u201cI bet you will. Now, listen up\u2014if you get an interview with Finn Dalton, you can have any assignment you want.\u201d</p><p>Taking small steps, Carrie backed out of the office. She pointed at Nash. \u201cI\u2019m holding you to your word.\u201d</p><p>The managing editor was already back to reading his computer screen and didn\u2019t appear to have heard her. It didn\u2019t matter; she\u2019d heard him, and he\u2019d come across loud and clear.</p><p>Once she was out of his office, she examined the book to see the author photo, but couldn\u2019t find one, not even on the inside back flap.</p><p>Walking back to her cubicle, she paused at Sophie\u2019s instead. \u201cYou ever heard of Finn Dalton?\u201d</p><p>Sophie\u2019s eyebrows lifted on her round face. \u201cYou mean you haven\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The book title wasn\u2019t much help. Alone. That told her next to nothing. The jacket revealed a snow-covered landscape with a scattering of stubby trees.</p><p>Sophie shook her head. \u201cHave you been living under a rock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Who is this guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a survivalist who lives alone someplace in the Alaskan wilderness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That was a bit daunting, but Carrie considered herself up to the challenge. She\u2019d been born and raised in Washington State. She\u2019d hoped to join her family for Thanksgiving, but if she needed to use her vacation time to find Finn Dalton, then she was willing to.</p><p>\u201cHis book has been on the bestseller lists for nearly seven months, mostly at the number-one position.\u201d</p><p>Carrie was impressed. \u201cWhat does he write about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the kind of guy you can set loose in the wild with a pack of chewing gum, a pocketknife, and a handkerchief, and by the time you find him he\u2019s built a shelter and a canoe. From what I\u2019ve read, his stories about Alaskan life and survival in the tundra would kink your hair. Well, not that yours needs curling.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This was Sophie\u2019s idea of a joke. Carrie\u2019s wild dark brown curls were the bane of her existence. She tamed them as best she could, but she often found herself the brunt of jokes over her out-of-control hair.</p><p>\u201cNash says he doesn\u2019t give interviews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just doesn\u2019t give interviews\u2014this guy is like a ghost. No one has ever met or even talked to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely his publisher or his editor\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sophie said, cutting her off. \u201cEverything has been done by computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll anyone knows is that he lives near an Alaskan lake somewhere in the vicinity of the Arctic Circle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is it you know so much about this guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, and that\u2019s just it. No one does. The press has gone wild looking for him. Plenty of reporters have tried to track him down, without success. No one knows how to find him, and Finn Dalton doesn\u2019t want to be found. He should have called his book Leave Me Alone. Someone could pass him on the street and never know it was him, and from everything I\u2019ve read, that\u2019s exactly how he likes it.\u201d</p> <p>Intrigued, Carrie flipped through the pages of the book. \u201cNash said I could have any assignment I wanted if I got an interview from Finn Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he did. Nash has been around long enough to know he\u2019s got you in a no-win situation.\u201d</p><p>Carrie glanced up. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m going to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to be a killjoy here, but Carrie, no way will you find this guy. Better reporters than either of us have tried and failed. Every newspaper, magazine, and media outlet is looking to dig up information about him, without success. Finn Dalton doesn\u2019t want to be found.\u201d</p><p>That might be the case, but Carrie refused to give up without even trying. This was far too important to drop just because it was a long shot. \u201cI\u2019m desperate, Sophie.\u201d And really, that said it all. If she was going to have a real career in journalism, she had to find Finn Dalton. Her entire future with the Chicago Herald hung in the balance.</p><p>\u201cI admire your determination,\u201d Sophie murmured, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to hit one dead end after another.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat might be the case.\u201d Carrie was willing to admit to her friend that finding Finn Dalton wouldn\u2019t be easy. \u201cBut I refuse to quit without trying.\u201d She knew Sophie didn\u2019t mean to be negative. \u201cI want this chance, and if it means tracking Finn Dalton into some forsaken tundra, then I will put on my big-girl shoes and go for it.\u201d But not the heels she\u2019d worn last night, that was for sure.</p><p>The first thing Carrie did in her search for Finn Dalton was read the book. Not once, but three times. She underlined everything that gave her a single hint as to his identity.</p><p>For two days she skipped lunch, spending her time on the computer, seeking any bit of information she could find that would help her locate Finn Dalton. She went from one search engine to another.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Sophie asked as they met each other on their way out the door a couple of days later.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Through her fact-finding mission, Carrie was getting a picture of the man who had written this amazing book. After a third read she almost felt as if she knew him. He hadn\u2019t always been a recluse. He\u2019d been raised in Alaska and had learned to live off the land from his father, whom he apparently idolized. One thing was certain, he seemed to have no use for women. In the entire book, not once did he mention his mother or any other female influence. It was more of what he didn\u2019t say that caught Carrie\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cAny luck?\u201d Sophie asked, breaking into her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cHave you read the book?\u201d</p><p>Sophie nodded. \u201cSure. Nearly everyone has.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you notice he has nothing to say about the opposite sex? I have the feeling he distrusts women.\u201d</p><p>Sophie shrugged as if she hadn\u2019t paid much notice, but then she hadn\u2019t been reading between the lines the way Carrie had.</p><p>\u201cHow old do you think he is?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really say.\u201d Finn was an excellent writer and storyteller. But the tales he relayed could have happened at nearly any point in the last several decades. Current events were skipped over completely.</p><p>Sophie crossed her arms and looked thoughtful. \u201cMy guess is that he\u2019s fifty or so, to have survived on his own all these years.\u201d</p><p>Speculation wouldn\u2019t do Carrie any good. \u201cTell you what. When I find out, you\u2019ll be the first to know. Deal?\u201d</p><p>Sophie smiled and nodded. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>That night, as Carrie readied for her latest charity event, her cell rang. It was her mother in Seattle. They spoke at least two or three times a week. Carrie was tight with her family and missed them dreadfully.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d she answered, pressing her cell to one ear while she attempted to place a pearl earring in her other earlobe.</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetheart. Are you busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a couple of minutes.\u201d She switched ears and stabbed the second pearl into place before tucking her feet into a comfortable pair of high heels. She was scheduled to meet Harry in thirty minutes.</p><p>\u201cDad and I are so excited to see you at Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, about that.\u201d Carrie grabbed her purse and tucked it under her arm while holding on to her phone. \u201cMom, I hate to tell you this, but there\u2019s a possibility I might not make it home for Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The disappointment in her mother\u2019s voice was painful to hear. \u201cHave you ever heard of Finn Dalton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. Your father loved his book so much he bought two additional copies. I read it, too. Now, that\u2019s a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to interview him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? From what I understand, he doesn\u2019t give interviews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I heard, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he ever come to Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtful,\u201d Carrie murmured. If only it could be that easy and he would come to her. Well, that wasn\u2019t likely. Then again, something Sophie said had stayed in her mind. She could walk past him on the sidewalk and never know it was him. \u201cI\u2019ll need to track Finn Dalton down, but I keep running into dead ends the same as everyone else.\u201d She mentioned her online search, the calls to Alaska, and the number of phones slammed in her ear. No one had been willing to talk to her. \u201cI have to look at this from a different angle. Have you got any ideas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what your father said, Finn Dalton isn\u2019t a man who would enjoy being written up on the society page.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it, Mom. This would be an investigative piece. My editor told me I could have my pick of assignments if I was able to get this interview. It\u2019s important, enough for me to take the vacation days I planned to use for Thanksgiving to find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Carrie, I hate the thought of you doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I hate it, too, but it\u2019s necessary.\u201d Her mother was well aware of Carrie\u2019s feelings toward her current work situation.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think you can find Finn Dalton?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can or not, but if I don\u2019t, it won\u2019t be for lack of trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always admired your tenacious spirit. Can I tell your father you\u2019re going to write a piece on the man who wrote Alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ... not yet. I have to locate Dalton first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you discovered so far?\u201d Her mother was nothing if not practical. Carrie could visualize her mother pushing up her shirtsleeves, ready to tackle this project with Carrie.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where he was born?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I assumed it must have been Alaska, but there\u2019s no record of his birth there. I\u2019ve started going through the birth records of other states, starting with the northwest, but haven\u2019t found his name yet.\u201d At this rate, it would be the turn of the next century before she found the right Dalton.</p><p>\u201cWhat about his schooling? Graduation records?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried that, but he\u2019s not listed anywhere. Maybe he was homeschooled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d her mother said, sounding proud that Carrie had reasoned it out. \u201cOne of his stories mentions his father mailing away for books, remember? Those were textbooks, I bet.\u201d</p><p>Carrie had made the same assumption.</p><p>\u201cFinn is a rather unusual name, isn\u2019t it?\u201d her mother continued softly, as though she was thinking out loud.</p><p>\u201cAnd of course it could be a pseudonym, but his publisher claims the name is as real as the man.\u201d Nothing seemed the norm when it came to Finn Dalton.</p><p>\u201cYou know, work on the Alaskan pipeline was very big about the time your father and I got married. That was a huge project, and it brought a lot of men to Alaska; many of them stayed. His father might have been one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d But that was a stab in the dark. She\u2019d already spent hours going over every type of record she could think to research from Alaska, to no avail. Carrie glanced at the time, even though this talk was helping her generate ideas of where to continue looking for the mysterious Mr. Dalton.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I remember, a lot of men left their wives and families for the attraction of big money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could start looking at the employment records for the pipeline from that time period and see what I find,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a terrific idea. And listen, when you find Finn Dalton, make sure your dad gets a chance to chat with him, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise that.\u201d First she\u2019d need to convince Finn Dalton to talk to her!</p><p>\u201cJust do your best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Mom.\u201d Carrie ended the call and dumped her cell in her small bag. After a quick glance in the hallway mirror, she headed out the door to what she hoped would be one of the very last social events she would ever need to cover.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>This had to be Finn Dalton\u2019s mother. It simply had to be. From the moment Nash had given Carrie what seemed like the impossible assignment of interviewing Finn, she\u2019d looked for out-of-the-box ways to locate him. Her mother\u2019s mention of work on the Alaskan pipeline and that many of those employed came from Washington State had led to a breakthrough. At least she hoped so. The search led Carrie to the birth record for a Finnegan Paul Dalton, not in Alaska but in her own birth state of Washington. That record revealed his mother\u2019s name\u2014Joan Finnegan Dalton\u2014which then led to a divorce decree, along with a license for a second marriage several years later. Tax records indicated that Joan, whose married name was now Reese, continued to reside in Washington State. Her hope was that Joan Dalton Reese would be willing to help Carrie find Finn.</p><p>The November wind and rain whipped against her as she walked up the short pathway to the single-family house in Kent, a suburb south of Seattle.</p><p>Nerves made Carrie tense as she rang the doorbell and waited. After a few moments, she heard footsteps on the other side of the door. The woman who opened it didn\u2019t look to be much older than her own mother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJoan Finnegan Dalton Reese?\u201d Carrie asked.</p><p>The petite, dark-haired woman blinked warily, and her eyes widened as if she wasn\u2019t sure what to think. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy chance are you related to Finnegan Paul Dalton?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer right away, and then her gaze narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re another one of those reporters, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Joan started to close the door, but Carrie quickly inserted her foot, stopping her.</p><p>The two women stared hard at each other. \u201cYes, I\u2019m a reporter, but I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll hear me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d she demanded, and crossed her arms over her chest.</p><p>Carrie frantically searched for something that would convince the other woman to talk to her. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a single reason other than the fact that I\u2019m tired of writing for the society page. I gave up spending time with my family over Thanksgiving with the hope that I could get this interview, and I think you have an incredible son, and I\u2019d very much like to meet and interview him.\u201d</p> <p>The delicate woman looked undecided. \u201cWhat do you mean you write for the society page?\u201d</p><p>Carrie explained how she\u2019d taken a few of her precious vacation days and flown to Seattle. It\u2019d been a risk, but one she was willing to take. This would be the first year she\u2019d missed the holiday with her parents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. Although it would be a sacrifice, her parents understood that if she did manage to interview Finn Dalton, then she would have her pick of writing assignments, and not just in Chicago, but perhaps in the Pacific Northwest. \u201cI want to move back to Seattle to be closer to my family, and this is my chance.\u201d</p><p>Joan eyed her carefully, and then, after what seemed like an eternity, she slowly opened the door, silently inviting Carrie inside.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d Stepping out of the cold, Carrie instantly felt the warm flow of air surround her. She noticed a bronze pumpkin off to the right and a doll-sized set of pilgrims on the dining room table.</p><p>Joan motioned toward the living room. \u201cHow much do you know about my son?\u201d</p><p>Carrie sat on the edge of the sofa cushion, unsure how best to answer. She could attempt to bluff or she could be direct in the hope that Joan Reese would be willing to help her. \u201cWell, only what I\u2019ve read in his book and what I\u2019ve learned online, which isn\u2019t much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t know how much help I\u2019ll be. I haven\u2019t talked to my Finn in five years, not since his father died ... he told me he wants nothing more to do with me.\u201d</p><p>Carrie read the pain in the other woman\u2019s eyes, and not knowing how to react, she leaned forward and placed her hand on Joan\u2019s forearm.</p><p>\u201cI tried to connect with him after his father\u2019s death, but Finn made it clear that I had nothing to say that he wanted to hear.\u201d She wadded a tissue in her hands and kept her head lowered.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t have any idea where Finn is living?\u201d Carrie asked, her heart thumping with hope and expectation.</p><p>\u201cAlaska, somewhere outside Fairbanks, but then you probably already know that.\u201d</p><p>Seeing that he\u2019d written extensively about life in the frozen north, this was the one piece of information she did have. And apparently so did every other news agency. His book told of adventures on the tundra, which indicated his cabin was most likely situated near the Arctic Circle. And that meant the only way to reach him would be by air, which would involve hiring a bush pilot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried to find someone in Alaska to help me\u201d\u2014Carrie explained her efforts to talk to a number of resources, including bush pilots\u2014\u201cbut it\u2019s been one dead end after another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019re honest about being a reporter,\u201d Joan said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t imagine what some of them have tried, thinking I could give them information that would lead them to my son. You, at least, are willing to admit why you\u2019re doing this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe probably never suspected this interest in him and his lifestyle would happen. People love his stories, and now they want to know about the man behind them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never forgave me, you see ...\u201d Joan murmured, her voice trailing away as she methodically tore apart the tissue in her hands.</p><p>\u201cForgave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left him and his father when Finn was a boy. Paul loved Alaska, and I was born in Louisiana. I tried to make a life with him up there, but I couldn\u2019t bear the cold and the isolation, whereas Paul and Finn seemed to thrive on it. I wanted us to compromise, come back to the lower forty-eight a few months each year, but Paul wasn\u2019t willing to consider that. He insisted there was nothing for him outside Alaska. He felt any time away would be a waste. He had a dozen different projects going all the time and refused to leave. I wanted Finn to come with me, but my son chose to stay with his father.\u201d She paused and looked away as if she regretted having spoken. \u201cOnce I left, Paul cut me completely out of his life, and Finn\u2019s, too. Eventually I remarried, but it was more for companionship than love. Finn never forgave me for that, either. I think he must have held on to the dream that his father and I would reunite one day. My second husband died a year ago, so I\u2019m a widow twice over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew the man Finn has become,\u201d Joan whispered.</p><p>\u201cIf I find him and have a chance to talk to him, I\u2019ll tell him about meeting you. I can give him a message from you, even if it\u2019s just to remind him that you love him and want to hear from him.\u201d</p><p>Joan glanced up and her eyes brightened with what could be described only as ragged hope. \u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d As close as she was to her own family, Carrie\u2019s heart went out to Finn\u2019s mother, still looking to connect with her son. Although she didn\u2019t know him beyond the pages of his book, she couldn\u2019t help wonder about a man who would turn his back on his mother.</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps there\u2019s a small way I can help,\u201d Joan said, her eyes twinkling now.</p><p>\u201cThere is?\u201d She had Carrie\u2019s full attention.</p><p>Joan left the room and returned a few moments later with a simple gold ring. \u201cThis was Paul\u2019s wedding band. When we divorced ... he was angry and bitter, and he returned the ring to me. I\u2019ve saved it all these years, and now that Paul is dead I would like Finn to have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to give Finn his father\u2019s ring?\u201d</p><p>Joan nodded. \u201cFinn has a friend named Sawyer. He\u2019s a bush pilot who is often in Fairbanks. I could see Sawyer felt bad for the way Finn spoke to me at his father\u2019s funeral, and I think he might be willing to help you find my son if you give him a good enough reason.\u201d</p><p>Carrie smiled and held the gold band between her index finger and thumb. This ring could very well be her ticket to reaching the elusive Finn Dalton.</p><p>\u201cYou found him?\u201d Sophie shouted from the other end of the cell phone. \u201cYou actually found Finn Dalton?\u201d</p><p>Carrie meandered through the Fairbanks airport, dragging her carry-on behind her with one hand and holding the cell phone to her ear with the other. Her high-heeled boots made tapping sounds against the floor as she left the baggage-claim area. \u201cI haven\u2019t found him yet,\u201d Carrie corrected. \u201cBut I\u2019m close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFairbanks. I just landed.\u201d Carrie had caught the first available flight out of Seattle after meeting with Joan. \u201cSo, listen, if I\u2019m not back in Chicago on Monday, make up an excuse, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to tell Nash you\u2019re hot on the trail of Finn Dalton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I want to present the article as a done deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you were actually able to track him down,\u201d Sophie said excitedly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get ahead of me; I still don\u2019t have that interview. Sorry, I need to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck. I\u2019ve got my fingers crossed for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d After ending the call, she stuck her cell phone in the outside pocket of her purse and made her way through the small airport, looking for the hangar where the bush pilots parked. All she had was Sawyer\u2019s name, and she wasn\u2019t even sure if it was his first or last. It took her awhile to locate the hangar. She asked around until she found someone willing to talk to her.</p><p>Clearly she looked enough like a city girl with her full-length double-breasted gray wool coat, fashionable boots, and earmuffs for the pilots and mechanics to recognize she was another pesky reporter in search of the elusive Finn Dalton. She was barely able to get two words out of her mouth before she got the cold shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a pilot named Sawyer,\u201d she asked a man inside the hangar, doing her best to hide her frustration. He looked like a mechanic, dressed in greasy coveralls. If bush pilots weren\u2019t willing to talk to her, then perhaps he would. No one seemed to want to help.</p><p>The mechanic\u2019s eyes pierced her, slowly taking her in. \u201cWhat do you want Sawyer for?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Carrie straightened her shoulders and stood her full five feet ten inches, meeting him almost eye to eye. \u201cI would like to hire him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA job.\u201d</p><p>With his hands braced against his hips, the mechanic regarded her skeptically. \u201cYou\u2019re another one of them reporters, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Carrie decided to sidestep the question. \u201cI have something to deliver to a friend of Sawyer\u2019s, so if you\u2019d kindly point me in his direction, I\u2019d be most appreciative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend of his named ...\u201d He left it for her to fill in the blank.</p><p>Carrie\u2019s shoulders relaxed. \u201cFinn Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d Turning his back on her, he walked completely around the outside of his plane, running his hand over the structure as though checking for something, although Carrie couldn\u2019t imagine what.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t giving up. \u201cCan you tell me if Mr. Sawyer is in the area now, or when I can expect to find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so it\u2019s Mr. Sawyer now?\u201d</p><p>Carrie ignored his tone and the question.</p><p>\u201cI have something to give Finn Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you, now? And what might that be? A headache?\u201d</p><p>Very funny. She ignored that comment, although her patience was wearing thin. \u201cIt\u2019s something from his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his mother\u2019s name is?\u201d he asked, whirling around unexpectedly and almost colliding with her.</p><p>\u201cJoan,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cJoan Finnegan Dalton Reese.\u201d</p><p>The mechanic regarded her for several moments, studying her, his eyes boring into hers. \u201cI\u2019m Sawyer O\u2019Halloran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Sawyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the flesh.\u201d</p><p>After a long flight, Carrie was tired and hungry and anxious. \u201cI want to hire you to take me to Finn Dalton.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Sawyer muttered something indecipherable and walked away. \u201cYou and every other reporter who has been nosing around here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carrie hurried after him. \u201cI\u2019m serious, and I\u2019ll pay you anything reasonable if you\u2019ll take me to him. You can wait while I talk to Finn. I won\u2019t be long, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as I thought. When will you people give it up? Although I have to admit you\u2019re cleverer than most, bringing up his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth. I have something to give him from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do,\u201d Sawyer commented, continuing to walk away from her.</p> <p>Carrie chased after him, dragging her suitcase. She had to duck her head in order to walk beneath the Cessna\u2019s wing. \u201cIt\u2019s his father\u2019s wedding band. Joan asked me to deliver it to Finn.\u201d She hated the desperate pleading quality to her voice, but she had to convince Sawyer she was legitimate.</p><p>Sawyer hesitated. \u201cShow me the ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She slid the purse strap off her shoulder and dug inside for the ring, which was wrapped in a tissue inside a plastic bag. Once it was free, she handed it to Sawyer. \u201cHis name, Paul Dalton, is engraved on the inside, along with Joan\u2019s name and the date of their wedding.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer carefully examined the gold band, and then Carrie, before returning the ring. \u201cThere\u2019s a storm due. I\u2019m heading back to Hard Luck in fifteen minutes. I\u2019ll land on the lake outside Finn\u2019s cabin and return in the morning or whenever, depending on this storm. Is that agreeable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, perfect.\u201d At this point, Carrie would have agreed to practically anything.</p> <p>\u201cFinn isn\u2019t going to like this, so I\u2019ll radio him you\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect he\u2019ll have the welcome mat out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got two things against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, you\u2019re a woman, and second, you\u2019re a reporter. Make that three things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. You\u2019re bringing him something from his mother. He doesn\u2019t want any reminders of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she said.\u201d Curiosity got the best of her. \u201cNot that I want you to change your mind, but can you tell me why you\u2019re helping me?\u201d</p><p>The bush pilot shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll probably regret it. Finn\u2019s a good friend, but it\u2019s time he broadened his horizons some, and you, pretty lady, might be just the ticket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever the reason, I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinn will probably stop speaking to me, but he\u2019ll get over it eventually,\u201d Sawyer continued. \u201cI feel I should warn you, though; he\u2019s bound to be as inviting as a wolverine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it. Any other advice?\u201d</p><p>Sawyer scratched the side of his head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t start off mentioning the ring and his mother.\u201d He gave her the once-over a second time. \u201cYou pack anything practical for the weather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live in Chicago. It freezes there.\u201d</p> <p>He snorted as if to cover a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ve got fifteen minutes. Make use of them.\u201d He pointed in the direction of the airport, and Carrie took off running. She wasn\u2019t sure what she\u2019d need, but with the help of the clerk picked up a couple of pieces of gear, including a hat and thick scarf. It seemed extravagant to purchase anything else, seeing that she intended to be in Alaska only a short while.</p><p>By the time she returned, Sawyer had moved the plane out of the hangar and had the engine running. \u201cYou ready?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Because she was winded and excited, she only nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay, climb inside. We need to get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now?\u201d She\u2019d hoped to have a few moments to gather herself.</p><p>\u201cYes, now,\u201d he snapped. \u201cThere\u2019s limited light, and with the coming storm, that window is closing. Ready or not, I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d Carrie had never flown in a private plane, but that one small detail wasn\u2019t about to stop her. She eyed the Cessna, sucked in a deep breath, and loaded her suitcase. It wasn\u2019t easy climbing inside and locking the passenger door. Carrie was relieved she\u2019d worn her jeans, and thankfully her boots had only a moderate heel.</p><p>Within a few minutes they were airborne, circling the airport and heading due north. Carrie clung to her purse as if that would save her from imminent danger and held her breath several times when the plane rocked after encountering moderate turbulence. Sawyer had handed her a pair of headphones, but he wasn\u2019t much for conversation, preoccupied as he was with flying the plane. He radioed Finn twice but wasn\u2019t able to reach him. Although Sawyer didn\u2019t say so, Carrie had the feeling he already regretted agreeing to this. Fearing anything she said might do more harm than good, she remained silent until it was clear that he was preparing to land.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the airstrip?\u201d she asked, studying the landscape below. In the dim light, all she could see were snow and trees.</p><p>\u201cAirstrip?\u201d Sawyer repeated incredulously. \u201cI\u2019m not landing on any strip. Didn\u2019t I already mention I\u2019d be landing on a lake?\u201d</p><p>Set on convincing him to fly her to Finn, Carrie didn\u2019t remember that part of their conversation. A lake? A frozen lake? Peering through the window, she couldn\u2019t make out anything but snow. She gasped out loud when the plane\u2019s wheels bounced against the ice and skidded sideways out of control.</p><p>Sawyer didn\u2019t cut the engine but guided the Cessna to the lake\u2019s center and turned toward her.</p><p>\u201cUnder normal conditions, I\u2019d escort you to Finn\u2019s cabin. Unfortunately, I\u2019m headed directly into that storm, and I don\u2019t have the time to spare. You can see his cabin over there,\u201d he said, pointing in the distance.</p><p>Carrie squinted in the fading light. \u201cIs it far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll happen upon it soon enough. If Finn isn\u2019t there, make yourself at home, and have him contact me.\u201d He snickered. \u201cActually, no need, he\u2019ll be in touch, I\u2019m sure. You going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>Carrie nodded, swallowed hard, and put on a good front. \u201cI was a Girl Scout. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She could see the outline of the cabin through the thick, fat flakes that had already started to fall. Sawyer needed to get back in the air as quickly as possible.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d he said, and it sounded as if he meant it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll square up with what I owe you when you return tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, whatever. But like I said, with the weather, it might be a day or two.\u201d</p><p>Carrie bit into the soft flesh of her inner lip. \u201cOkay.\u201d She was grateful he had brought her this far and would count her blessings.</p><p>He hit the throttle, which was her signal to get going. Carrie opened the plane\u2019s door and climbed out, but not with a lot of grace. She retrieved her small suitcase and the bag of gear she\u2019d bought and stood back as the plane immediately accelerated across the frozen lake. The wind and snow whipped across Carrie\u2019s face with such ferocity that it felt as if she were being stuck with needles.</p><p>Other than her brief time in the hangar when she\u2019d first met Sawyer, she hadn\u2019t been exposed to the Alaskan elements, and they were as brutal as the bush pilot had warned. Her coat, which had been all the protection she needed in Chicago, felt useless. Already she was so cold she had started to shake. Within moments her toes had lost all feeling. Wrapping her new scarf around her head and face, she started walking in the direction of the cabin.</p><p>With the plane airborne now, the thin layer of snow settled down on the thick ice, and in the distance Carrie saw a twisting tail of smoke. That had to be coming from Finn\u2019s cabin.</p><p>Carrie hunched her shoulders as close to her head as she could manage, and even through the protection of her gloves, it felt as if her hands were exposed to the raw elements. The ice was uneven, and dragging her suitcase wasn\u2019t an easy task. With her hands numb, she twice dropped the suitcase handle and had to stop and pick it back up.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t even met Finn and already she\u2019d started to feel as if this was a terrible mistake. Everything had happened so quickly, and when she did meet him she wasn\u2019t sure what she would say to convince him to give her an interview.</p><p>Suddenly it started to snow with such ferocity that she couldn\u2019t see more than a few feet in front of her. The wind drove it sideways, and with her head bowed she struggled against the elements until she heard what sounded like a wild beast. Looking up, Carrie squinted, and what she saw caused her heart to shoot up to her throat. It was an animal, a wolf, and he was racing toward her at an alarming pace.</p><p>Dropping her suitcase, Carrie did the only thing she could think to do. She started running. The wind made it nearly impossible to make headway as she strained against the force of it.</p><p>Then it happened. She stumbled and fell face-first onto the ice.</p><p>Before she could right herself, the wolf was nearly on top of her.</p><p>Screaming, she twisted around and bunched her fists, determined to do what she could to save her life.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cHennessey, sit.\u201d</p><p>Carrie felt the animal\u2019s warm breath against her neck and then didn\u2019t. Struggling to sit upright, she turned to see a man walking toward her across the ice. The wind swirled the snow around him, obliterating his features, but his strides were long and powerful. The animal she\u2019d assumed was a wolf appeared now to be a large dog. Hennessey sat on his haunches, awaiting his master.</p><p>His master.</p><p>This could only be Finn Dalton.</p><p>When he reached her, the hulk of a man loomed over her like a beast in his own right. His face was nearly obscured by protective weather gear and a full beard, but his eyes, deep and dark, cut through her the way a diamond slices through rock. As Carrie gazed up at him, in those first few breathless moments, he seemed more intimidating than the wolf/dog had been.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he shouted, but his voice was carried away by the wind. Leaning down, he reached for her arm, pulling her to her feet. Upright now, her boots slipped against the freshly fallen snow, and she would have toppled a second time if he hadn\u2019t held her in place. Shaking his head in what could be described only as disgust, he grabbed her about the waist and tucked her under his arm as if she were no bigger than a rag doll. Before she could protest, he started walking toward the cabin, eating up the distance with angry strides. Carrie was perpendicular to the ground, so all she could see was the snow on the lake. By now, the hair that had escaped her hat was frozen tendrils that slapped against the tender skin of her cheeks. Hennessey obediently followed. Carrie thought to protest and demand that he put her down, but she knew it would do no good. He probably wouldn\u2019t be able to hear her.</p><p>\u201cM-y, m-y suitcase,\u201d she shouted, or tried. Then she noticed that he had that and her shopping bag in his other hand. His strength astonished her. He carried her with one arm as if she weighed next to nothing. Hennessey trailed behind them, keeping a careful watch on her. Carrie had the impression that if Finn were to mutter one word, Hennessey would happily make a meal out of her.</p><p>By the time they reached the cabin, Carrie was shaking from head to foot. Finn kicked the door closed and set her down, but she found it impossible to stand upright. Gripping her by the waist, he promptly placed her in a chair in the kitchen area. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then he faced her with his feet apart and his hands braced against his hips. \u201cWho the hell are you, and what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Carrie did her best to answer, but her teeth chattered so hard that speaking coherently was a lost cause. In the cozy warmth of the cabin her frozen hair started to thaw, dripping cold water against her shoulders as tight ringlets formed about her head. Thankfully, the huge wood-burning stove warmed the cabin. The log cabin was a marvel, and she did her best to take in as much of it as she could. From the outside Finn\u2019s rustic home didn\u2019t look like much, and she was pleasantly surprised by the interior, with plenty of bookshelves, braided rugs, and large furniture.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he demanded a second time.</p><p>\u201cA ... well, my name is ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what your name is.\u201d</p><p>As though he couldn\u2019t bear to look at her a moment longer, he filled a pot with water and then placed it atop the old-fashioned cast-iron cookstove. She continued to shiver, bracing her glove-covered hands across her body. In some ways, Carrie felt as if she were actually holding herself together.</p><p>Finn studied her as if he\u2019d never seen anyone more pathetic in his life. \u201cGet out of those wet clothes,\u201d he told her gruffly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to remind her that her outfit wasn\u2019t suited to the frigid weather. Everything had happened so quickly. Just the day before, she\u2019d met his mother, and then there were the last-minute flight arrangements to Fairbanks. She\u2019d arrived mid-morning, and then there was the roller-coaster ride in the bush plane. Although it was still afternoon, the sun had already gone down.</p><p>Still shaking with cold and shock, Carrie removed her wool coat and unwound the newly purchased scarf from her neck. Next she attempted to unzip her boots, but her frozen fingers refused to cooperate. Finn walked over to where she sat, got down on one knee, and undid them for her. Pulling off her boots, he set them by the stove to thaw and then disappeared behind a fabric door, only to return a couple of moments later with a pair of thick wool socks. Still shivering, Carrie managed to pull them on.</p> <p>Without asking permission, Finn opened her suitcase and sifted through its contents, shook his head, and slammed it shut. She had a couple of thick sweaters, but little else suitable for the harsh Alaskan elements. Once again he disappeared into the other room and returned with a wool shirt, which she slipped on even though it was far too large for her.</p><p>Not a word was exchanged between them. She watched him move, wanting to remember everything she could about him for her article. Right away she noticed that while he was a large man, he moved with a grace and ease that defied his size. His hair was as dark as her own, and shoulder length. Unfortunately, his full beard hid his face. Even without seeing him clean shaven, she doubted that he would be considered traditionally handsome. His nose was a bit too large and his mouth a tad too thin. While he didn\u2019t appear to be hunk-calendar material, she found the raw vitality surrounding him strongly appealing.</p><p>Although they hadn\u2019t spoken, she sensed his irritation and his curiosity. He had probably already guessed she was a reporter, which was why he hadn\u2019t pursued his questions. One look told her he was determined not to give her any information she could publish.</p><p>When the water was thoroughly heated, Finn brewed coffee and without a word set a mug on the table in front of her. Carrie took it and held on to it with both hands. The first sip scalded her lips, but it was so deliciously hot that she barely minded. Finn remained on the far side of the room, close to the hot stove, as if to keep as much distance between them as possible.</p><p>Taking careful note of what she saw, Carrie realized that most everything inside the cabin had been made by hand. The space was compact but utilized beautifully. The kitchen area, complete with sink and countertop, a few open-faced cupboards, the cast-iron stove, and a table with four chairs, flowed naturally into a cozy sitting area. Hennessey lay on an oval-shaped braided rug close to the warmth of the stove. Two rocking chairs rested on either side, with dry wood stacked close by, and a sofa rested against another wall. The windows, of which there were two\u2014one in the kitchen and another in the living area\u2014had coverings that were pulled tightly closed. The cabin had lights, which she assumed were powered by a generator. What she found encouraging were the bookcases built against the walls, which were jam-packed. From what she could see, Finn Dalton was a reader. When possible, she\u2019d check out the titles, which were sure to give her insight into this man.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Carrie,\u201d she offered, hoping that by being open and friendly he\u2019d be willing to chat. \u201cCarrie Slayton.\u201d</p> <p>Finn ignored her and sat down with his back facing her.</p><p>Fully capable of moving now, Carrie stood and, taking the coffee with her, claimed the second chair. The heat from the stove felt glorious. \u201cI apologize for arriving unannounced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho brought you?\u201d The question was clipped, angry.</p><p>\u201cSawyer. He tried to reach you, but you didn\u2019t pick up and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much did you pay him?\u201d he asked, cutting her off.</p><p>\u201cWell, nothing yet. I told him I\u2019d square up with him in the morning when he returns to pick me up.\u201d</p><p>Finn snickered.</p><p>Carrie wasn\u2019t sure what that meant. \u201cWe discussed terms, and I found his price reasonable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did he charge? Thirty pieces of silver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it was nothing like that.\u201d</p><p>For the first time she noticed a small nook on the other side of the room. He had another table set up there, with a lone chair. On the table was a computer and what she assumed was a radio. If she\u2019d had his email address, she might have been able to convince him to give her the interview. Then again, probably not.</p><p>\u201cYour cabin is amazing ... all the conveniences. You actually have a computer, but then I shouldn\u2019t be surprised, right? I know that you worked with your publisher via email.\u201d</p><p>Nothing. This one-sided conversation wasn\u2019t going the least bit well.</p><p>\u201cI read your book,\u201d she said, trying again. \u201cIt was wonderful. The stories are detailed and rich. You make the reader feel part of the story as well. That\u2019s a rare gift. My dad read your book, too, long before me. In fact, Mom mentioned that he purchased two additional copies as gifts this Christmas. Alone is still on the bestseller lists and has been for months, but then you probably already know that.\u201d She realized she was chattering away and stopped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful you found me when you did,\u201d she said, trying again after several tense moments of silence. \u201cSawyer wanted to stay, but the storm was fast approaching and he needed to get back to Bad Luck.\u201d What an unusual name for a town.</p><p>\u201cHard Luck,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cRight. Hard Luck.\u201d That wasn\u2019t much better. It was difficult to maintain this cheerful facade with little to no feedback.</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019d like to know how I found you.\u201d She thought it might work out better if she asked questions.</p><p>Nothing. Unfortunately, she\u2019d supposed wrong. Finn Dalton had no interest in speaking to her, no matter how she directed the conversation.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk, that\u2019s fine, I understand,\u201d she said with a labored sigh. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve intruded on your life and it\u2019s unbelievably rude of me, I know.\u201d</p><p>They sat in silence for several minutes, but the tension between them was so strong it felt like overactive bass pounding from a speaker. Carrie was quickly losing patience. She hadn\u2019t come this far and jumped through all these hoops to be thwarted now.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe all the different ways I tried to find you,\u201d she said. It felt like a shallow victory now, seeing how uncooperative Finn was. But then, this should have been expected. While she was jubilant, he, on the other hand, was hostile.</p><p>Hennessey kept his gaze focused directly on her. \u201cGood boy,\u201d she said, and made sure her voice was soft and cajoling. \u201cYou\u2019re a friendly dog, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Like his master, Hennessey gave no indication that he\u2019d heard. The canine\u2019s eyes steadily regarded her, watching her every move. With Finn freezing her out, she looked to his companion for some connection. At this point she was willing to accept whatever Hennessey was willing to give her.</p><p>\u201cI hope you know you practically gave me a heart attack, racing up on me like that,\u201d she told the dog. She bent forward and stretched out her hand, making sure he understood that all she wanted was to pet him.</p><p>\u201cHe bites,\u201d Finn warned, and from the way he clipped out the words, it seemed he would welcome the sight.</p><p>Hennessey\u2019s gaze flickered to Finn and then back to Carrie.</p><p>\u201cAre you a big, bad wolf?\u201d Carrie asked Hennessey softly.</p><p>The dog\u2019s eyes met hers, and then Hennessey moved to rest his chin on his paws. Then, to her utter amazement, he wagged his tail. Just one wag, one single shift to indicate that he no longer considered her a threat. It was enough to make Carrie want to shout with delight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m friendly, Hennessey, really friendly. Can we be friends?\u201d Once again she extended her hand for the dog to see.</p><p>Again, Finn warned her. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that if I were you.\u201d</p><p>Carrie slowly withdrew her hand.</p><p>Hennessey lifted his head and looked up at her and then his tail started to move, this time to a full wag, as if to tell her he was willing to trust Carrie if she was willing to trust him.</p><p>\u201cAnother traitor,\u201d Finn muttered under his breath.</p><p>\u201cSawyer isn\u2019t a traitor,\u201d Carrie insisted. \u201cAnd Hennessey isn\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>Finn snorted and then sipped his coffee.</p><p>\u201cFinn ... Mr. Dalton,\u201d she said, trying again. She didn\u2019t mean to sound so familiar, and at the same time, \u201cMr. Dalton\u201d came off as much too formal. \u201cAs you\u2019ve guessed, I\u2019m a reporter. I write for the Chicago Herald. Actually, I cover the society page. It\u2019s not my favorite subject, but I was grateful to get the job. I\u2019m a good reporter, and I wanted an opportunity to prove that I was capable of writing something other than who was seen where and with whom. I am sick to death of writing about meaningless parties and who\u2019s getting married and who\u2019s breaking up. So sick that I was ready to quit, and then my editor, who\u2019s been in the business thirty years, said I could have any assignment I wanted if I could manage to interview you. Little did I know how difficult finding you would be.\u201d</p><p>Once she\u2019d started explaining, she couldn\u2019t seem to stop. Her hope was that once Finn heard her story he\u2019d be willing to cooperate.</p><p>Eventually he\u2019d have to give an interview to someone, and it might as well be her. She was the one who\u2019d found a way to reach him; that should prove something. He had to know his book was practically a phenomenon and the public was curious to know more about him.</p><p>\u201cIf I was able to find you, then others will, too ... eventually.\u201d</p><p>He glared at her as if to refute her words.</p><p>\u201cYour book is amazing, and your readers want to meet the man behind Alone. And really, who could blame them? Surely you realized when you submitted the book what it would mean?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He remained unmoved, so Carrie tried another tactic. Perhaps he would feel sorry for her. \u201cI gave up spending Thanksgiving with my family in order to find you, but it\u2019d be worth every one of my vacation days and a lot more if you were willing to give me an interview.\u201d Studying him, she could tell he wasn\u2019t the least bit concerned.</p><p>\u201cAre you looking for sympathy from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not ... well, maybe, just a little.\u201d</p><p>He briefly closed his eyes and shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d she said in the same cheerful tone she\u2019d used earlier. \u201cI\u2019ll let you preview the piece, give it your stamp of approval. If you don\u2019t like it, then it won\u2019t get printed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly expect me to believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, of course. I\u2019m a woman of my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve yet to meet one who is.\u201d His words dripped with disdain. Snickering softly, he walked over to where the computer and the radio were set up. Pulling out the chair, he sat down, flipped a couple of switches, and put on headphones. It didn\u2019t take Carrie long to figure out his call was to Sawyer.</p><p>Although Carrie could hear only one side of the conversation, it was enough. She was the main topic of interest.</p> <p>\u201cIf this is a joke, I\u2019m not laughing. Over.\u201d</p><p>From Finn\u2019s reaction, Sawyer was apparently amused.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re way off base,\u201d Finn shouted into the microphone. \u201cHaving a woman here, let alone a woman reporter, isn\u2019t my idea of doing me a favor. I don\u2019t care who she is or who she knows. Over.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer replied, but Carrie couldn\u2019t make out what he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her here, and that\u2019s putting it mildly. Over.\u201d</p><p>Silence followed. Finn rubbed his hand over his beard in what she could only assume was frustration.</p> <p>\u201cYou have twenty-four hours to come get her. Over.\u201d</p><p>He slapped his hand against the top of the table. \u201cNo ... I don\u2019t care about any damn storm. You brought this on yourself. Over.\u201d</p><p>Carrie was worried. She really didn\u2019t want to remain with Finn in this isolated cabin any longer than it took to get what she needed for the article. The sooner Sawyer came for her, the better. She needed to be back to work in Chicago. With the holidays coming up, there were any number of social events she\u2019d been assigned to cover. If worse came to worst and she was stuck in Alaska, Nash would forgive her once she handed him the interview with Finn. Even in the short amount of time she\u2019d been with him, she could relay a number of interesting details about the man.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-four hours is my limit. Over.\u201d Finn ended the conversation with what sounded very much like a threat.</p><p>Carrie was left to wonder what he would do if Sawyer didn\u2019t return for her in the prescribed amount of time. Surely Finn wouldn\u2019t put her out in the cold to deal with the elements alone. Would he?</p><p>When he finished he removed the headphones and turned off the radio.</p><p>Carrie remained frozen, hardly knowing what to do or say, so she did nothing.</p><p>Finn reached for his mug and drank down the last dregs of his coffee, and then delivered the empty cup to the kitchen sink. Carrie got out of the chair. Her own coffee was finished, so she followed him, the movement of the wool socks against the cabin floor nearly silent. Unfortunately she was closer behind him than either of them realized, because when he turned, he nearly mowed her down.</p> <p>With his hands braced against her upper arms, he glared down at her, a deep frown etched into his forehead. \u201cStay out of my way.\u201d Each word was distinctly spoken, leaving her in no doubt as to the strength of his feelings.</p><p>\u201cSorry ... that was an accident.\u201d She stuttered slightly, and while she attempted to figure how best to get his cooperation, Finn grabbed his coat, hat, and gloves, and after getting everything on, promptly walked outside.</p><p>Carrie stared at the closed door, too stunned to move. She\u2019d had such high hopes for this interview, but if this \u201ccoffee time\u201d was any indication of what was to follow, then she was going down in flames.</p><p>Hennessey remained by the stove, seemingly content to stay by the warm fire. Carrie got down on the rug next to him, sitting with her legs folded and her chin braced against her knees.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like me,\u201d she told the dog.</p><p>Hennessey lifted his head to gaze at her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say that I blame him. I barged into his life, and now I\u2019m paying the price.\u201d</p><p>To her delight, Hennessey lifted his chin and then rested it on top of her foot. Although Finn had warned her that he might bite, she gently placed her hand on the top of his head. After giving him a moment to adjust to the feel of her touch, she stroked the length of his spine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nothing like the big, bad wolf Finn makes you out to be,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re a big puffball.\u201d</p><p>Well, at least Finn\u2019s dog liked her, and for now that was enough. She continued stroking his fur, burrowing her fingers into his thick coat. \u201cMaybe I should interview you instead,\u201d she suggested quietly. \u201cHow does that sound?\u201d</p><p>The large wolf/dog didn\u2019t indicate his feelings on the matter one way or another.</p><p>\u201cHennessey, tell me, what\u2019s it like ...\u201d</p><p>The door opened again, and Finn came in along with a blast of frigid air and an armload of wood. Thankfully, he shut the door and latched it. He set the wood down by the stove, stacking it for the night.</p><p>\u201cCan I do anything to help?\u201d Carrie asked.</p><p>\u201cLeave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hoped ... I\u2019d assumed that Sawyer would fly me in to meet you, and the two of us could briefly chat and then I\u2019d be on my way, mission accomplished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now I\u2019m stuck with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, and I apologize.\u201d Seeing that he didn\u2019t welcome her help with the evening meal, she felt the least she could do was get her carry-on bag out of the way.</p><p>\u201cIs there someplace you\u2019d like me to put my suitcase?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou mean like in a guest bedroom?\u201d he asked with more than a hint of sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d</p><p>He snickered. \u201cThere\u2019s only one bedroom, and only one bed, and I\u2019m telling you right now I\u2019m not sleeping on the sofa.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>This was an unwelcome predicament, and Finn wasn\u2019t the least bit happy. The biggest shock was that Sawyer had turned on him. Sawyer O\u2019Halloran was a friend, a good friend, and beyond reproach ... until now. Their brief conversation left more questions than it provided answers. The woman had something for him, Sawyer claimed, but to this point she\u2019d kept it to herself. Finn hadn\u2019t questioned his friend, although the temptation had been strong. Whatever it was had convinced Sawyer to fly her in. To his credit, Sawyer had attempted to reach him.</p><p>After several hours of tense silence, Finn loaded wood into the stove and brought out the leftover moose-meat stew for his dinner. He glanced at Carrie and grumbled under his breath. She was a pretty thing, with hair dark enough to be called chocolate and startling blue eyes, although he tried not to notice anything about her. Women like Carrie Slayton were sure to leave a string of broken hearts in their wake, and Finn was determined not to be one of them. He noticed that she kept touching her head. It appeared to have something to do with her hair, which had twisted into springy ringlets after it\u2019d gotten wet in the snow. She seemed to be self-conscious about it, waiting for him to tease her. He wouldn\u2019t. Truth be known, he found her hair to be one of the most attractive features about her.</p><p>Not good. Noticing anything about the woman in his cabin was a sign of weakness, and Finn refused to allow her to take up one iota of consideration.</p><p>As much as he hated to admit it, what she said about granting her the interview made sense. If she\u2019d been able to find him, then other reporters would as well, sooner or later. He\u2019d ignored that inevitability longer than he should have. Not that her argument had persuaded him\u2014nothing would. Finn wrote the book to share his love of the wilderness and to fill the long, lonely hours of the winter solitude. Never in his wildest dreams had he expected it to be such an overwhelming success. Thankfully, he\u2019d done all the legal transactions through an attorney, with the stipulation that he maintain his privacy. He hadn\u2019t agreed to a single interview, regardless of repeated attempts by his publisher. Despite how it looked, Finn wasn\u2019t a recluse but simply a man who enjoyed his solitude. He wasn\u2019t about to disrupt his life and become a media darling.</p><p>Finn didn\u2019t dislike women; he simply didn\u2019t trust a single one of them. Those were lessons he\u2019d learned the hard way. His father was never the same after his mother left. He\u2019d grown bitter and hard, and drummed those lessons into Finn. Later Finn had discovered on his own what his father had tried to tell him. Women were fickle and not worth the trouble they caused in a man\u2019s life. He\u2019d fallen for Pamela, but she\u2019d hurt him the same way his mother had hurt his father. Thankfully, Finn had learned early in their relationship that Pamela wasn\u2019t trustworthy. It embarrassed him to remember the way she\u2019d played him. Finn made the mistake of believing he was falling in love with her only to learn she was married and bored and looking for a little action on the side while her husband was overseas. Finn was willing to admit he enjoyed being with women, but he knew better than to involve his heart.</p><p>He did feel bad about the sleeping situation. But Carrie was the one who\u2019d come uninvited and unannounced. What she\u2019d done was stupid and dangerous, and there were consequences. Finn refused to give her his bed, although the idea of sharing it with her was fairly tempting. He quickly shook his head, casting the image out of his mind.</p><p>Despite his best efforts, his gaze wandered back to her and her beautiful hair. Who was he kidding? It wasn\u2019t only her hair that attracted him; she was a knockout. Little wonder Sawyer hadn\u2019t been able to refuse her. No doubt she had a string of boyfriends as long as the Alaska shoreline.</p><p>Frowning, he realized he wasn\u2019t the only one who noticed how attractive she was. Hennessey had cozied right up to her. Finn wouldn\u2019t have believed it if he hadn\u2019t seen it with his own eyes. Generally, Hennessey didn\u2019t take kindly to strangers. It seemed his faithful mutt wasn\u2019t immune to her charms, either.</p><p>As far as he was concerned, the sooner Carrie Slayton was out of his hair, the better.</p><p>Carrie swallowed hard as she surveyed the cozy living room off the kitchen. The couch was old and lumpy, but the only alternative was the floor. \u201cWhere would you like me to sleep?\u201d She sat down on the couch, testing it, her hands at her sides. It would do in a pinch, she supposed, and it would be more comfortable than the hard floor.</p><p>\u201cWherever you want. The choice is yours, although I should warn you Hennessey considers the sofa his.\u201d</p><p>Finn remained in the kitchen, and from what she could see he appeared to be putting dinner together, heating a pot on the stove. Although it was early evening, it seemed much later. The aroma from the stew was heavenly. Carrie\u2019s stomach growled, reminding her that it\u2019d been several hours since she\u2019d last eaten, and that had been pretzels the airline handed out during the flight. In her rush to get to the airport, she\u2019d skipped breakfast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGetting stuck here for the night wasn\u2019t what I planned, either,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate being here any more than you want me,\u201d she said, and then felt she should explain further. \u201cI need to be back in Chicago. Sophie will cover for me, but ...\u201d She stopped when it was clear he had no interest in listening to her concerns.</p><p>He paused, glanced up, and said, \u201cYou should have considered that earlier.\u201d</p><p>The wind continued to howl and hiss, reminding her that it could be days before Sawyer would be able to return. This was quickly turning into an unmitigated disaster.</p><p>She was deep in her worries, and dinner proved to be a miserable affair. Finn served the stew, which he, thankfully, shared with her. The meat didn\u2019t have a familiar taste, and Carrie decided she was better off not knowing what it was. Bear? Walrus? Mountain goat? For his part, Finn seemed to think if he pretended she was invisible he could completely ignore her. He made it clear he wasn\u2019t interested in conversation. Carrie took the hint and ate her meal in silence. When she\u2019d finished, she politely complimented his efforts and thanked him.</p> <p>Almost immediately after dinner, Finn went into the bedroom and returned a few minutes later with two thick blankets and a pillow. Without a word, he handed them to her.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, taking them from him and holding them against her chest. He might have the personality of a rattlesnake, but she wasn\u2019t about to let his bad mood affect her.</p><p>Apologizing to Hennessey, she made her bed on the sofa, scooting it as close to the stove as she dared. As soon as she lay down, Hennessey leaped up and snuggled next to her legs. Stretching out her arm, she welcomed the canine\u2019s warmth. This was probably the earliest she\u2019d gone to bed since she was a toddler.</p><p>Although she should be exhausted, Carrie found her mind racing. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to give me the interview,\u201d she told the dog, rolling onto her back and staring up at the log beams of the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will interview you,\u201d she said, and gently petted Hennessey\u2019s head.</p> <p>The dog rested his chin against her knee in a move that both comforted and warmed her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Hennessey, tell me what it\u2019s like living with the great Finn Dalton, esteemed author of Alone.\u201d</p><p>She waited, pretending to listen to his answer.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t mean to say you actually like spending countless hours with such a cantankerous owner? I\u2019m wrong, you say, and he really isn\u2019t as bad as I assume? Frankly, I find that hard to believe! Oh, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right, Finn Dalton can be civil, but unfortunately he sees me as an evil threat and he wants to boot me out of here as fast as he can. I know, I know, it\u2019s a shame we couldn\u2019t have reached an understanding. It\u2019s only a matter of time, you know, before others track him down.\u201d</p><p>Again she paused as though taking in the dog\u2019s comments.</p><p>\u201cYes, I hear you. To you he\u2019s a good guy, but to me he\u2019s rude and arrogant and a narcissist. Oh, sorry, narcissist is a big word. It means he\u2019s completely hung up on himself.\u201d</p> <p>A loud snort came from the other room, which was a sure sign Finn was listening in on their conversation.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I realize you have a few questions for me, too. Ask away.\u201d</p><p>She pretended to be listening before she answered. \u201cLike I explained earlier, America is interested in learning what they can about the man who wrote Alone. They see Finn as some sort of hero. Little do they know what he\u2019s really like.\u201d</p><p>She paused and waited for a couple of moments. \u201cOh, you want to know how I was able to find him when so many others have failed? Sawyer asked me the same question. He told me a handful of reporters have tried to bribe him and a couple of other bush pilots to help locate Finn, but none of Finn\u2019s friends would betray him.\u201d She yawned as if she were ready to call it a night.</p><p>\u201cAnswer the dog\u2019s question.\u201d Finn stood in the doorway, holding back the fabric partition. \u201cI\u2019m curious to know what you have for me that convinced Sawyer to bring you here. He\u2019s a good friend, and I know he wouldn\u2019t be easily swayed.\u201d</p><p>Carrie sat upright and wrapped her arms around her bent knees. So this is what it took to get the mighty Finn to open up. \u201cIf you must know, it was what I told him about your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother,\u201d Finn repeated slowly. \u201cWhat does she have to do with any of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found her, and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou searched out my mother?\u201d he demanded in what came across as anger mingled with restraint.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. So have others, but I was able to convince her to talk to me. Your mother and I had a good chat, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Finn took two steps into the room and braced his hands against his hips, looking at her as if she were the lowest of the low. \u201cYou actually talked to my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just said as much, and she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what she said. I want nothing to do with her.\u201d</p><p>Carrie sighed, feeling wretched for Joan when all she wanted was to connect with her son. \u201cShe told me that you\u2019d probably react like this the minute I mentioned her to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe walked out on my father and me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Finn, you have to know it\u2019s more complicated than that. She loves you, and your father didn\u2019t give her many options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Ms. Busybody, this is none of your business, so stay out of it.\u201d He marched back to the bedroom and pushed aside the curtain with such force she was surprised it didn\u2019t rip in half.</p><p>Carrie was ready to wash her hands of this obstinate, unfeeling man. He was unreasonable, unforgiving ... and a dozen more unflattering words that circled her mind. Lying back down, she stared up at the ceiling. Hennessey remained at her side.</p><p>\u201cHe really has mother issues, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d she told the dog, lowering her voice to a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI heard that.\u201d</p><p>Carrie ignored him, seeing how well he\u2019d managed to pretend she didn\u2019t exist. \u201cHis heart must be as cold as ice not to care about his own mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of it, Carrie.\u201d</p><p>She ignored that, too.</p><p>\u201cHis attitude toward her explains a great deal. It seems to me Finnegan Dalton has distinct abandonment issues, right along with issues regarding all women.\u201d</p><p>He laughed as though he found her analysis amusing.</p><p>\u201cWhy else would he choose to live in the Alaska wilderness alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re clever, don\u2019t you?\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cBut all that is probably just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone is right.\u201d She raised her voice to be sure he heard her loud and clear. \u201cHe\u2019s probably been running away his entire life. Then he had to go and make the mistake of writing a bestselling book that captured the public\u2019s attention. How unfortunate for him.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>The blizzard howled outside the door, and Carrie was grateful Hennessey had chosen to stay with her. She punched the pillow several times and then lay back down, pulling the thick blanket over her shoulders and forcing her eyes closed. Finn Dalton could thank his lucky stars she wasn\u2019t writing the article on him right that minute. She couldn\u2019t think of a single flattering comment she could make about this ill-mannered man.</p><p>The minutes ticked past, but as hard as she tried, Carrie couldn\u2019t fall sleep. The sofa was uncomfortable, and Finn had made her so angry the adrenaline pumped through her, making it impossible to relax.</p><p>\u201cHe hates all women, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d she asked Hennessey, keeping her voice low and soft.</p><p>The dog lifted his head, and she almost expected an answer.</p><p>\u201cNot true,\u201d Finn insisted. He stood in the doorway to the bedroom again, filling it with his bulk.</p><p>Ah, so he hadn\u2019t been able to fall asleep, either. \u201cIs so,\u201d she returned with equal fervor. \u201cHow else do you explain yourself? Your mother was given very few options. My goodness, Finn, think about it. She was a southern belle; these harsh elements were too much for her. She wanted to compromise, but your father wouldn\u2019t hear of it. She told me it broke her heart to leave you behind, but you and your father were so close she couldn\u2019t bear to separate you. When you chose to stay with your father, she could have insisted, could have taken the matter to the courts, but she didn\u2019t. She bowed to your wishes even though it broke her heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told you all this, did she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and that\u2019s not all. She mentioned how rude you were to her when your father died. She attended his funeral to make what amends she could, and you rejected her.\u201d Carrie\u2019s jaw tightened just thinking about the unkind way Finn had behaved toward his mother.</p><p>\u201cShe had no right to be there. She remarried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loved your father, and she loves you.\u201d It was beyond Carrie\u2019s imagination that Finn would continue to shut his mother out, especially after losing his father. \u201cYou were a boy when she left. You only heard one side of the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did you, and frankly, what\u2019s between my mother and me is none of your concern.\u201d</p><p>He was right; Carrie was butting her head into areas that had nothing to do with writing the article. However, now that she\u2019d started, she couldn\u2019t seem to stop. \u201cYour mother wants you in her life. You\u2019re her only child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe should have thought of that twenty-five years ago.\u201d As though he was exhausted from their argument, he slowly shook his head and whispered, \u201cJust go to sleep, would you?\u201d</p><p>She was about to mention how uncomfortable the sofa was, but he might assume she was looking for an invitation to join him in his bed. Nothing could be further from the truth. \u201cI\u2019m trying, but you make me so angry that I can\u2019t think straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry harder.\u201d The curtain between the two rooms swayed as he whirled around and returned to bed.</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t know how long it was before she managed to sleep. At some point in the night she woke from the cold and drew the thick blankets more snugly about her shoulders. Later, she was overly warm and kicked them free from her jean-clad legs.</p><p>At about midnight, she opened her eyes to find Finn standing by the stove, feeding it the wood he\u2019d brought in earlier.</p><p>The next thing she knew, he was gently waking her. \u201cYou can have the bed now.\u201d</p><p>She blinked up at him without understanding. He was fully dressed, and while it surely must be close to morning, the only light that showed came from the fire in the stove.</p><p>Finn led her into the bedroom, and once she\u2019d crawled into the ultracomfortable feather bed, he covered her with thick blankets. \u201cI\u2019ll be gone for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she mumbled, already half asleep. Surrounded by warmth and comfort, she thought sleeping on this soft mattress was heavenly.</p><p>When she woke, it was still dark. She quickly put on every bit of clothing that she could fit into until her arms were so thick with two long-sleeved shirts and two sweaters that she could barely bend her elbows.</p><p>Although she\u2019d never cooked on a cast-iron stove, it didn\u2019t seem that difficult. The coffeepot sat on the stove top, but she was unable to get water from the faucet. Once she got the fire going, she opened the cabin door. She blinked at the cold that seemed to come at her like a giant fist. It stole her breath, but she managed to pack the coffeepot with snow and then quickly came back inside. Searching through Finn\u2019s cupboards, she found coffee and quickly assembled a pot. The coffee had just finished brewing when she heard Hennessey bark. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finn was back.</p><p>Carrie couldn\u2019t imagine where he\u2019d gone or what he\u2019d been doing, especially in the snow. She automatically reached for a second mug and filled it. Finn came in the door, followed by Hennessey, who instantly went to her side. She bent down and petted her newfound friend. Finn seemed surprised to see her up and about.</p><p>\u201cThe storm has let up,\u201d he murmured. \u201cBut not enough for Sawyer to fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Carrie had been afraid that was the case. She handed him a mug of steaming brew.</p> <p>\u201cYou made coffee,\u201d he said, as if this was some gargantuan feat.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It was one thing to get into a sparring match with him in the dead of night and quite another to do so when they were standing face-to-face. She\u2019d made several accusations that she wished now had remained unsaid. It embarrassed her that she had delved into his personal life when what he did or didn\u2019t do was none of her affair.</p><p>Finn, too, seemed uneasy.</p><p>\u201cHave you had breakfast?\u201d she asked, although she didn\u2019t have a clue what she would cook if he hadn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t like she had access to fresh eggs. From what little she\u2019d picked up about life in the frozen north, being this close to the tree line meant that groceries, supplies, or anything else Finn needed would have to be flown in.</p><p>\u201cI ate earlier. You?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d This strained politeness was a complete turnaround from the way they\u2019d behaved toward each other previously. Carrie felt responsible for clearing the air, although she wasn\u2019t sure what to say or if she should even try. Perhaps it would be best to just pretend their verbal skirmish hadn\u2019t happened.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some caribou jerky if you\u2019re interested. Made it myself this summer.\u201d</p><p>His attitude toward her appeared to be a bit more amicable, she noticed. \u201cThanks, but I\u2019m not much of a breakfast person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d</p><p>He removed his coat and then sat down at the table with his coffee, his gaze focused on the cup as if he were reading tea leaves.</p><p>Carrie sat down across from him and decided to make an effort at conversation. \u201cAbout last night ...\u201d</p> <p>His head shot up, and his gaze narrowed significantly. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to apologize for the things I said about you and your mother.\u201d</p><p>He bobbed his head as though to assure her all was forgiven. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But I still think you have issues with women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop it, would you?\u201d he said between clenched teeth.</p><p>Carrie held up her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re right, sorry.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed and sipped his coffee.</p><p>\u201cI need to do something, and I don\u2019t want to make you mad, so I\u2019m telling you in advance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow what?\u201d he asked, as if he\u2019d already grown tired of the conversation.</p><p>Carrie slipped the tips of her fingers into her jeans pocket. \u201cYour mother asked me to give you this. I feel honor bound to follow through with my promise to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s wedding band.\u201d</p><p>His face tightened. \u201cKeep it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that; a promise is a promise.\u201d</p><p>He stared across the short space between them and then smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s how you convinced Sawyer to fly you in, isn\u2019t it? You told him you had something for me, but he didn\u2019t say what and I didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t feel she could or should lie. \u201cI\u2019m grateful Sawyer was willing to help me, but he didn\u2019t do it for me. He did it because he felt he was doing what was best for you. He\u2019s a friend, and from what I can see, a good one.\u201d</p><p>Finn snorted and rubbed his hand down his beard. \u201cI knew it had to be something like that.\u201d</p><p>She placed the gold band in the center of the table.</p><p>\u201cSatisfied now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His chair made a grating noise as he stood and reached for the gold band, which he carried to the front door. He opened it, letting snow and wind into the cabin before he tossed the ring with all his might into the storm.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Carrie bolted to her feet and raced through the open door, and practically dove face-first into the whirling snow. The wind blinded her but she caught a glimpse of metal and nearly fell on it in her eagerness to retrieve Paul Dalton\u2019s wedding band. Clenching the gold band tightly in the palm of her hand, Carrie battled the storm in an effort to hurry back into the house. It took all her strength to close the door against the elements. By the time she was finished she was half frozen and breathless.</p><p>\u201cHow could you be so uncaring?\u201d Carrie demanded, glaring at Finn. Her lungs hurt from the brief time she\u2019d been in the icy cold. Chicago was known for its brutal winters, but this frigid air was beyond anything she\u2019d ever experienced.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I care about a wedding ring when the marriage meant nothing to my mother?\u201d he retorted.</p><p>Carrie leaned against the door, needing its support to remain upright. Her entire body was rigid with cold and anger. She waited for a moment, letting the warmth of the room revive her enough to think clearly.</p><p>\u201cThe ring belonged to your father,\u201d she reminded him. One would think Finn would hold on to the band as a keepsake, if for no other reason than the fact that his father had once worn and treasured it.</p><p>\u201cDad returned it to my mother at the time of the divorce. If he didn\u2019t want it, what makes you think I would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your mother kept it, which should tell you something.\u201d Carrie didn\u2019t know why she felt such a strong need to defend his mother. In some way, it felt as though she was sticking up for herself as well as all the other women of the world.</p><p>\u201cAs far as I can determine, women are out for what they can get from a man. You don\u2019t care who you step on or who you hurt. I made the mistake of thinking I was in love once, but I won\u2019t make it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll women?\u201d Carrie challenged. He wasn\u2019t making sense. \u201cYou see us as selfish and untrustworthy because your mother left you? And you have the nerve to tell me you don\u2019t have abandonment issues?\u201d She resisted the urge to laugh. This guy was a real piece of work. \u201cHave you considered counseling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think this is just about my mother. You don\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me,\u201d she urged.</p><p>\u201cPamela,\u201d he muttered, \u201cwas lesson number two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so that\u2019s it. A woman disappointed you and now you\u2019re sour on the entire gender. That is such a clich\u00e9. What happened? Did Pamela decide she couldn\u2019t live in Alaska? Was she too much like your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, this has nothing to do with me. I have just one more thing to say and then I promise not to mention it again. Finn Dalton, get over it.\u201d</p><p>Before she could suck in the next breath, Finn\u2019s face was two inches away from her own. They were practically nose-to-nose. If Carrie could have backed away, she would have, but with the door pressed against her backside, she had nowhere to move.</p><p>Hennessey was on his feet and stood next to Finn, barking madly. Finn ignored him, and so did Carrie.</p><p>\u201cI knew Pamela from the time we were teenagers. Or, better yet, I thought I knew her. She moved to Seattle and then came back. I loved her, and then I learned that while she was away, she married a soldier who went off to Afghanistan. She didn\u2019t care about me. All she wanted was some entertainment while her husband was out of the country. She was playing me. I don\u2019t need a woman in my life\u2014got it? Not one of you is worth the heartache. I saw what losing my mother did to my father, and I had a small taste of it myself. I don\u2019t need another, so back off. Stay out of my life, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoud and clear.\u201d His anger seemed to inhale all the oxygen in the room until the small hairs on the back of Carrie\u2019s neck bristled. Her hands were flattened against the door, and when he stepped away it took several seconds before Carrie felt like she could breathe normally again.</p><p>He stalked over to his desk on the far side of the cabin as if he couldn\u2019t get away from her fast enough.</p><p>Carrie bent down to pat Hennessey and reassure him that all was well.</p><p>The tension left her shoulders, and she realized she was trembling almost uncontrollably in the aftermath of their confrontation. Despite herself, she felt bad for Finn. Not knowing Pamela or the situation that had led to their breakup, she had to believe it must have been traumatic to Finn.</p><p>\u201cMy college boyfriend dumped me,\u201d Carrie said, and was surprised by how low and shaky her voice sounded.</p><p>\u201cAnd you \u2018got over it,\u2019 right? No big deal.\u201d He sat with his back to her, his tone cold. The air seemed to vibrate with tension.</p><p>\u201cActually, no ... I tried to pretend it was a natural parting of the ways. I was in Chicago, working for the newspaper, and he was back in Seattle. But it hurt,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe married a friend of mine six months later, and I was a bridesmaid in their wedding, and I had to pretend it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Finn turned around and looked at her for an extra-long moment, frowning as if to gauge whether she was telling the truth. Carrie held his gaze and didn\u2019t flinch before moving into the kitchen, feeling the need to sit down. Her bottom lip trembled slightly, and she bit into it, wanting to disguise how upset she was.</p><p>Hennessey sat down by Finn\u2019s side, and then after a few minutes walked over to where Carrie sat at the table. She petted his thick fur, trying to think of what to say to ease the tension. They were trapped here together, and she had to do something to make it tolerable.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve both been hurt, but it isn\u2019t the end of the world.\u201d</p><p>He snorted.</p><p>\u201cCan we put this conversation behind us?\u201d</p><p>His back was to her again, and he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cDo you play chess?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrabble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>What do you play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSolitaire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The hand of truce that Carrie had extended had been solidly slapped.</p><p>Several tense moments passed before he exhaled harshly and said, \u201cDo you play cribbage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandfather taught me,\u201d she responded. If they could find common ground, it would help pass the long hours of being cooped up together until Sawyer arrived. \u201cI\u2019m not much good, but I\u2019d be willing to give it a try if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated and then went into his bedroom and returned with a cribbage board and a deck of cards. Sitting down at the kitchen table across from her, he removed the cards from the box and shuffled.</p><p>Carrie was grateful they weren\u2019t destined to spend the entire storm at each other\u2019s throats. \u201cGo ahead and deal. How about coffee?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Finn had dealt the first hand by the time she returned. Carrie looked at her cards, discarded two, and so they started. Luck was with her and she narrowly won the first game. Finn regarded her skeptically. \u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t much good at this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>Sipping his coffee, Finn tried to hide his smile, but Carrie saw it and smiled back. \u201cI believe it\u2019s my turn to deal.\u201d</p><p>Keeping his eyes on her, he slid the deck of cards across the table.</p><p>Shuffling the cards, Carrie glanced up and smiled ever so sweetly. \u201cWomen aren\u2019t stupid, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never said they were. Heartless, yes, but a few I\u2019ve happened upon showed meager signs of intelligence.\u201d</p><p>Carrie suspected he was purposely attempting to bait her. \u201cI\u2019ll add chauvinist to the long list of words that best describe you, Finn Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter word would be realist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, puh-leese.\u201d She drawled out the word and laughed despite herself.</p><p>Finn did, too, and the surprise of hearing his amusement caused her to fumble and lose control of the cards, which scattered across the tabletop.</p> <p>\u201cYou should laugh more often,\u201d she said, gathering together the deck.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really.\u201d</p><p>His eyes shone, and despite his grizzled appearance, she found him strongly appealing. If he were clean shaven and his hair groomed, he might even be considered handsome. She must have been staring at him because he frowned and barked, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry.\u201d Carrie quickly looked away and dealt the cards.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring at me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>This question was harder to answer. She couldn\u2019t very well admit she found him intriguing, and so she said the first thing that came to mind. \u201cI want to remember what you look like, and I doubt you\u2019d let me take your photo.\u201d</p><p>He immediately frowned. \u201cFor that article you intend to write?\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering, she kept dealing the cards and then waited while he cut the deck.</p><p>The second game proved they were well matched. Finn won, but not by much.</p><p>\u201cTie-breaker?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she responded. It surprised her how much she enjoyed this mini\u2013battle of the sexes with him.</p> <p>After shuffling the cards, he dealt.</p><p>\u201cDo you do anything special around the cabin for Christmas?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Frowning, he glanced at her above his hand. \u201cIt isn\u2019t even Thanksgiving yet. Why are you asking about Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s on my mind. A lot of the stores already have their decorations up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>He grumbled some. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re the sort of woman who goes all out for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, as she counted out her score. \u201cAlthough I live alone, I put up a tree, hang garlands, and decorate with holly. What about you?\u201d</p><p>He finished counting out his hand. \u201cWhat about me? If you\u2019re digging for more information for that article, you can stop right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d she said, groaning. It seemed everything she asked was suspect. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a Christmas tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why would I?\u201d</p><p>Knowing him, he probably didn\u2019t like Christmas at all. \u201cIs it just another day for you and Hennessey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the most part, yes. I\u2019ll sometimes join Sawyer and his family or fly to Fairbanks and spend Christmas Day with friends.\u201d</p><p>It made Carrie feel better to know he wouldn\u2019t be alone unless that was what he chose. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes. I would hate the thought of you spending Christmas alone.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, as if her comment amused him. \u201cDespite what you think, I enjoy my own company, but I have a real life, too. I live a good part of the time here, but I have a condo ... elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do? But how do you support yourself? I mean, before the book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have all the work I want with the state, checking on the pipeline.\u201d He grimaced, as if he\u2019d said far more than he meant for her to know. \u201cForget I said that.\u201d</p><p>She pantomimed zipping her lips closed. There was far more to Finn than she realized. \u201cListen, this isn\u2019t related to anything I might write, so relax.\u201d</p><p>They broke for lunch. Finn made sandwiches, which they ate in front of the stove, sitting in the rocking chairs. A glance out the window told her the wind had died down and the snow had stopped.</p><p>\u201cMy mother is probably worried about me,\u201d she said, checking her cell phone. Thankfully, her battery wasn\u2019t dead, but coverage this far north simply wasn\u2019t going to happen. \u201cI told her I\u2019d phone, and I haven\u2019t. Is there any way I can get word to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a satellite phone, but it isn\u2019t cheap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to pay whatever the charges are. I won\u2019t talk long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving you out of my hair by tomorrow morning would be payment enough.\u201d</p><p>Carrie frowned. \u201cOuch. I thought we were getting along so well, too.\u201d</p><p>Finn chuckled. \u201cWe were almost friends until you whipped me in cribbage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, men and their fragile egos.\u201d</p><p>Finn grumbled something she couldn\u2019t hear, and then he showed her how to operate the phone by his desk. It took a moment for the line to connect, and when it did, her father answered.</p><p>\u201cDad, it\u2019s me. I don\u2019t have a lot of time, but I want you to know I\u2019m still in Alaska. Tell Mom I\u2019m doing great and I\u2019ll connect with her once I\u2019m back in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s been concerned. You said you\u2019d call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Dad. I\u2019ll explain everything when I\u2019m not paying outrageous satellite charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSatellite charges? Where in heaven\u2019s name are you?\u201d Her father was the talker in the family.</p><p>\u201cOutside of Fairbanks, Alaska.\u201d If she said anything more, her dad would have more questions, and then more after that.</p><p>\u201cYou found him? You found Finn Dalton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, I can\u2019t talk now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, but I\u2019m going to want a full report once you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. Reassure Mom that I\u2019m fine and thank Grandpa for teaching me cribbage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind, I\u2019ll explain later.\u201d</p><p>They said their farewells, and Carrie ended the call. When she turned around, she was surprised to find Finn had put on his parka and heavy boots.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going somewhere?\u201d she asked, surprised.</p><p>\u201cThe wind has died down and the snow has mostly stopped. I won\u2019t be gone long.\u201d Hennessey was at the door, eager and ready to be on his way.</p><p>At the door, Finn hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019ll be all right for a while by yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d It surprised her that he\u2019d asked. Actually, she welcomed the privacy in order to work on the article. The instant he was out the door, she retrieved her computer. It didn\u2019t take her long to organize her thoughts. She\u2019d already gathered more than enough information to write a lengthy piece about him. The rough draft took her the better part of an hour. Feeling good about the piece, which she felt was fair, if not flattering, she tucked her laptop back inside her suitcase, grateful Finn hadn\u2019t returned while she\u2019d had it open.</p><p>With that out of the way, Carrie soon grew restless and bored, fidgeting, wishing she could talk to Sophie. Had she better planned this trip, she would have brought along her e-reader.</p><p>Finding little with which to entertain herself, Carrie took out the paper tablet she had with her, found a pair of scissors, and went about cutting large snowflakes. With the sewing kit at the bottom of her purse, she took thread, stood barefoot on a chair, and suspended the flakes from the ceiling until the entire cabin looked like a magical winter wonderland.</p><p>More than likely Finn wouldn\u2019t appreciate her effort toward Christmas decorations; however, she wasn\u2019t going to let that stop her. Other than keeping her occupied, she hoped this would amuse him.</p><p>She was standing on the chair in the middle of the cabin, stretching her arms above her head, when the door unexpectedly opened and Finn and Hennessey stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat the ...\u201d</p><p>Startled, Carrie lost her balance, and with arms flailing at her sides, she started to topple from her perch on the chair. Seeing her predicament, Finn reacted quickly and instinctively, catching her in midair. Carrie issued a small, breathless gasp as her body was pressed hard against his.</p><p>For one wild moment all they did was stare at each other. Her pulse raced, and his eyes went directly to her throat as if he could see her reaction. He didn\u2019t release her, and she realized she was glad to be in his arms. It wasn\u2019t a comfortable feeling.</p><p>His gaze traveled from the throbbing pulse in her neck to her lips, and Carrie\u2019s mouth went dry as his eyes held hers. When did this happen? Another question quickly followed the first\u2014what were they going to do about it? Carrie knew what she wanted. She closed her eyes, expecting, hoping that Finn would kiss her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>Gradually he released her, setting her feet down on solid ground. Then he stepped back as though having her this close had burned his senses.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d he asked, his voice ragged, demanding. He hardly sounded like himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Carrie\u2019s own senses became jumbled. Confused. She wasn\u2019t sure what he meant. It sounded as if he was asking about this sudden arc of awareness that vibrated between them. \u201cI ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis!\u201d He pointed at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cOh, that,\u201d she said, feeling foolish, embarrassed, and relieved. \u201cI thought I\u2019d add a bit of holiday spirit to your cabin.\u201d</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>\u201cI can take it down if you want.\u201d</p><p>His response was a soft snort. \u201cAnd risk you breaking your fool neck a second time? Leave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it looks great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t?\u201d she pressed.</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother to answer, but instead announced, \u201cI\u2019ll put a roast on for dinner.\u201d She stood by while he put together meat, carrots, and onions in a cast-iron pot and placed it in the oven.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d she asked, looking to help.</p><p>\u201cYou can peel potatoes if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want.\u201d</p><p>They both seemed eager to put that sensual awkwardness behind them. It was important, she supposed, to ignore the awareness that sprang up so unexpectedly. Finn seemed as determined as she was to pretend it had never happened. Carrie was more than eager to do so, seeing that she\u2019d practically begged him to kiss her. Just thinking about it mortified her. She didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d been thinking, which explained it, because clearly she hadn\u2019t been thinking. Instead, she\u2019d been feeling, and that was dangerous to them both.</p><p>Within a couple of hours the scent of the roast filled the cabin. As she set the table for dinner, Finn disappeared for a couple minutes and returned with a bottle of red wine.</p><p>\u201cDo you like wine?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, very much.\u201d</p><p>He set the wine bottle in the middle of the table.</p><p>\u201cAre we celebrating?\u201d she asked, teasing him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes. Sawyer will collect you come morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. How could I have forgotten?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be more than ready to see me go.\u201d</p><p>To her surprise, he didn\u2019t immediately respond.</p><p>When dinner was ready, they sat down across from each other, the roast and assorted vegetables on a platter between them. Finn opened the wine bottle and poured them each a glass.</p> <p>\u201cWhat shall we toast?\u201d she asked, pressing the brim of her glass against his.</p><p>\u201cTo cribbage,\u201d he suggested. \u201cAnd I demand a rematch after dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo cribbage,\u201d she echoed, and smiled.</p><p>Their eyes held for an extra-long moment, and her stomach was filled with butterflies as she realized that this heightened awareness of each other hadn\u2019t gone away. If anything, it was stronger, and was growing more so each moment. Although they both tried to ignore what was happening, it was still there, as real and as profound as when he\u2019d caught her and kept her from falling to the floor.</p><p>They sipped the wine while their gazes held. Deliberately, Carrie looked away. She needed to remind herself that the sole reason she was in Alaska was for an interview. After spending more than twenty-four hours with Finn, she had what she needed. And as soon as the article was published, Finn Dalton would want nothing more to do with her.</p> <p>Chapter Six</p><p>This wasn\u2019t working, Finn realized. When Carrie showed up unexpectedly, he\u2019d been determined to freeze her out. She might have found him, but she wasn\u2019t getting one iota of information out of him for that blasted article she intended to write. He would say as little as possible, speak in monosyllables, and be rid of her the instant the weather cleared.</p><p>And yet within the span of twenty-four hours she knew more about him than he ever intended. Only a few of his friends knew about his involvement with Pamela. If divulging personal information wasn\u2019t bad enough, he\u2019d been keenly tempted to take her in his arms and kiss her. The urge had been so strong that he\u2019d had to leave the cabin. Then, upon his return, he\u2019d found her standing on a chair and she\u2019d fallen directly into his arms. He\u2019d like to think she planned this, but her reactions said otherwise. He\u2019d caught her, and she\u2019d looked up at him with those baby blues of hers, practically begging him to do the very thing he wanted to most. It felt as if he was about to go down for the third time before he gathered the strength to pull away. Not that it was easy. Finn liked to think of himself as disciplined and in control of his emotions. With Carrie, every bit of self-preservation flew out the proverbial window. He didn\u2019t like it one bit.</p><p>What he needed, Finn decided, was a distraction. He figured if they could play cards, that would keep him sane until he was well rid of her. Then he\u2019d come up with the bright idea of opening a bottle of wine. What was he thinking? If he found her beautiful before dinner, she was all the more so during. Stunning, breathtakingly beautiful, and for the life of him he couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off her.</p><p>He wanted to blame the wine, but she\u2019d intoxicated him with little more than a smile. This was bad, and every minute he spent with her made it worse. Before he knew how it happened, he\u2019d lowered his guard.</p><p>\u201cAre you surprised?\u201d she\u2019d asked him. \u201cYou know, by how successful the book has been?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. It baffled him even now. His editor routinely updated him on sales and his position on the New York Times bestseller list. \u201cI\u2019ve been told it\u2019s a publishing sensation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. Finn, thousands and thousands of people are reading and loving your stories about Alaska. What ever made you think to write it?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and leaned back, far more comfortable with her than he should have been. Before he knew it, he was telling her the story. \u201cIt was just one of those things. I read an article about the problems with kids having sedentary lives, obsessed with video games and television, and was astonished. While I was growing up, every day was an adventure. I thought if I wrote about some of my own experiences it might inspire kids and adults to step outside their front door and look at nature in an entirely different way.\u201d</p><p>Carrie\u2019s eyes brightened and Finn couldn\u2019t have looked away from her if someone had offered him gold ingots.</p><p>\u201cDid you know,\u201d Carrie said, her smile warm and alive, \u201cthere are whole groups that are springing up across the country for organized hikes and other outdoor activities that your book inspired? This would never have happened if it hadn\u2019t been for your book. I hope you realize what a strong influence Alone has been.\u201d</p><p>He had heard about such groups, and it pleased him immensely.</p><p>The bottom line, Finn realized, was that he needed to keep his trap shut.</p><p>The problem was how comfortable he felt with Carrie. Hardly trying, she got him talking. He wasn\u2019t sure what it was about her; maybe it was the pain that radiated from her when she spoke of her college sweetheart. At first he assumed she\u2019d made up the story in order to gain his trust. But the hurt he saw in her couldn\u2019t be fabricated. No one was that good an actress.</p> <p>All Finn could hope was that Sawyer didn\u2019t get delayed come morning. There was still a chance that Finn might come out of this fiasco unscathed.</p><p>Carrie and Finn worked together washing and drying the dinner dishes. Although she pretended not to notice, he kept a careful watch on her. At one point she almost said she had no intention of stealing his silverware.</p><p>Dinner had been pleasant enough. The roast had been cooked to perfection, tender and succulent, and the vegetables were a wonderful complement. They\u2019d chatted amicably during the meal, and Carrie was surprised how easy it was to talk to Finn. Without her prompting, he\u2019d started to talk about the book, which shocked her. When he abruptly stopped, she realized he\u2019d said far more than he\u2019d ever intended.</p><p>\u201cI like you, Finn,\u201d she said as they claimed the chairs by the fire.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d He arched one thick brow as though questioning her.</p><p>\u201cWith few exceptions, I\u2019ve enjoyed spending this time with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Her announcement appeared to amuse him. He leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms as though he expected her to elaborate.</p><p>She rocked a bit before answering. \u201cI\u2019m not going to feed your ego.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. Why not?\u201d</p><p>Carrie had trouble holding back a smile \u201cOkay, fine,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019re so authentic. You are who you are and you aren\u2019t willing to apologize for it. I like that.\u201d</p><p>Actually, she was strongly attracted to the fact that Finn was a man\u2019s man, but she wasn\u2019t willing to admit it. His strength didn\u2019t come from working out in some gym but from living life.</p><p>She found he was staring at her, and so she continued, \u201cCovering the society page the way I do, you can\u2019t imagine how many men ... and women I meet who only care about money, appearances, superficial things. Oh, don\u2019t get me started, but you ... you\u2019re a refreshing change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m highly intelligent,\u201d he added.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAnd humble, too, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d He chuckled and then asked, \u201cWhat about good-looking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel qualified to answer that,\u201d she said, and cocked her head from one side to the other as though assessing his looks.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he challenged.</p><p>She flexed her fingers over her own cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell with your entire face covered with that beard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but you should be able to take my word for it. Besides, beards are a necessity here in Alaska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone should have told me and I would have grown one,\u201d she joked.</p><p>He smiled back, and it seemed like their gazes caught and held for an extra-long moment. In order to break the spell, she looked away and added, \u201cYou\u2019re a good conversationalist.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her comment. \u201cToo good.\u201d</p><p>Their conversation continued for another hour. Carrie discovered that they had a surprising amount in common and agreed on a number of issues; they both loved reading thrillers and were big football fans, especially of the Seattle Seahawks. On others, they were diametrically opposed, the foremost being politics. What struck her, what she found devastatingly attractive about him, was the fact that he could laugh at himself and about Alaska. Finn possessed a wonderful dry wit. When she asked him about the rumor that Alaska was full of bachelors, he replied, \u201cYou know what they say about Alaska, don\u2019t you? It\u2019s where the men are men, and so are the women.\u201d</p><p>Carrie tried unsuccessfully to hide her laugh, nearly choking with the effort. Once she composed herself she recited something she\u2019d read on a T-shirt. \u201cI heard that if a woman is looking for a husband in Alaska, her odds are good but the goods are odd.\u201d</p><p>Finn laughed in return, and then it happened again. Their gazes caught and held for what seemed like an eternity, as neither one of them was keen to break the contact.</p><p>Carrie hadn\u2019t been joking; she enjoyed Finn\u2019s company. The more she got to know him, the stronger her feelings became. Before long, they\u2019d finished off the bottle of wine. Then Finn suggested a rematch of their cribbage game.</p><p>\u201cOnly this time whoever wins the match gets the bed tonight,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t need to think twice about this wager. \u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d The only decent sleep she\u2019d had the night before had been in Finn\u2019s bed, and that had been right before morning. She remembered wrapping herself up in the warm quilts, surrounded by the scent of Finn. The sofa had been lumpy, and half the night she\u2019d shivered with cold. It\u2019d been an uncomfortable experience. The one bonus was having Hennessey with her.</p><p>Once again Finn brought out the cribbage board and the cards, and they sat down across from each other as they had before. They cut the cards, and Finn won for the deal. As he shuffled the deck, he made light conversation, almost as if he was looking to distract her.</p><p>\u201cYou said you work for the Chicago Herald?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She caught the cards as he dealt them to her. \u201cThe society page, like I said earlier.\u201d</p><p>Finn arched his brows.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fortunate to have a job with such a prestigious newspaper, but quite honestly, Finn, this isn\u2019t the type of writing I want to do.\u201d The thought of returning to Chicago and immediately being thrust into a series of parties and other social events filled her with dread.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s the reason you went to such desperate lengths to find me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. An article on you would change everything for me.\u201d She glanced up hopefully, but his expression remained blank. He didn\u2019t need to tell her his feelings on the matter; they\u2019d already been well stated. But she would write the article. The nearly thirty-six hours she\u2019d spent in his company had proved he was everything he\u2019d claimed in his book and more.</p><p>Finn laid down his first card, and she immediately added her own.</p><p>Carrie would like to think that it was because she was distracted by their conversation that she handily lost the first game.</p><p>\u201cNo fair,\u201d she muttered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you suggesting I cheated?\u201d he asked, and seemed to enjoy her loss far too much.</p><p>\u201cNo, but you distracted me, got me thinking about ... work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a convenient excuse, and you know it. The fact is I played a superior game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you did,\u201d she muttered sarcastically, and reached for the deck. \u201cWe\u2019re playing for the match, remember.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you rest your brain for a few minutes?\u201d Finn suggested, his voice dripping with pretend sympathy. He rose from the table and came to stand behind her, and placed his hands on her shoulders. He rubbed and kneaded the knotted flesh as shivers of awareness shot down her spine. Giving in to his touch, Carrie closed her eyes with a sigh and let her head drop forward. This was divine. It might have been her imagination, but for just an instant she thought she felt his breath against the side of her neck as if he\u2019d bent over to kiss it. His touch was so light, so tender, that it could well have been wishful thinking. From everything Finn had said, he was more than eager to be rid of her.</p><p>\u201cWhat I need,\u201d she said, scooting back her chair, anxious to break this trance that had come over her, \u201cis some fresh air.\u201d As it was, the room seemed overwhelmingly stuffy. The storm was over, and the night appeared relatively peaceful.</p><p>Handing Carrie her coat, Finn walked her to the front door. When she stepped outside, her arms immediately went about her middle as her gaze went to the star-filled heavens. In all her life, Carrie had never seen so many stars. Thousands upon thousands of pinpricks of twinkling light dotted the sky, mesmerizing her.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d she whispered, caught up in the magic of the moment. \u201cThis is unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>Finn came to stand behind her, his hands on her shoulders. \u201cI never grow tired of this view,\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>\u201cNo wonder. It\u2019s incredible. Awesome. Breathtaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow look north.\u201d He turned her halfway around so that she faced the arctic.</p><p>Carrie gasped. The sky was filled with wave upon wave of color\u2014gold, bronze, and lavender arced across the night sky. \u201cIs that the ... aurora borealis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never seen it before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Of course, I\u2019ve heard about it, but I had no idea it was this beautiful, this dramatic.\u201d Just watching the northern lights dance their seductive ballet chased off the chill of the frigid night. Then Carrie realized the source of this toasty feeling was Finn\u2019s arms, which surrounded her. He\u2019d tucked his warm body close to hers, warding off the frigid night air.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d he suggested, his head close to hers.</p> <p>She did as he requested.</p><p>\u201cDo you hear anything?\u201d His breath was warm against her ear.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cA crackling sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the northern lights. Not everyone can hear them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d she asked, barely getting the words out. Having him this close took her breath away.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His lips nuzzled her neck, and Carrie sighed audibly.</p><p>At the same moment, they both seemed to become aware of the close proximity they shared, knit together, as it were. Without a word, Finn snatched his arms away and returned to the house.</p><p>Carrie followed a moment later. Finn was already sitting at the table by the time she closed and latched the door.</p> <p>\u201cIs your brain working now?\u201d he asked, and cleared his throat, busying himself with shuffling the cards.</p><p>\u201cAh, sure.\u201d Her breath trembled slightly, and she hoped that if Finn noticed he wouldn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anything more beautiful,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d Finn added.</p><p>Her mind swirled with the sights and sounds of the innate beauty of Alaska. Inhaling a deep breath, she glanced up to find Finn studying her. She wanted to thank him for sharing his home and his life with her for the past two days. The words were on the tip of her tongue, but she doubted she could murmur a single word without tears leaking from her eyes. These last few minutes had felt almost spiritual, as if she\u2019d been standing in a church and singing hymns of praise.</p><p>As best she could, Carrie returned to the game, doing her utmost to pretend nothing out of the ordinary had happened and at the same moment acutely aware that it had.</p><p>As luck would have it, she won the second game, but it was no thanks to her skilled card sense. The air between them sizzled and arced much like the northern lights, even as they both chose to ignore it. Perhaps that was for the best, as she would be flying out at first light. An immediate sense of regret filled her. In an amazingly short amount of time, Alaska had won her over, and Finn had, too.</p><p>The last cribbage game was close, but in the end Finn won. Little wonder, really, as Carrie\u2019s mind was not on the game. She didn\u2019t know how she was going to say good-bye when she had the distinct feeling she would be leaving her heart behind.</p><p>Finn seemed surprised that he managed to pull out a win. Carrie sighed as she set her cards down and pulled the pegs from the board. She wasn\u2019t looking forward to another miserable night on the sofa, but, all things considered, a little discomfort was a small price to pay.</p><p>Finn seemed to read her lack of communication as disappointment. \u201cYou can have the bed,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cNo. You won,\u201d she said much too cheerfully, overcompensating. \u201cI\u2019m the intruder here, remember?\u201d Hennessey would lie at her feet, and he\u2019d keep her company during the night. It wouldn\u2019t be so bad, and if she was fortunate enough to catch the flight back to Seattle and then make a quick connection to Chicago, she could sleep on the plane.</p><p>Finn reached for the cards and placed them back inside the box.</p><p>\u201cI realize having me as your houseguest wasn\u2019t what you wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been more than gracious, and I want to thank you for putting up with me.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, giving the impression it wasn\u2019t a big deal. \u201cYou aren\u2019t so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContrary to popular opinion, you aren\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>He cracked a smile. \u201cYour opinion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cwe didn\u2019t exactly start off on the right foot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he acknowledged.</p><p>\u201cAre you still upset with Sawyer?\u201d</p><p>He gave the question some consideration before answering. \u201cI\u2019ll settle up with him later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on him,\u201d Carrie pleaded. \u201cHe\u2019s a good friend to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Finn agreed.</p><p>A short while later Finn announced it was time to call it a night. Despite the fact that it was relatively early, Carrie was tired. He offered her privacy so she could wash up and change clothes. While she was getting ready for bed, Finn contacted Sawyer. She heard the two men talking over the ham radio but was able to make out only half of what was being said.</p><p>When she reappeared, Finn said, \u201cSawyer will arrive early. He\u2019ll see you to the terminal and make sure you have a seat on the next available flight out of Fairbanks to Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how ...\u201d This was the one drawback to her plan. She\u2019d arrived in Alaska, and not knowing when to book her return ticket, she\u2019d left it open. Now she would need to purchase a last-minute ticket back to Chicago at a greatly inflated price. Because of cutbacks with the airlines, almost every plane she\u2019d flown on lately had been packed with passengers like sardines in a can. All she could hope was that there would be a seat available.</p><p>\u201cSawyer works with the airlines. They owe him a favor. Don\u2019t worry\u2014it\u2019s all being taken care of.\u201d</p><p>Although the two friends seemed to have reached an understanding, it appeared Finn was still eager to send her on her way. She had to believe he\u2019d experienced the same tenderness and awareness she had. The electricity between them was powerful enough to light up a city block. Surely he felt it, too. Like her, it probably made him uncomfortable, and the best way he could deal with it was to send her packing.</p><p>Carrie could find no way of telling him that she wouldn\u2019t mind spending a few more days. That was crazy thinking on her part, but she couldn\u2019t shake this reluctance to leave. It seemed they were just beginning to come to an understanding, a willingness to explore whatever it was that was happening between them.</p><p>\u201cTime for lights out,\u201d Finn said, and his voice sounded odd, regretful.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d How she wished she knew what he was thinking.</p><p>He brought out the blankets and pillow for her. Carrie held out her arms to take the load, but he hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019re sure about this? I don\u2019t mind taking the sofa tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s generous, but a deal is a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight again.\u201d</p><p>He built up the fire and then returned to the bedroom. Carrie made her bed, sat on the sofa, and wrapped her arms around her bent knees.</p><p>To her surprise, Finn hadn\u2019t mentioned her article again. She half expected him to argue his case, demand that she honor his privacy. Instead, he\u2019d avoided the subject entirely. He hadn\u2019t sought out this notoriety, even if he had written one of the most intriguing and interesting books of the year. Although there was so much more she wanted to know about him, it seemed wrong to press the point. As far as she was concerned, the article was fast becoming secondary to everything else.</p><p>Eventually Carrie fell asleep, her mind full of Finn, the man she was just beginning to know and wished to know much better. He wasn\u2019t like anyone she\u2019d ever met, which intrigued her all the more. The businessmen and the community leaders she met at social functions were as different as night and day from a man like Finn, and yet she was strongly attracted to him. She found him more appealing than anyone she\u2019d recently dated, that was for sure.</p><p>For the last few months she\u2019d gone out with Dave Schneider a number of times. It wasn\u2019t anywhere close to serious. She enjoyed his company, but as a salesman, he traveled frequently, and their schedules didn\u2019t often mesh. While she had ample opportunities to date, the men she usually met were too slick, too polished, too caught up in themselves and their careers to appeal to her. She couldn\u2019t see making a life with anyone in her current social network.</p><p>At some point during the night, Carrie stirred awake to find Finn kneeling over her. Leaning up on one elbow, she rubbed the sleep from her eyes. \u201cIs it morning already?\u201d she asked. A sense of dread filled her. She didn\u2019t want to leave\u2014not yet. Not so soon.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cTake the bed. I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to argue but could see it would do her no good. Tossing aside the blanket, she started to get up but instead Finn effortlessly lifted her into his arms and carried her into his bedroom.</p><p>He pressed her down on the feather mattress and, leaning forward, kissed her brow. \u201cSleep tight,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Reaching up, she cupped the side of his face, his beard prickling her palm, and she smiled at him softly, silently wishing that he would kiss her for real. She moistened her lips, inviting him to take what she offered. Surely he could read the longing in her eyes; surely he knew what she wanted. Instead, he reluctantly straightened and left the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carrie tried but found she was unable to fall back to sleep. Apparently, Finn wasn\u2019t having much luck, either, because she could hear him moving about the outer room as if he was as restless as she was.</p><p>Seeking a comfortable position, Carrie tried sleeping on one side, then the other, and finally lay on her back, staring up at the ceiling. His room had a window, and after what seemed like an eternity, she tossed the thick covers away and climbed out of bed. Her feet made no sound as she walked over to the window and pushed the curtain to one side. Staring into the night, she looked up at the heavens.</p><p>Once more she was struck by the brilliant dark sky with countless stars. The moon was full and lit up the frozen lake like stage lighting. No wonder Finn loved Alaska. This was a magical place, beautiful and uncomplicated, so far removed from the craziness of city life.</p><p>After a while she returned to the main room to find Finn sitting at his desk. Right away he heard her and whirled around in his chair. He seemed surprised to find her awake.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep, either,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>He immediately closed the document on his computer, as if he didn\u2019t want her to see what he was writing.</p><p>\u201cAnother book?\u201d she dared to ask.</p><p>\u201cIf I admit it, will you put that in the article?\u201d The question was more of an accusation.</p><p>\u201cI ... I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>He closed the lid to the laptop.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re writing a sequel, I can tell you your readers will be more than thrilled.\u201d</p><p>He ignored the comment and glanced at his wrist. \u201cSawyer should be here within the hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d It seemed far too soon. She wasn\u2019t eager to leave. Finn\u2019s father\u2019s wedding band remained in her jeans pocket, and she thought to simply leave it in the cabin for him to find once she was gone. However, seeing his reaction to it earlier prompted her to keep it for now. She\u2019d return the gold ring to his mother at Christmas.</p><p>Sure enough, within the hour the sound of an approaching aircraft filled the house. The noise seemed to multiply, stirring up the atmosphere inside the cabin, building anticipation.</p><p>\u201cThat must be Sawyer,\u201d Finn said.</p> <p>Carrie nodded. Dragging her carry-on to the door, she checked the cabin to be sure she hadn\u2019t left anything behind.</p><p>Finn stood in the kitchen sipping coffee, as if, in these final moments, he wanted to keep as much distance between them as possible.</p><p>Hennessey barked, and rushed to the door, wanting out. Finn opened it just as the float plane bounced against the solid ice and skidded for several feet in the surrounding moonlight.</p><p>\u201cThe trip out here was my first experience in a single-engine plane,\u201d she said, more to fill the silence than to make a statement.</p><p>Without commenting, Finn reached for her suitcase and carried it outside. Carrie followed, a lump in her throat. That she should get all emotional over this farewell was an embarrassment. She was determined not to let Finn see how discombobulated she felt. It was ridiculous. She barely knew this man. He\u2019d let it be known she was a nuisance and considered himself well rid of her.</p><p>By the time she reached the plane, Finn had the passenger door open and her suitcase stored inside. He exchanged a few short sentences with Sawyer, but she couldn\u2019t hear what he said over the roar of the engine.</p><p>Carrie made sure she had a smile in place when he turned to face her. She hadn\u2019t thought what her last words to him would be, and so she said what came instinctively.</p><p>\u201cThank you for everything.\u201d</p> <p>Cupping her shoulders, Finn looked down on her, his dark eyes as intense as she could ever remember seeing them.</p><p>She met his gaze, wanting to tell him without words how much the last two days had meant to her, and how impressed she was with the man he was. She longed to thank him for opening her eyes to what it was to be with a man who was passionate about life and who had shared that passion through stories of life in Alaska.</p><p>Staring down at her, his hands tightened. He murmured something she didn\u2019t understand, and then he pulled her close as if he couldn\u2019t help himself and lowered his mouth to hers.</p><p>Carrie gave a small cry of welcome and gratitude and clung to him. Finn\u2019s hands cupped her face as he tilted her head to receive his kiss, which felt urgent and needy, needs that mirrored her own.</p><p>For a moment the sheer wonder of it nearly caused Carrie\u2019s knees to collapse from under her. This was exactly what she wanted, what she\u2019d hoped would happen. And his kiss was everything she could have imagined. More. Without fully being aware of what she was doing, Carrie locked her arms around his neck and kissed him back, wanting to return everything that he had given her.</p><p>After a long moment, Finn gradually released her from the kiss, but he still hugged her close and tight against him, half lifting her from the frozen lakebed.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Finn,\u201d she whispered close to his ear.</p><p>He kissed her neck and then whispered back, \u201cGood-bye.\u201d</p><p>She started to climb into the airplane but Finn stopped her by gripping hold of her hand. He looked deep into her eyes as if to gauge her reaction, and then leaned forward and said, \u201cCarrie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Her heart was in her eyes. Could it be possible that he would ask her to stay? Did it seem as wrong to him as it did to her that they should part now? Surely he felt the very things she did.</p><p>Leaning in close, he kissed her one last time and then said, \u201cDon\u2019t write the article.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>The wheels of the Boeing 737 bounced against the O\u2019Hare tarmac as the plane landed safely, jolting Carrie out of a light slumber. She hadn\u2019t slept as much on the long flight back to Chicago as she\u2019d hoped, which wasn\u2019t surprising. She glanced at her watch and realized she was still on Alaska time.</p><p>Finn time.</p><p>He\u2019d asked her not to write the article. Surely he understood what that meant. She\u2019d explained to him what this piece could do for her career. It would change everything for her. As she boarded the flight in Seattle, Carrie was forced to ask herself if invading his privacy was worth the cost. Perhaps the answer should seem obvious, but she still wasn\u2019t sure what she would do.</p><p>The temptation to ignore his request was strong. In every likelihood she might never see or hear from the elusive Finn Dalton again. Surely he understood how unreasonable he was being, how selfish, but then ... wasn\u2019t she being selfish, too?</p><p>Monday morning, after sleeping on it, Carrie had her answer. She wouldn\u2019t finish her story about Finn Dalton. No matter what happened or didn\u2019t happen between them, it wouldn\u2019t be worth the price. Every woman Finn had ever known had betrayed him, and she was determined not to be one of them. If there was a chance he would ever learn to trust and love again, then the path would start with her. It meant sacrifice on her end, but all she could do was hope that someday he would thank her. Someone else was sure to find him, one day, and the author of Alone would be exposed to the world, but she wouldn\u2019t be the reporter who did it.</p><p>Carrie wasn\u2019t at her desk two minutes before Sophie showed up, nearly bouncing with energy and excitement. \u201cWell?\u201d she asked expectantly. \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d</p><p>Glancing up at her friend, Carrie made sure her face didn\u2019t give anything away. \u201cGo?\u201d she repeated, as though she didn\u2019t understand the question.</p><p>\u201cDid you find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Finn Dalton?\u201d Carrie\u2019s mind scrambled with ways of answering without telling an outright lie. \u201cIt was a needle-in-a-haystack idea. I must have been out of my mind to think I could jet off to Alaska and stumble upon the one man half the world is dying to read about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but did you find him?\u201d</p><p>Leave it to Sophie to press the point. \u201cHonestly, would I be sitting here so glum if I had?\u201d She was in a blue funk, but it was due to other reasons. Lack of sleep, for one; missing Finn, for another. Really missing Finn. Thinking back on their final minutes together, there\u2019d been a hundred things she wished she\u2019d said, and she hadn\u2019t managed to get out even one coherent thought. Well, other than a generic \u201cthank you for everything.\u201d And \u201cgood-bye.\u201d How lame was that! Nor had she said good-bye to Hennessey.</p><p>Sawyer had certainly been curious, drilling her with questions much in the same way Sophie was just now.</p><p>\u201cSeems like you two got along just fine,\u201d the bush pilot had commented.</p><p>\u201cNot at first.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d chuckled. \u201cI can well imagine. You won him over, though, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d she asked Sawyer. She might never know the answer to that.</p><p>\u201cI thought for sure you had a chance,\u201d Sophie said, dragging Carrie back into the dreary present. Monday mornings were bad enough, but this Monday was even worse, especially on only a few hours\u2019 rest.</p><p>Carrie couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Finn, couldn\u2019t stop dreaming about him. If any two people were dissimilar, it was them, and yet the attraction had been magnetic and powerful. Now that she was gone, she wondered if she remained on his mind the way he did on hers.</p><p>\u201cHow disappointing for you,\u201d Sophie said, her eyes wide with sympathy.</p><p>\u201cI really thought I had a line on him, too,\u201d Carrie confessed. Only she was the one who\u2019d fallen\u2014hook, line, and sinker.</p><p>\u201cYou located his mother, though, right?\u201d Sophie leaned against the side of Carrie\u2019s desk and crossed her arms.</p><p>\u201cYes, and that got me really excited, but mother and son have been estranged since Finn was ten years old. All she really knew was that he was living in Alaska, and that it was close to Fairbanks. Unfortunately, her directions were too vague to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened when you got to Fairbanks?\u201d Sophie hopped up onto the corner of Carrie\u2019s desk as though she intended to stay awhile.</p><p>\u201cWell, for one thing, I discovered I wasn\u2019t the only reporter who\u2019d arrived out of the blue searching for the elusive Finn Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBush pilots. From what I heard, Finn is a pilot himself.\u201d Carrie had learned from Sawyer on their flight back that Finn owned a plane, which was currently in Fairbanks for a routine maintenance check.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWord of mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d Carrie was growing irritated with Sophie\u2019s questions. In retrospect, she wished she hadn\u2019t said anything. At the time, she\u2019d been too excited to keep the information to herself.</p><p>\u201cDid any of those pilots give you anything you could use?\u201d Sophie seemed obsessed with this, and Carrie was finding it difficult to give her friend ambiguous answers.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have work to do?\u201d Carrie asked instead.</p><p>\u201cYes, but it seems to me the bush pilots must know Finn and would tell you something, anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. Finn has very loyal friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have bribed them; did you think of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie, please, it\u2019s my first day back and I\u2019ve got a ton of stuff to catch up on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right. I just hope you aren\u2019t too disappointed.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not. I gave finding him my best shot and turned up empty. I can\u2019t do anything more than that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to give up just like that?\u201d Sophie appeared stunned. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like you at all.

Now it seems like you hardly care at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s because I\u2019m looking to keep the job I already have.

Sophie made it nearly impossible to continue this charade.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you to be so secretive.\u201d Sophie leaped off the desk and stood staring at Carrie as though she no longer recognized her friend. Then she sadly shook her head and returned to her own cubicle.</p><p>The tension between Carrie\u2019s shoulder blades gradually relaxed. She\u2019d passed the first test\u2014at least she hoped she had. Now all she had to do was concentrate on putting her energy into the society page and making the most of her current position. She couldn\u2019t help being disappointed. When it came to Finn, she\u2019d made her decision, and right or wrong, she was sticking to it. She cared too much to betray him.</p> <p>Her morning was completely eaten up by answering emails. She worked straight through lunch and grabbed coffee and a muffin around two. Her phone rang just as she sat back down at her desk. She reached for her extension with one hand and her coffee with the other.</p><p>\u201cCarrie Slayton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d The lone word sounded as if it had come from the moon.</p><p>Carrie nearly came out of her chair. It was Finn. \u201cWhat are you doing calling me here?\u201d she whispered in a near panic. She leaned halfway over her desk and kept her voice as low as possible.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see if you got back okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did.\u201d Carrie cupped her hand over the phone\u2019s mouthpiece. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t phone me here; it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to phone you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, oh, yes.\u201d She didn\u2019t bother to hide her enthusiasm. The sound of his voice washed over her, warming her, filling her with a rush of joy.</p><p>\u201cGive me your cell number, then,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>She rattled it off and had him repeat it to be sure he\u2019d written it down correctly. \u201cAre you on the satellite phone?\u201d she asked, her heart hammering wildly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you said it was expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and closed her eyes at the happiness that settled over her. \u201cDoes that mean you miss me?\u201d</p><p>He grumbled a phrase she didn\u2019t understand. \u201cIt must,\u201d he muttered. \u201cDoes that make you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cCan I call you tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said automatically, then realized she was covering an art gallery opening. \u201cNo, sorry. I\u2019ve got an assignment this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill there be lots of men around?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTons.\u201d</p><p>He grumbled again in the same vague way he had earlier.</p><p>\u201cAre you jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I be?\u201d</p><p>Carrie smiled. \u201cThat depends. If you\u2019re intimidated by clean-shaven, handsome men in slick black suits who hardly know which end of a car has the gas tank, then be my guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I\u2019m in the clear after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say so,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhat time will you be home?\u201d</p><p>Carrie wished she could give him a definite time. \u201cCan\u2019t say. Hopefully before eleven, but I can never predict how long these events will last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is one reason you dislike this society-page reporting as much as you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d She clung to the phone, not wanting to end the call, even if the cost was exorbitant. \u201cHow did you get my number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much of an investigative reporter if you need to ask that. I called the newspaper and asked to be connected to the society-page editor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Plainly, she wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. It came to her then the real reason behind his call. As much as she wanted to believe it was because he couldn\u2019t live without hearing the sound of her voice, she knew otherwise. \u201cYou called because you want to know if I\u2019ve reached a decision, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cIt\u2019s more than that, I ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d</p><p>The line went still and silent. \u201cAnd what did you decide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRest easy, Dr. Livingston, your secrets are safe with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLivingston. All the world was on a search to find him, too, if you remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could email me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your email address?\u201d</p><p>She gave him her private email address, unwilling to risk someone from the office stumbling upon their communication.</p><p>\u201cI should go,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d As much as she wanted to talk to him, someone might overhear and connect the dots. Lowering her voice, she added, \u201cCall me tonight, okay?\u201d It probably wasn\u2019t smart to let him know how eager she was to hear from him again, but she couldn\u2019t stop herself. She was falling for this guy. And falling hard.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Eleven your time, eight mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d No matter what, she intended to leave the art show in plenty of time to be home for Finn\u2019s call.</p><p>Somehow Carrie got through the evening, smiling at all the right times, taking down names, and making the most of the event for the following day\u2019s newspaper. Harry, the staff photographer, glanced her way suspiciously a couple of times.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asked, as they hurriedly walked toward the parking garage. She still had to write the story and get it in before the press deadline.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She played innocent, although she was practically trotting in her eagerness to escape.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you in such an all-fired hurry like this. You meeting someone later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, in complete honesty.</p><p>Harry shrugged. \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d</p><p>Carrie arrived back at her condo fifteen minutes early. She kicked off her shoes, wiggled out of her dress, shimmied out of her pantyhose, and grabbed her warmest pjs. She tossed back the covers to her bed, climbed in, and sat cross-legged with her cell phone clasped in her hand, waiting for Finn\u2019s call.</p><p>Twice she caught herself falling asleep, so when the phone rang, it surprised her and she nearly dropped it.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, and knew she sounded breathless. \u201cYou\u2019re right on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, yourself.\u201d</p><p>Right away she noticed that the call had a different sound to it. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFairbanks. I figured it would make talking to you a whole lot more convenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains why you sound as if you\u2019re in the next room instead of outer space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first call did come from outer space.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how did the art show opening go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry was suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Harry?\u201d</p><p>He sounded worried, which thrilled her. \u201cThe staff photographer, who\u2019s at least fifty and has a half-dozen kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean he was suspicious?\u201d</p><p>This was a bit more difficult to explain. \u201cHe could tell I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of the show; I kept glancing at my watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it would be better if we emailed.\u201d</p><p>She thought about that for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t need to worry about the time difference, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound reluctant. Is there a reason?\u201d</p><p>To this point, she hadn\u2019t done a decent job of hiding her feelings toward him, so now probably wasn\u2019t a good time to start. \u201cI like hearing the sound of your voice.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for a moment. \u201cI like hearing your voice, too. I have something for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her curiosity was instantly piqued.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t exactly call it that ... it\u2019s something I\u2019d like you to have. I\u2019ve already sent it off. I shipped it overnight, so you should have it tomorrow or Wednesday at the latest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Finn, I can\u2019t imagine what it could be.\u201d Her mind toyed with several possibilities. She\u2019d seen a number of items on the shelves in his cabin that interested her. A beautiful piece of scrimshaw was the first thing that came to mind, and another was a small wood carving. During her short visit she hadn\u2019t seen evidence that he carved wood, but it seemed like something that would interest him.</p><p>They spoke for a full hour, until Carrie found it impossible to smother her yawns any longer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exhausted,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI need to let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just a few minutes longer,\u201d she pleaded, yawning again.</p><p>\u201cCarrie, you\u2019re practically falling asleep while on the phone. I\u2019ll email you so when you wake up there\u2019ll be a message waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>She smiled sleepily and admitted, \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep very well the last couple of nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo will I. Sweet dreams,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>They would be sweet because they would be filled with Finn.</p><p>Six and a half hours later Carrie woke to the sound of her bedside alarm, feeling rested. Stretching her arms above her head, she arched her back and smiled contentedly. Then, remembering Finn\u2019s promise, she hurried out of bed and brewed a single cup of coffee while she logged on to her computer. Sure enough, Finn had sent her an email that included the tracking number for the surprise he had mailed her.</p><p>Later that same afternoon, a midsize box was delivered to her desk. Carrie knew immediately that it was from Finn.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Sophie asked, coming out of her cubicle.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She lifted the box and carefully shook it. That didn\u2019t tell her anything, though.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s it from?\u201d</p><p>Carrie pretended to read the return address. \u201cA friend,\u201d she said nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cMale or female?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMale. Like I said, a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t keep me in suspense. Open it.\u201d</p><p>Carrie was more than curious herself. She tore open the box to find it filled with those irritating packing peanuts. She had to dig deep into the box before she found her treasure.</p><p>When she pulled it free, Sophie immediately started to laugh. \u201cIs this someone\u2019s idea of a joke?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t have an answer. This was quite possibly the very last thing she would even have guessed that Finn could possibly mail her.</p><p>Inside the box, carefully packaged and protected with packing peanuts, was an antique toaster.</p><p>Chapter Eight </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>From:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>Sent: November 13, 2013</p><p>To:</p> <p>[email protected]</p><p>Subject: A toaster?</p><p>Finn,</p><p>You spent a fortune to mail me a toaster?

Call anytime. I\u2019m planning on listening to Christmas music, getting in the mood for the holidays, and sipping hot chocolate. Wish you were here.</p><p>Carrie</p><p>Finn leaned back in his chair and slowly exhaled. The picture of Carrie sipping hot chocolate and listening to Christmas music while waiting for his call filled his mind. That shouldn\u2019t surprise him. Carrie Slayton had dominated his thoughts from the moment she\u2019d left Alaska. And if he was honest, even before that, too.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. He\u2019d assumed that once she was out of sight he\u2019d be able to forget her. That hadn\u2019t happened. If anything, it was ten times worse\u2014thoughts of Carrie hounded him. He went to sleep thinking about her, and when he woke, she was right there, filling his mind and his heart.</p><p>Even Hennessey missed her. She\u2019d won over his dog in record time, and now that she was gone, Hennessey moped around, his tail between his legs. His eighty-pound dog acted like a lost and lonely puppy. That shouldn\u2019t be any surprise, seeing that Finn had reacted much the same since she\u2019d left.</p><p>Whatever was happening to him didn\u2019t sit well. This was a dead-end relationship, and the sooner he accepted that, the better off they both would be.</p><p>And yet ... Finn couldn\u2019t forget Carrie. It was bad enough that she was in the forefront of his thoughts during the day, but it was getting worse, as she had invaded his dreams as well. The kiss they shared was what had started it all. He\u2019d managed to restrain himself from taking her in his arms until the very last minute. Once she was gone, life would right itself again. He even managed to convince himself this attraction was a simple matter of proximity. Naturally, they were attracted to each other, he\u2019d reasoned. They were both young and single, and they\u2019d been cooped up together for nearly forty-eight hours. As soon as she was gone, life would return to normal.</p><p>Carrie had been back in Chicago nearly a week now, and it hadn\u2019t happened. It was as if Carrie had indelibly stamped his heart with her own brand and he was marked for life.</p><p>What Finn feared most was repeating the mistake his father had made and falling in love with the wrong woman. After his mother left, Finn\u2019s father was never the same again. When they learned Joan had remarried, it had about killed the man. In his entire life, his father had only loved one woman. Now, just like his father, Finn was irresistibly drawn to a woman who was his opposite in far too many ways. It was enough to send warning bells ringing so loud they threatened to activate an avalanche.</p><p>He glanced at his watch, calculating the time difference between Fairbanks and Chicago. Carrie would be home by now, unless she was meeting a friend for dinner. Instantly, Finn\u2019s gut tightened and his blood pressure spiked. He couldn\u2019t bear the thought of Carrie with another man. It drove him to madness. Never having experienced jealousy this strong, he found the emotion distressing and worrisome.</p><p>This was the end of it. He was finished walking around like a wounded moose. He made the decision right then and there not to contact her again. But an immediate sense of emptiness and loss settled over him. After talking to her nearly every day and sharing an almost constant flow of emails, cutting off their relationship abruptly wouldn\u2019t be good. He\u2019d ease himself out of it, he reasoned, and instantly he felt better. Baby steps. That decided, he made a second decision\u2014no further contact with her for the rest of the day.</p><p>Restless now, he stalked the condo and then decided to get out and do something. He headed to a local hangout, had a beer with one of his friends, and before he knew it, he was back in his condo.</p><p>Immediately his gaze flew to the telephone. He tilted back his head and stared at the ceiling. Unable to stop himself, he reached for his cell. He wouldn\u2019t contact her tomorrow. But for now she was impossible to resist. He dialed Carrie\u2019s number, as eager to hear the sound of her voice as a starved man is for nourishment. Oh, yes, he had it bad.</p><p>The phone rang, and Carrie nearly stumbled over her own feet in her eagerness to get to it.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d She nearly blurted out Finn\u2019s name but stopped herself in the nick of time. They\u2019d spoken every day, sometimes two and three times. Finn had upgraded his cell phone so they could now text when he was in Fairbanks. He seemed to commute between the cabin and his condo on a regular basis.</p><p>\u201cCarrie, it\u2019s Mom. What\u2019s up with you, honey? We\u2019ve hardly spoken to you since you got back to Chicago. The only time we\u2019ve talked is when Dad and I called you about your Christmas gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom,\u201d Carrie tried to hide the disappointment in her voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve been meaning to call.\u201d Which was true.</p><p>\u201cI have to tell you, honey, Thanksgiving just won\u2019t be the same without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I wish I could be there, too.\u201d Carrie was upset about it herself. This was the choice she\u2019d made before flying to Alaska. The thought of spending the holiday alone filled her with dismay. She would miss the huge family gathering for the first time in her life.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t like you not to call.\u201d</p><p>This was a bit more difficult to explain. \u201cWell, for one thing, being away from my desk for so long means I\u2019m swamped at the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, honey, you know your father and I are dying to hear what happened in Fairbanks; we\u2019ve only heard snippets. Tell us more about Finn Dalton. Everyone here wants to know what he\u2019s like and if the things he wrote about in his book could really be true.\u201d</p><p>Carrie\u2019s stomach twisted in a huge knot. \u201cMom, who have you told about me meeting Finn?\u201d</p><p>Her mother must have heard the panic in Carrie\u2019s voice, because she asked, \u201cAre you keeping it a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she nearly shouted. \u201cThis is important. Please don\u2019t mention my meeting Finn to anyone, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, but surely once the article\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t going to be an article.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019ve come to know Finn and want to respect his privacy.\u201d Her voice softened as her mind traveled back to the moment when he\u2019d passionately kissed her and held her in his arms before she boarded the flight with Sawyer.</p><p>\u201cCarrie?\u201d her mother said. \u201cYou better tell me what happened between you and this wilderness man. And don\u2019t try to hide it from me. Clearly there\u2019s something going on here; I can hear it in your voice.\u201d</p><p>Carrie swore her mother had special radar where she was concerned. It seemed she was unable to keep anything from her mother, and perhaps that was a good thing. Besides, Carrie felt like she would burst if she couldn\u2019t talk about her feelings for Finn. The way she\u2019d been lately with her head in a cloud was causing all kinds of speculation among her friends, especially Sophie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m falling in love with Finn Dalton.\u201d It felt good to admit it, good to say out loud what was already in her heart.</p><p>Her announcement was followed by a short, stunned silence. \u201cAfter only two days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it sound crazy?\u201d Then, before she could stop herself, Carrie blurted out nearly the entire story right to the point when he\u2019d kissed her and asked Carrie not to write the article.</p><p>\u201cLove is a strong emotion after such a short acquaintance,\u201d her mother warned softly.</p><p>\u201cI agree, I do, but I can\u2019t help how I feel. It was all sorts of crazy and wonderful. Finn and I were playing cribbage, and I looked up at him and something happened. Something physical. All at once my pulse started racing and I looked at this burly, unshaven man and I thought Finn Dalton was the most attractive, appealing man I\u2019d ever met. At first I tried to ignore it, tried to rationalize this attraction away with an entire list of excuses why a relationship between us simply wouldn\u2019t work. It hasn\u2019t done me any good. And since I\u2019ve left Fairbanks, that feeling has grown stronger and stronger. He\u2019s on my mind nearly every minute of the day. It\u2019s like I\u2019m only half alive since I returned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear, you do have it bad,\u201d her mother said with a sympathetic sigh.</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t need her mother to tell her the obvious.</p><p>\u201cBut surely there\u2019s a way for you to write the article and maintain the relationship,\u201d her mother suggested. \u201cYou could write it and give it to him to read and approve. That way he would have control over what information was released to the public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought of that, too.\u201d Her mind had worked its way around several scenarios, but in the end she feared even approaching Finn with the idea would be a breach of trust.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he realize what that article would do for you and your career?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows. Finn didn\u2019t ask for this notoriety when he wrote his book. He doesn\u2019t want the focus to be on him but on the beauty of the land and the adventures that await those willing to explore the great outdoors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he should have thought of that before he wrote the book.\u201d</p><p>In theory, Carrie agreed, but Finn had had no idea how popular his tales of life in Alaska would be. \u201cDo you know why he decided to write Alone?\u201d she said, thinking back over a recent conversation. \u201cHe said he saw what was happening to men and boys in America, addicted to computer games. People are not getting outside and enjoying the outdoors and the wilderness nearly enough. He wanted to awaken a sense of adventure in people to get excited about what\u2019s outside their front doors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI wonder if he knows all the outdoor groups his book has inspired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him about that, but I don\u2019t believe he truly grasps the extent of it. I think he finds it all rather humbling. Finn never sought the national spotlight. In hindsight, I wonder if he\u2019d have written the book if he\u2019d known what a sensation it would cause.\u201d His motives were good. If Carrie had learned anything in the time they\u2019d been together, it was that he deeply loved Alaska and that he had respect for nature. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSweetheart, just where do you think this relationship is headed?\u201d her mother asked, clearly concerned for Carrie.</p><p>She appreciated her mother\u2019s question. \u201cI don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t think Finn does, either.

It looks like an antique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me right. A toaster. I realize it probably has some special significance to him that he wanted to share with me. But if that\u2019s the case, he hasn\u2019t explained it yet. I have it in my kitchen.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother chuckled. \u201cOh, dear, Carrie. Listen, honey. I don\u2019t want to burst your bubble. You\u2019re new into this relationship, and this is a honeymoon period, but soon enough reality is going to settle in. I don\u2019t want you to set yourself up for heartache. Just be careful, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, Mom.\u201d And while she agreed, Carrie couldn\u2019t help thinking that love would see her and Finn through any obstacle. She was crazy for this guy, toaster and all.</p><p>Once they\u2019d finished chatting, Carrie returned to her computer. Finn was scheduled to phone, but he hadn\u2019t, which concerned her. Just then her cell phone chirped, letting her know she had a text message.</p><p>Carrie grabbed her phone.</p><p>What are you doing?</p> <p>Listening to \u201cMary, Did You Know,\u201d which was playing softly in the background. It was one of her favorite Christmas songs.</p><p>A little early for Christmas music, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>Reading Finn\u2019s text, she punched in her answer. Not for me. Besides, you have your Christmas decorations in your cabin. How are they holding up?</p><p>He responded within seconds. Snowflakes dangling from my ceiling. Utterly ridiculous.</p><p>But they are still up?</p><p>Yes. Remind me of you.</p> <p>Very sweet, thank you.</p><p>I look at them and think of the stars we saw that night.</p><p>That incredible starry night. Makes me miss being with you all the more.</p><p>G-r-r-r. Hennessey misses you.</p><p>Hennessey? What about you?</p><p>Finn texted back a smiley face.</p><p>Carrie laughed. She had just tucked her cell phone in her jeans pocket when it rang. A sweet joy went through her when she saw it was Finn. So she was going to get her phone call after all.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cHi. It seemed ridiculous to be texting you when we could be talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. You must be in Fairbanks. I had no idea you spent that much time in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenerally, I don\u2019t. Fact is, until these last few days, it\u2019s been weeks since I was at the condo.\u201d</p><p>In other words, he\u2019d come into town in order to be able to communicate more easily with her. Finn wasn\u2019t a romantic man. The fact that he would mail her a toaster told her it was highly unlikely that he would look to win her heart with flowers or jewels.</p><p>\u201cI had bread from my toaster for breakfast this morning.\u201d She mentioned this so he\u2019d know that she\u2019d put his gift to good use.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t much of a breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in a hurry to get to church. I\u2019m in the choir, and we had an early practice for the Christmas pageant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sing, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an alto. I harmonize well. Come to think of it, I play well with others, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly you\u2019re a woman of many talents.\u201d</p><p>She ran her fingers through a tousle of dark curls. \u201cI\u2019d like to think so.\u201d</p><p>They spoke for an hour until her cell phone battery was nearly depleted. Before they ended their conversation, Finn told her he would be out of reach for a couple of days, checking the pipeline outside of Fairbanks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll survive,\u201d she assured him. Although she made it sound as if it wouldn\u2019t trouble her, she was already dreading not hearing from him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll survive, but I\u2019m not sure about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinn.\u201d She laughed, her heart warmed by his words. \u201cThat\u2019s the most romantic thing you\u2019ve ever said to me.\u201d</p><p>He snickered softly. \u201cI\u2019m not a romantic kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sort of guessed that, which makes these little comments precious. I\u2019ll miss hearing from you, too.\u201d</p><p>He grumbled as if he didn\u2019t quite know how to respond.</p><p>\u201cOh, before you go, I wanted to tell you that I\u2019ll be in Chicago for Thanksgiving\u2014it\u2019ll be my first alone, but I\u2019ll be in Seattle for Christmas.\u201d She mentioned this with the hope that he would take the hint and fly down for a visit. Seattle was relatively close to him, much closer than Chicago. When he didn\u2019t immediately pick up on her hint, she added, \u201cMy parents feel bad that I won\u2019t be with everyone on Thanksgiving, so for Christmas they\u2019re giving me a ticket to fly home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated and then asked with what seemed like reluctance, \u201cHave you talked to my mother since your return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I haven\u2019t had a chance to get in touch with her. I know she\u2019s anxious to hear what happened with the ring.\u201d Truth was, Carrie felt terrible having to tell Joan that her plan had backfired. Given the turn in her relationship with Finn, maybe she\u2019d hang on to the ring a bit longer, rather than returning it at Christmas, as she\u2019d planned.</p><p>\u201cDoes my mother need anything?\u201d he asked. His voice was low, concerned, and different from the teasing banter they had exchanged earlier.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s well physically, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. As for her other needs, there was only one thing I picked up on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d</p><p>Carrie knew she was wading into deep waters, but she felt she had to try. Finn\u2019s mother had entrusted her with something precious, and she wanted to repay the favor. \u201cShe needs her son.\u201d</p><p>His response was a dismissive snort.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought you\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch in a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Not being able to talk to him for even a short amount of time would feel like an eternity. \u201cI have a busy week with the holidays close and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going to be with Harry?\u201d he asked, mentioning the staff photographer.</p><p>Now it was Carrie\u2019s turn to hesitate. \u201cFor a couple of events, and then I\u2019ll be out the Tuesday before Thanksgiving with a ... friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA male friend?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to mislead Finn. \u201cDave and I set this up a while ago, Finn. Trust me, you don\u2019t have anything to worry about.\u201d</p><p>He grumbled something unintelligible.</p><p>This was another romantic jewel he offered her without even realizing what he was doing. Carrie\u2019s smile took up her entire face. \u201cI love it that you\u2019re jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not jealous,\u201d he insisted. \u201cJust concerned. No guy likes the idea of his girl spending time with some other guy.\u201d</p><p>Oh, boy, he walked right into that. \u201cAm I your girl, Finn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould a guy send you a toaster if you weren\u2019t?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou have me there,\u201d she said, smiling. Her phone beeped, reminding her that her battery was almost dead. \u201cI really need to recharge my phone. Fly safely, Finn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always fly safely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd hug Hennessey for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want a hug, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a bare minimum, but I\u2019d like a whole lot more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo would I,\u201d she whispered, before she ended the call.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you lately?\u201d Sophie asked Wednesday afternoon as they waited in line to order lunch.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Carrie pretended to be reading the menu posted on the wall above the cashier. She almost always ordered the same thing. Egg-salad sandwich on wheat with a small garden salad, ranch dressing on the side.</p><p>\u201cEver since you were away you\u2019ve been ... I don\u2019t know, different, I guess. Happier.\u201d</p><p>Carrie smiled. Oh, yes, she was happier.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met someone, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>How could she deny it and keep a straight face? \u201cCould be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie, it isn\u2019t like you to keep secrets. It\u2019s the guy who sent you that joke gift, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe toaster isn\u2019t a joke, but yes, and if you must know, his name is Paul.\u201d Middle name, she added silently.</p><p>\u201cPaul is from Seattle?\u201d</p><p>Technically, that was where Finn was born. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his story? Is he married? Is that the reason you\u2019re keeping this to yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried? Of course not.\u201d It irritated Carrie that Sophie would believe she\u2019d even consider dating a married man. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll order the curried chicken-salad sandwich instead of my usual egg salad. I\u2019m in the mood to live on the edge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re changing the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Get the hint, Sophie. I\u2019ll tell you more when there\u2019s more to tell. For now, I\u2019m not talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, then, have it your way,\u201d Sophie pouted.</p><p>Carrie\u2019s cell phone beeped.</p><p>I\u2019m back. It was Finn.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Sophie demanded, attempting to look over Carrie\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Carrie ignored her and stepped up to the counter to place her lunch order. When it was Sophie\u2019s turn, she grabbed her phone and texted back. Can\u2019t talk now.</p><p>Have you missed me?</p><p>Oh, yes. Am having lunch with snoopy friend.</p><p>Got ya. In an hour?</p><p>OK.</p><p>She dropped her phone back inside her purse just before Sophie rejoined her. They found a vacant spot, set their order numbers on the table, and then went for their drinks. Carrie was antsy to talk to Finn. Two days had never seemed so long. She was dying to know if he\u2019d missed talking to her nearly half as much as she\u2019d missed chatting with him.</p><p>Carrie had her coffee and Sophie her soft drink when they reclaimed their table.</p><p>\u201cWe should talk about the party,\u201d Sophie said. Their orders arrived, and she thanked the waiter with a smile.</p><p>Party? What party? Then Carrie remembered that just before she left for Alaska they\u2019d decided to host a small party in Carrie\u2019s condo after Thanksgiving. Her place was bigger and could accommodate more guests.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking the first week of December. Friday or Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d Carrie mentally reviewed her calendar. As far as she could remember, both days were clear.</p><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t get the word out soon, it won\u2019t happen. Besides, everyone gets so busy this time of year.\u201d</p><p>Sophie was a party girl, and Carrie had agreed, looking to make the most of the holiday season.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d throw together a few appetizers and bring out the eggnog. Four or five couples should keep it manageable. We don\u2019t need to make a huge thing out of it\u2014just a few friends getting together to celebrate the holidays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, sure.\u201d</p><p>Sophie reached for the pepper shaker and doused her Oriental chicken salad. \u201cYou going to ask Dave?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was Carrie\u2019s Tuesday-night theater date. \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of this other guy?\u201d</p><p>Sophie was digging for information, but Carrie wasn\u2019t going to let anything out. In response, she shrugged.</p><p>\u201cDavid\u2019s a prize, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor someone else, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, he\u2019d like to be more than a friend.\u201d</p><p>Carrie had sensed as much. But even before she met Finn she knew it wasn\u2019t happening for her. She felt vastly different when it came to Finn. He was a man\u2019s man. Dave was personable and fun, but he wouldn\u2019t be able to last a day on his own in an Alaskan winter. He wouldn\u2019t even know where to start in order to survive. Oh, he could dress like a male model and flatter a woman with compliments and sweet talk. In simple terms, he wasn\u2019t, and would never be, another Finn.</p><p>As they munched through their meal they quickly pared down the guest list. Sophie promised to send out email invites that afternoon. A little more than two weeks wasn\u2019t much notice, but it should be adequate.</p><p>Eager to hear from Finn, Carrie rushed back to the office and straight to her cubicle. She still had one sleeve in her coat when she grabbed her cell phone and texted Finn.</p> <p>I\u2019m back in the office.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for him to reply. Snoopy friend?</p><p>Need to be careful; suspicions running rampant. Told her you were from Seattle, which you are, right?</p><p>Born there.</p><p>Close enough.</p><p>Sophie?</p> <p>Yes. Talk tonight?</p><p>OK.</p><p>Carrie had her phone tucked back inside her purse and her coat off when her desk phone rang. She answered the way she always did. \u201cCarrie Slayton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie?\u201d</p><p>The voice on the other end of the line was vaguely familiar.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Joan Reese, Finn Dalton\u2019s mother. I hope you don\u2019t mind me contacting you, but I hadn\u2019t heard from you and I\u2019ve been anxious for news of my son.\u201d</p><p>Carrie felt dreadful that she\u2019d delayed getting in touch with Finn\u2019s mother. \u201cJoan, I am so sorry. I\u2019ve been meaning to call.\u201d She started to make a convenient excuse, the way she had with her own family, then stopped herself.</p><p>\u201cWere you able to talk to Finn?\u201d Joan asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Carrie couldn\u2019t find the words to tell this gentle woman that Finn wanted nothing to do with her or the wedding band Joan had asked her to deliver.</p><p>\u201cDid you give him the ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried.\u201d That should tell her what had happened without Carrie going into a long explanation.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d In a single word, her disappointment rang like a cathedral bell.</p><p>Carrie lowered her voice for fear someone might be listening in on the conversation. \u201cI spent two days alone with him at his cabin outside of Fairbanks. Well, his dog was with us, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d Joan asked, with such longing that it nearly brought tears to Carrie\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Carrie hardly knew how to answer, knowing she meant more than Finn\u2019s physical well-being. Joan hungered for information, and Carrie didn\u2019t have those kinds of answers. \u201cHe\u2019s doing well,\u201d she started off. \u201cHe looks good. He has a big dog named Hennessey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHennessey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. When I first saw him I thought he was a wolf, interested in dinner and that meal was me.\u201d She hoped the story would bring levity to their conversation.</p><p>Joan laughed softly. \u201cPaul must have named him. Hennessey was his mother\u2019s maiden name.\u201d</p><p>Carrie remembered how the large dog had spent the night warming her and longed to see him again.</p><p>Joan hesitated. \u201cFinn wouldn\u2019t take the ring, would he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but he did ask after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d How quickly joy flooded her words. \u201cThat gives me hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a positive sign. Given time, I think Finn will come around, I really do.\u201d Carrie couldn\u2019t leave the older woman without some positive news. Perhaps in time Carrie would be able to influence Finn to give his mother another chance.</p><p>Joan softly sighed. \u201cI hope you\u2019re right. I really appreciate your efforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might not realize it yet, but one day Finn will figure out that he needs you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Carrie.\u201d Joan said, and she seemed to struggle to sound encouraged. \u201cI won\u2019t keep you any longer. I apologize for contacting you at your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoan, before I let you go I need to ask you something ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinn mailed me a gift. It\u2019s a toaster, a really old one. I asked him about it, but his answers have been vague. Is there some significance to it?\u201d</p><p>His mother started to laugh. \u201cHe gave you the toaster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I have it in my kitchen ... I\u2019ve been using it.\u201d</p><p>Joan exhaled and seemed to be gathering her thoughts. \u201cPaul bought that toaster for me when we were first dating. My goodness, I had no idea he\u2019d kept it. That toaster is nearly forty years old. It was the first sign I had that Paul had any feelings for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think Finn would want me to have it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear, isn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d she asked, and appeared to get real enjoyment out of the telling. \u201cMy son is crazy about you. He\u2019s repeating what his father did when he first fell in love with me. Finn is telling you the only way he knows how that you\u2019re important to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s important to me, too.\u201d</p><p>The line went silent for a moment. \u201cOh, dear. Are you in love with my son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Carrie said, lowering her voice. She wasn\u2019t sure why she hesitated. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, plainly, distinctly. They\u2019d known each other less than a month and yet her heart knew. No man had ever made her feel the way she did about Finn.</p><p>\u201cProceed carefully, my dear,\u201d Joan warned. \u201cIf Finn is anything like his father, and I suspect he is, then he doesn\u2019t give his heart lightly; he loves deeply, completely, and when he\u2019s hurt he\u2019ll react like a wounded grizzly bear.\u201d</p><p>Carrie mulled over Finn\u2019s mother\u2019s words the rest of the afternoon. The conversation with her own mother lingered in her mind as well. She and Finn were very different people, living in entirely different worlds. She was a girly girl, just as her email address claimed, and he lived and worked in the Alaskan wilderness. The practical side of Carrie reminded her that they had little in common, but her heart was unwilling to listen.</p><p>Carrie\u2019s mother had referred to this as the honeymoon part of the relationship, when they were so caught up in the intensity of their feelings that they willingly ignored their differences. It was easy to do, which was exactly what her mother was trying to tell her.</p><p>Finn\u2019s mother, too, had issued her own dire warning. It seemed everyone she told about her and Finn was filled with doubts about the two of them. One reason Carrie hadn\u2019t told Sophie about Finn was because she knew her best friend would become a naysayer as well, and Carrie didn\u2019t want to hear it.</p><p>That evening Carrie was anxious to talk to Finn. She sat on the sofa with her legs tucked under her and the phone clenched tightly in her hand, ready to answer the instant he rang. Her thick, wild hair was tied at the base of her neck with a scrunchie.</p><p>By the time he phoned, Carrie felt ready to weep. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you called,\u201d she blurted out the minute she heard his voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He was immediately concerned.</p><p>\u201cYour mother. My mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? You talked to my mother?\u201d He didn\u2019t sound happy about it, either.</p><p>\u201cOh, sure, get upset with me, too, that\u2019s all I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie, take a deep breath and start at the beginning.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled deeply and then exhaled. \u201cMy mom and I spoke recently, and she warned me about falling for you ... she said right now nothing seems impossible, but eventually we\u2019re going to have to face our differences.\u201d</p><p>The line went silent as he seemed to take in her mother\u2019s words of wisdom. \u201cAnd my mother said the same thing,\u201d he said gruffly, sounding annoyed.</p><p>\u201cMore or less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that worries you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I don\u2019t want it to, but it does. It\u2019s been nearly three weeks since I last saw you and it feels like an eternity. Is it really possible to feel this strongly about someone I\u2019ve known only a short while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to call it quits now and save us both a lot of hassle and heartache?\u201d he asked starkly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her response was vehement and instant. \u201cAre you saying that\u2019s what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. I found myself whistling the other day. I haven\u2019t whistled since I was a kid. I climbed into bed at the cabin the other night and I felt your presence from just that small amount of time you slept in my bed. I rested better than I have in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Finn, you make me want to cry.\u201d Carrie didn\u2019t know why she\u2019d thought this man couldn\u2019t be romantic.</p><p>\u201cSawyer just looks at me and shakes his head, as if he no longer recognizes me. I\u2019m not alone, either. Hennessey mopes around the cabin, looking lost and miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same with me. What\u2019s happened to us? I think about you and then my insides get all mushy and I feel like I want to cry because I have no idea when I\u2019ll see you again,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She heard the sound of him exhaling. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to make any decisions tonight, do we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t give you up yet, Carrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have to give me up at all?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo I have to give you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, and hopefully not for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she whispered, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t think I could bear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he said with some enthusiasm. \u201cNow that we have that settled, let\u2019s talk about something else. Tell me about this hot date of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Finn, honestly, you have nothing to fear from Dave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so his name is Dave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nice guy, but he would never think to give a woman a toaster. He doesn\u2019t have a heart nearly as big as yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realize I\u2019m going to be worrying about you with this guy the entire time you\u2019re out with him.\u201d</p><p>His words cheered her considerably. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sure. It will keep you on your toes. If this kind of competition continues, I could end up with a can opener that matches that toaster.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>The night of her dinner date with Dave, Carrie hurried home from the office in order to change clothes. Cool, suave, sophisticated Dave. Finn had been suspiciously quiet all day. She hadn\u2019t received a single text from him in nearly twenty-four hours, which was unusual. She knew he was concerned about her going to the theater, even with a friend, and seemed to view any man she saw as a potential threat. It was clear he didn\u2019t have a clue how head-over-heels nuts she was over him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Perhaps she was living in a fool\u2019s garden, not thinking about the future. Frankly, she didn\u2019t care what chances anyone gave their relationship. Finn felt as much a part of her now as her arms and legs.</p><p>She changed clothes but kept her cell phone handy, hoping to hear the ding that would tell her she had a text message. The earlier one she\u2019d sent him remained unanswered. Perhaps he\u2019d returned to the lake cabin, but it seemed he would have mentioned it, if that was the case.</p><p>Once she refreshed her makeup, she glanced out the window and saw that the snow, which had been threatening most of the afternoon, had started to fall in thick flakes. With the holidays so close, everyone seemed preoccupied. Carrie had gotten three invitations to parties and other social events from friends. Sophie had invited Carrie to join her family for Thanksgiving. Knowing she would be alone, even Harry had extended an invite. Carrie had declined both invitations, feeling she would be an add-on. She would have her own Thanksgiving, she decided, and make the best of it by herself.</p><p>The last time she\u2019d seen snow she\u2019d been with Finn and Hennessey. The reminder made her miss them both dreadfully.</p> <p>Unable to bear this silence any longer, she reached for her cell and typed out with practiced ease. Miss you.</p><p>Almost right away she got a response. Good.</p><p>Where have you been all day? Finn had to know she\u2019d been anxiously waiting to hear from him.</p><p>In the air. Still have your hot date tonight?</p><p>In the air? That didn\u2019t make sense\u2014a flight to Fairbanks from his cabin was less than thirty minutes. Are you jealous?</p> <p>You bet.</p><p>Carrie grinned, and a warm sensation came over her. It\u2019s snowing here; makes me miss you all the more.</p><p>I know it\u2019s snowing in Chicago.</p><p>You know it\u2019s snowing?????</p><p>Big, fat flakes.</p><p>Carrie gasped, and her fingers moved with urgency across the tiny alphabet on her cell phone. Finn, where are you?</p> <p>Chicago.</p><p>She hardly had time to take in the fact that Finn was in town before her phone rang. She hit the answer button so hard the cell nearly dropped out of her hands.</p><p>\u201cSurprise,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Carrie wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. Laugh because she was so happy and excited and then weep because she had this stupid date and wouldn\u2019t be able to see him until the end of the evening.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>He named a local hotel about two blocks from her condo. \u201cI know it\u2019s crazy, my being here. I didn\u2019t want you to be alone over Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s crazy or not; I\u2019m too happy to care.\u201d Carrie just hoped she didn\u2019t embarrass herself when she first saw him by launching into his arms and bursting into tears. She\u2019d dreamed about seeing him again. He hadn\u2019t said a word that he was planning this. Not a single solitary word.</p><p>\u201cDo you still have to go to the theater?\u201d he asked, and then instantly withdrew the question. \u201cForget I asked. Of course you do. I\u2019ll be here at the hotel waiting, and when you get back to your apartment, let me know.\u201d</p> <p>Her doorbell chimed, announcing Dave\u2019s arrival. \u201cI hope you realize this is torture,\u201d she told Finn on her way to answer the front door.</p><p>\u201cFor you or for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor us both.\u201d Carrie had no idea how she was going to get through this evening, knowing Finn was in town.</p><p>\u201cGo. It\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Finn encouraged her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but you\u2019re going to suffer for doing this to me.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and ended the call.</p><p>Carrie took a moment to compose herself before she opened the door. Dave was impeccably dressed for the evening. He really was an attractive man, but she didn\u2019t feel even the slightest stirrings for him. Just thinking about Finn waiting for her in his hotel room had her pulse spinning at the rate of a jet engine.</p><p>The Christmas musical they went to see, which had gotten rave reviews, didn\u2019t hold Carrie\u2019s attention, but to be fair, she doubted she would have appreciated anything outside of a five-alarm fire. Somehow she got through the evening, although she felt it was only fair to tell Dave that she\u2019d met someone else. Their relationship had never really gone beyond friendship, and he took her news well.</p><p>Straight from the theater, Dave drove her to her home and briefly parked outside the condo complex. The snow had stopped, but traffic was a mess. It went without saying that he didn\u2019t need to see her up. She thanked him for the evening, and then before she climbed out of the car she impulsively hugged him. He\u2019d been decent and thoughtful, and she was grateful for his friendship.</p><p>\u201cI hope it works with you and the other guy,\u201d he said, and didn\u2019t seem to have any hard feelings.</p><p>\u201cI do, too.\u201d Carrie wished that more than anything.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a lucky guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let him know you said so.\u201d She smiled as she said it.</p><p>Climbing out of the car, she gathered her coat more securely around her and made a dash for the building\u2019s entrance. Dave waited until she was inside the foyer, and Carrie waved before he drove off. The instant he was out of sight, she opened her clutch to retrieve her cell phone. Right away, she sent Finn a text.</p><p>I\u2019m home.</p><p>I know.</p><p>She glanced up to find Finn standing on the other side of the building\u2019s glass door. For a moment, all she could do was stare at him. She shivered with the cold, but he wore no jacket. All he had on was a yellow-and-black plaid shirt, jeans, and boots. In her entire life she\u2019d never seen a more strongly appealing man. Hurrying to the locked security door, she opened it for him. Even before he was inside, she was wrapped in his embrace.</p><p>Carrie looped her arms around his neck, hugging him and laughing with joy. Right away, Finn swept her off her feet. With his arms around her waist, he lifted her so that her shoes dangled several inches off the ground. With her hands framing his bearded face, they kissed as if they couldn\u2019t get enough, as if they meant to consume each other right in the center of the lobby.</p><p>A man\u2019s voice broke through the fog of longing and joy. \u201cMs. Slayton? Ms. Slayton?\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Carrie ended the kiss and looked over her shoulder to find Lester, the security guard, closely studying her.</p><p>\u201cYou know this man?\u201d Lester asked.</p><p>She smiled and nodded. \u201cLester, this is\u2014\u201d</p><p>Finn released her and stretched out his hand to the guard. \u201cPaul. Paul Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to meet you, Paul. I apologize if I was rude earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d</p><p>Carrie was curious to know what that was all about. \u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs,\u201d she said, and steered Finn toward the elevator. She waited until they were inside and the doors had closed. \u201cI\u2019m glad you were clearheaded enough to tell him your name is Paul.\u201d</p><p>Finn smiled down at her \u201cClearheaded? You\u2019re joking, right?\u201d</p><p>Carrie laughed and cuddled close to his side. They had their arms around each other. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about Lester being rude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. He didn\u2019t like the idea of unsavory types hanging around the building and asked what my business was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnsavory types?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh, just let me kiss you again.\u201d</p><p>Carrie wasn\u2019t about to argue with him. They were completely consumed with each other when the elevator stopped on the twenty-fifth floor and the door glided open. Finn reluctantly broke off the kiss and thrust out his arm to stop the doors from closing on them.</p><p>Using her code, Carrie let them into her apartment, wondering what Finn would think when he stepped inside the ultra-exclusive high-rise. It was a one-bedroom unit that she\u2019d rented because of its close proximity to the newspaper office and the incredible views of the city it offered.</p><p>Staring out the picture window, Finn stood with his back to her. \u201cI\u2019m a bit out of my element.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping her arms around him, she pressed the side of her face against his back. \u201cI think we\u2019re both way out of our comfort zones.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and folded his rough, muscled hands over hers. \u201cTrue enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was either fly to see you or go slowly mad wondering about you and that pretty boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw Dave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you hug him. He\u2019s darn lucky he didn\u2019t try to kiss you; otherwise, I would have been forced to drag him out of that car and send him flying into the closest snowbank.\u201d</p><p>Carrie laughed at the mental picture. Dave was a pretty boy, but he wouldn\u2019t have stood still for Finn\u2019s he-man tactics.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m joking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Finn, if only you knew how close you are to my heart.\u201d</p><p>He turned and nearly crushed her in his arms before he slowly released her. \u201cI\u2019ve never been the jealous sort, but Carrie, you ... you make me feel things.\u201d Frowning, he rubbed his chest. \u201cOne kiss just before Sawyer took you away and you unbalanced my entire life. I hardly know myself any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like having your life unbalanced?\u201d she asked, noting how dark his face grew with the confession.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s never happened quite like this.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him, letting her lips linger over his. When she pulled away, he groaned softly. \u201cPerhaps I could grow used to it,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking I could as well,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>After a while she brewed them each a cup of coffee, and then they sat and talked away half the night. They bounced from one subject to the next as if it\u2019d been months since they\u2019d last spoken. It felt as if they\u2019d known each other their entire lives. Finn talked about the second book he\u2019d written. It was finished, but he wasn\u2019t sure it was as good as the first one.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a problem when a first book is such a success,\u201d she said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s all this pressure for you to repeat the performance of the first book. That alone is intimidating enough.\u201d</p><p>Finn agreed. \u201cNew York keeps asking me when they can see this second manuscript, and I\u2019ve been putting them off, although it\u2019s been finished for quite some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to read it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWould you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d It was an honor that he trusted her enough to give her this opportunity.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be honest with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>With anyone else she would have doubted their sincerity, but not with Finn.</p><p>It must have been close to three in the morning before Finn announced it was time for him to go back to his hotel. Carrie resisted the urge to ask him to stay. They both knew that it wouldn\u2019t take much encouragement on either of their parts to convince him to spend the night. She had to go to work in the morning but would be off early. Most of the staff would be away from their desks for the Thanksgiving holiday.</p><p>Reluctantly, Carrie walked him to the door.</p><p>\u201cCan I see you tomorrow?\u201d he asked, his arms around her.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny more social obligations I need to know about?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNope. The entire holiday is free ... well, other than church. The choir is singing. You\u2019ll come, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He frowned and then nodded.</p><p>Carrie rewarded him with a lengthy kiss. \u201cChurch might actually do you some good, and then next week is the party.\u201d</p><p>He frowned again. \u201cWhat party?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Christmas one Sophie and I are throwing right here. You must come, you really must.\u201d</p><p>He certainly didn\u2019t look keen to join in the festivities. \u201cThe first week of December? You\u2019ll be here, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee if you can change your flight, Finn. I need to prove to everyone that you\u2019re real. If you think you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s not himself, then you\u2019re wrong. My friends claim they hardly know me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie, I\u2019ll never fit in with your life here.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t argue. Instead, she pressed her hand to the side of his jaw, her eyes round and pleading.</p><p>Finn snickered softly, and Carrie knew she\u2019d won.</p><p>\u201cCould I refuse you anything?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d She hugged him, fearing if they kissed again they wouldn\u2019t be able to stop.</p><p>He grumbled but didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>\u201cI promise the rewards will be worth any discomfort.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRewards?\u201d His dark eyes brightened.</p><p>\u201cYes. We can talk about those later.\u201d</p><p>He left her then, and while she was practically asleep on her feet, Carrie was far too happy and excited to let go of the exquisite sensation of knowing Finn was only a couple of blocks away, and would be with her for several days.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Late Wednesday morning Finn unloaded the last of the groceries into Carrie\u2019s refrigerator. Shopping for their Thanksgiving dinner had been an experience he never wanted to repeat. While she was at the office he decided to make good use of his time and get what they needed for their meal. If ever he wanted a lesson in the differences between their lives, this was it. The trip to the grocery store had taken him hours.</p><p>Finn knew his way around a kitchen, his father had made sure of that. But the meat he was most familiar with didn\u2019t come from a food market. He found the selection of vegetables and fresh fruit mind-boggling. He had to admit he was impressed. It was like walking into the Garden of Eden. In Alaska, especially at this time of year, fresh fruits and vegetables were at a premium. They were available in limited quantities, but the prices were astronomical.</p><p>He glanced at his watch. Carrie should arrive home anytime now. Just thinking about her produced a sense of lightness that he\u2019d rarely experienced. His decision to fly to Chicago had been last-minute. If he\u2019d been smart he would have planned this trip much earlier.</p><p>After all Carrie had gone through in order to find him, he was determined she not be alone over Thanksgiving. She was close to her family, which was something Finn had never experienced. His father had been his only relative, though Carrie would be quick to remind him that his mother was living. But she\u2019d been out of his life since he was a kid and he had nothing to say to her. He loved hearing Carrie talk about her family and their traditions. It made him feel good to know how deeply she valued these relationships; it was something he envied. The more he got to know Carrie, the more he cared about her. He tried to ignore the feeling that he was starting to care more for her than he should. More than was wise for either of them.</p> <p>Finn pushed those thoughts aside for now. He was determined to make this a Thanksgiving they would both remember.</p><p>The door opened and Carrie breezed in, breathless and excited. \u201cFinn?\u201d she called out.</p><p>\u201cIn here.\u201d He had the turkey in the sink and the counter-tops lined with a variety of food.</p><p>She rounded the corner and came to an abrupt halt, her beautiful blue eyes widening. \u201cWhat in heaven\u2019s name is this?\u201d Not waiting for his answer, she launched herself into his arms and buried her face in his neck.</p><p>Finn wrapped his arms around her and breathed in the fresh scent of her. In all his life, nothing had felt more right than having Carrie in his arms. If he was living in a dream world, then he never wanted to wake up. She smelled of roses and sunshine. Clinging to him, she swallowed tightly but didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our Thanksgiving dinner,\u201d he explained, probably unnecessarily. \u201cI plan to cook for you.\u201d</p><p>Her arms remained tightly clenched around his neck. \u201cThank you. Oh, thank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>What struck him was the fact that Carrie thanked him when he was the one who should be grateful. For an instant his throat clogged and he found it impossible to speak. He held her close and then they were kissing, so hungry for each other that breathing no longer seemed necessary. The taste, the feel, the need he had for this one woman was all the oxygen he would ever require. In a single moment all the hassles of traveling from Alaska, the crowded grocery store, and every other irritation he\u2019d experienced evaporated. Being with Carrie was worth all of it.</p><p>Finn realized this emotional high, this linking of their hearts, was temporary. He\u2019d long ago accepted that their time together was destined to be limited. He tried not to think about it. One day they would both need to face reality, but it wouldn\u2019t be this day. He hoped whatever it was they shared would last, and in the same breath he felt he had to accept that it probably wouldn\u2019t. People change, and what had seemed right could suddenly go very wrong. One day Carrie was sure to wake up to their differences. Thus far they\u2019d managed to look past the fact that they were polar opposites. As soon as she stopped, and long before he was ready to deal with letting her go, she would end their relationship. Finn had seen it often enough. His own mother had walked out on him and his father. They were a good example of what happened when a man and a woman who didn\u2019t belong together ignored what should have been clear from the beginning.</p><p>Gradually and with a great deal of reluctance, Finn released her. Carrie tried to hide the tears that shimmered in her eyes. Because he knew they embarrassed her, he pretended not to notice. One thing that did catch his attention, though, was the reddish marks his beard had caused on the tender skin of her face. He rubbed his hand down the sides of his jaw and felt his prickly whiskers. His thick beard offered his face protection against the bitter cold, but for Carrie he would do away with it. Fact was, he hardly remembered what he looked like without it.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking this was going to be the worst Thanksgiving of my life,\u201d Carrie confessed.</p><p>\u201cNot on my watch,\u201d Finn countered, and, taking her hand, he raised it to his lips and kissed the inside of her palm.</p><p>Their Thanksgiving meal was everything Finn had hoped it would be. The turkey was cooked to perfection and the stuffing was delicious. In fact, the entire meal was the best he could remember outside of his early childhood. His mother\u2019s cornbread stuffing had been his favorite, and he\u2019d taken delight in wolfing it down in large quantities. Along with that long-buried memory came others, reminding him that at one point, his parents had been happy together. And then they weren\u2019t. He knew the lessons from their marriage and divorce remained deeply engraved in his psyche, but he hadn\u2019t minded that until now. Finn shook his head, needing to dispel the image of his parents and those early Thanksgivings. He wanted to focus on the present, here with Carrie.</p><p>The table was covered with partially empty serving dishes, and their plates were practically clean when Carrie leaned back in her chair and groaned. \u201cIf I swallow another bite I will explode. Oh, Finn, you\u2019re a wonderful chef.\u201d</p><p>Finn basked in her praise although the meal had been a team effort. She\u2019d done a good deal of the preparation work.</p><p>They sat across from each other. \u201cWhat were your Thanksgivings like as a child?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFunny you should ask. I was just thinking about that myself.\u201d The memories wrapped themselves around him, warming him. \u201cMom got up at the crack of dawn and got the turkey in the oven so I woke to the smell of it roasting. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget that. She\u2019d be busy baking and cooking, and Dad would offer to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would? I don\u2019t picture your dad as someone who would volunteer to help cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t. To the best of my memory, he only offered at Thanksgiving. I think he was more of a nuisance than anything. I suspect what he wanted was to be close to Mom. Dad\u2019s main job was to peel the potatoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was your job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo eat the potatoes,\u201d Finn teased.</p><p>Just the way he knew she would, Carrie laughed. \u201cThen, after dinner, Mom would bring out this Nativity set and she\u2019d let me set it up on the fireplace mantel. I still have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you put it out for Christmas?\u201d she asked.</p><p>If anyone else had asked, he\u2019d deny it, but with Carrie he couldn\u2019t. Everything was different with Carrie.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Thanksgiving after your mother left?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt was just Dad and me, and maybe a few of my father\u2019s single friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever leave Alaska?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVacations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlaska has everything I would ever want, but on occasion I did travel. I went to France once, and England. A couple of times I had business meetings in Texas and got a kick out of the lone-star attitude, thinking they\u2019re so big. Minnesota brags about its ten thousand lakes. Do you know how many lakes are in Alaska?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver a million.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA million!\u201d</p><p>Finn knew she was impressed just by the way she said it.</p><p>\u201cYou were born in Seattle. Do you have any memories of life there?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNone. Mom and Dad moved to Fairbanks when I was a baby. They bought a house there and Dad kept it, but he built a cabin on the tundra as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you did, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father built that house with his own two hands, and he taught me everything he knew. I was fortunate to learn I could survive on my own in the wilderness if it was ever necessary. Some of those experiences are included in Alone, but I have a lot more stories to tell.\u201d</p><p>Carrie leaned forward and pushed her plate aside. \u201cI don\u2019t see why you refuse to give interviews. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re truly a recluse, and from what I\u2019ve seen you would even be good on television.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and leaned back while he formulated his answer. When the book had first started selling, his publisher had wanted him to do interviews. But Finn hadn\u2019t signed up to have his personal life invaded. He wanted nothing to do with that side of the business. From that point forward, his publisher automatically rejected all interviews and invitations for appearances. All the interest and attention embarrassed him. It wasn\u2019t until reporters started making trips to Fairbanks that he grew irritated and stubborn.</p><p>\u201cThe simple answer is that I like my privacy.\u201d</p><p>She mulled that over, and he half expected her to bring up the article she wanted to write. She didn\u2019t, and gradually the tension between his shoulder blades eased. Maybe he could trust her. He certainly wanted to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Their conversation drifted to other subjects, and Finn was grateful. He didn\u2019t often talk about his childhood. Carrie\u2019s had been wrapped around happy memories of cousins and family gatherings. Finn hadn\u2019t experienced that and didn\u2019t realize all he\u2019d missed. He enjoyed listening to her stories. If he ever had a family, this was what he would wish for his own children.</p><p>They cleaned the kitchen together, music playing in the background, using any time they were in close proximity to kiss. Hands down, this had been the best Thanksgiving of his life.</p><p>Once they finished with the cleanup, Finn brought out the cribbage board.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we playing for?\u201d she asked, as she sat down and reached for the deck.</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cWhatever you wish.\u201d</p><p>Carrie\u2019s smile widened. \u201cOh, how tempting. Okay, if I win, we go shopping in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShopping?\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe she would even suggest something so out of his comfort zone. He knew from previous conversations this was something Carrie and her mother did every Black Friday. \u201cThis is a joke, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo joke. I want you to meet my friends, and right now they\u2019ll take one look and know you\u2019re from Alaska. From there, it\u2019ll be easy to make the leap that you\u2019re Finn Dalton.\u201d</p><p>Gauging by the determination in her eyes, Finn realized it didn\u2019t matter what cards he was dealt. Within a matter of hours he would be on the Chicago streets, credit card in hand, and he\u2019d do it gladly because Carrie had asked him to.</p> <p>The deep-dish sausage and pepperoni pizza sat in the middle of the table in front of Carrie and Finn. Try as she might, she couldn\u2019t take her eyes off him. He was gorgeous. His beard was gone, and his hair neatly trimmed. His jaw was clearly defined, and his lips were full and enticing.</p><p>\u201cStop looking at me,\u201d he said, clearly uncomfortable with her scrutiny.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I can\u2019t help myself. You look more scrumptious than that pizza.\u201d The woodsman had disappeared, and in his place sat Prince Charming. Finn was handsome\u2014well, in her eyes, anyway\u2014and if the glances she saw coming from other women in the restaurant were anything to go by, she wasn\u2019t alone in thinking so. The transformation was total. Finn exuded vigor and strength, and she found it nearly impossible to keep from staring.</p><p>\u201cYou have to admit this is the best pizza you\u2019ve ever tasted,\u201d she said, in an effort to keep the conversation going. If she was drooling, it wasn\u2019t over the food.</p><p>\u201cAll right, you win. Chicago pizza isn\u2019t half bad, but you have to promise to try reindeer-sausage pizza the next time you\u2019re in Alaska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it,\u201d she teased.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>She loved the idea that he assumed she would visit Alaska again, and frankly, she wasn\u2019t opposed to the idea, especially if it meant she would be with Finn. It didn\u2019t hurt that he loved pizza as much as she did, either.</p><p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s funny?\u201d he said, wiping the grease from his fingers with a paper napkin. \u201cI keep fighting the urge to text you.\u201d</p><p>Carrie laughed because she\u2019d experienced the same feeling. It was the usual way they communicated and had become such a habit that it felt odd not to be exchanging texts even when they sat across the table from each other.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done shopping, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are unless you have a secret desire to face the maddening crowds yet again.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cHardly. I\u2019ve seen about as many people in one day as I can handle. I\u2019m starting to feel claustrophobic. Is it always like this in the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways. Sometimes worse, although not often. Black Friday is a special, magical day.\u201d Carrie hid a smile. One disgruntled look from Finn told her he could do without the holiday craziness. \u201cBut you haven\u2019t been to Navy Pier yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnother time,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can take much more of these crowds, let alone the noise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Carrie had no complaints, watching as he once again ran his hand over his smooth cheeks as though he felt naked.</p><p>He\u2019d arrived at her apartment that morning clean shaven, and for just an instant she hadn\u2019t recognized the man standing in front of her. She hadn\u2019t asked him to shave and had been both shocked and delighted.</p><p>\u201cAnd you keep staring at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I can\u2019t stop myself. I had no idea you were such a hunk.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled as if she\u2019d made a joke, but she wasn\u2019t kidding. The minute her friends took one look at him, they\u2019d be all over Finn, especially Sophie. She frowned, disliking the thought.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, as he paid their tab and collected their purchases. Finn reached for her hand, gripping it in his own as they started out of the restaurant.</p><p>It amazed her how easily he read her mood. \u201cWhat makes you think anything is wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re frowning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got an inkling of how you felt with me spending the evening with Dave.\u201d They wove their way around busy tables toward the front of the well-known Chicago pizza restaurant.</p><p>He paused, frowning, his brow folding into thick ripples. \u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was imagining my friends meeting you, and I realized they are going to want you for themselves. You\u2019re mine, Finn, all mine.\u201d</p><p>His eyes grew dark and serious. His grip tightened on her hand. \u201cNo one is going to turn my head, Carrie. It simply isn\u2019t possible.\u201d</p><p>Carrie and Finn walked back to her condo, bundles in hand. Until that morning Finn mentioned that the only clothes shopping he\u2019d done in years had been through catalogs or online. It\u2019d been a true test of the strength of their relationship when it came to choosing dress slacks and a sweater for him. All in all, he\u2019d been more than patient, but she could appreciate his unease.</p><p>Once back at her condo, Finn collapsed onto her sofa, spreading out his arms along the back cushion. Her tree was up but had yet to be decorated, and although it was only four feet tall, it took up one entire corner of her living room. Finn had placed a gift under it first thing that morning. She eyed it now, wrapped in plain brown paper.</p><p>\u201cCurious?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d She picked it up, held it close to her ear, and shook it.</p><p>\u201cAny guesses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it\u2019s a can opener.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re way off base.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd ruin the surprise? No way. You have to wait until Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Carrie reluctantly set it back down. \u201cYou\u2019re taunting me, and that simply isn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll be pleased\u201d was all Finn was willing to tell her. Over the years she\u2019d received a variety of gifts from the men she\u2019d dated, but Finn\u2019s gifts were distinctive in every way. It wasn\u2019t likely she would ever forget that toaster.</p><p>Carrie went over to her television and removed a DVD from her collection.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re watching a movie?\u201d Finn asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s tradition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a romance? I don\u2019t think I could sit through a chick flick\u2014not after the last three hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush.\u201d She sat down close to him and reached for her remote control, pushing the appropriate button.</p><p>Right away he slid his arm around her shoulders and then let it drop. \u201cThe Bishop\u2019s Wife?\u201d he muttered as the title flashed across the screen. \u201cIt\u2019s in black and white.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, years ago ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my favorite Christmas movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh, you\u2019ll miss the introduction.\u201d</p><p>His arm was back, and she pressed her head against his shoulder. \u201cJust relax and enjoy.\u201d</p><p>He grumbled, but she noticed that he was soon into the movie. Every now and again he would lean forward and kiss her temple. Carrie snuggled into his embrace. She loved that they could cuddle and be this close.</p><p>\u201cListen up. This is one of the best lines of any movie ever.\u201d Carrie mouthed the words along with Cary Grant as he spoke to Loretta Young.</p><p>Finn sat up slightly. \u201cYou\u2019ve memorized the movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParts of it. Like I said, it\u2019s one of my favorites.\u201d It thrilled her that he was with her and they could view it together. What she loved was how much he seemed to be enjoying it, too.</p><p>\u201cJust how many times have you watched this silly movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a silly movie,\u201d she insisted, knowing that he enjoyed teasing her.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever seen The Replacement Killers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYuck, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYuck? It\u2019s a great movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what,\u201d Carrie whispered, tilting her head back and kissing the underside of his clean-shaven jaw. \u201cI\u2019ll watch it with you one day, as long as you promise to hold me just like this.\u201d</p><p>He smiled down on her. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang shortly after the movie ended. It was Sophie. \u201cA group of us are going to Logan\u2019s for drinks. Can you meet us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck?\u201d Sophie repeated.</p><p>\u201cI have company. F\u2014Paul is in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeattle Paul? The guy who\u2019s got you walking around with your head in the clouds Paul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne and the same.\u201d Finn eyed her closely. Carrie was sure he was able to hear both sides of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything about him coming to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know. It was a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, bring him. I, for one, am dying to meet this guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d Carrie pressed her cell against her chest. \u201cWhat do you think? Do you want to go out tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d like you to meet my friends.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated and then nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward and kissed him soundly on the lips.</p><p>\u201cI could grow accustomed to these little rewards you so willingly hand out,\u201d he murmured as he gripped her hand.</p><p>Carrie smiled and brought the cell back to her ear. \u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes eight work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. See you then.\u201d</p><p>Sophie hesitated. \u201cDoes Paul have a friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and, fair warning, hands off. Got it?\u201d</p><p>Sophie laughed before the line was disconnected.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Logan?\u201d Finn asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bar about six blocks from here. A few of us from the newspaper hang out there when we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoisy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid so. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Finn chuckled. \u201cIt won\u2019t be so bad if there are rewards involved.\u201d</p><p>Carrie smiled. \u201cI imagine there will be more than a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen bring on the noise.\u201d</p><p>For the rest of the afternoon they simply hung out together while a medley of Christmas songs played in the background. It seemed they never ran out of things to talk about. And as promised, Finn gave her sections of his new book to read and critique. Carrie found it as good as, if not better than, Alone and told him so. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They left the condo around seven forty-five and with her arm tucked in Finn\u2019s they walked the six blocks to Logan\u2019s. The noise was explosive the instant they entered the bar. Sophie and Bruce already had a table. Bruce worked for the newspaper, and he\u2019d been dating Sophie for the last few months, following his divorce. According to Sophie, it wasn\u2019t a serious relationship, and after seeing them together a couple of times, Carrie had to agree.</p><p>The noise level made it nearly impossible to talk, but they managed by yelling across the table to one another. Finn ordered a beer. Sophie and Carrie had their favorite dirty martinis before another couple joined them. Introductions were made and a second round of drinks was ordered. Finn stayed close to her side and contributed to the conversation, although it was difficult with the bar so crowded. They left an hour later.</p><p>\u201cI enjoyed meeting your friends,\u201d he commented when they were outside in the relative quiet of the street.</p><p>\u201cBut the crowds and the noise bothered you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot bothered, exactly,\u201d he said, and reached for her hand. \u201cI\u2019m just not accustomed to it to that extent. We get plenty rowdy in Fairbanks ourselves, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this is different.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and nodded. Soon they had their arms around each other as it started to snow again. They took a leisurely stroll down Michigan Avenue on the way back to Carrie\u2019s place. On a side street they walked past a bookstore, and Alone took up the entire window display. Finn paused and did a double take.</p><p>\u201cHow does it feel seeing that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He took his time answering. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it displayed before, but nothing like this. It leaves me feeling a little ... I don\u2019t know, weird, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA good weird, though, right?\u201d She felt proud for him and for all that he\u2019d accomplished, proud to be with him. Carrie knew the phenomenal sales of his book had shocked Finn. He didn\u2019t seem to understand what it was about his book that fascinated readers. When he\u2019d submitted the manuscript, he\u2019d been amazed at how quickly it\u2019d sold. Then to have it shoot straight to the top of the bestseller lists and remain there for months on end was beyond the scope of his imagination.</p><p>\u201cI can see your mind working,\u201d he said, and, leaning down, he kissed her brow. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a mind reader now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d love to write that article about me, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>To deny it would be a falsehood, but to confess that she\u2019d composed it a half-dozen times in her mind, even still had a rough draft on her laptop, would give him the wrong impression. \u201cThat\u2019s a moot point. I would never destroy the trust you have in me. I wouldn\u2019t submit a word until you gave me the approval to do so.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a long time and then said, \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p> <p>They held hands as he walked her to her condo and kissed her good night.</p><p>\u201cCome upstairs with me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI think I should go back to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>Carrie held on to his hand. \u201cIs everything all right? You\u2019re not upset about anything, are you?\u201d</p><p>Finn brought her back into his arms and hugged her close. \u201cYou\u2019re far too tempting, Carrie. If I came upstairs with you now, I wouldn\u2019t be leaving until morning, and we both know it.\u201d</p><p>Carrie went into her building with a happy, excited sense of anticipation and relief. She would see Finn tomorrow. He\u2019d met her friends and not a one had even suspected her Seattle Paul was Finnegan Dalton.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>\u201cWhen is Paul leaving?\u201d Sophie asked on Saturday afternoon. Finn was in her kitchen, fixing sandwiches for their lunch. Carrie had been bringing down dishes when her friend had called.</p> <p>\u201cHis flight is scheduled for Monday. I mentioned our Christmas party, and I hope he\u2019ll be able to change his plans so he\u2019ll be staying for that.\u201d He\u2019d used her laptop to see about alternate flights and to check his emails, but it didn\u2019t look promising that he\u2019d be able to delay his return to Alaska.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he might?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The thought of him leaving filled her with dismay, but at the same time she appreciated that city life was completely foreign to him.</p><p>And she would need to return to work Monday morning and he\u2019d be restless in the city, although there would be plenty for him to see and do.</p><p>\u201cHow come you left so early last night?\u201d Sophie pressed.</p><p>\u201cToo noisy,\u201d she explained, as she strolled into the kitchen. \u201cIt was difficult to hold a decent conversation, and Paul and I had been out and about all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an idea,\u201d Sophie returned cheerfully, as if she was the most brilliant woman in the universe. \u201cI\u2019ll have the two of you over for dinner this evening. I\u2019ll ask Bruce, and we\u2019ll have a small dinner party with just the four of us\u2014nothing fancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea, but I\u2019ve already got a roast in the Crock-Pot.\u201d A good portion of the leftover turkey had gone into the freezer, and she\u2019d made up plates with turkey, stuffing, and the other side dishes to distribute to her neighbors who were widowers.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Sophie returned enthusiastically. \u201cThen we\u2019ll come to your place. Does six work?\u201d</p><p>Carrie glanced at Finn, knowing he could hear the conversation, and he shrugged as if to say it was her decision. \u201cSure. We\u2019ll see you then.\u201d Carrie would have preferred to spend the night with just her and Finn, but she had more or less been manipulated into agreeing. Setting her phone aside, she wrapped her arms around Finn\u2019s waist. \u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d she asked. \u201cI can call Sophie back and tell her we\u2019ve changed our minds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. I liked your friends.\u201d He downplayed her concern, kissed her cheek, and brought their turkey-salad sandwiches to the table.</p><p>Sophie and Bruce arrived at six, bringing flowers and chocolate-dipped strawberries for dessert. Her friends wore matching Santa hats. The flowers became the centerpiece, and the meal was served. Conversation flowed smoothly throughout dinner. For obvious reasons, the answers to questions directed at Finn were vague. Sophie was the one who asked one question after another, almost as if she were conducting an interview. At one point, Carrie opened her mouth to stop her, an uneasy feeling filling her chest, but Finn pressed his hand over hers, reassuring her that all was fine.</p><p>Following the meal, Bruce and Finn went into the living room to watch a college football game while Sophie and Carrie cleared the table.</p><p>The instant they were out of earshot, Sophie hissed, \u201cWho do you think you\u2019re kidding? That\u2019s Finn Dalton.\u201d</p><p>Just as she\u2019d suspected when Sophie started hitting Finn with a barrage of questions, her friend had seen through their little masquerade.</p><p>Carrie started to explain when Sophie quickly cut her off. \u201cDon\u2019t even try to deny it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right, yes, it\u2019s Finn. Paul is his middle name.\u201d</p><p>Sophie rolled her eyes. \u201cWho did you think you were fooling, Carrie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember,\u201d Carrie said, grabbing hold of her friend\u2019s forearm, \u201cyou said that Finn Dalton could be walking down the streets of Chicago and no one would even know it was him? Well, guess what, he is, and you\u2019re right, no one knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie, I\u2019m worried about you. Surely you realize this relationship isn\u2019t going to work. Long-distance relationships rarely do. The two of you are night and day, oil and water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, to this point we seem to be coming along rather nicely,\u201d Carrie countered, unwilling to let her friend rain on her parade. Not for anything would Carrie give up on her and Finn.</p><p>\u201cFor the love of heaven, why haven\u2019t you written the article?\u201d Sophie demanded. \u201cWe both know what that would mean to you and your career. You could have your choice of jobs with any newspaper. You\u2019re always talking about moving back to Seattle one day. This is your golden opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe article is off the table.\u201d Carrie rinsed the dirty dishes and set them inside the dishwasher, not wanting to have this conversation. \u201cI\u2019d rather not discuss this, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you write it?\u201d Sophie wasn\u2019t willing to let this go.</p><p>Carrie straightened and faced her friend head-on. \u201cFinn asked me not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sophie all but exploded.</p><p>Carrie hurriedly glanced around the wall that separated the kitchen from the living room to be sure Finn hadn\u2019t heard any part of this conversation. Both men appeared caught up in the football game. Sighing with relief, Carrie turned back to her friend.</p><p>\u201cKeep your voice down, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, but you need to think this through; give me one good reason why you aren\u2019t writing that article. Just one.\u201d She held up her finger and threatened to wag it with every word.</p><p>The answer should be obvious. \u201cIn case you hadn\u2019t figured it out, I\u2019m in love with Finn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou barely know the guy,\u201d Sophie challenged.</p><p>\u201cI know him well enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Carrie, I realize you think you\u2019re in love, but you aren\u2019t. This is a classic case of wild infatuation. Opposites attract, right?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for a response. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone bonkers for him, and it\u2019s understandable. He\u2019s not bad looking, and he seems to be a nice guy, but tell me, do you honestly see yourself picking berries out in the wilderness in order to survive?\u201d</p><p>Sophie was right about one thing; Carrie couldn\u2019t see herself living her life in Finn\u2019s cabin, raising a family in such a limited environment. Still, she wasn\u2019t willing to give up Finn.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your career?\u201d Sophie challenged next.</p><p>\u201cI can write anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can,\u201d Sophie reluctantly agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re smart and talented. But you can\u2019t seriously be considering giving up this golden opportunity.\u201d</p><p>Carrie lowered her voice to a whisper. \u201cI won\u2019t betray Finn. I\u2019m not that kind of person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t bear to see you make this sacrifice,\u201d Sophie insisted. \u201cYou\u2019d be a fool not to take advantage of what you know about him.\u201d</p><p>Carrie refused to listen to this any longer. \u201cStop, Sophie. I said I\u2019m not doing it, and I mean it. End of story.\u201d</p><p>Sophie gave a disgusted shake of her head. \u201cDon\u2019t you see what he\u2019s doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? He trusts me, and I trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid he might be using you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsing me? For what?\u201d The idea was so preposterous that Carrie nearly laughed out loud.</p><p>\u201cTo keep track of what you\u2019re doing so you won\u2019t write the article,\u201d Sophie explained.</p><p>Carrie shook her head, finding this conversation almost comical. \u201cFinn isn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Sophie challenged. \u201cTake my advice and admit that this relationship isn\u2019t going anywhere. If you hang on, you\u2019ll only be setting yourself up for heartache. I\u2019m your friend, and I have your best interests at heart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carrie actually felt sorry for her. \u201cYou are getting to be such a cynic, Sophie. How can you say these things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be sure he isn\u2019t with you so that you won\u2019t write the article?\u201d Sophie asked. \u201cAgainst all odds, you found him. You know too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Carrie insisted. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d She was finished with this conversation. She tossed the dish towel down on the counter, jerked the Christmas apron loose from her waist, and stuffed it in a drawer. \u201cI\u2019m done listening to you,\u201d she said.</p><p>Abruptly, she turned away from her friend, and to her shock she found Finn standing in the doorway.</p> <p>Sophie cast her an apologetic glance, murmured, \u201cOops,\u201d and then scooted past Finn. \u201cHey, Bruce, time for us to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the game ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can watch it from my place.\u201d</p><p>Carrie waited until she heard the front door click closed. \u201cHow much of that did you hear?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Finn had his arms crossed over his muscular chest. His frown compressed his forehead. \u201cI heard enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be offended by Sophie. She doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about. She certainly doesn\u2019t know my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinn ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean to say you never guessed what caused my change in attitude while we were in the cabin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ...\u201d She frowned. \u201cNo ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you first arrived I was determined not to give you a single bit of information, and then you riled me to the point where I said far more than I ever intended. Very clever of you, by the way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean ... That wasn\u2019t my intention.\u201d He couldn\u2019t honestly believe that the argument about his mother had been prompted by anything other than exactly what it was. She hadn\u2019t been looking for a way to unearth his motivations so she could share them with the rest of the world. He couldn\u2019t actually believe that, could he?</p><p>\u201cDespite my best efforts to keep you in the dark, it was clear you had enough on me to write ten articles if that was what you wanted,\u201d he continued.</p><p>Unwilling to trust his words, Carrie shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you any more than I do Sophie. Are you telling me this has all been a game ... you don\u2019t have any feelings for me?\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cOkay, sure. You\u2019re attractive and fun, and for a while I actually thought there might be something between us, but these last few days have shown me nothing permanent will ever come of this relationship.\u201d He looked almost apologetic. \u201cI was perfectly content until you came into my life; I will be again, and so will you. We had a good run, but it\u2019s time we were realistic enough to accept that this relationship isn\u2019t good for either of us. It was always about the article.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t possibly mean what he was telling her. \u201cFinn, please. You\u2019re overreacting. Sophie\u2019s like that. She makes assumptions she shouldn\u2019t. I would never betray your trust. Never.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her long and hard. \u201cYou\u2019re dying to write the article, aren\u2019t you? You as much as admitted it. An article on me would make your career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about that stupid article; what matters to me is you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re lying.\u201d He wiped his hand across his face.</p> <p>\u201cI am not lying.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled slowly. \u201cCarrie, I saw it on your laptop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She slowly shook her head. \u201cBut that was before\u2014\u201d Abruptly, she stopped and sucked in her breath. She\u2019d never deleted the rough draft of the article she\u2019d written while in Alaska. It remained on her computer, nearly forgotten. Finn had used her laptop to check availability with the airlines and his emails. He must have seen it then. \u201cOkay, yes, there\u2019s an article there, but did you look at the date? I wrote that while I was at the cabin before ... before you asked me not to publish it.\u201d</p><p>Finn shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019re in over our heads. This isn\u2019t going to work. Sophie\u2019s comments should be a wake-up call to us both. She knows it, your mother knows it, and for that matter my mother, too. It\u2019s time for us to be honest, Carrie. This relationship is doomed. It always has been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop saying that. I\u2019m not willing to give up on us. I love you, Finn.\u201d She threw her heart out to him and waited breathlessly for him to respond.</p><p>For the longest time all he did was stare at her. His shoulders sagged, and he released his breath in a long, slow exhale. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Carrie. I don\u2019t love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s lying?\u201d she asked, hiccupping on a half-sob. It felt as if the floor had started to pitch beneath her feet as though she were on board a ship, tossed about in a vicious storm at sea.</p><p>\u201cBelieve what you want.\u201d</p><p>His words hit her with a nearly physical impact. It felt as though he\u2019d reached out and shoved her backward. Despite herself, she stumbled back several steps.</p><p>Although she recognized that it would do little good to argue with him, she made the effort. \u201cWhat about the toaster?\u201d she whispered, hardly able to speak because of the tightness in her throat. She might be able to believe him if she didn\u2019t know about the significance of the toaster. It meant far more to him than an antique. It\u2019d been his way of telling her she was important to him. As important to him as his mother had been to his father.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, the toaster. That was a rather brilliant move on my part. I didn\u2019t know yet if you\u2019d take my request seriously. I needed to do something that would have an effect on you, and I figured you\u2019d ask my mother about it.\u201d</p><p>Her knees suddenly felt like they were about to collapse on her. She needed to sit down, and quickly.</p><p>Finn started for the door, briefly hesitated, and turned the knob.</p><p>\u201cTake the Christmas present with you,\u201d she called after him, anger coming to rescue her pride in those final seconds.</p><p>\u201cKeep it,\u201d he said on his way out the door, as if it meant nothing.</p><p>As if she meant nothing.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t even bother to go to bed that night or the next, sleeping in fits and starts, a few minutes at a time. She sat up on her sofa with a quilt her mother had lovingly crafted for her while she was in college. With its thick warmth wrapped around her shoulders, she tried to digest what had happened between her and Finn, and what would happen next\u2014if anything. Try as she might, she couldn\u2019t make herself believe that the things he said had even the smallest semblance of truth.</p><p>At seven Monday morning she tossed aside the quilt, and although she was bone tired, she readied for work. Staring at her reflection, Carrie did her best to disguise the dark circles beneath her eyes, but with little success.</p><p>Sophie, who usually rushed into the office five minutes late, was already at her cubicle when Carrie arrived at her normal time. Her friend had left several messages, but Carrie hadn\u2019t answered her phone or responded to text messages.</p><p>Sophie didn\u2019t wait for Carrie to remove her hat and coat before she pounced on her, seeking information.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened Saturday night after Bruce and I left?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you answer any of my phone messages or texts?\u201d</p><p>Carrie stared back blankly.</p><p>Sophie lowered her voice. \u201cI feel terrible that Finn heard the things I said.\u201d</p><p>Fearing that if she said one word she would give in to the emotion that threatened to overwhelm her, Carrie simply shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou have to tell me,\u201d Sophie pleaded. \u201cMe and my big mouth. I\u2019ll never forgive myself. How could I be so stupid?\u201d</p><p>Carrie swallowed against the tightening knot in her throat and gave an offhand shrug. \u201cApparently, you were right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight?\u201d Sophie\u2019s jaw dropped several inches. \u201cRight about what?\u201d</p><p>Bending over to turn on her computer, Carrie did her best to sound nonchalant and disengaged. \u201cYou might as well say \u2018I told you so.\u2019 Finn and I are over.\u201d</p><p>Sophie\u2019s look of disbelief slowly evolved into a frown. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d</p><p>How Carrie wished she was. In answer, she shook her head. \u201cFinn wanted to end it; he basically said the same thing you did, that we could never make it work, blah, blah, blah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinn said that and you believed him? Listen, Carrie, I was wrong. Before I left I saw the way he looked at you. If a man ever looked at me like that, I\u2019d be willing to give up chocolate and bear his children.\u201d</p><p>With all her heart, Carrie wanted to believe that was true, but she wasn\u2019t sure it even mattered. Finn was gone. Nevertheless, she was hanging on to that slender thread called hope, only in her case it was ragged hope.</p><p>Sophie pulled out a chair and sat down. \u201cAnyone with two functioning brain cells could see he\u2019s nuts over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to believe you, I really would, but he left shortly after you did, and I haven\u2019t heard from him since. Frankly I doubt that I will.\u201d</p><p>Sophie stiffened. \u201cFine, then write that article. He can\u2019t treat you like that.\u201d</p><p>Why was it everything went back to that stupid article?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to do it, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019d be a fool not to.\u201d</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t need to think about it. Undoubtedly, it was what Finn expected of her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d Instead, she reached for her mouse and clicked on an email.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to write it,\u201d Sophie insisted.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you off your rocker?\u201d Sophie stood and did a complete three-hundred-and-sixty-degree turn. \u201cSomeone call a medic; Carrie\u2019s losing her mind.\u201d</p><p>Carrie stopped her friend from making fools of them both. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand that\u2019s exactly what Finn expects me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen give him what he wants,\u201d Sophie suggested. \u201cThat way you can both have what you want. Don\u2019t be an idiot, Carrie. This opportunity is one that comes along once or maybe twice in a career. This is your chance to prove yourself to Nash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Finn loves me.\u201d It was the only scenario that made sense to Carrie. He had vehemently denied it, but Carrie refused to accept that. For two nights she\u2019d mulled over his words, and ultimately she chose not to believe them. She couldn\u2019t feel the things she did if it\u2019d all been a lie.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Finn now?\u201d Sophie asked. \u201cLet me talk some sense into him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie\u2014\u201d Carrie really didn\u2019t feel like discussing this now.</p><p>\u201cIs he still in Chicago?\u201d Sophie asked, cutting her off.</p><p>Carrie shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to Alaska?\u201d</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t know, and so she shrugged. It didn\u2019t matter. She was confident that no matter where he was, Alaska or Timbuktu, he was as miserable as she.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens now?\u201d Sophie asked, showing signs of sympathy. \u201cThis is dreadful, just dreadful. I don\u2019t think I can bear it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Again, Carrie answered with a lift of her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the better part of the last two days and nights going over a variety of scenarios. I have to believe Finn will have a change of heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean he\u2019ll come back for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ... he won\u2019t do that.\u201d That wouldn\u2019t be his way.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Sophie said, speaking softly now.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to regret the lie that he doesn\u2019t care, doesn\u2019t love me, and so he\u2019ll make it up to me the only way he can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll ask me to be the one to break the story on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Sophie vaulted to her feet and clapped her hands. \u201cOf course. It\u2019s brilliant. And you\u2019ll do it, and then ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Sophie froze. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Carrie repeated. \u201cI\u2019m going to refuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Sophie planted her hands on top of her head. \u201cThis is like a chess game, and I\u2019m losing track of the moves. If he wants you to write the piece, then why won\u2019t you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if I refuse it will force his hand.\u201d</p><p>Sophie scratched the side of her head as though puzzled. \u201cI don\u2019t follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinn wants me to publish something about him because it will salve his conscience. It\u2019s the one way he has of apologizing, of letting me know he loves me. But I won\u2019t do it, because it\u2019s the only way I can think to let him know I love him. It\u2019s the one thing I can do to tell him my feelings haven\u2019t changed.\u201d</p> <p>Sophie sat back in the chair. \u201cYou\u2019re losing me, girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>It was a gamble for sure, Carrie realized. And until she got word from Finn, she would need to keep silent. There was a chance, of course, that she was completely wrong and she would never hear from him again. For now, it was a waiting game.</p><p>The first week of December passed. Long, torturous days in which there was complete silence from Finn. Somehow Carrie got through her and Sophie\u2019s little Christmas gathering. She managed to smile and even laugh now and again. It was a great party, everyone said, and Carrie was grateful she was able to pull it off. The only person who seemed to notice that Carrie\u2019s spirits were low was Sophie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having a hard time dealing with this guilt,\u201d her friend confessed. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m to blame. I look at you and I want to cry. You\u2019re so miserable, and it\u2019s all my fault.\u201d</p><p>Carrie did her best to reassure her friend. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. These matters have a way of working out how they\u2019re meant to be.\u201d While she might have sounded confident, Carrie was anything but.</p><p>Another week of silence followed. Carrie lost weight. Sleep felt like a luxury.</p><p>On Friday a few days before Christmas, just before quitting time, the office threw a small party. Carrie was scheduled to fly back to Seattle in the morning, to be with her family, and she was getting ready to head home to pack when she got word that Nash wanted to speak to her in his office.</p><p>She knocked against his door and stepped inside. Without looking away from his computer screen, he motioned for her to take a seat.</p> <p>Carrie complied.</p><p>\u201cI just got off the phone with some New York publicity woman,\u201d he said, frowning at her as if seeing her for the first time. \u201cHow is it that you know Finn Dalton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I know Finn?\u201d she parried with a question of her own.</p><p>\u201cYou said you were determined to find him, as I recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I did.\u201d She folded her hands in her lap, afraid the trembling would give her away.</p><p>\u201cWell, congratulations. It seems you looked under the right rock, because this PR person called to tell me Finn Dalton is ready to let someone interview him. The surprising part is that he requested you, and he claims you already know everything there is to know. He\u2019s requested you write the piece.\u201d</p><p>Carrie\u2019s eyes drifted shut. This was exactly the news she\u2019d been waiting to hear. She\u2019d been right. Finn had offered her the assignment. A sense of release and joy rushed through her. He was as much as telling her that he loved her. She pressed her hand to her mouth, fearing she was about to break into sobs.</p><p>\u201cI can see you\u2019re pleased. I\u2019d be crying with joy, too. I don\u2019t know what you did, but congratulations. This is one of the biggest coups this newspaper has had in a long time. How soon can you write the piece? If possible, I\u2019d like to have it for the weekend edition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Nash, Mr. Dalton\u2019s publisher is going to need to find someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Nash nearly came out of his chair. \u201cIs this a joke? If so, I\u2019m not laughing.\u201d</p><p>Now wasn\u2019t the time to back down. Carrie had to remain strong. As badly as she ached to give in, she couldn\u2019t do it. \u201cI hate to disappoint you, but you\u2019ll need to find someone else.\u201d</p><p>Nash shook his head. \u201cThe publisher insists you have to be the one. No one else.\u201d</p><p>It was exactly as she\u2019d calculated. \u201cSorry.\u201d She blinked back tears.</p><p>The hard-core newsman glared at her. \u201cYour job is on the line, Ms. Slayton. This newspaper can\u2019t afford to let this opportunity slip by. I\u2019m giving you twenty-four hours to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>Losing her job was an aspect of this decision that she hadn\u2019t considered. Carrie swallowed hard and bit into her lower lip. \u201cIt won\u2019t matter if it\u2019s twenty-four hours or twenty-four days. I\u2019m not going to change my mind.\u201d</p><p>Disgusted, Nash shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving in the morning for Seattle to see my family.\u201d It seemed her Christmas break would now be spent seeking another job. It was a steep price to pay to prove her love to Finn, but she wouldn\u2019t back down.</p><p>\u201cGo have Christmas with your family,\u201d Nash said, motioning for her to leave his office. \u201cBut take this time to think about what I said. I\u2019m serious, Carrie. Write the article and keep your job. Otherwise, you can clear out your desk when you return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I write the article, what about your promise to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny assignment I want, any department.\u201d He hadn\u2019t said it quite like that; still, it wouldn\u2019t do any harm to press her point.</p><p>Nash hesitated and then sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s negotiable.\u201d</p><p>Sophie was waiting for her at Carrie\u2019s desk when she returned. Her friend had glittery silver tinsel wrapped around her neck like a Hawaiian lei. \u201cSo, what did Nash want?\u201d</p><p>When she told her about the call from the New York publicist, Sophie leaped up and gave a loud cheer. \u201cThis is exactly what you said would happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the way I hoped it would play out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Sophie said eagerly, shifting her arms back and forth, \u201cwhat\u2019s the next move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know? I thought you had this all planned out.\u201d</p><p>How Carrie wished that were true. She knew what she had to do, but the rest was up to Finn.</p><p>The next day Carrie sat at the O\u2019Hare Airport gate, waiting to board her flight to Seattle, when her cell chirped. She didn\u2019t recognize the number but saw that it was an Alaska prefix.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she answered hesitatingly.</p><p>\u201cCarrie, this is Sawyer O\u2019Halloran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSawyer?\u201d She couldn\u2019t imagine why he would be calling her, unless something had happened to Finn. She gripped hold of the phone with both hands, instantly alarmed. \u201cIs everything all right? Has Finn been hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ... He isn\u2019t in the hospital or anything, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re wondering. What happened between the two of you, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Carrie relaxed a bit. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to ask him about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking, right? He hasn\u2019t been himself since he returned from Chicago. I\u2019ve never seen him like this. He disappeared for a couple of days, showed up drunk as a coyote, which is surprising, because he isn\u2019t much of a drinker. He isn\u2019t talking to anyone\u2014well, other than me, but it\u2019s difficult to understand what he\u2019s saying. Furthermore, he isn\u2019t eating or sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Carrie exhaled and whispered into the small receiver. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m not doing much better myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two had a falling out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, before we go any further, Finn doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m contacting you. If he finds out about this, he\u2019ll have my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get my personal phone number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy. I waited until he passed out and then checked his cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was that drunk?\u201d This didn\u2019t sound anything like Finn. It didn\u2019t make her feel any better knowing that he was miserable. All Carrie wanted was for this foolishness to be over.</p><p>\u201cNo, he wasn\u2019t drunk, but practically dead on his feet. I don\u2019t know the last time he slept. He kept mumbling something about giving you a shot at what you wanted, and you rejecting that. Don\u2019t know what that\u2019s about, but I figure you must.\u201d</p><p>Carrie simply shook her head. \u201cIf he wants to talk to me, all he needs to do is call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling him that.\u201d</p><p>At this point, Carrie suspected Finn wasn\u2019t listening to advice from anyone.</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling this all goes back to that article you wanted to publish. The one Finn asked you not to write.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. At first he was adamant I not write the piece, and now it seems he\u2019s had a change of heart. He\u2019s giving me what he thinks I want, but it isn\u2019t. What I want is him.\u201d</p><p>The line went silent. \u201cI\u2019m confused. He\u2019s giving you this opportunity because he loves you and you\u2019re turning it down because you love him? Have I got that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do.\u201d Her flight was announced, and the boarding process had already started. \u201cListen, Sawyer, I need to get off the phone, but I want you to tell Finn something for me, if you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting him know we had this conversation. I value my head, which he\u2019d bite off if he got so much as an inkling that I\u2019ve contacted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I understand, but if the opportunity comes up and he finds out we chatted, tell him that before I will agree to write a single word, he will need to sit down with me face-to-face; otherwise, it\u2019s no deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your final answer?\u201d Sawyer wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Carrie disconnected the call and felt better than she had in almost three weeks.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Carrie\u2019s flight from Chicago landed at Sea-Tac Airport on time. It would be good to be with family over the Christmas holiday. She needed the comfort of their acceptance and love. Not a moment passed when Finn wasn\u2019t in the forefront of her mind.</p><p>She exited the plane and automatically reached for her cell, turning it on. Either her mother or father would be waiting in the cell-phone waiting area for her text message. As soon as it powered up, she typed in the information that she\u2019d landed safely, and then headed toward the exit signs. She would go directly to baggage claim and meet them at the curb for pickup. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dragging her carry-on behind her, she was following her fellow passengers onto the escalator when her phone beeped, indicating she had a text message. Assuming it was one of her parents, she didn\u2019t immediately check. About halfway up, she glanced at her phone and saw that the text was from Finn. It shook her up so badly that she dropped the phone. Carrie watched in horror as it went tumbling down the escalator steps. \u201cPlease, someone grab that for me!\u201d she cried out in a panic.</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d a woman at the bottom shouted back to her.</p><p>As soon as Carrie reached the top, she hurriedly circled around and leaped onto the opposite escalator, racing down the steps, unwilling to stand and wait. The woman remained at the bottom and handed the cell back to her.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Carrie whispered, grabbing hold of it. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p> <p>Her heart raced at a frantic speed as she opened Finn\u2019s text.</p><p>Why won\u2019t you write the article?</p><p>Her fingers moved in a blur as she typed her response. I would be happy to.</p><p>Good.</p><p>Once you give me a face-to-face interview.</p> <p>His response was immediate. Not going to happen.</p><p>Then get someone else. She didn\u2019t expect Finn to be thrilled with her stipulation. Seeing her again was the last thing he wanted, because it was sure to be difficult to answer her questions, and, even more so, to send her away.</p><p>She waited for a response, but none came.</p><p>Having collected her bag, Carrie was standing in the cold outside the airport, waiting to be picked up by her mother, when she heard the ping indicating Finn had responded. Why are you so stubborn?</p><p>An involuntary smile came over her as she rushed to answer. Because you lied. You love me.</p><p>Finn didn\u2019t deny or confirm her text, not that she\u2019d expected he would. After a couple of moments, Carrie placed her phone inside her purse. The ache in her heart was back, stronger than ever. This could quite possibly be the last communication she might ever have with Finn. The thought sent her Christmas spirits spiraling downward.</p> <p>Her mother pulled up to the airport curb, and after sticking her bags in the backseat, Carrie climbed inside the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re home,\u201d her mother said, and they briefly hugged.</p><p>\u201cI am, too,\u201d Carrie assured her. They drove off, heading to the family home, where her brother, his wife, and his children would be waiting. Soon they\u2019d all be gathered around the table, and there would be laughter and conversation. Finn had never known this, and Carrie hungered to share her family with him.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, honey?\u201d her mother asked, as they merged into the heavy freeway traffic. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so well. It\u2019s Finn, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Carrie nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow much weight have you lost?\u201d</p><p>Carrie shrugged. \u201cA few pounds is all.\u201d</p><p>Reaching over, her mother gave Carrie\u2019s hand a gentle squeeze. \u201cMark my words, it will all work out.\u201d</p> <p>Carrie desperately wanted that to be true. Everything seemed so hopeless at the moment.</p><p>\u201cTime is the great healer,\u201d her mother assured her.</p><p>She\u2019d spent an hour on the phone with her mother shortly after her breakup with Finn, pouring out all her hurt and fears. Patty Slayton hadn\u2019t offered empty reassurances or reminded Carrie of her own concerns over this relationship; instead, she\u2019d simply listened. At the end she\u2019d said, \u201cYou really do love him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d There was no doubt in Carrie\u2019s mind. Finn Dalton owned her heart. He carried it with him, and now the question, the real question, was what he intended to do with it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just glad you\u2019re home for the holidays,\u201d her mother said, pulling her back into the present.</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d Carrie didn\u2019t mention that she might be returning to Seattle on a more permanent basis. For the first time since she\u2019d spoken to Nash, she actually considered caving in. That was what Finn wanted her to do in an effort to ease his conscience. He could break her heart and then walk away without guilt because he\u2019d done her a good turn. Writing that blasted article was what everyone hoped she\u2019d do.</p><p>\u201cI need to run an errand in the morning,\u201d Carrie casually mentioned once she was home and had emptied her suitcase. Dinner was over and her brother and family had returned to their home. \u201cDo you mind if I borrow the car?\u201d she asked her parents.</p><p>\u201cYou going to run off to Alaska?\u201d her father asked.</p><p>\u201cNick Slayton,\u201d her mother hissed in a low, warning breath.</p><p>\u201cWell, if Carrie is going to break up with Finn Dalton, why can\u2019t she do it after we have a chance to meet him?\u201d</p><p>Both her mother and Carrie ignored the comment.</p><p>\u201cI doubt very much that I\u2019ll be going to Alaska,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>\u201cOf course you can take the car.\u201d Her mother cast her a questioning glance. \u201cI don\u2019t have any plans for the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be gone more than an hour or two,\u201d Carrie assured her.</p><p>First thing the next morning, Carrie contacted Finn\u2019s mother and they set a time to meet. Joan had the front door open before Carrie had reached the end of the short walkway.</p><p>The older woman held open the screen door. They briefly hugged before Joan brought Carrie into the house. Her tree was up and decorated with festive ornaments, and her fireplace mantel displayed a wooden Nativity scene. Joan indicated that Carrie should take a seat on the sofa. Finn\u2019s mother had a teapot and two cups out, along with a plate of decorated sugar cookies.</p><p>\u201cFinn used to help me decorate the cookies every Christmas,\u201d she said as they sat next to each other on the sofa. \u201cHe enjoyed it, although his father feared I was turning him into a sissy. My goodness, the boy was only four years old.\u201d</p><p>Joan handed her a cup of freshly poured tea, which Carrie accepted, holding on to the tiny saucer with one hand and the teacup with the other.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from my son?\u201d Joan asked.</p><p>\u201cJust briefly.\u201d There\u2019d been nothing since their quick text exchanges late yesterday afternoon.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like Finn is as stubborn as his father.\u201d</p><p>Carrie was afraid that was the case.</p><p>Joan exhaled as though emotionally bracing herself for what was coming. \u201cYou brought Paul\u2019s wedding band back to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m so sorry. I tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, dear. I should never have put you in such an awkward position.\u201d</p><p>Carrie disagreed. \u201cI doubt I could have convinced anyone to fly me to Finn\u2019s cabin without it, so the ring served a purpose.\u201d She dug it out of her purse, and with regret returned it to Finn\u2019s mother, feeling like she\u2019d failed her.</p><p>Joan\u2019s eyes revealed her disappointment. \u201cI so hoped ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know; I did, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confident Paul went to his grave loving me. Unfortunately, pride prevented him from letting me know he wanted me back. He was unwilling to compromise. It could only be his way.\u201d</p><p>Carrie feared Joan might be right and Finn was like his father. He, too, would be willing to walk away from her and not look back.</p><p>They sipped their tea in silence for several moments while Carrie gathered her thoughts. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate your help with something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Carrie reached into the bag she\u2019d brought along with her. \u201cI need you to tell me what this is.\u201d She brought out the Christmas gift Finn had left under her Christmas tree. Unable to wait any longer, Carrie had unwrapped his gift before she left Chicago, but she didn\u2019t have a clue as to what it might be. It was a narrow stick of what appeared to be fossilized ivory and was about twenty inches in length.</p><p>The night before, Carrie\u2019s father had taken a look at it and shook his head. He didn\u2019t have an answer for her.</p><p>Joan reached for the object and released a soft \u201cOh, my.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Carrie asked.</p><p>Joan reverently ran her hand down the piece, and then raised her eyes to Carrie\u2019s. \u201cMy son gave you this for Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. What can you tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>Joan nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s an oosik.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d This wasn\u2019t helping.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a walrus penis bone.\u201d</p><p>Carrie gasped. \u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>Joan laughed at the look that came over Carrie. \u201cLeave it to my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gave me a toaster and a walrus penis bone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one is rather rare, though, if it\u2019s the same one Paul got all those years ago from an elderly Alaskan native.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn oosik?\u201d Carrie repeated, the word unfamiliar on her tongue.</p><p>\u201cThis one is a fossilized baculum and comes from an extinct walrus. They\u2019re highly collectible for Alaskan art. It was one of Paul\u2019s most prized possessions. At the time, and remember, this was many years ago, it was valued at around twenty thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would Finn give it to me?\u201d She wanted to clasp it to her breast, but that wouldn\u2019t bring Finn back.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious, my dear? He loves you.\u201d</p><p>It was too valuable, and it clearly held sentimental value to Joan. \u201cI can\u2019t keep this,\u201d she said sadly, her mind made up. \u201cI\u2019d rather you take it.\u201d</p><p>Automatically, Joan shook her head. \u201cFinn wanted you to have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Carrie whispered. \u201cIt should stay with you. And if by chance Finn and I ...\u201d Her voice caught, and she had to stop talking for fear her emotions might overwhelm her. \u201cIf Finn and I,\u201d she repeated, \u201cmanage to get back together, then you can save it to give to one of your grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>Joan\u2019s eyes filled with unshed tears, and she slowly nodded.</p><p>Deep down, Carrie believed she wouldn\u2019t hear from Finn again. She\u2019d played her hand, laid down her cards, and her ploy had failed. Finn was unwilling to meet her face-to-face for an interview or anything else. He couldn\u2019t look her in the eye and say the things he had to her while in her kitchen, and they both knew it.</p><p>Christmas Eve day Carrie helped her mother get everything ready for their annual Christmas buffet. Instead of the big traditional dinner, complete with turkey and stuffing plus all the fixings, her mother served a multitude of longtime family favorites: several salads, casseroles, fried chicken, deviled eggs, and a ham, plus a wide variety of desserts.</p><p>On Christmas Day, friends and family would stop by to partake. Carrie always enjoyed this special time working in the kitchen with her mother. It seemed the most important discussions of her life had taken place in front of the stove or the refrigerator.</p><p>Carrie sliced the cooked potatoes for the potato salad, her father\u2019s favorite, when her mother unexpectedly came to her and hugged her. \u201cI know how hard this year has been for you, honey. Your heart is aching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking about him might help. Do you want to tell me what it is that you find so compelling about Finn Dalton?\u201d</p><p>Discussing her feelings was exactly what Carrie needed. Everyone else seemed to tiptoe around anything having to do with Finn, afraid to bring up any reference to him. Carrie realized they were simply looking to protect her, but Finn had become the subject everyone had chosen to ignore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not like any man I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d she told her mother. \u201cHe\u2019s resourceful and resilient, quick-witted and generous. He has the most wonderful subtle sense of humor. I can laugh with him more than I have with anyone else I\u2019ve ever met. And he\u2019s incredibly intelligent. Everyone looks at us and all they see are the differences, but beneath it all we share the same values, the same sense of what\u2019s important. He told me over Thanksgiving how much he envies me my family, and if he ever had one of his own he\u2019d make sure he would be the kind of husband and father my own dad has been.\u201d She paused, remembering the night they\u2019d stood out and gazed at the heavens. \u201cAnd while he\u2019d never openly admit it, he loves Christmas. He helped me put up decorations without a word of complaint. He has a Nativity set from when he was a kid and admitted he sets it up every year. I don\u2019t think anyone else knows he does that.\u201d She smiled, remembering how she\u2019d amused herself while he was gone from the cabin. \u201cWhen I was with him in Alaska, I hung paper snowflakes from the ceiling of his cabin.\u201d</p><p>Her mother laughed. \u201cI can only imagine what he thought of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, Mom, I don\u2019t think he minded. For all I know, they are still up. They should have been stars, though, instead of snowflakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter the snowstorm had died down, we stood outside under the stars. Oh, Mom, you can\u2019t imagine how beautiful the night sky is in Alaska. All those stars\u2014I\u2019ve never seen anything that could compare to it. They were like fairy dust sprinkled across the heavens. I think it was on that starry night that I realized I was falling in love with Finn.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d felt it, too, Carrie knew. Everything had changed between them from that moment on. It\u2019d been magical, wondrous, with his arms around her. He would never admit it, but those few minutes under the stars had shaken Finn. They\u2019d deeply affected her as well.</p><p>\u201cWhat about his family?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>\u201cHis mother is wonderful, and she loves her son and wants to be reunited with him. Finn is struggling with that.\u201d He\u2019d never come out and say as much, but Carrie could sense it from little things that had happened, things he\u2019d said and done. He wanted to ignore the fact that he had a mother, but try as he might, he still cared.</p><p>\u201cHe seems to be struggling with a great deal at the moment,\u201d her mother said.</p> <p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Carrie agreed, and like her, he was hurting. She wondered if he thought about the things they\u2019d discussed when he\u2019d been with her over Thanksgiving. He\u2019d told her his dreams and she\u2019d shared her own, and while they lived in different worlds, they\u2019d found common ground and a deep connection.</p><p>Perhaps she was being unreasonable about all this, Carrie mused. If Finn wanted to clear his conscience and be done with the relationship all in one fell swoop, she shouldn\u2019t stand in his way. This was what he wanted. No one could write about him the way she could. Carrie suspected that outside of Sawyer, few knew Finn better than she did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid, Mom\u2014afraid I will never love anyone as deeply as I do Finn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, you can\u2019t see it now, but in time you\u2019ll be able to remember him without pain. Love doesn\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoving someone shouldn\u2019t hurt like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d her mother whispered, and placed her arm around Carrie\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAnd in the future, when you\u2019re able to look back, I promise you it won\u2019t hurt as intensely as it does now. You\u2019ll feel sad for what might have been, but the pain will be gone.\u201d</p> <p>Later, after all the salads had been made and the dishes washed and put away, Carrie retreated to her childhood bedroom. She sat on her bed, rehashing the conversation with her mother. It\u2019d been a good talk, and while she didn\u2019t hold out much hope, she couldn\u2019t help reaching for her phone, longing for a text or call from Finn.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t one.</p><p>In a couple of hours, Carrie would be joining her family for Christmas Eve services at their church. She wasn\u2019t much in the mood, but she wouldn\u2019t disappoint her family by staying home. Church was exactly where she needed to be. This was Christmas, with or without Finn.</p><p>Before she could change her mind, she reached for her phone and sent a brief message to him.</p><p>Merry Christmas. Look at the stars tonight and remember me.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Christmas morning, Carrie woke and waited for the dark cloud that seemed to hang over her head to return. It didn\u2019t. She sat up in bed with a deep sense of peace. She\u2019d followed her heart, and while she would always love Finn, she was ready to move forward. Today was Christmas, and she wasn\u2019t going to allow her current sorrows to mar the day.</p><p>Hearing movement in the kitchen, she knew her parents were up. They enjoyed their morning ritual of having coffee together. How fortunate she was to have parents who continued to love and care for each other. Carrie didn\u2019t want to disturb their special time, and so she gathered her clothes together and headed into her tiny bathroom for a shower.</p> <p>Her mother noticed the change in Carrie\u2019s attitude right away. \u201cI feel better,\u201d she said, hugging both her parents. \u201cI\u2019m going to be okay now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you will be,\u201d her mother said, hugging her back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to give that young man a piece of my mind,\u201d her father insisted. \u201cIf I had my way, I\u2019d string Finn Dalton up by his thumbs for hurting my little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Daddy,\u201d Carrie chided, loving him for wanting to make things right for his daughter.</p><p>By noon her brother and his family had stopped by for breakfast on their way to his in-laws\u2019. All the gifts had been opened, and Carrie was busy in the kitchen, helping her mother get everything set up for their buffet, when the doorbell chimed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be Charlie,\u201d her father called out from the other room.</p><p>\u201cUncle\u201d Charlie Hines was a longtime family friend who\u2019d remained a bachelor. He made sure he was one of the first to stop by for the feast, claiming he never ate better than Christmas Day at Nick and Patty\u2019s.</p><p>Carrie and her mother had barely gotten the food displayed on the table.</p><p>\u201cThat Charlie,\u201d her mother said under her breath, setting down a pitcher of water. \u201cHe comes earlier every year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably the only decent dinner he eats,\u201d Carrie added, as she followed her mother out to greet him.</p><p>Only it wasn\u2019t Charlie who stood in the middle of the living room. Instead, it was Joan and Finn. Mother and son. Together.</p><p>Thankfully, Carrie had set down the last of the salads from the kitchen; otherwise, there would be lettuce and heaven knew what else tossed all across the carpet.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d Joan said. \u201cI hate to intrude, but I brought someone with me I thought you might like to see.\u201d</p><p>Carrie\u2019s mouth had gone completely dry. She couldn\u2019t utter a word\u2014not a single, solitary word.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not intruding,\u201d Carrie\u2019s mother assured her, as she stepped forward to clasp the other woman\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m Patty Slayton, Carrie\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoan Dalton Reese, Finn\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>The two women hugged, and the introductions continued as Nick came in.</p><p>Finn\u2019s intense gaze settled on Carrie. Everyone seemed to be watching them. Carrie wanted to welcome them both, but couldn\u2019t because she found it impossible to speak. Never, in all her life, had she seen a more welcome sight than Finnegan Dalton standing in the middle of her parents\u2019 living room early Christmas afternoon. He seemed to fill up the space, his eyes boring into hers, waiting, questioning.</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, Carrie did what seemed to be the only sensible thing\u2014she rushed across the room and launched herself into Finn\u2019s arms.</p><p>He caught her around the waist, lifting her off the floor. And then they were kissing. It felt as if the last few weeks boiled down to this one hungry, passionate kiss. It was as if they were starved for each other.</p><p>Carrie\u2019s hands framed his face, his beautiful bearded face. The beard wasn\u2019t as thick as before, but his whiskers were back. His beautiful, dark whiskers. It didn\u2019t matter that they had an audience or that Joan was chatting animatedly with her parents. The only important thing was Finn, the man she loved.</p><p>\u201cCome into the family room,\u201d her mother was saying to Joan. \u201cI have the feeling these two might appreciate a few minutes alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore he leaves I want to talk to that young man,\u201d her father objected.</p><p>\u201cNot to worry,\u201d Joan assured him. \u201cI believe Finn wants to talk to you, too.\u201d</p><p>And then it was just the two of them, as her parents and Joan left the room.</p><p>Finn lowered her until her feet were on the floor. Carrie kept her hands on his face, unable to stop looking at him. \u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re actually here.\u201d</p><p>She led him to the sofa and then sat on his lap. His eyes were eating her up as if he\u2019d been without water for far too long and she was a freshwater spring. \u201cWhat have you done to me, Carrie Slayton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoved you,\u201d she returned.</p><p>\u201cI gave you the career opportunity of a lifetime, and you turned it down.\u201d He shook his head as if even now he couldn\u2019t believe that she\u2019d refused. Carrie found it hard to believe herself, only it had been necessary.</p><p>\u201cMy career isn\u2019t nearly as important as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is crazy, Carrie. We have everything going against us. You live in Chicago, and I\u2019m in Alaska ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll move,\u201d she said, cutting him off, and then pulled his mouth to hers and kissed him in a way that left them both weak and breathless. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it work,\u201d she insisted, her eyes still closed. She reveled in the taste and feel of him holding her. It\u2019d been far too long since she\u2019d been in his arms. She hadn\u2019t realized how badly she\u2019d missed his touch.</p><p>\u201cWhen you kiss me like that you make me believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She couldn\u2019t keep from touching him. Her hands roamed over his neck and shoulders, savoring the feel of him. \u201cYou\u2019ve reconciled with your mother?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his hand over his eyes. \u201cI\u2019d pushed you out of my life. I\u2019d been alone before, but not like this, and then I remembered something you\u2019d said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you.\u201d He leaned down and kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cI asked if my mother needed anything, and you said the only thing she really needed was her son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was with her yesterday morning.\u201d Carrie couldn\u2019t believe Joan would hold back the news that she\u2019d heard from Finn.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t call her before I came. I wasn\u2019t sure I had the courage to go through with it until I pulled up to her house late last night. I told myself I was coming to Seattle to make amends with her, but the real reason was I couldn\u2019t stay away from you. Not for another minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Finn, this is the best Christmas of my life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He couldn\u2019t seem to stop staring at her. \u201cYou gave my mother the oosik,\u201d he commented.</p><p>Carrie lowered her gaze. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep anything that valuable, Finn. It was more important that she have it than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what you said to her,\u201d he returned, frowning.</p><p>Carrie couldn\u2019t remember anything specific. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat if the two of us were to get back together, she should save it for one of her grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>Carrie relaxed and smiled. The warm, happy feeling that had come over her that morning intensified. Had her heart known Finn was close? she wondered. She hardly knew how else to explain this sensation.</p><p>\u201cYou want it all, don\u2019t you? Marriage, children, a career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s what you want, too, Finn.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and nodded. \u201cYes,\u201d he whispered, \u201cmore than I ever knew, although I didn\u2019t realize it until I met you.\u201d</p> <p>Carrie braced her forehead against his. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me where we settle\u2014Alaska, Washington, Illinois\u2014because my home is wherever you are.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her even closer. \u201cI thought I could walk away from you, but I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019ve never needed anyone the way I need you. I felt alone, truly alone, for the first time. Then you sent me that text, reminding me about the night we viewed the stars. You asked me to remember you. Did you honestly believe forgetting you was even possible? I fell in love with you that starry night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the night when I realized I was falling in love with you, too,\u201d she confessed. It had been that special moment, gazing up at the heavens, when she\u2019d felt that connection with Finn, unaware that from that moment forward their futures would be forever linked. It seemed as though the heavens had smiled down on them both and offered them a blessing.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here,\u201d Carrie whispered, worshipping him with her eyes, loving him so much it felt as though her heart were about to crack wide open.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I\u2019m here and I\u2019m not going away. I doubt Sawyer is talking to me any longer, and even Hennessey looks at me with disgust.\u201d He studied her, his gaze delving into hers. \u201cI hardly know myself any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Finn, I love you so much.\u201d</p> <p>He brushed the hair from her forehead. \u201cAnswer me truthfully, Carrie. Would you seriously consider resigning from your job with the newspaper?\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a difficult question. Carrie nodded. Her ultimate goal had always been to eventually return to Seattle. \u201cI don\u2019t have to work for a newspaper to be a writer. I\u2019d even be happy freelancing from home.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her close. \u201cMy home is wherever you are. I think to be fair to us both, we can divide our time between Seattle and Alaska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be willing to do that?\u201d</p><p>Finn smiled down on her and kissed her again. \u201cI want the opportunity to get to know my mother, and this will give you a chance to be close to your own family. We\u2019ll make it work, Carrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy home is with you and with Hennessey, and then later, of course, we\u2019ll be adding to the family.\u201d</p><p>His head came back up. \u201cYou want another dog?\u201d</p><p>Carrie slapped his chest. \u201cNo, silly. Children.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d he said with a chuckle.</p><p>Carrie nestled her head beneath his chin. \u201cThings are right between you and your mother?\u201d Although she hadn\u2019t been able to take her eyes off Finn, Carrie had noticed the happiness that seemed to radiate off Joan. It seemed both Carrie and Joan were having the best Christmases of their lives.</p><p>\u201cYou were right about her. She\u2019s never stopped loving me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to have that effect on women.\u201d</p><p>He brought her mouth close to his. \u201cCertain women, at any rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis woman.\u201d</p><p>Finn spread nibbling kisses down the side of her neck. \u201cThis man loves this woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because this is just the beginning for us. And this time it\u2019s for keeps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor keeps,\u201d Finn repeated. He was willing to admit he\u2019d been a fool. He\u2019d assumed he\u2019d be able to walk away from Carrie and not look back. At the time, it\u2019d seemed the prudent choice. He knew when he found the article on her laptop that Carrie had never intended to submit it. Finding it gave him all the excuse he needed to break it off. Only she\u2019d called his bluff. She\u2019d forced him to lie. He wasn\u2019t proud of the things he\u2019d said to Carrie. At the time, it had seemed necessary. Finn had believed that it would be tough the first couple of days but within a short amount of time he\u2019d be over her.</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>Miserable didn\u2019t even begin to describe his feelings. He felt lost, cast adrift with nothing to anchor him. Before Carrie had entered his life, everything seemed perfectly fine. He\u2019d been content. Happy, even\u2014and perhaps he was.</p><p>Then she was dumped into his well-ordered existence\u2014no thanks to Sawyer O\u2019Halloran\u2014and everything changed. All at once he became aware of the dark shadows in what had once been light, the isolation he\u2019d accepted rather than deal with the past and his parents\u2019 divorce. At first he assumed he could let her go, and he later realized he was making the same mistake as his father with his unwillingness to compromise. His father had been determined to stand his ground. If Joan loved him, she would accept his terms, and as a result he\u2019d ended up lonely and bitter. Finn refused to repeat history. He loved Carrie, and if loving her meant spending part of the year in Seattle, then that was a small sacrifice in order to make her his wife. In order to make her happy.</p><p>His thoughts returned to his ridiculous efforts to sever the relationship. Carrie knew him far too well, had refused to believe he didn\u2019t love her. How easily she saw through his ploy. She\u2019d read him perfectly. If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, she\u2019d been unwilling to settle for his token apology by giving her the opportunity to write the article about him that everyone seemed to want.</p><p>This woman could be stubborn. It didn\u2019t help matters that she held his heart in the palm of her hand. Still, he fought it; still, he assumed he could go on without her. What a laugh that turned out to be.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t only Carrie, either. In all the years since his mother had walked out, not once had Finn felt the need to connect with her again. She\u2019d left him and his father. Pride demanded that he have nothing more to do with her, despite her repeated efforts to reach out to him.</p><p>Feeling alone and lost, Finn had to accept that as difficult as it was to admit, he needed his mother. His children would need their grandmother.</p><p>Carrie wanted children. The thought both thrilled and terrified him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a funny look,\u201d she said, gazing up at him, frowning slightly.</p><p>Finn kissed her again, and a sense of happiness and joy filled him until it felt as if he could soar. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d Carrie agreed.</p><p>Her parents and his mother came back into the room, and Carrie scooted off his lap. They stood and he slipped his arm around her waist.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s eyes were moist with tears, and she held her fingers against her lips, watching the two of them.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to love our Carrie?\u201d Nick Slayton asked.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d she protested, clearly embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cWith all my heart,\u201d Finn promised, keeping her close against his side.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d Nick thrust out his hand for Finn to shake. \u201cWelcome to the family.\u201d</p><p>The two men clasped hands, and their gazes held for an extra-long moment as understanding passed between the two of them.</p><p>Oh, yes, this was definitely going to be the best Christmas of Finn Dalton\u2019s life. </p> </body></html>"]
