His companions were smart enough to reach the same conclusion he had. Zoltan\u2019s snitch had double-crossed them, and now they\u2019d teleported into a trap.</p> <p>Mikhail quickly scanned the group of Malcontents as they emerged from the nearby forest and gathered on the moonlit meadow, snarling and thumping their fists against their shields. They were armed with swords, spears, and axes. A mortal might assume these vampire thugs were hopelessly stuck in the past, but Mikhail knew better. The Malcontents preferred their battles up close and bloody. The scent of blood in the air drove them wild.</p><p>He completed his headcount. \u201cThirty-six to four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be worse,\u201d J.L. whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe each take out nine,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe can do it.\u201d</p><p>Zoltan nodded. \u201cWe should fight in a circle, so our backs are protected.\u201d</p> <p>Mikhail frowned as his companions drew their swords. Zoltan\u2019s idea wasn\u2019t bad, but it would severely limit their mobility. And if there was one thing Mikhail valued, it was a life free from limitations.</p><p>Freedom from the ravages of time and disease. Freedom to live however he liked and fight however he wanted. In over six hundred years of battle, no one had come close to defeating him. As a result, he had become a fiercely aggressive warrior but never much of a team player.</p><p>Not that he didn\u2019t care about his friends. Just twenty minutes earlier, Jack had announced with a huge grin that his wife, Lara, was pregnant. Mikhail would single-handedly annihilate an entire army of Malcontents to ensure Jack returned to his wife even though it was unlikely that he would need assistance. Jack, aka Giacomo di Venezia, was probably the best vampire swordsman on the planet. Jean-Luc Echarpe would disagree, but he was too busy designing silly clothes, while Jack and Mikhail were helping Zoltan destroy a Malcontent human-trafficking ring based in Albania.</p><p>As Coven Master of Eastern Europe, Zoltan Czakvar could handle himself in a swordfight. It was J.L. Wang who had Mikhail concerned. The former FBI Special Agent was a young American Vamp and probably more comfortable with a pistol in his hand than a sword.</p><p>A metallic screech pierced the air as the Malcontents drew their swords. They shouted taunts across the field, no doubt feeling arrogantly secure in their superior numbers.</p><p>Time to improve the odds. With one swift move, Mikhail reached overhead to draw his weapon from the leather scabbard on his back. It was a huge broadsword, heavy enough that most mortals found it difficult to lift with two hands. With his left hand, he pulled a freshly sharpened battle-axe from his belt.</p> <p>His roar boomed across the field, causing the Malcontents to flinch. As he charged toward them, he saw the calculations in their gleaming eyes. Just like the weathermen who watched incoming hurricanes, they were predicting where and when he would make landfall.</p><p>Dead center. The vampires in the middle lifted their swords and shields in anticipation. The ends of the battle line inched forward, hoping to close in and surround him.</p><p>Mikhail teleported to the right flank, and with one mighty swing of his sword, he lopped off three heads. Before the dead could fully disintegrate into three piles of dust, he teleported to the left flank and decapitated three more Malcontents. With one last stop at the center of the line, he took out three more, then teleported back to his companions. The entire maneuver had taken less than five seconds.</p><p>Shocked, the Malcontents fumbled about. A dozen succumbed to fear and teleported away.</p><p>Mikhail took a deep breath, then bellowed another war cry as he lifted his sword and battle-axe overhead. That alone was enough to make three more Malcontents piss on themselves before teleporting away.</p><p>Behind him, his companions chuckled.</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s twelve to four,\u201d Zoltan said.</p><p>\u201cWay to go, Mikhail,\u201d J.L. added.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are we waiting for?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>With a shout, they charged toward the Malcontents. Mikhail dispatched two with one swing of his sword, then spun around to take out a third with his axe. A quick glance assured him that his companions were doing well. Jack had killed two and engaged a third, an ugly guy with a scar down the side of his face. Zoltan and J.L. had each killed one and were fighting a second opponent.</p><p>That left two Malcontents. Mikhail spotted them attempting to sneak up on J.L. and Zoltan from behind. Typical Malcontent behavior. Stabbing someone in the back.</p><p>He teleported to the first one, turned him to dust, then glowered at the second Malcontent. \u201cBoo.\u201d</p><p>With a squeak, the second Malcontent teleported away. Mikhail wedged his axe beneath his belt, then turned to watch the end of the battle.</p><p>A burst of music joined the clanging of swords. Mikhail tilted his head. The music appeared to be coming from Jack\u2019s jacket. A lively rendition of \u201cThat\u2019s Amore.\u201d</p><p>With a muttered curse, Jack lunged at his opponent, causing Scarface to jump back six feet. With his left hand, Jack pulled out his cell phone and glanced at it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer it,\u201d Mikhail muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lara.\u201d Jack continued to fence with Scarface. \u201cIf I don\u2019t answer, she\u2019ll worry.\u201d</p><p>Mikhail snorted. Thank God he\u2019d avoided the trap most of his friends had fallen into. Marriage and children? Never again.</p><p>\u201cHello, bellissima,\u201d Jack answered the phone. His opponent tried to take advantage of his divided attention by rushing forward, but Jack easily drove him back.</p><p>\u201cThis is not a good time, Lara. Can I call you back in about twenty minutes?\u201d Jack glanced to the side as Zoltan finished off his assailant. \u201cMake that ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause as Jack parried with Scarface. \u201cNo, there\u2019s nothing going on. We\u2019re perfectly safe.\u201d He deftly handled a well-aimed thrust. \u201cThat clashing noise? Oh, it\u2019s just a few of the guys doing sword practice.\u201d</p><p>Stifling a groan, Mikhail slid his sword back into the scabbard. J.L. Wang jabbed his opponent in the heart, turning him to dust. He joined Mikhail and Zoltan as they stood nearby, watching Jack.</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetheart, you don\u2019t have to wait on me for dinner.\u201d Jack jumped, missing a low swipe intended to slice through his knees. \u201cI\u2019ll be home soon. Could you put a bottle of Blardonnay in the fridge for me?\u201d</p><p>Mikhail rolled his eyes. With a resigned sigh, Zoltan sheathed his sword. Jack could have killed Scarface five minutes ago if he weren\u2019t so distracted.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re hungry, go ahead and eat.\u201d Jack easily fended off another frenzied attack. \u201cYou\u2019re eating for two, you know.\u201d</p><p>Mikhail groaned. J.L. glanced at his watch.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re fat. I think you\u2019re\u2014merda!\u201d Jack leaped to the side to avoid disembowelment. \u201cNo, bellissima, I wasn\u2019t referring to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Mikhail zoomed forward, caught Scarface\u2019s hand in his fist, and squeezed till vampire cried out in pain and dropped his sword. Then Mikhail punched him in the jaw, sending him flying back twenty yards, where he slumped onto the ground in a daze.</p><p>Jack gave Mikhail a grateful nod, then walked away a short distance to continue his phone conversation. \u201cLara, I think you\u2019re more beautiful than ever.\u201d He slid his sword into its sheath. \u201cI know you miss working in the field, but we agreed you shouldn\u2019t be taking any risks right now. Yes, it\u2019s perfectly safe here, but\u2014why is my voice echoing? Did you put me on the speakerphone? Lara\u2014\u201d He stopped as a form materialized nearby.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be Lara, Mikhail thought, as a dark form took shape in the moonlight. As a mortal, Lara didn\u2019t have the ability to teleport.</p><p>This was a vampire and definitely female. Her head was covered with a black spandex cap that included a mask over her eyes. Whoever she was, she was stunning. Black leather boots and gloves, and the rest of her encased in body-hugging black spandex. Long, slim legs, nicely rounded hips, a trim waist cinched tightly with a leather utility belt, and breasts that were firm and full. Not too full, he amended his assessment, but full enough to fit nicely in his hands. Not that he intended to\u2014</p><p>His thoughts screeched to a halt. Her body looked familiar. Only the lower half of her face was exposed, but that, too, seemed familiar. Where had he seen those lips? So pink and delicate. And the way she lifted her chin with a slight tilt, as if she could shrivel a man\u2019s balls with one arrogant, disdainful glance\u2014he\u2019d seen that before on a reality show on the Digital Vampire Network. He didn\u2019t usually watch television, but that was one show he hadn\u2019t missed.</p><p>Was it truly her? How many times had he imagined her naked on a pile of furs?</p><p>She twirled around, her black silk cape rippling through the air as she scanned the surroundings. Apparently convinced she was in no danger, she faced them, assuming a dramatic pose. Black boots wide apart, gloved fists on her hips, chest thrust forward, and chin lifted as she looked them over. She gave an imperious nod to Zoltan, then J.L.</p><p>Mikhail watched her closely as her gaze moved to him. Her eyes widened, then she quickly focused elsewhere.</p><p>It was definitely her. Her eyes were an odd shade of blue. Lavender blue. In over six hundred years, he\u2019d never seen anyone with eyes quite like hers. She was the most beautiful female vampire in the world. Unfortunately, she was also the snootiest.</p><p>There had been many occasions over the years when he could have met her in person. He always spotted her across the ballroom at Roman\u2019s big parties. She would wear one of her wispy Regency-style gowns and pile her shiny blond hair on her head with a few curls trailing down her lovely neck.</p><p>Naked on a pile of furs. He\u2019d always been careful to keep his distance, for he knew if he drew too close, he\u2019d want to drag her off to a cave.</p><p>Not that he had a cave. There was just something about her that stirred the centuries-old Norseman in him, heating his blood till he was driven to conquer and pillage. No doubt, she wanted to perch on a satin chaise in an elegant parlor while she sipped hot Chocolood from a china teacup and engaged in witty conversation. He wanted her naked and wet on a pile of furs.</p><p>She had a long, fancy name, but he preferred to think of her simply as Pam. Naked and wet and panting on a pile of furs.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, gentlemen,\u201d she addressed them with her crisp British accent. \u201cJack, you may inform Lara that I have arrived safely.\u201d</p><p>Jack lowered his voice. \u201cLara, what have you done?\u201d</p><p>Mikhail leaned to the side to watch Scarface, who was still on the ground. The Malcontent\u2019s eyes were open, and he was leering at Pam.</p><p>\u201cI know I said it was safe here,\u201d Jack continued, \u201cbut you shouldn\u2019t have let her come.\u201d He glanced at the woman in spandex. \u201cWho the hell is she?\u201d</p><p>Behind Pam, Scarface jumped to his feet. Mikhail tensed, ready to attack.</p><p>\u201cI am VampWoman!\u201d Pam gripped the edges of her cape and lifted her arms suddenly as if she planned to take flight. All she managed to do was clobber Scarface as he made a lunge for her.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. So sorry.\u201d She glanced back at his crumpled body on the ground. She must have realized he was a Malcontent, for she swiveled to face them with a victorious flourish of her cape. \u201cI meant to do that.\u201d</p><p>Mikhail snorted. Snooty as always.</p><p>She lifted her chin and attempted to glare down at him, an impossible task since he was a good foot taller than her. He stared calmly back until her cheeks flushed a rosy pink, and she looked away.</p><p>Zoltan stepped toward her. \u201cLady Pamela?\u201d</p><p>She flinched.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Mikhail asked, unable to resist goading her.</p><p>She shot him an annoyed look, then turned back to Zoltan. \u201cThis is a most unfortunate development since I had hoped to keep my true identity a secret. I did not anticipate that anyone would see past my clever disguise.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, she waved a hand in the air. \u201cIn hindsight, I now realize that it is nigh impossible to conceal someone as well-known as myself.\u201d She cast another irritated look at Mikhail.</p><p>One corner of his mouth curled up, and she stiffened before turning back to Zoltan. \u201cAt any rate, it hardly signifies. Since we are all on the same team\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d Mikhail asked. Her eyes flashed at him. Damn, she was beautiful even when she was angry.</p><p>She turned away from him. \u201cAs I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted\u2014since we are working together, I feel certain I can rely on your utmost discretion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Pamela,\u201d Zoltan began.</p><p>\u201cVampWoman,\u201d she corrected him. \u201cI will thank you to address me properly while I am in costume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara, I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d Jack pocketed his cell phone. \u201cWhat are you doing, Lady Pamela? Is this some sort of game where you masquerade as a superhero?\u201d</p><p>She planted her hands on her hips. \u201cThis is not a game. I am quite serious, I\u2019ll have you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be worse.\u201d J.L. grinned. \u201cShe could pretend to be a supervillain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not pretending,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI labored for a fortnight on this costume. And I studied fencing and martial arts for six months. I assure you, I am quite prepared to battle evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Mikhail asked.</p><p>She gave him an exasperated look. \u201cWhy not? I have my reasons, and they are of no concern to you.\u201d</p><p>While Zoltan launched into an explanation that six months of lessons hardly sufficed when the Malcontents had centuries of experience, Mikhail tilted his head to look around her. In the nearby forest, a large group of Malcontents were teleporting in. Apparently, the cowards who had fled earlier were now returning with reinforcements. There had to be over fifty of them.</p><p>\u201cWeapons?\u201d he interrupted Zoltan\u2019s lecture. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She gave him a frosty look. \u201cWhen did you acquire the ability to speak more than one syllable at a time?\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer. \u201cWeapons?\u201d</p><p>Her chin went up another notch. \u201cOf course. I came well prepared.\u201d She flipped back her cape to reveal her utility belt. \u201cI have a sword, an assortment of knives and ninja stars, an automatic handgun with extra clips, and several hand grenades.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHand grenades?\u201d J.L. gave her an incredulous look. \u201cWhy would you want those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were on sale.\u201d She gasped when Mikhail grabbed at her waist. \u201cUnhand me, you brute!\u201d</p><p>He wrenched a grenade off her utility belt, ripped out the pin, and tossed it into the forest.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you\u2014\u201d Her voice broke off when he pulled her against his chest as he twisted around.</p><p>A loud explosion boomed, followed by screams. He hunched over her as branches and leaves rained down on his head and shoulders.</p> <p>Zoltan, J.L., and Jack drew their swords and rushed to the forest to destroy any survivors. He needed to go with them, but Pam was clinging to him, clutching handfuls of his black T-shirt in her fists.</p><p>She was in his arms at last.</p><p>Naked on a pile of furs. He shook his head. He couldn\u2019t risk those thoughts right now. Too much lust, and his eyes would glow red. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her face pressed against his chest. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d She lifted her head, and their eyes met.</p><p>Lavender blue. The color instantly sparked a surge of longing so intense he forgot to breathe. Time froze, and he was drowning as memories flooded his head, memories of love, joy, and everything that was beautiful in the world.</p><p>With a shake of his head, he squeezed his eyes shut. He couldn\u2019t fall into that trap again. The grief and guilt had nearly destroyed him.</p> <p>\u201cOh, dear. Are you in pain? Were you injured?\u201d</p><p>Yes, he was in pain, but it had been a slap in the face he sorely needed. He\u2019d vowed centuries ago never to involve himself with another vain and selfish woman. The damage from the first one had ravaged his heart, and he could never allow himself to be that vulnerable again.</p><p>His mind made up, he opened his eyes. Unfortunately, with one look at her, he was instantly rocked by another wave of lust. It gripped him by the balls and squeezed tight. Damn, he wanted her bad.</p><p>Grasping her by the upper arms, he moved her back a few inches. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Release me, so I can help the others.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a blank look, then gasped. \u201cOh! I didn\u2019t realize.\u201d She released her grip on his T-shirt. \u201cOh, dear, I\u2019ve wrinkled your shirt. I do apologize.\u201d She attempted to smooth out the wrinkles.</p><p>He gritted his teeth at the feel of her hands rubbing across his chest. Naked and wet on a pile of furs. His groin swelled. Not now, dammit!</p><p>Her hands stilled. \u201cAre you wearing body armor beneath this shirt?\u201d Her gaze lifted and locked with his once more.</p><p>His leather pants bulged. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d She stepped back, her cheeks blushing. \u201cI beg your pardon. I didn\u2019t know a man could be so . . . hard.\u201d</p><p>You have no idea. He turned away abruptly as his vision turned pink.</p><p>\u201cOh dear, I must have offended you,\u201d she said in a rush. \u201cObviously, I don\u2019t make a habit of feeling men\u2019s chests. I don\u2019t recall my late husband being so . . . well, he was much more refined. A viscount, actually.\u201d</p><p>A candy ass. Mikhail willed his eyes to stop glowing, but it didn\u2019t work. Prim and proper Pam would be shocked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe we have been formally introduced,\u201d she continued. \u201cI am Lady\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who you are.\u201d And why not shock her? Why not show her how he honestly felt? Was he such a coward that he intended to keep it a secret for another hundred years? He turned back to face her.</p><p>With a gasp, she stepped back.</p><p>She was tinted pink, along with her surroundings, a sure sign that his eyes were glowing red. There was no need to write a sonnet in her honor or woo her with fine gifts. No need to say a word. He could simply let the fire in his eyes blaze the message to her soul.</p><p>Yes, I want you. I lust for you. Deal with it.</p><p>He could hear her heart racing. She opened her mouth, but no words came out. For the first time in centuries, Lady Pamela Smythe-Worthing had been rendered speechless.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cWE\u2019RE DONE!\u201d JACK ran up to them, followed by J.L. and Zoltan.</p><p>Mikhail turned away, so they wouldn\u2019t see his eyes. He gazed at the forest while he attempted to force his vision back to normal. \u201cI originally spotted about fifty.\u201d</p><p>Pam gasped. \u201cFifty? Malcontents?\u201d</p><p>Mikhail nodded. \u201cReady to attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the blast killed about half of them,\u201d J.L. reported. \u201cMost of the survivors teleported away, and we took care of the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Pam whispered. \u201cWe were terribly outnumbered . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny mission can suddenly become dangerous,\u201d Zoltan told her. \u201cIt was ill-advised for you to come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree,\u201d she replied with a stronger voice. \u201cYou should be thankful I came here so well equipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d J.L. chuckled. \u201cThank God for the holy hand grenade of Antioch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it came from Yorkshire,\u201d Pam explained. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what you can find on e-Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady, the Malcontents could return any second,\u201d Zoltan insisted.</p><p>\u201cI believe we are safe for the moment.\u201d Mikhail turned to face her, his vision now back to normal. \u201cThey\u2019ll think twice before risking another of milady\u2019s hand grenades.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a shy, grateful smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we have time for a few questions,\u201d Mikhail continued. \u201cHow did you find out about our mission?\u201d</p><p>Her smile withered. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019re not an employee at MacKay Security and Investigation, so you shouldn\u2019t have known\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t blame Lara,\u201d she interrupted, turning to Jack. \u201cShe worries so much about you. I went to see her at your villa in Venice, and I encouraged her to call you, knowing that I could use your voice as a beacon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find out about our mission?\u201d Mikhail repeated.</p><p>She fiddled with her glove and avoided looking at him. \u201cIt\u2019s a rather long story\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen make it short. Pam.\u201d</p><p>That made her look at him again. Her eyes flashed. \u201cThat\u2019s Lady Pamela to you\u2014I mean VampWoman.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curled up, and she turned away from him with a huff. \u201cIt all began when Maggie and Darcy went to Scotland to film Angus MacKay\u2019s castle and interview Emma for their show, Real Housewives of the Vampire World.\u201d</p><p>Jack groaned. \u201cI can see where this is going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Pam frowned at him. \u201cYour wife was quite devastated when you postponed your appearance on the show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her I could do it after we destroyed this human-trafficking ring,\u201d Jack mumbled.</p><p>\u201cAnd that was six months ago.\u201d Pam glowered. \u201cMaggie and Darcy have been waiting forever. After they finished up in Scotland, they dropped by to see me and the old harem girls in London. They told us how frustrated they were, waiting for you to complete your mission in Albania, and that\u2019s when I thought you might appreciate some help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom you?\u201d Mikhail asked dryly.</p><p>Her chin lifted. \u201cYou weren\u2019t complaining when you needed one of my hand grenades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do appreciate your help,\u201d Jack muttered. \u201cBut you should return home now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think not. We may have defeated some traffickers, but where, pray tell, are the humans?\u201d</p><p>She made a good point. Mikhail scanned the area, wondering where the human captives were being held. Scarface had regained consciousness and was attempting to sit up. He flopped about, groaning, his lips bloodied and both eyes bruised and swelling.</p><p>Mikhail zoomed over, grabbed his shirt, and hauled him to his feet. \u201cWhere are the humans?\u201d he asked in Albanian.</p><p>Scarface sneered. \u201cWhy should I tell you?\u201d</p><p>He pulled back a fist.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Scarface gasped. \u201cDon\u2019t hit me again. There\u2019s a road through there.\u201d He waved at the forest behind them, then teleported away.</p><p>Mikhail drew his sword. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They ran through the forest. With his longer legs, Mikhail could have easily outdistanced his companions, but he held back, making sure Pam remained safe. You fool, it\u2019s happening already, an inner voice chided him. He was becoming vulnerable. Over another vain and selfish woman. He shoved those thoughts away.</p><p>After half a mile, they emerged on a dirt road, where a dented and rusty old camper truck was parked. Mikhail quickly circled the truck. No Malcontents in sight. He returned to the back door, where Jack was hacking at the chained padlock with his sword.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d Mikhail smashed through the chains with his battle-axe, then opened the door.</p><p>They were greeted by a dozen pair of terrified eyes. The girls, tied up and gagged, attempted to squirm farther back into the filthy recesses of the camper. Mikhail guessed their ages to be somewhere between twelve and twenty. More years than his daughter had lived. He pushed that errant thought aside. At least he hadn\u2019t failed these.</p><p>He climbed into the camper, and the girls cowered on the floor, whimpering behind their gags.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re frightening them.\u201d Pam quickly followed him into the camper, then knelt in front of the girls. \u201cYou poor dears, there is no need to be afraid. We have come to rescue you and deliver you safely home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d Zoltan whispered to her. \u201cThese are humans. We should leave them to the human authorities. I\u2019ll call the local police\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d Pam looked up at him, aghast. \u201cMake them endure hours of questioning when we could easily take them home to their families? Haven\u2019t they suffered enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur first imperative is always to keep our existence a secret,\u201d Zoltan whispered. \u201cIf we teleport them\u2014</p><p>\u201cThey have bite marks,\u201d Mikhail interrupted, motioning at the girls. \u201cThe Malcontents were feeding off them. They already know about vampires. We should teleport them home, then wipe their memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Pam gave him a grateful smile that made his heart squeeze in his chest.</p><p>He ignored it and moved closer to the girls, who were huddled together, trembling.</p><p>\u201cThere, there.\u201d Pam patted a girl on the shoulder. \u201cI know he looks like a huge brute, but he won\u2019t harm you.\u201d</p><p>A huge brute? Mikhail winced inwardly. Even so, it seemed like a good thing that Pam was here. Her presence was comforting the girls. They had grown quiet, the terror on their faces melting into hope.</p><p>He leaned over one of the girls, and, using his psychic power, he delved into her mind to locate her home. Then he grasped her arm and teleported her back. With a happy squeal, she turned to thank him. He removed her gag and ropes while he wiped her memory of the last few days. When her face turned blank, he teleported back to the camper truck.</p><p>With all five of them working, it took only a few minutes to return the captives to their homes. After delivering a third girl, Mikhail reappeared at the camper to find it empty. He sauntered around the truck, making sure no Malcontents had returned. As he approached the back, Pam materialized.</p><p>She glanced into the camper, then, with a satisfied smile, turned away. \u201cNot bad for your first night,\u201d she murmured to herself, then peeled the spandex cap off her head. Her blond hair slipped free, and she shook it out, the golden tresses falling in waves around her shoulders.</p><p>Good God, she is beautiful. He must have made some kind of noise, for she spun around to face him.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2014you\u2019ve returned.\u201d She glanced around. \u201cThe others haven\u2019t made it back yet.\u201d She winced. \u201cI\u2019m sure you already know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He stepped toward her.</p><p>She brushed her hair back over her shoulder. \u201cThe cap was rather hot. Stifling, actually. I might have to reconsider my costume design.\u201d</p><p>He raked his eyes down to her boots, then back up to her breasts. \u201cIt looks good to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ogling my chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a red mark there. It draws a person\u2019s attention.\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s a \u2018V.\u2019 It stands for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVoluptuous?\u201d</p><p>She scoffed. \u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cViscountess?\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cNo. VampWoman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never have guessed.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a dry look. \u201cYou may mock me, but I much prefer my new identity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was wrong with your old one?\u201d</p><p>She ducked her chin and fiddled with her gloves. \u201cI\u2019d rather not discuss it.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer. \u201cWhy are you doing this? Why are you risking yourself?\u201d</p><p>A pained look crossed her face. \u201cI\u2019d rather not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was wrong with Lady Pamela? I always thought she was beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She glanced up. \u201cShe\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s . . . shameful.\u201d Her eyes glistened with tears, and she turned away.</p><p>His breath caught. She didn\u2019t sound as vain as he had expected. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cSo many reasons. First, I married a vampire without realizing it. There were rumors about Maximilian. Plenty of clues. I never saw him eat, never saw him during the day. But like a fool, I ignored it all. I was too enamored with the notion that a viscount could love me and want to marry me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mikhail frowned. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t your fault. He should have been honest with you.\u201d</p><p>She waved aside his attempt to defend her. \u201cI was young and foolish. A few weeks after the wedding, Max asked me if I would like to wear beautiful gowns and go to lovely parties forever. I said yes.\u201d She brushed away her tears with an angry swipe. \u201cCan you imagine giving up mortality for such a ridiculous reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know he meant to transform you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She gave Mikhail a wry look. \u201cIt was a bit of a shock when he attacked me.\u201d</p><p>Mikhail gritted his teeth. It was a good thing the bastard was dead.</p><p>\u201cI was so foolish. I gave up my chance to ever have children.\u201d</p><p>Mikhail\u2019s heart squeezed as the memory of his daughter swept across his mind. \u201cYou wanted children?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and another tear rolled down her cheek. \u201cThen I made the mistake of complaining to my father. I didn\u2019t go into any details, but it was enough to make him suspect that the rumors were true.\u201d</p> <p>Her shoulders slumped. \u201cI was a coward. I knew my father hated Max, but I did nothing to dissuade him. Max trusted me, and I let him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it was your father who killed your husband?\u201d Mikhail asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. He staked Max while we lay beside each other in our death-sleep. Father left his ring in the ashes so I would know it was he. I feared that Max\u2019s vampire friends would avenge him by killing my father, so I begged him to flee to America. He asked me to accompany him, but I was too afraid to go. I abandoned him when he was in danger.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cI joined the Coven Master\u2019s harem in London, where I would be safe. Then later, when the Germans were bombing London, I fled to New York. As usual, I took the cowardly way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was self-preservation. The underground lairs were no longer safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then my friend, Vanda, was in danger. The Malcontents blew up our nightclub and wanted to kill her, and I left her. I went back to London.\u201d She turned to face him with tears running down her cheeks. \u201cDon\u2019t you see why I\u2019m ashamed? I\u2019m a coward who fails the people who count on me. I abandon them when they need me the most.\u201d</p> <p>Mikhail stared at her, stunned by the ferocity of her self-recrimination . Was she trying to earn redemption as VampWoman? She\u2019d be lucky if she wasn\u2019t rewarded with an early death. \u201cI can understand the need to make up for past mistakes, but what you\u2019re doing now, you\u2019re putting yourself in danger\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t approve.\u201d She dried her cheeks with an impatient swipe. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have confessed everything to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m glad you told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you could never understand how I feel. You\u2019re so incredibly huge and fierce. I doubt you\u2019ve ever lost a battle or ever let anyone down.\u201d</p><p>He flinched.</p><p>\u201cDo you even know what it\u2019s like to be filled with guilt and regret?\u201d</p><p>He pinched his eyes shut to avoid the memories that flooded his mind. \u201cEnough.\u201d He opened his eyes to find her staring at him.</p><p>\u201cYou do know,\u201d she whispered. Her hand lifted toward his face, but before she could touch him, she blinked and withdrew her hand. Her gaze dropped to his chest. \u201cThen you do understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand that each time you endanger yourself, it will scare the hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you hardly know me.\u201d</p><p>That much was true. For almost two hundred years, he\u2019d assumed she was selfish and vain. And why wouldn\u2019t she be, when she was the most beautiful vampire in the world? But instead of feeling superior, she had actually been ashamed of herself. She\u2019d used the snooty image of an arrogant viscountess to hide her self-doubt and vulnerability.</p><p>With a small shock, he realized that Lady Pamela had been the masquerade. VampWoman was the true Pam.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re . . . Mikhail?\u201d Her gaze lifted back to his face. \u201cFrom Moscow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know of me?\u201d</p><p>She blushed. \u201cEveryone knows who you are. You\u2019re a full head taller than the other men, and they\u2019re rather large. Of course, the rumor is that you\u2019re some sort of fierce medieval Viking and that you came to Russia centuries ago to pillage and plunder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what they say?\u201d</p><p>Her blush deepened. \u201cWell, I was in a harem for years. There wasn\u2019t much to do other than gossip about the men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always thought you were beautiful.\u201d He touched a lock of her hair. Now he realized she was just as beautiful on the inside. And he\u2019d been a fool to avoid her all these years.</p><p>He moved closer.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d</p><p>He touched her cheek and wiped the moisture of her tears with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cI-I should be going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d He grazed his thumb over her lips. They were as soft as he\u2019d imagined.</p><p>She gulped. \u201cI believe our work here is done.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hand around her neck and leaned over till his mouth was a mere inch from hers. \u201cPam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Her rapid breaths puffed against his skin.</p><p>\u201cPrepare to be plundered.\u201d</p><p>With a gasp, she teleported away.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cCOWARD!\u201d LADY PAMELA yanked off a boot and threw it on the parquet floor of her bedchamber.</p><p>How could she have behaved so cowardly? Six months of planning and practicing to be a stronger and more fearless person, and what had she done? She\u2019d run away just like she had in the past. With a disgusted groan, she tossed her other boot on the floor.</p><p>Perhaps it wasn\u2019t too late. Less than a minute had passed since she\u2019d fled in fear. She could teleport back and . . . what? Allow that huge barbarian to kiss her?</p><p>A shudder skittered down her spine.</p><p>\u201cCoward,\u201d she muttered. Instead of running away, she should have slapped the brute soundly. Or better yet, she should have used some of her newly acquired martial-arts skills to fling him over her shoulder.</p><p>Her breath caught. Was it even possible to fling such a man? He was so enormous. As immovable as a giant boulder.</p><p>And his eyes had turned red.</p><p>Her hands flew to her cheeks, and she felt the heat of a blush. His eyes had turned red.</p><p>When she\u2019d first spotted him, she\u2019d been shocked by the sheer strength of his presence. It felt like he had swallowed up her entire field of vision, so she could hardly even see the other men. Or hear them.</p><p>His eyes had turned red. Because of her.</p><p>Why, oh why had she told him so much about herself? What had possessed her to confide in such a huge brute? Although he had seemed rather attentive and understanding for a barbarian.</p><p>She chased that thought away. He was a barbarian. He had attempted to kiss her. Prepare to be plundered. The gall of the man!</p><p>She jumped when a loud pounding shook her door.</p><p>\u201cLady Pamela? Is that you I hear?\u201d</p><p>That accent could only belong to Miss Cora Lee Primrose\u2014a Southern belle, transformed just prior to the American Civil War, and one of Pamela\u2019s friends who shared the London townhouse.</p><p>\u201cYes, I have returned,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cWell, land sakes, come out of there and tell us how it went. We\u2019ve been worried sick about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be down shortly.\u201d Pamela removed her utility belt and set it carefully on her bed so the various knives and ninja stars wouldn\u2019t snag her pink satin coverlet.</p><p>With a sigh, she unzipped the front zipper on her costume. Perhaps she shouldn\u2019t be overset by the night\u2019s events. After all, she did assist the men in defeating the traffickers and delivering the captives back home. The blast from the hand grenade had frightened her but not enough to make her run away. Apparently, the prospect of a kiss was more terrifying than an explosion.</p><p>She removed her cape, then peeled off her latex costume. No doubt he had imagined undressing her. How dare he ogle her like that?</p><p>His eyes had glowed red. How could a man\u2019s passion flare so hot so quickly?</p><p>\u201cPosh.\u201d She slipped on a silk wrapper and tied the sash around her waist. The man was a barbarian. He probably ogled a dozen women nightly and leered at them all with glowing red eyes. Prepare to be plundered, indeed. Who did he think he was? A Viking warrior who ravished innocent women?</p><p>What if she had stayed? Where would he have touched her? And kissed her? No doubt a barbarian did wicked things a gentleman would never do. Goose bumps prickled her skin.</p><p>She rubbed her arms as she marched toward the door. \u201cI will not give him another thought.\u201d</p><p>She was halfway down the stairs when she recalled his reaction to the camper full of pretty mortal girls. His eyes hadn\u2019t turned red for them. Like her, he had wanted to take them home, and he\u2019d handled them gently to assuage their fears. He\u2019d been surprisingly kind . . . for a barbarian.</p><p>\u201cThank the Lord you are alive and well!\u201d Princess Joanna announced when Pamela entered the parlor.</p><p>\u201cSanta Maria be praised,\u201d Maria Consuela added, and kissed her rosary.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite all right,\u201d Pamela assured the ladies.</p><p>Joanna\u2019s title of princess was honorary since she was an old vampire, having been changed in Venice while en route to the Holy Land during one of the Crusades. Maria Consuela de Montemayor had been captured during the Spanish Inquisition when the authorities had feared that her fianc\u00e9 was Jewish. Fortunately for her, he was also a vampire, and he\u2019d teleported into the prison to rescue her. Both had been widowed centuries ago and had then transferred to a harem, where they could live in comfort and safety.</p><p>After appearing on a reality show for the Digital Vampire Network, Lady Pamela and her old harem friends had become modern enough to eschew the concept of needing a master. Still, in many ways, they held fast to their historic roots.</p><p>Princess Joanna settled in an easy chair by the fireplace. \u201cPrithee, tell us all that has transpired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Cora Lee walked in with a tray and set it down on the table. \u201cWe want to know everything.\u201d She poured four cups of steaming hot Chocolood, a mixture of synthetic blood and chocolate. \u201cI do declare we were worried sick.\u201d</p><p>Maria Consuela shuddered. \u201cIt reminded me of being tortured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do not suffer on my account.\u201d Pamela sat, then accepted a cup from Cora Lee. \u201cThank you, dear.\u201d</p><p>The Southern belle perched on the settee next to Maria Consuela. \u201cWere you able to find Lara\u2019s husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Everything went precisely as I had planned.\u201d Not precisely, Pamela thought with a silent groan. Never in her wildest imaginings would she have foreseen herself in that man\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cAnd who was there?\u201d Princess Joanna sipped from her cup. \u201cGiacomo di Venezia, of course. And Zoltan Czakvar?\u201d</p><p>Pamela nodded. \u201cThey were quite shocked to see me when I arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet!\u201d Cora Lee snickered. \u201cWho else was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo others. We hardly know them.\u201d Pamela took a sip from her cup. \u201cOne was that new chap, J.L. Wang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Cathay?\u201d Princess Joanna asked.</p><p>\u201cI believe it\u2019s called China now, dear.\u201d Pamela set her cup down. \u201cBut he\u2019s actually American.\u201d</p><p>Princess Joanna waved a dismissive hand. \u201cThose Americans are such a . . . boiling cauldron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s melting pot,\u201d Cora Lee said. \u201cWho was the other fellow?\u201d</p><p>Pamela shrugged nonchalantly even though heat was invading her cheeks. \u201cThat . . . man from Russia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRussia?\u201d Princess Joanna\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>Cora Lee gasped. \u201cYou mean the huge giant with the icy blue eyes and the blond braid down his back? Land sakes, his hair is longer than mine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWicked,\u201d Maria Consuela whispered as she clicked through her rosary. \u201cI know of whom you speak. He has eyes as cold as sin.\u201d</p><p>More like red-hot and glowing, Pamela thought with an inward wince. But the sinful part was probably accurate.</p><p>\u201cHeaven forbid!\u201d Princess Joanna pressed a hand to her chest. \u201cYou cannot mean that barbarian!\u201d</p><p>Pamela started to lift her cup, but changed her mind for fear her hand would noticeably tremble. \u201cHe seemed to be a valuable member of their team. No doubt he\u2019s a fierce warrior.\u201d</p><p>Princess Joanna snorted. \u201cFierce, indeed. The man is one of those horrid Vikings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvil,\u201d Maria Consuela whispered.</p><p>Joanna shuddered. \u201cFor centuries, they were a scourge on our countryside, always pillaging and plundering.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d come close to being plundered. If Pamela had waited but a second longer, his lips would have touched hers. And being a barbarian, he wouldn\u2019t have stopped. He would have ravished her mouth entirely. Thoroughly.</p><p>Her skin pebbled with gooseflesh, and in a shocking burst of clarity, she realized it wasn\u2019t fear that was making her heart pound and her body tremble.</p><p>It was excitement.</p><p>Good heavens! Was she losing her senses? Such feelings could not be tolerated. The man was not her type at all.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Mikhail, right?\u201d Cora Lee asked. She sipped from her cup. \u201cI do declare he\u2019s always frightened me a bit. He seems so . . . cold and forbidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvil,\u201d Maria Consuela muttered.</p><p>\u201cHe is absolutely wrong in every possible way,\u201d Pamela said in a rushed voice. \u201cIncredibly huge and muscular, with a chest like a rock. Not at all like my late husband. Maximilian was a gentleman. Sophisticated and refined. He would have never said . . .\u201d She paused when she realized that the three women were watching her curiously. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cora Lee leaned forward. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>Pamela\u2019s face blazed with heat. \u201cNothing.\u201d Prepare to be plundered.</p><p>\u201cYou are comparing him to your late husband?\u201d Princess Joanna asked.</p> <p>Pamela shook her head. \u201cOnly to emphasize what a huge brute he is.\u201d</p><p>Cora Lee gave her a pointed look. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s huge all over.\u201d</p><p>Pamela gasped. \u201cI daresay that is . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWicked.\u201d Maria Consuela zipped through her rosary at vampire speed.</p><p>Cora Lee shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just saying it\u2019s been a long time since any of us indulged in a little romance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat is quite out of the question,\u201d Pamela snapped. \u201cI have no intention of going anywhere near that brute\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuge brute,\u201d Cora Lee interrupted with a smirk.</p><p>Was he really huge? Pamela shoved that disturbing thought aside. \u201cWe all know a man\u2019s size is totally irrelevant. What matters is his mind-control ability.\u201d</p><p>Princess Joanna nodded. \u201cIndeed. We need to make the acquaintance of a gentleman who is skilled at vampire sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Roman.\u201d Cora Lee sighed. \u201cI do declare he could satisfy us all in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Pamela agreed. \u201cIt was very time-efficient. And wonderfully private. The entire experience is so much more refined when it\u2019s conducted purely as a mental exercise.\u201d</p> <p>Cora Lee nodded. \u201cWe could stay in our own rooms. And we didn\u2019t even have to take off our clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it was never messy, like physical sex.\u201d Pamela grimaced. \u201cNo grasping, sweaty hands pawing you all over.\u201d</p><p>Maria Consuela shuddered. \u201cEvil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a time when I think I actually enjoyed real sex.\u201d Princess Joanna waved a hand in the air. \u201cBut that was centuries ago, and I have long forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is best left forgotten,\u201d Pamela said. The thought of having a man physically invade her body\u2014it was far too shocking. Too raw and frightening.</p><p>But wasn\u2019t she trying to get over her cowardice?</p><p>\u201cSo what happens now?\u201d Cora Lee asked. \u201cAre you going to meet them tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely, one night of wild behavior will suffice,\u201d Princess Joanna said. \u201cIt is far too dangerous for you to continue with this folly.\u201d</p> <p>Pamela swallowed hard. She had to be brave. She couldn\u2019t wallow in cowardice for another century. Or even another night. \u201cVampWoman will return.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cYOU SHOULDN\u2019T HAVE come,\u201d Zoltan announced the next evening after Lady Pamela teleported into his parlor in Budapest.</p><p>With a silent squeal of triumph, Pamela congratulated herself on finding the men. Back home, while donning her costume, she\u2019d worried about being able to locate them. But since Zoltan was the Coven Master of Eastern Europe, she\u2019d decided his home was a good place to start. She\u2019d been here before to attend a party, so the location was embedded in her psychic memory.</p><p>\u201cGood evening.\u201d She smiled at Zoltan, who stood next to the fireplace. \u201cGentlemen.\u201d She nodded at Jack and J.L., who lounged in nearby chairs, frowning at her. A pile of sheathed swords and knives rested on a coffee table.</p><p>Where was . . . the back of her neck prickled as if touched by an icy breeze. Or was it the frigid glare of pale blue eyes? She spun about, her black silk cape rippling through the air.</p><p>Mikhail was leaning against the doorjamb, his arms crossed over his massive chest, his eyes glittering like broken shards of icicles. Heat spread like flames throughout her body, causing her face to flush. How could such a cold brute make her feel like she was melting?</p><p>A corner of his mouth curled up.</p><p>Arrogant oaf. How dare he assume he was the cause of her blush? Even though he was. But as annoyed as she was, she couldn\u2019t help but notice the dimple caused by his half smile. And what a wide, sensuous mouth he had. Finely sculpted lips, too. Lips that had come so close to kissing her. Don\u2019t think about it! With a blink, she forced her gaze back to his eyes.</p><p>Dear God, no. He was ogling her again, lingering over every dip and curve of her body. Her skin tingled beneath the black spandex, and the costume felt suddenly tighter, constricting her to the point she could scarcely breathe. His eyes met hers, and he slowly smiled.</p><p>With a flourish of her cape, she turned her back to him. Blast him! He enjoyed unnerving her.</p><p>He said something in a foreign language that made Zoltan chuckle. It must be Hungarian. She hadn\u2019t thought about it till now, but the oaf\u2019s English was quite good. And he\u2019d spoken in Albanian to a Malcontent the night before. He was surprisingly well educated for a barbarian, and that unnerved her even more.</p><p>She squared her shoulders and adjusted her utility belt. \u201cPray tell, where will our mission take us tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re waiting for a report to come in from Dubrovnik,\u201d Zoltan replied. \u201cWe believe the Malcontents are hiding a group of human captives in a warehouse near the docks. We need to rescue them before they\u2019re loaded onto a ship.\u201d</p><p>A lump of alarm rose in her throat, and she swallowed hard. This mission could easily turn violent. But wasn\u2019t this what she had trained for? She took a deep breath to steady her nerves. Tonight, she would prove she was no coward. When her companions needed her, she would not turn tail and run.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as we get the call, we\u2019re leaving,\u201d Zoltan continued, then gave her a pointed look. \u201cAnd you will not be coming with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will. I\u2019m part of the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, milady, you are not,\u201d Jack said softly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t work for MacKay S and I,\u201d J.L. added.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a free agent,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI\u2019m here to help you, and I will not be dismissed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Pamela.\u201d Zoltan gave her an exasperated look. \u201cWe only wish to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour presence could endanger us all.\u201d Jack stood and selected a sword from the coffee table. \u201cIf we\u2019re forced to protect you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d She planted her fists on her hips. \u201cI am up to the challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d a deep voice spoke behind her, and she pivoted to face him.</p><p>Mikhail walked toward her, watching her with a predatory gleam in his eyes. \u201cIf I remember correctly, you frighten very easily.\u201d</p><p>Her heart sped up, pounding in her chest.</p><p>His gaze dropped to her mouth. \u201cAre you certain you won\u2019t . . . disappoint?\u201d</p><p>Was he alluding to their almost kiss? How dare he! She lifted her chin. \u201cI will not abandon my teammates.\u201d</p><p>He focused on her breasts, which made her even more breathless and tingly. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid. I can hear your heart racing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fear! It\u2019s\u2014\u201d Good heavens! She stopped herself in the nick of time.</p><p>His eyes met hers in a flash, and the intensity of his look took her breath away. He tilted his head, searching her face.</p><p>She jumped when a phone rang.</p><p>\u201cThat should be my informant.\u201d Zoltan pulled a cell phone from his jacket pocket, while Jack and J.L. quickly armed themselves. \u201cI\u2019ll turn on the speakerphone, so we can teleport to his voice.\u201d</p><p>Excellent! Pamela faced him, mentally steeling her nerves for battle.</p><p>The phone rang again, and Zoltan frowned at her. \u201cMikhail, get her out of here. I\u2019ll call you in sixty seconds, so you can join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Pamela gasped when Mikhail grabbed her from behind. Before she could react, everything went black.</p><p>As soon as she materialized, she jumped into action. A sharp jab in his ribs with her right elbow as she spun to face him, then a left punch in the\u2014\u201cOuch!\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s stomach was like a slab of concrete.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d He grabbed her hand.</p><p>Before he could remove her glove, she yanked her hand away. Balling her fists, she bounced back on the balls of her feet, then aimed a quick roundhouse kick at his chest. He nabbed her ankle and tugged, making her lose her balance. As she started to fall, he grabbed her and pulled her hard against him.</p><p>\u201cOof.\u201d She caught her breath, her nose pressed against his chest. He smelled surprisingly clean for a barbarian. As she splayed her hands against his stomach, preparing to shove him away, she realized he wasn\u2019t as smooth and cold as a concrete slab. He was warm and rippled. With muscles.</p><p>He held her tight, his arms banded around her shoulders. She resisted an urge to snuggle against him. It was tempting, so tempting. What if he wasn\u2019t a barbarian after all?</p><p>She glanced up at him. \u201cWhat did you say to Zoltan that he found so amusing?\u201d</p><p>A corner of Mikhail\u2019s mouth lifted, causing the dimple to reappear. \u201cIt was a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d His left hand slid beneath her cape and down her spine to her utility belt. \u201cI was admiring you from . . . behind.\u201d His hand curved around her rump.</p><p>\u201cStop that!\u201d When she attempted to push away, his hand flexed on her buttock, pulling her closer. How could she have ever doubted he was a barbarian? \u201cHow dare you!\u201d</p><p>He gave her another squeeze.</p><p>If only she could slap that amused look off his face, but both her arms were pinned against his chest. She stomped her boot on his foot.</p><p>He merely looked annoyed. \u201cDo I need to tie you to the bedpost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare\u2014bedpost?\u201d She glanced over her shoulder and flinched. A massive, canopy bed dominated a room filled with bookcases and tables and large leather chairs. \u201cYou\u2014you brought me to your bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the cellar of my hunting lodge.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the huge bed again. Of course it was huge. The man was huge. \u201cThis is highly inappropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to take you somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have taken me to my bedroom.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched. \u201cIs that an invitation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I meant my home. In London.\u201d She scanned the room once more. This was a hunting lodge? It was as well furnished as her townhouse. And he certainly owned a great number of books . . . for a barbarian.</p><p>He released her and stepped back. \u201cIf I knew the way to your home, I would have taken you there. You should go there now.\u201d</p><p>And give up on her dream? \u201cNo, I\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re going home, where you\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI refuse.\u201d She lifted her chin. \u201cI will not take the coward\u2019s way out.\u201d</p><p>His eyes hardened like ice as he stepped toward her. \u201cThen you\u2019d better be brave because if you\u2019re still here when I return, I will tie you to the bedpost. After I strip you\u2014\u201d His phone rang.</p><p>Her heart thundered in her ears so loud, she couldn\u2019t hear him answer the phone. He would strip her? And tie her to the bedpost?</p><p>\u201cPam!\u201d</p><p>She jumped when she realized he was talking to her.</p><p>\u201cThe guys need me. Go! Quickly!\u201d</p><p>The guys were in need? She vanished and materialized silently behind Mikhail.</p><p>\u201cOkay, she\u2019s gone,\u201d he said into the phone. \u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>She leaped on his back just before he disappeared.</p><p>DAMN IT TO hell! As soon as Mikhail materialized, he pried away the hands that were gripped around his neck. She was the most stubborn, disobedient woman he\u2019d ever met. He should have tied her. And stripped her. She wouldn\u2019t have pulled this stunt if she were naked. But then he wouldn\u2019t have answered the phone . . .</p><p>\u201cMerda,\u201d Jack whispered. \u201cWhy did you bring her?\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth as he turned to glare at Pam, who stood behind him with a defiant look on her face. \u201cYou little\u2014\u201d His anger froze when he spotted several dozen armed Malcontents streaming through the double doors of the warehouse, headed straight toward him and his companions.</p><p>A quick scan of their surroundings confirmed the gravity of the situation. They were blocked on three sides by heavy metal containers. They could fight or flee. Zoltan, Jack, and J.L. had their swords drawn, ready to fight, but Pamela\u2019s sudden appearance was making them hesitate.</p><p>She drew her sword. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>Mikhail noticed a second-floor balcony to the right. He grabbed Pam and teleported her onto the balcony.</p><p>As soon as they materialized, she hit him on the chest and opened her mouth to berate him.</p><p>He clapped a hand over her mouth and turned her so she could see the men below. \u201cI didn\u2019t take you away,\u201d he whispered. \u201cStay here, stay hidden, and keep out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>He unsheathed his broadsword and teleported quietly behind the group of Malcontents. With a war cry, he attacked from the rear. Zoltan, Jack, and J.L. charged from the other end. The warehouse echoed with the clanging of swords and screams of the wounded.</p><p>Wounded? Mikhail tended to kill the enemy so quickly, there was no time for a scream. And he\u2019d learned from experience never to leave wounded in his wake, for they could rally and attack from the rear. The screams appeared to be coming from the middle of the Malcontent pack.</p><p>He spotted flashes of silver metal streaking down from the balcony. It was Pam! She was hurling ninja stars down at the Malcontents. The crazed woman! It was only a matter of time before one of the Malcontents teleported up there to terminate her actions. By terminating her.</p><p>With another war cry, he accelerated his attack, lopping off heads at vampire speed. He needed to keep the Malcontents focused on him, so they would forget the wild woman on the balcony.</p><p>When less than a dozen Malcontents remained, his worst fear happened. One of them vanished and reappeared on the balcony. Mikhail\u2019s heart lurched when he saw the Malcontent\u2019s sword slash down at Pam. She dodged the blow, then jumped back and readied her sword. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mikhail teleported beside her. \u201cStay back.\u201d He shoved her behind him and lunged forward to attack the Malcontent. He jabbed him in the heart, dusting him, then heard an ominous crash behind him. He spun about to find that another Malcontent had attempted to stab him in the back. Pam had deflected the blow, but it had taken both her hands to wield her sword and all her strength to knock aside the thrust meant for him. The Malcontent took instant advantage and sliced her left arm with his knife.</p><p>With a cry, she fell to her knees. Mikhail beheaded the Malcontent, then grabbed her as she crumpled on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he gasped as he slapped a hand over her wound. Blood seeped between his fingers. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you stay hidden like I asked you?\u201d</p> <p>Her face paled to a deathly white. \u201cI\u2014I will not abandon my teammates.\u201d</p><p>Crazy, foolish . . . beautiful woman. The pain clouding her lavender-blue eyes struck a blow to his heart more sharp than any sword. If it took an eternity, he\u2019d make sure she was never injured again. He would protect her. And love her. And if it made him vulnerable, so be it. He would not give her up.</p><p>A quick glance below assured him that his companions were close to winning the battle. They wouldn\u2019t miss him.</p><p>He gathered her close to his chest. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>Everything went black.</p> <p>Chapter Five</p><p>PAMELA SNUGGLED DEEPER under her pink satin coverlet, her mind drifting in a foggy haze. Three hours had passed since she\u2019d been wounded, but thanks to Mikhail\u2019s doctoring and a whole bottle of Blardonnay, she was feeling no pain.</p><p>With a smile, she remembered the look on his face when he\u2019d taken care of her. The furrowed brow, the tortured eyes, as if her pain hurt him more than her. He\u2019d teleported them to the cellar of his hunting lodge, then taken her up the stairs to the kitchen.</p><p>After setting her in a chair next to the table, he\u2019d poured her a glass of Blardonnay. \u201cDrink it all. You\u2019ve lost too much blood.\u201d</p><p>She drank the mixture of synthetic blood and Chardonnay, then removed her gloves and pulled the cap off her head while he covered the table with an impressive array of medical supplies. \u201cWhere did you get all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Dr. Lee. He\u2019s too far away in Texas for me to see him whenever I get injured, so he taught me the basics.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine anyone\u2019s managing to wound you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinor cuts and scrapes.\u201d With an apology for destroying her clothes, he used scissors to cut through the spandex at her shoulder before easing the sleeve off her arm. He apologized again while cleaning her wound, wincing when the sting made her gasp.</p><p>She tried not to think about the pain, and so took advantage of the chance to study him up close. Even though his hair was a golden blond, his eyebrows were brown, and his eyelashes dark and thick. He was remarkably handsome . . . for a barbarian. And gentle. It would be so easy to fall for him. She gulped down the rest of her Blardonnay.</p><p>He filled a syringe. \u201cThis is a painkiller.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I have that when I\u2019m drinking wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather see you tipsy than in pain.\u201d He gave her the shot, then applied a row of butterfly bandages along her wound. \u201cThese will keep it closed till it can heal during your death-sleep. You might end up with a small scar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d looked at her then, his icy blue eyes glimmering with pain like fractured icicles. \u201cIt is not all right. If the wound had been deeper\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. If I had known how beautiful you were inside, I would have never . . .\u201d His voice drifted off as he wrapped her upper arm with a thick bandage.</p><p>\u201cNever what?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Frowning, he fastened the bandage. \u201cI wasted so much time.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cIt will be different now.\u201d</p><p>Was her mind already befuddled? She wasn\u2019t following him. \u201cWhat will be different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me.\u201d He brushed her hair back from her brow. \u201cYou were injured trying to protect me. Don\u2019t ever doubt your bravery again.\u201d</p><p>Her heart squeezed in her chest. He thought she was brave. And beautiful inside. \u201cYou protected me, too.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth lifted, revealing his dimple, and she thought she might melt.</p><p>He kissed her brow. \u201cYou should go home now, so you can rest, and I can return to the guys. They might need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She winced inwardly. They\u2019d left the other guys in the middle of their mission. She eased to her feet, and the room swirled. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m a bit woozy.\u201d</p><p>He caught her when she stumbled. \u201cI\u2019ll take you.\u201d He swept her up in his arms. \u201cBut you\u2019ll have to let me into your mind for a few seconds, so I\u2019ll know the way.\u201d</p><p>Into her mind? Vamps dove into the minds of mortals whenever they wanted to, without any hesitation, but they tended to be much more protective of their own mental privacy. No vampire wanted to be controlled by another. Normally, they only lowered their mental defenses to have vampire sex. And even then, they tended to keep all their secrets and past torments locked away. No one wanted to reveal a weakness that might later be used against them.</p><p>A mind meld with Mikhail. It was a chance to see inside him. If he let her. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>He cradled her against his chest, leaning his head forward till it touched hers. \u201cLet me in.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mind, and he slipped inside with a gentle, persistent strength, burrowing straight through her thoughts to the location of her bedroom. He was quick and efficient, his mind well-ordered and disciplined. He was holding back, she realized, making sure he didn\u2019t overpower her, but even the strength in his restraint was impressive.</p><p>In those few seconds before he teleported her, she searched his mind, digging past the structured intelligence to see what lay beneath. A deep sadness. Past that, a swirl of strong emotion, then a shocking clarity as he revealed his feelings.</p><p>He loved her. He\u2019d loved her for almost two hundred years.</p><p>As soon as they arrived in her bedroom, he exited her mind and placed her on her bed. Still stunned, she stared up at him, speechless.</p><p>He strode to the door and opened it to call her friends, so they could take care of her. They rushed in, gawking at him and fussing over her. She hardly heard them, her thoughts still reeling from the mind meld. He loved her. And he\u2019d wanted her to know.</p><p>He leaned over her, kissing her brow once again before teleporting away.</p><p>Now, three hours later, it still dominated her thoughts. Mikhail Kirillov was not a barbarian. And he loved her.</p><p>She stretched under the pink coverlet and glanced at the empty bottle of Blardonnay on her bedside table. Cora Lee had insisted she drink the whole thing. She was fuzzy-headed, but her mind still functioned enough to recall the strength of his passion.</p><p>\u201cMikhail,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The door opened, and Cora Lee entered with another bottle of Blardonnay.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, dear?\u201d She set the bottle next to the empty one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m drunk.\u201d And I\u2019m hopelessly attracted to Mikhail.</p><p>Cora Lee perched on the edge of the bed. \u201cYou gave us the biggest fright. When we saw that huge man in your bedroom . . .\u201d She pressed a hand to her chest. \u201cAre you sure he treated your wound properly? Do you want a real doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. He took very good care of me.\u201d And I think I care for him, too.</p><p>\u201cLand sakes.\u201d Cora Lee waved a hand in front of her face. \u201cI do declare that man simply oozes with virility. The way he kissed you. And looked at you. I don\u2019t know if he wants to worship you or devour you. Both, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>Pam gulped. Good heavens, I think I might love him. Her heart was yearning to see him, simply to talk to him or be in the same room with him. Her short glimpse into his mind had revealed a deep, dark pit of sadness. Grief. There was a tragedy in his past, and she wanted to be the one to console him. Wasn\u2019t that the beginning of love? And if more happened . . . her heartbeat quickened. \u201cI\u2014I think I want to be with him.\u201d</p><p>Cora Lee\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cVampire sex? Oh, gracious me. I have a feeling he would be very . . . adept.\u201d</p><p>Pamela nodded. \u201cI believe so, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLand sakes.\u201d Cora Lee glanced at the clock on Pamela\u2019s bedside table. \u201cWhat are you waiting for? It\u2019s two in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt should be five in Moscow.\u201d And still dark. She could teleport to his hunting lodge. If she dared.</p><p>AS SOON AS Mikhail turned off the water in the shower, he heard a noise in the bedroom next door. He stepped silently from the shower stall and picked up the battle-axe he\u2019d left on top of the laundry hamper. As far as he knew, no Malcontent knew where his hunting lodge was located.</p><p>\u201cMikhail?\u201d a soft voice called from the bedroom.</p><p>Pam? He cracked the door open. Her eyes instantly widened, and he realized he most likely looked like the brute she thought he was. His hair was loose and wet, his body still dripping, and his groin hidden behind a battle-axe still stained with blood from the recent battle.</p><p>She turned to face a bookcase, her cheeks flushed.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked. \u201cDid you need more painkiller?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She fiddled with the sash at her waist. \u201cIf this is a bad time, I could come back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d What was she wearing? Some sort of night robe? He was suddenly glad the battle-axe was concealing his ever-growing reaction. \u201cDon\u2019t go. I\u2019ll be right out.\u201d</p><p>When she nodded, he closed the door. What was she doing here? The sun would rise in about forty minutes. Her visit would have to be quick . . . unless she was intending to stay here for her death-sleep. In his bed.</p><p>He toweled off and grabbed a pair of jeans. No, too tight. His groin was already swollen. He pulled on a pair of flannel pants. Grabbing his towel, he stepped into his bedroom.</p><p>She\u2019d found his treasure box and was peering through the glass lid.</p><p>His heart stilled. Out of all the books and mementos on his bookcase shelves, she\u2019d zeroed in on the one thing that meant the most to him. Had she glimpsed it in his thoughts for the brief time their minds had been connected?</p><p>He pulled his hair over his shoulder and dried it with the towel. \u201cDon\u2019t open it.\u201d</p><p>With a start, she put the box back on the shelf. \u201cI beg your pardon. I didn\u2019t mean to pry.\u201d</p><p>He tossed the towel into the bathroom. \u201cI\u2019ve managed to preserve those flowers for over six hundred years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d Her gaze drifted over his bare chest, then shifted back to the dried flowers in the box. \u201cThey must be very important to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are.\u201d He approached slowly. \u201cMy daughter picked them for me. She died that night.\u201d</p><p>Pam gasped. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe color has faded, but the flowers were a beautiful shade of lavender blue.\u201d He stopped beside her. \u201cThe same color as your eyes.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cI remind you of losing your daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remind me of the most joyful days of my life.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cCan you . . . tell me about her? What was her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnya.\u201d He touched the glass cover on the box, tracing the outline of the stems and flowers. \u201cShe was bright and beautiful. Blond with blue eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you,\u201d Pam whispered.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cShe was murdered. Along with my wife.\u201d</p><p>Pam gasped and touched his arm. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>With a grimace, he stepped back. \u201cDon\u2019t waste any sympathy for my wife. She invited the vampires in. She wanted them to transform her, so she could stay young and beautiful for all time.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from Pam\u2019s shocked face and paced across the room. \u201cWhen the vampires invaded our house, they attacked me and tied me up. I was one mortal against ten vampires. I couldn\u2019t defeat them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>He twisted his hair, wrapping it around his fist. \u201cI couldn\u2019t protect my daughter. They fed on her, drained her dry. She was only six years old.\u201d</p><p>Pam approached him, her eyes glistening with pink tears. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife had made a deal with them. She sacrificed our daughter, an innocent child, in exchange for eternal life. But the vampires double-crossed her and laughed over her corpse. Then they told me to enjoy my pain for the rest of my measly life.\u201d</p><p>Pam shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know how a mother could do that.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI blamed myself for centuries. I should have seen the evil in her. I should have taken my daughter somewhere safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t blame yourself.\u201d</p><p>He smiled sadly at her. \u201cLike you? You\u2019ve been blaming yourself for past mistakes.\u201d</p><p>She nodded with a resigned look. \u201cSo what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent three years hunting the vampires, but eventually I realized I couldn\u2019t compete with them as a mortal.\u201d</p><p>Pam grimaced. \u201cSo you became one of the creatures you hated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the only way to avenge my daughter.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glistened with tears. \u201cYou loved her so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d He touched her cheek. \u201cIt was a long time ago. And I\u2019ve managed to kill a lot of bad vampires in the last six hundred years. That\u2019s a good thing, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her tear-filled eyes regarded him with tenderness. \u201cYou are a good man, Mikhail.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched. \u201cI thought I was a huge brute.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re . . . lovely.\u201d A tear tumbled down her cheek, and he caught it with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cPam.\u201d He leaned forward and pressed his lips against hers. She sighed sweetly against him, a sign of surrender, so he gathered her in his arms and kissed her thoroughly. By the time he was done, she was clinging to him and breathless.</p><p>\u201cMikhail,\u201d she whispered, leaning against his chest.</p> <p>He rubbed a hand down her back. No undergarments that he could feel. Was she naked beneath her nightclothes? His groin twitched. \u201cPam, I want you.\u201d</p><p>With a gasp, she stepped back. \u201cReally? You-you mean, tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We have less than thirty minutes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s fine.\u201d She waved a hand. \u201cTen minutes is usually quite enough for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen?\u201d Ten hours could hardly suffice. Not when he\u2019d wanted her for almost two hundred years.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She pressed a hand to her chest and blushed. \u201cI daresay this is rather exciting.\u201d</p><p>His vision turned pink. \u201cWe haven\u2019t actually started yet, but I appreciate the enthusiasm.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened at the sight of his eyes, now red and glowing. \u201cGood heavens.\u201d She glanced around the room. \u201cDo you mind if I make myself comfortable on your bed?\u201d</p><p>His groin tightened. \u201cBe my guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. And if you could retire to another room\u2014 perhaps upstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI prefer to be alone.\u201d</p><p>His vision popped back to normal. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll have to explain. You see, I . . .\u201d She blushed. \u201cThis is rather embarrassing, but I don\u2019t like anyone to see me when I reach that . . . certain moment. I have an unfortunate tendency to thrash about.\u201d</p><p>He stifled a grin. \u201cYou . . . thrash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a most unseemly manner.\u201d She ducked her head, her blush deepening.</p><p>\u201cI want to see that.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cNo! Absolutely not! Just because we\u2019re having sex, it doesn\u2019t mean you can invade my privacy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She wanted to have sex in two different rooms? Oh, hell no. He gave her an incredulous look. \u201cAre you talking about vampire sex?\u201d</p> <p>She huffed. \u201cOf course. We\u2019re vampires, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a man and a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d She waved a dismissive hand. \u201cBut surely you agree that vampire sex is the only dignified way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo hell with dignity. I want you naked. With me.\u201d</p><p>With a gasp, she stepped back. \u201cBut\u2014but mortal sex is so . . . so . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarbaric?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvasive.\u201d She retreated another step. \u201cYou-you would expect to touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only the beginning.\u201d He stepped toward her. \u201cI plan to caress you and kiss you and taste you all over. I want to hear you moan and scream. I want to see your face when you climax.\u201d His mouth curled up. \u201cAnd I damn well want to see you thrash about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood heavens,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He gathered her into his arms and kissed her brow. \u201cLet me make love to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is so much more than I expected.\u201d She splayed her hands on his chest. \u201cI would be so . . . vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than I.\u201d</p><p>She gazed at him in wonder. \u201cYou\u2019re so fierce. How could I possibly make you vulnerable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPam, you have my heart.\u201d</p><p>She touched his cheek. \u201cOh, Mikhail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d</p><p>When she nodded, he swept her up in his arms and carried her to his bed.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cI HAVEN\u2019T DONE it like this in ages,\u201d Pamela whispered, as he untied the sash on her silk wrapper.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while for me, too.\u201d Mikhail peeled back the wrapper to reveal the sheer nightgown she\u2019d worn underneath. \u201cI can see through this.\u201d He brushed his fingers over a nipple.</p><p>She gasped, and her skin pebbled beneath the sheer fabric.</p><p>His mouth curled up. \u201cNaughty woman, I think you came here to seduce me.\u201d</p><p>She had, but with vampire sex in mind. She was getting more than she had bargained for. Her breath caught when he unbuttoned her nightgown with vampire speed.</p><p>\u201cI wish we could spend hours on this, but we\u2019re short on time.\u201d He lifted her into a sitting position.</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Even so, she felt extremely self-conscious when he slipped her wrapper and nightgown off her shoulders. He was very careful with her wounded arm, but it hardly registered. She could only think that her bare breasts were now exposed to his red and glowing eyes. No one had seen her naked since her late husband two hundred years ago.</p><p>And no one had confessed to loving her, either, in all that time. \u201cI-I saw how you felt when our minds were connected.\u201d Would he say the words out loud? She would feel much more at ease if he did.</p><p>He said nothing, only pushed her back onto the bed and tugged her clothes down her hips and legs.</p><p>She covered her eyes, imagining his glowing eyes examining every inch of her body. What would he do next? Would he invade her without warning, like Max had done? And then after a few uncomfortable thrusts, it would all be over.</p><p>For the first time, she wondered if her late husband had been a selfish lover. She\u2019d been completely innocent up to the wedding, so she\u2019d had no one to compare him to. She only knew that in recent years, she\u2019d enjoyed vampire sex more than anything he had done.</p><p>\u201cPam?\u201d</p><p>She peeked between her fingers and found Mikhail stretched out beside her, studying her face.</p><p>His cheek dimpled. \u201cWhy are you hiding? Don\u2019t you know how beautiful you are?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her hands. \u201cI feel so exposed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d He brushed her hair back from her brow. \u201cAnd I love you more than ever.\u201d</p><p>Her heart swelled. \u201cOh, Mikhail.\u201d She touched his face, and blond whiskers tickled her fingertips. \u201cI never knew you felt that way. Why did you keep it a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, I assumed you were selfish and vain like my late wife.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cYou should slap me for being a fool. I lost so much time when I could have been loving you.\u201d</p><p>She traced the outline of his strong jaw, then brushed a finger over his beautifully sculpted lips. \u201cWe can still have centuries together.\u201d</p><p>The red in his eyes darkened. \u201cGood. For once I have claimed you, I will not give you up.\u201d</p><p>Her heart felt like it would burst with longing. \u201cMikhail.\u201d She wrapped her arms around his neck.</p><p>He kissed her tenderly and thoroughly till she grew comfortably relaxed with him, warm and pliant. Then his hands began to roam. And his mouth. The comfortable feeling quickly flamed into a fiery passion that sizzled through her veins, making her hot and frantic.</p><p>He was true to his word, kissing and tasting her all over. She moaned as he suckled on her breasts, gasped when his fingers discovered the wet heat between her legs.</p><p>He did things with his fingers she had never imagined. Soon she was thrashing about and not even caring. And when he burrowed his head between her legs, she cried out in shock. How barbaric! How . . . wonderfully wild. She writhed beneath him till she shattered with the strongest climax she\u2019d ever experienced.</p><p>She was still pulsating with aftershocks when she felt the first tug of death-sleep. The sun was rising, and they were running out of time.</p><p>\u201cMikhail,\u201d she panted, reaching for him. He\u2019d spent all their time pleasuring her. How could she not love such a dear man?</p><p>\u201cDamn sun.\u201d He ripped off his pants and settled between her legs.</p><p>She gasped. He was huge. But even as fierce and powerful as he was, he couldn\u2019t keep the sun from rising. Another tug of death-sleep pulled at her.</p><p>He collapsed beside her and pulled her into his arms, his erection pressed against her stomach. \u201cTomorrow, you will be mine.\u201d</p><p>A sharp pain squeezed her chest as death-sleep claimed her. Tomorrow, she thought, as she fell into darkness.</p><p>THEY BOTH JOLTED awake at the same time.</p><p>Pam stared into his face, only inches away, and the enormity of her actions stole her breath away. She\u2019d given herself to a man she hardly knew. True, the sex had been beyond her wildest imaginings, but she\u2019d done more than have sex. She\u2019d given him her heart.</p><p>His mouth curled up as his eyes turned red. \u201cShall we pick up where we left off?\u201d</p><p>With a gasp, she felt his manhood swelling against her belly. \u201cI-I should eat first. I\u2019m quite peckish when I awaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen bite me.\u201d He pulled his hair over one shoulder to expose his neck.</p><p>She gulped. She\u2019d never bitten a vampire before. Not even her late husband. And Mikhail was six hundred years old. No doubt his blood would be extremely rich and powerful. It was shocking that he\u2019d even offer it to her.</p><p>What a sweet and generous man he was. No wonder she\u2019d fallen for him so quickly. Still, it was frightening to think how vulnerable she was now. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t you have some bottles in your fridge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He tickled her breasts with the tail end of his hair. \u201cBut I want to keep you in bed all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we have a mission to go on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take the night off.\u201d He kissed her mouth, then trailed kisses down her neck to her breasts.</p><p>She shivered when he drew a nipple into his mouth. How could she resist such a man? But if he claimed her, he would never let her go. He\u2019d said so himself.</p><p>A frisson of panic skittered through her. Was she ready for this? Mikhail might have waited two hundred years for this, but for her, it had only been a few nights. \u201cI-I should go home to . . . freshen up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still daylight there.\u201d He shifted to the other breast.</p><p>Oh, bother. He was right. It would be a few hours before she could teleport to London. \u201cI should have brought my costume with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s missing a sleeve.\u201d He nibbled a path to her belly button.</p><p>She shivered. \u201cI have a spare.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head. \u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA spare costume. And another box of ninja stars.\u201d She gasped as a hunger pain cramped her stomach.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He offered his wrist.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to weaken you before our mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you finished destroying the human-trafficking ring last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean you won\u2019t be doing any more missions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Another hunger pain seized her, doubling her over.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He jumped out of bed, and returned a few seconds later with a bottle of Blardonnay and two glasses. He filled a glass and handed it to her.</p><p>She guzzled it down fast.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d He refilled her glass.</p><p>She nodded and drank some more. As the pain subsided, she let her gaze wander over him. She\u2019d been too overwhelmed with passion the night before to get a good look at him. He was beautiful, golden and muscular. He drank from his glass, his head tilted back, his long hair loose down his back.</p><p>She stroked a hand down his hair, and a wave of desire swept over her. It would be so easy, so tempting to fall back against the pillows and let him make love to her.</p><p>But he\u2019d said she wouldn\u2019t be going on any more missions.</p><p>He set his empty glass on the bedside table, then reached for her. \u201cWhere were we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid we were about to quarrel.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched. \u201cI thought we were going to make love.\u201d He leaned toward her to kiss her.</p><p>She stopped him with a palm against his chest. \u201cYou said I couldn\u2019t go on any more missions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPam.\u201d He brushed her hair over her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re not trained well enough for battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree. I studied at the premier fencing academy in London. And I took classes three nights every week at a martial-arts\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not ready. You were wounded last night.\u201d His hand skimmed over her bandage. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to risk yourself.\u201d</p><p>She scooted back. \u201cThere is a need. I explained it to you before. I thought you understood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do understand. You wanted to prove that you wouldn\u2019t abandon your friends. You did that. You showed us how brave you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce isn\u2019t enough! I don\u2019t intend to scurry back to my parlor and embroider handkerchiefs for another hundred years. This is the new me\u2014VampWoman!\u201d</p><p>His jaw shifted. \u201cThe new you will end up getting killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not. The other women fight evil, so I can, too. Jack lets Lara help out. Olivia assists Robby. And Emma does things, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara was a police officer; Olivia was with the FBI; and Emma was with the CIA. They have years of training. If you want to go about this safely, you will join MacKay S and I and get the training you need. But even then, if you\u2019re not ready for battle, you will not be allowed to fight. I know for a fact that Lara and Olivia do not engage in vampire battles. They work more in the area of investigation.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, Pam reached for her wrapper. \u201cI did apply at MacKay S and I. Six months ago. They turned me down.\u201d</p><p>Mikhail sat back. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She slipped on the wrapper. \u201cThat\u2019s when I decided to be a free agent and take care of my own training. I suppose if you won\u2019t let me fight with you, I\u2019ll have to go solo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He grabbed her arm. \u201cAre you suicidal?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m determined.\u201d</p><p>His grip tightened. \u201cI won\u2019t allow it.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away from him. \u201cYou don\u2019t own me!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d He gritted his teeth. \u201cBut I cannot bear for you to be injured. The last time I lost someone I love, it nearly killed me.\u201d</p><p>Tears blurred her vision. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about your daughter, but I can\u2019t give up my dream and do nothing for the rest of my life.

You have my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for it!\u201d She winced. Oh God, she shouldn\u2019t have blurted that out. He had instantly flinched and let go of her.</p><p>He climbed out of bed, his face harsh and his eyes cold. \u201cMy apologies for burdening you with something you do not want.\u201d</p> <p>He stalked off to the bathroom and shut the door.</p><p>Her chest seized with a sudden pain. What had she done? She hadn\u2019t meant to hurt him. She only wanted go on missions with him. She wanted to prove herself strong and brave. What was so wrong with that?</p><p>Instead, she\u2019d proven herself a terrible fool.</p><p>Tears ran down her cheeks. What should she do? Apologize and tell him she loved him? Did she?</p><p>Oh, God, yes. She must love him for this to hurt so horribly.</p><p>She slipped out of bed, ready to dash to the bathroom and confess her love. But what then? Would she be expected to give up her plans?</p> <p>She wandered to the bathroom and knocked on the door.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\u201cMikhail?\u201d She knocked again. \u201cCan we . . . talk?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>She opened the door, and the room was empty. He must have thrown on some clothes and teleported away. He was probably at Zoltan\u2019s, getting ready for the next mission.</p><p>She was tempted to follow, but how could she show up there, wearing nothing but a thin wrapper? Besides, she didn\u2019t know what to say. He wasn\u2019t likely to back down, and she didn\u2019t want to give up her dream. They were at an impasse, and she didn\u2019t know how to fix it.</p><p>All she knew was that she loved him. She wanted an eternity with him.</p><p>But she might have discovered it too late.</p> <p>Chapter Seven</p><p>A week later. . .</p><p>\u201cHAVE A SEAT.\u201d Angus MacKay motioned to an armchair in the parlor of his London townhouse.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Pamela sat and wedged her small handbag into the chair next to her. After receiving a brief phone call and invitation from Angus\u2019s wife twenty minutes earlier, she\u2019d quickly dressed in a modern, professional-looking suit designed by Jean-Luc Echarpe. She wasn\u2019t sure what Angus and Emma wanted, but since they were the owners of MacKay Security and Investigation, and he was Coven Master of the British Isles, she wanted to look her best.</p><p>Angus paced across the parlor, his blue-and-green-plaid kilt swishing about his knees. \u201cI hear ye\u2019ve been busy of late, helping the lads in Albania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d So this was the purpose for her sudden invitation. The men must have complained about her interference with their mission, and Angus was going to berate her over it.</p><p>She gripped her hands together. Was Mikhail behind this? Was this how he intended to keep her safe at home and hopelessly bored for the next few centuries?</p><p>Angus stopped pacing and frowned at her. \u201cI heard ye were injured in battle. Are ye all right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Thank you.\u201d Pamela shifted in her chair. \u201cHow are you and Emma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re very well.\u201d Emma strode into the room, carrying a tray. \u201cWould you like a cup of hot Chocolood?\u201d</p><p>Pamela nodded. \u201cThat would be lovely. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>While Emma poured two cups from a teapot, Angus helped himself to a glass of Blissky at the sidebar.</p><p>\u201cHere you are.\u201d Emma passed her a cup, then sat near her on the settee. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering why we invited you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Pamela sipped some Chocolood, then set her cup down before her trembling hands could betray her.</p><p>Angus plunked his glass of Blissky on the coffee table, then sat next to his wife. \u201cWe received a detailed report on your recent activities.\u201d He arched a brow. \u201cVampWoman, ye call yerself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Heat invaded her cheeks. She\u2019d thought her idea excellent for the past six months, but now she feared others would see it as an irresponsible prank. She steeled herself for the berating soon to begin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid we made a mistake not hiring you before,\u201d Emma said with an apologetic smile. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realize how determined you are.\u201d</p><p>Pamela blinked. She wasn\u2019t in trouble?</p><p>Angus leaned forward, his elbows resting on his knees. \u201cWe\u2019d like to hire you now if ye\u2019re still interested.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open.</p><p>\u201cOf course, we doona think ye\u2019re properly trained for battle,\u201d Angus continued.</p><p>\u201cBut we will train you,\u201d Emma added. \u201cVigorously. Are you up to that?\u201d</p><p>Pamela snapped her mouth shut and nodded. Her pulse quickened. She was going to work for MacKay S and I!</p><p>Emma took a sip from her cup of Chocolood. \u201cYou worked as a bartender at Vanda\u2019s club in New York, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do ye feel about spying?\u201d Angus asked.</p><p>Pamela\u2019s heart skipped a beat, but she sat up straighter. \u201cHow soon can I start?\u201d</p><p>Angus chuckled. \u201cLet me explain the plan first. The Malcontents are in disarray, with Casimir and Corky gone. No clear leader has surfaced, and information is scarce. We know of a nightclub in Moscow they like to frequent, so there\u2019s a good chance we could gain valuable information there.\u201d</p><p>Pamela nodded. Good heavens! Did they expect her to work in Moscow?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tragic place.\u201d Emma grimaced. \u201cThe mortals who go there are enthralled to the point that they enjoy being fed on. Eventually, they run out of blood and are cast aside like empty milk jugs. And regrettably, there are more mortals ready to take their place. You would have to witness that but do nothing to help them, or your cover would be blown. Then you would be in serious trouble.\u201d</p><p>Pamela swallowed hard. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe would work at the bar, serving the puir mortals, and listening in on the Malcontents,\u201d Angus said.</p><p>Pamela slumped. This wasn\u2019t going to work. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t help you. I don\u2019t know any Russian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re perfect for the job.\u201d Emma gave her an encouraging smile. \u201cThe Malcontents will feel free to discuss their affairs in front of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will most likely test you to make sure ye doona understand them,\u201d Angus warned her. \u201cThey might say some verra nasty things to you to see if ye react.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust ignore them and go about your job, serving the mortals,\u201d Emma said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be wired, so their conversations will be heard by our Russian operative.\u201d</p><p>Pamela\u2019s heart lurched. \u201cYou mean . . . Mikhail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Angus replied. \u201cHe\u2019ll be yer partner.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019ll never agree to it. He doesn\u2019t want me doing anything dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear.\u201d Emma reached over and touched her arm. \u201cThis was Mikhail\u2019s idea. He\u2019s the one who convinced us to hire you.\u201d</p><p>Pamela sat back, stunned. Mikhail was behind this?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be listening in while you\u2019re at work,\u201d Emma added. \u201cIf there\u2019s an emergency situation, he can teleport to you instantly.\u201d</p><p>Angus stood. \u201cWhat do ye say, lass? Do ye want the job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Her heart thundered in her ears. A job with Mikhail? Night after night?</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you would like to discuss the matter with him first?\u201d Emma asked.</p><p>\u201cMikhail!\u201d Angus shouted.</p><p>Pamela gasped. He was here? She glanced at the entrance to the parlor just as his large frame filled the open doorway.</p><p>Her heart clenched with longing. How many tears had she shed the past week, believing she\u2019d lost him forever? Even now, her eyes filled with tears, and she squeezed them shut. This was not the time to fall apart. She needed to show Angus and Emma how strong she could be.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she opened her eyes and eased to her feet. Mikhail strode into the room, his eyes focused on her with an intensity that made her skin prickle with gooseflesh.</p><p>Emma grabbed her husband\u2019s arm and pulled him toward the entrance. \u201cWe should give them some privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re staring at each other something fierce,\u201d Angus whispered.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Emma herded him through the door and shut it.</p><p>Pamela drew in a shaky breath. Over the past week, she\u2019d envisioned meeting Mikhail many times. Sometimes, she imagined herself fussing at him and taking a tough stance. Other times, she would confess her love and throw herself into his arms. But far too often, she had burst into tears for fear he would never want to see her again.</p><p>Now the time had come. He was here, and she didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>He stopped about ten feet away. \u201cYou look thin. And pale.\u201d</p><p>She blinked away the tears in her eyes. Dear Mikhail. No false flattery from him, just the blunt truth. It was one of many things she loved about him. He was thinner, too. His cheekbones and the line of his jaw were sharper, and his eyes had a haunted look about them. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI arrived an hour ago to present the plan to Angus. He told you about it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe said we would be . . . business partners.\u201d</p><p>His mouth thinned. \u201cThat would be a start.\u201d</p><p>A start for what? \u201cI suppose I might need to live closer to the bar where I\u2019ll be working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a townhouse in Moscow. You\u2019re welcome to live there.\u201d A pained look crossed his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s a spare bedroom.\u201d</p><p>She winced inwardly. \u201cThen this is a . . . business proposition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, confused. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re doing this. You made it clear you didn\u2019t want me doing anything dangerous, but now you\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know why?\u201d He stepped toward her. \u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? I\u2019m trying desperately to get you back into my life. I\u2019m so desperate I\u2019m willing to put you in a dangerous situation that will scare the hell out of me every night. And I\u2019m willing to endure that torture just so you\u2019ll be near me.\u201d</p><p>Her heart swelled. \u201cMikhail\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I rushed you. I\u2019ve been in love with you for almost two hundred years, but it was new for you. I should have courted you, waited for you.\u201d He slashed the air angrily with his hand. \u201cI will wait for you. No matter how long it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMikhail.\u201d Tears ran down her cheeks. \u201cThe wait is over. I love you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened, then he grabbed her and pulled her into his arms. \u201cOh, God, Pam. I thought you hated me. I thought I\u2019d messed everything up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I messed up.\u201d She touched his face. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He wiped the tears from her cheeks. \u201cI love you so much. I should have never let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d She wrapped her arms around his neck. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how much I loved you till I had lost you.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her brow. \u201cWe can\u2019t let the Malcontents know you\u2019re with me. It would blow your cover. So we\u2019ll have to keep our marriage a secret.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cMarriage?\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cI keep going too fast. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll take it slower this time.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, smiling. \u201cI\u2019ll beat you up if you stick me in that spare bedroom. I can do it, you know. I\u2019m VampWoman.\u201d</p><p>With a laugh, he hugged her tight. \u201cYou\u2019re my woman.\u201d</p><p>A Forever Love</p><p>Pamela Palmer</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>\u201cCATCH IT, CATCH it, catch it, yes!\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth Bryant jumped from her seat as the Washington Redskins scored on a beautiful touchdown pass in the last ten seconds of the game to win. \u201cHail to the Redskins!\u201d she sang at the top of her lungs, joining her friends. At the Skins\u2019 win, high fives exploded around the small apartment living room, followed by several victory kisses between her girlfriends and their husbands and fianc\u00e9s.</p><p>Elizabeth\u2019s date, Tim, grabbed her around the waist and pulled her close, laying one on her. She stiffened before she could catch herself, then forced herself to relax and kiss him back. It wasn\u2019t the first time they\u2019d kissed\u2014she\u2019d been dating him for about a month, but the tender he-man assault was just too much like something Lukas would have done. She didn\u2019t appreciate the attempt or the reminder. She\u2019d belonged in Lukas\u2019s arms. She didn\u2019t belong in Tim\u2019s. And the thought made her chest ache.</p><p>Pulling away, she made a quick excuse and headed for the kitchen. Damn you, Lukas Olsson. Why can\u2019t I forget you? And she needed to forget him. Two years ago, he\u2019d left her, suddenly, without so much as a good-bye. She should be completely over him by now. She ought to hate him.</p><p>The trouble was, deep inside, the flicker of hope that he\u2019d someday return refused to die. Because Lukas Olsson had been full of secrets. When she\u2019d asked what he did for a living, he\u2019d only ever given her vague answers\u2014the kind of answers top secret types always offered in this town. CIA. NSA. Not only was Washington, D.C., overrun by politicians; it was crawling with spies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the eight months she and Lukas had dated, she\u2019d only ever seen him late at night. And while, logically, she knew that that probably meant he\u2019d had another girlfriend, or even a wife, hidden away somewhere, and that he\u2019d left her at the risk of getting caught, she couldn\u2019t let go of the hope that he\u2019d been sent on some last-minute top secret assignment that demanded communication silence, a mission that was taking longer than he\u2019d expected. And that someday he\u2019d waltz back into her life, sweep her into his arms, and kiss her senseless.</p><p>But with each passing month, it became harder to hold on to that hope. The likelihood that their relationship had never meant as much to him as it had to her became greater and greater. In all probability, Lukas had taken the coward\u2019s way out and disappeared rather than facing her with that truth.</p><p>Logic said that he was gone and wasn\u2019t coming back, and the sooner she accepted that and forgot about him, the happier she\u2019d be. But the heart was a hopelessly illogical organ.</p> <p>As she entered the kitchen, Steph caught up with her, her eyes at once sympathetic and a little frustrated.</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked this one,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Elizabeth shrugged. \u201cTim\u2019s a great guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s not Lukas.\u201d Steph\u2019s warm fingers closed around her forearm. \u201cSweetheart, no one is ever going to be Lukas.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth\u2019s lips twisted ruefully. \u201cTrust me, I know that.\u201d There would only ever be one Lukas Olsson. With the blond hair and blue eyes of his Nordic ancestors and the build of a linebacker . . . or Viking marauder . . . Lukas had been gorgeous in a powerful, masculine, wholly uncivilized way. And that smile of his . . . oh, that smile could whip an entire roomful of women into a frenzy of delight or jealousy, depending on who was on the receiving end.</p> <p>Elizabeth sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s no spark with Tim, and I can\u2019t keep pretending there is.\u201d And, Heaven help her, there\u2019d been sparks with Lukas. Fireworks bright enough to light up the night sky.</p><p>She\u2019d thought he adored her. He\u2019d acted as if he adored her, as if he\u2019d been every bit as much in love with her as she\u2019d been with him, even if they\u2019d never actually said the words. They\u2019d dated, made love, and spent every night together for almost eight months.</p><p>Damn him. She knew he\u2019d cared for her, at least a little bit. No man was that good an actor for that long. But he obviously hadn\u2019t cared enough.</p><p>Releasing a hard sigh, she grabbed a Corona and the bottle opener.</p><p>Steph watched her open her beer, her expression soft. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to say this, but there\u2019s more to life than sparks, sweetie. Tim\u2019s nice, he\u2019s good-looking, and he\u2019s a lawyer. And let\u2019s face it, a lawyer\u2019s salary would go a long way toward balancing your teacher\u2019s pay.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth snorted. There was that.</p> <p>But as Tim walked her back to her apartment an hour later, Elizabeth knew she couldn\u2019t see him again. They\u2019d dated a month, and she\u2019d put off having sex with him as long as she could. She\u2019d already learned from experience that there was nothing lonelier in the world than sharing that ultimate intimacy with the wrong man when she knew there was a right one.</p><p>Even if, in all probability, the right one was gone from her life for good.</p><p>When Tim tried to take her hand, she feigned ignorance, and a chill she didn\u2019t feel, and crossed her arms instead. At the base of the stairs to her apartment building, she turned to him.</p><p>Wry disappointment twisted his expression. \u201cThis isn\u2019t working, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I like you, Tim, but . . .\u201d</p><p>He nodded. And sighed. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Giving in to impulse, she kissed his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a great catch for the right woman. I\u2019m sorry she can\u2019t be me.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, ready for bed, Elizabeth eyed the drawer of her bedside table. Don\u2019t touch it, she urged herself. Leave it alone and go to sleep. But the temptation was just too great, and she lifted out the framed picture that Steph had snapped the weekend before Lukas disappeared. With a beer in one hand, he\u2019d pulled Elizabeth against him in that way that screamed mine. She\u2019d looked up, laughing. And the expression on his face as he\u2019d grinned down at her had been so full of adoration. Of love.</p> <p>How could he have left her without a single word?</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Lukas Olsson.\u201d As she stared at his beloved face, her heart squeezed, tears burning her eyes. \u201cWhy do I still miss you so much?\u201d She\u2019d found that most wonderful and elusive of treasures\u2014a forever love. Then lost it, lost him, in a haze of mystery, questions, and uncertainty.</p><p>Despite that, if she had it to do over, she wouldn\u2019t change a thing. Knowing Lukas, loving him, even for that short time, was worth all the doubts and misery and loneliness that had followed. A loneliness, she feared, that might well last a lifetime.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>STEPH WAS WAITING in front of Elizabeth\u2019s apartment the next morning, two Starbucks lattes in her hands. The September morning was just cool enough to hint at autumn\u2019s impending arrival, the sun bright, the sky a brilliant cobalt. Elizabeth\u2019s cotton cardigan felt good, though by the time school was out, she wouldn\u2019t need it.</p><p>With a grin, she adjusted her purse on her shoulder and took one of the lattes. \u201cYou are the best friend, evah.\u201d</p><p>Steph laughed as the two started down Wisconsin Avenue NW toward Georgetown and Adams Middle School, where Steph taught music and Elizabeth math. The weather was lovely, the road narrow and tree-lined, the architecture quaint, filling her with pleasure despite the heavy traffic and morning crush.</p><p>\u201cI figured the morning after a breakup deserved something special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you know Tim and I broke up?\u201d Elizabeth asked primly. Steph always knew what Elizabeth was going to do before she did it.</p><p>\u201cThe writing was on the wall. You did break up with him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Elizabeth sighed. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>They walked side by side, past the Naval Observatory, the sidewalk crowded with people heading to work, or looking for coffee, or just meandering with a dog on a leash.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing after school?\u201d Steph asked. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about checking out the new health club. Come with me. We can ogle the hotties together.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m not dead, girlie. Garrett doesn\u2019t mind in the least if I work myself into a lather. Not as long as I come to him for relief.\u201d</p><p>With a smile, Elizabeth took a bracing sip of hot latte goodness. Hazelnut, just the way she loved it. \u201cI\u2019m up for a workout as long as you don\u2019t try to fix me up with anyone.\u201d Before Steph could profess innocence of any such plan, Elizabeth continued, \u201cI didn\u2019t have time to check the news this morning. Anything interesting that I missed?\u201d</p><p>Steph sobered. \u201cAnother person\u2019s gone missing, this one down by the Navy Yard. He was on his way to a Nats game, and his friends say he just disappeared. Which is impossible, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that make, now? Fifteen, sixteen?\u201d People all over the city had disappeared over the past few months, some in broad daylight. Some purportedly into thin air.</p><p>\u201cNineteen. The most popular theories are space-alien abductions, or the rapture, though if it\u2019s the latter, it\u2019s taking forever and leaving most of the superreligious behind. They\u2019re pissed. Garrett\u2019s worried, but I keep reminding him that nineteen out of well over a million means my odds of being snatched are small enough to be approaching zero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like the math teacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are. Still, I feel bad for the families left wondering where they went.\u201d She had a sense of what that felt like, the void a missing loved one created in one\u2019s life. The never knowing where they\u2019d gone or why, or if they were ever coming back. It had crossed her mind that Lukas\u2019s disappearance might be related though it seemed unlikely, given that the spate of disappearances had started only a couple of months ago.</p><p>\u201cSo share the deets on the health club,\u201d Elizabeth said, steering the conversation to a less depressing topic.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got a grand opening special . . .\u201d</p><p>As Steph talked, and they walked the mile to school past colorful Georgetown row-house shops, Elizabeth sipped her latte and drank in the sights and sounds of the hectic morning rush, consciously embracing all that she loved about her life. And there was much to love\u2014her friends and family, her math kids, the teaching itself, and the constant, familiar bustle of the city she\u2019d grown up in.</p><p>For eight months, she\u2019d been more than just happy. She\u2019d felt . . . complete . . . as if her world and her life had finally snapped into full, brilliant focus. Though, if she were honest, that brilliant focus had always suffered more than a handful of shadows. Shadows in the form of Lukas\u2019s secrets. She\u2019d never called him on his unwillingness to share more about himself, hoping that eventually he\u2019d trust her with the truth. Instead, he\u2019d left without a word. And she\u2019d never quite be the same again. Not with her heart now missing an elemental piece.</p><p>If she was lucky, someday another man . . . the right man . . . would come along and fill the hole Lukas had left. But deep inside, her heart stubbornly insisted that Lukas Olsson was the only right man for her.</p><p>As they reached P Street, the crosswalk flashed with the red-handed \u201cwait\u201d sign, and Elizabeth took another sip of coffee. Steph had a way of shifting conversational directions on a dime, and they were now talking about the new fall television season.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to see it,\u201d Steph enthused about yet another amateur singing hour.</p><p>Elizabeth smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll set it to record on my DVR when I get home.\u201d</p><p>The light changed to \u201cwalk,\u201d and they started forward again. But halfway across P Street, a cool draft of air shivered over Elizabeth\u2019s skin.</p><p>And with her next step, the lights went out.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>ELIZABETH FROZE. HER pulse took flight as the darkness, the silence, pressed in all around her. She could see nothing. Hear . . . nothing.</p><p>How? How . . . ?</p><p>A second ago, she\u2019d been walking across P Street beside Steph in the bright sunshine. Now . . . this. Had she passed out? Was she having a seizure, or a stroke? Good grief, had she . . . died?</p><p>No. Not unless her latte had traveled with her. Her Starbucks cup remained clasped warm in her hand.</p><p>\u201cSteph?\u201d Her voice cracked with fear.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, something coalesced from the darkness. Slowly, a landscape began to materialize around her. No, no, it was just her eyes beginning to adjust to a dark that was not, as she\u2019d first thought, complete\u2014the dark of a dangerously stormy day. Or dusk.</p><p>All around her stood buildings. Not the buildings that should be here but something entirely different\u2014small houses and large, a general store, a . . . stable? It looked like a ghost town from a bygone era, deserted. Crumbling.</p><p>Trees rose among the buildings and houses, as if trying to reclaim forest once stolen by the town. But the trees were winter bare, twisted, some half-disintegrated, as if they, too, had been left to die.</p><p>What is this place? A chill skated over her skin, part shock, part true chill, for the air was much cooler here than it had been in . . . the place she belonged. How in the name of all that\u2019s holy did I get here? It smelled different\u2014woodsy in a dry, aged way, and dusty. Dust overlaid with decay.</p><p>Clutching her Starbucks cup with both hands, she turned around slowly, her heart trying to break its way out of her chest.</p><p>This can\u2019t be happening. \u201cI have to get to class,\u201d she murmured, as if whatever mysterious hand had plucked her out of her life would say, \u201cOh, sorry. Of course I\u2019ll send you back.\u201d</p><p>Is this Heaven?</p><p>A sound caught her ear, blasting through the panic pounding at her eardrums. A man\u2019s scream.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s Hell.</p><p>Her heart thudded so hard, her entire body began to quake. She felt light-headed, dizzy. Don\u2019t pass out. You can\u2019t pass out.</p><p>Another sound broke through, the dull clip-clop of horses. Multiple horses, much closer than the scream. Were the ghosts of this place coming for her? If so, she\u2019d be the one screaming soon.</p><p>The warmth seeping into her now-shaking hands reminded her that she still held her latte. Gripping the precious cup, she sipped gingerly, relishing the tasty slide of warmth down her throat. The familiar taste grounded her, if only a little, reminding her of Steph, of their walk, of their discussion . . .</p><p>The nineteen missing.</p><p>Oh my God. I\u2019m number twenty.</p><p>Her face turned to ice. Her head began to pound as one thought broke free of the dozens swirling inside. If Lukas finally came back, he wouldn\u2019t find her. Now she was the one who\u2019d disappeared.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she breathed, her mind turning to steel. \u201cI\u2019m not staying here.\u201d</p><p>There had to be a way back home.</p><p>And she had to find it.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>ELIZABETH TOOK ANOTHER bracing sip of her quickly cooling coffee, then started forward. No good could come of standing in the middle of the street, especially with the sound of the horses drawing nearer. Instinct urged her to find a place to hide until she saw what manner of people . . . or creatures . . . rode those horses. But where?</p><p>She had no idea what this place was. The streets were laid out just the same as Georgetown\u2019s, but the buildings were all wrong. They appeared not only decrepit but old. As if the buildings she knew had been replaced with their predecessors. Or as if they\u2019d never replaced their predecessors at all.</p><p>How is that possible? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As she neared the sidewalk, another thought occurred to her. If she was one of the missing, where were the others? Were they the ones on horseback? Or the ones screaming?</p><p>Her stomach quivered.</p><p>The sound of the horses grew louder, and she stepped up her pace, running toward the nearest door, praying it offered sanctuary and not greater danger. But when she reached for the knob, she found it locked tight. Glancing at the windows, she shied away. They\u2019d been shattered, leaving deadly, jagged edges like razor-sharp teeth ready to devour anyone foolish enough to try to climb through.</p> <p>Strikeout. She\u2019d have to hide behind the house instead. But as she retraced her steps to the sidewalk, three horses and their riders turned onto the street. She saw them. Worse, they clearly saw her, for they rode straight toward her, closing the distance fast, the beasts\u2019 hooves kicking up dust in the twilight air.</p><p>Her primal self screamed at her to run. Her logical mind scoffed at the notion. She didn\u2019t stand a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of outrunning them. Not only were there three of them, on horseback, but they knew where they were. And she didn\u2019t have a clue.</p><p>Sometimes, the best defense was a good offense. Sometimes, it was the only defense. Swallowing hard, she crossed her arms over her chest, careful not to spill her coffee, and waited for their arrival as if they were three young students late to class, and not . . . whatever they really were.</p><p>The men slowed their mounts to a walk as they reached her, fanning out around her as they pulled up, eyeing her with smiles and speculation that made her skin crawl. At least it was nice to know her instincts . . . the ones that had told her to run . . . had probably been correct. If only she\u2019d stood a chance of getting away.</p><p>Taking a studiously nonchalant sip of her coffee with a badly shaking hand, she studied them, trying to hide just how scared she really was. Two of the men were dressed alike in what appeared, in the low light, to be tan pants and long-sleeved black shirts with tight cuffs and billowing sleeves, reminding her of pirate garb from some old movie. Adding to that image were the swords strapped to their waists. But other than their garb and weapons, those two looked nothing alike. One had skin as black as night, his hair hanging long around a face pierced in more than a dozen places\u2014through the eyebrows, the nose, the lip. A face devoid of softness, devoid of humanity. The other\u2019s skin appeared pale as moonlight though most was hidden beneath a full, bushy, black beard.</p> <p>The third rider . . . holy cow. His hair glowed. Glowed like a black opal. He appeared considerably younger than the other two, maybe no more than early twenties, and he, at least, watched her with something approaching sympathy. Which meant she probably needed it.</p><p>Oh, she was in trouble.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pretty one,\u201d the dark-skinned swordsmen said, then suddenly . . . literally . . . disappeared off his horse. Before her jaw could drop, he reappeared an arm\u2019s length in front of her.</p><p>Elizabeth jumped back with a squeak, nearly dropping her latte. Her entire body began to quake.</p><p>The man threw his head back with a look of such pleasure that she wondered what kind of drug he was on. Or what he was imagining doing to her. Her breath lodged in her throat, and she started to back away. The nicker of a horse at her back reminded her there were three of them, and she was going nowhere.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll claim you for my own, pretty one,\u201d the male in front of her said, his head straightening, dark lashes sweeping up to reveal . . .</p> <p>The Starbucks finally slipped through her fingers, but she barely noticed, barely heard the splat or felt the splash of liquid against her pant legs as she stared at his eyes . . . dark eyes now centered with a perfect white circle, a white pupil.</p><p>Her shock apparently pleased him, for he grinned, revealing long, sharp incisors. Fangs.</p><p>Her breath left her altogether. \u201cWho are you?\u201d she gasped, her voice quavering like a twelve-year-old boy\u2019s in the presence of a twelve-year-old girl. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s smile widened, his look of pleasure deepening, his fangs growing longer still.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your new master, pretty one. And this place? Washington, V.C. Vamp City.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cVAMP . . . ?\u201d ELIZABETH STARED at the man with the white-pupiled eyes. And the fangs. \u201cAs in vampire?\u201d Her voice shot up, nearly to a squeak.</p><p>This isn\u2019t happening. Vampires aren\u2019t real. Everyone knows they\u2019re not real.</p> <p>Suddenly, an arm snaked around her from behind, pinning her back against a hard chest. The brush of beard against her hair told her which of the other two had her.</p><p>Elizabeth struggled against his iron hold, his arm pressing so hard against her shoulders she gasped with pain. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting me.\u201d But he didn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>The pierced man\u2019s white-pupiled eyes lit with fury. \u201cMine,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cI say she isn\u2019t,\u201d the man at her back growled. \u201cBut I\u2019m willing to share. Let me take the first bite.\u201d</p><p>Bite? Elizabeth felt the blood drain from her face and was almost glad for the arm restraining her because without it, she feared her knees were going to fail her.</p><p>The hoofbeats of another horse caught her attention.</p><p>\u201cHold!\u201d The voice, not the youth\u2019s, called from a short distance. A voice that sounded wonderfully, achingly familiar, as if she\u2019d conjured it up in this desperate moment.</p><p>A tiny flare of hope had her head snapping up as the fourth horseman approached, deep in the twilight shadows. All she could make out was a form big enough and broad-shouldered enough to be Lukas\u2019s. As he drew closer, she could tell the hair was a little longer, in need of a haircut. Logic told her it wasn\u2019t he, it couldn\u2019t be. Her agitated mind was merely attempting to overlay his image on the male who approached, the image of a savior. A hero.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Lukas.</p><p>But as he drew closer, and she finally saw the strong jaw and high cheekbones of the face that had haunted her for two years, her knees gave way.</p><p>\u201cLukas,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>He was dressed in a black shirt and tan pants, the same as the other pair, two swords strapped to his back, their hilts rising from behind his shoulders like wings.</p><p>The man she loved pulled his horse to a stop beside the male with the pierced face and stared at her with an expression she\u2019d never seen, his mouth hard, his eyes at once cool as frost and angry as hell.</p><p>Her heart began to shatter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been searching for you, Elizabeth,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed with confusion. \u201cWhat? Here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d the male at her back exclaimed, tightening his hold on her until she cried out with the pain shooting through her chest and shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re not claiming her, Lukas. She came in on the sunbeam, and don\u2019t try to deny it\u2014she\u2019s got Starbucks. She didn\u2019t get that in Vamp City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was my slave in the real world,\u201d Lukas said smoothly. Slave? \u201cI expected her to find her way to me before this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not your slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows my name, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d His expression was so hard. Cold blue eyes pinned her. \u201cAre you mine?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her heart thundering. Yes, she\u2019d been his. The old Lukas\u2019s. She did not know this man.</p><p>\u201cYou left me.\u201d The words came out unbidden, as raw as the pain in her heart.</p><p>For a swift second, she thought she saw that pain mirrored in his eyes, but a moment later, he stared at her once more through hard, blue crystals.</p><p>\u201cAre you mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, master,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>This was not the man she knew. Yet at the very first sight of him, her heart had begun, very slowly, to unfurl, to blossom, and it continued to do so.</p><p>Her heart was an idiot.</p><p>\u201cI saw her first,\u201d the pierced male grumbled. \u201cI should at least get a taste of her.\u201d</p><p>Lukas swung down off his horse far slower than the bearded man had, his movements deliberate, threatening. And she didn\u2019t think the show was for her.</p><p>\u201cRelease her.\u201d Lukas\u2019s gaze pinned the man at her back. \u201cNo one touches what is mine.\u201d</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the arm across her shoulders disappeared. In the blink of another, Lukas was beside her, his hand gripping her upper arm. Too fast. Either she was suffering some kind of head trauma, or they were moving too damned fast.</p><p>Her head felt suddenly full of helium, and she began to sway. Lukas swept her up as if she weighed nothing, and she grabbed at her purse as it slipped off her shoulder. He strode to his horse, deposited her on its back, and swung up behind her.</p><p>As his arm slipped around her waist, as he pulled her back against the chest she\u2019d once loved so much, she finally found herself in the one place she\u2019d longed to be for two years. Once more in Lukas\u2019s arms.</p><p>But instead of the joyous reunion she\u2019d imagined, she was shaking with shock. And fear. Lukas Olsson was not the man she\u2019d thought he was.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t certain he was a man at all.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cBACK TO OUR search,\u201d Lukas commanded, as if he was the leader of this bunch. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be anywhere near this block if the sunbeam breaks through again.\u201d</p><p>The two males who\u2019d threatened her mounted, and the four horsemen started down the road, Lukas in front, Elizabeth snug against his chest.</p><p>She was so confused, her mind a tangle of conflicting emotions. She was furious, and hurt, and terrified. And yet her heart refused to be silent as it rejoiced that she\u2019d found Lukas at last. Part of her wanted to turn around and kiss him senseless; another part wanted to punch him in the mouth. And the biggest part wanted to leap off the horse and run like crazy.</p><p>The arm pinning her ensured she did none of those things. All she could do was pray that the man she\u2019d fallen in love with\u2014the kind, loving Lukas who\u2019d been so good to her\u2014hadn\u2019t been a complete lie, that he was still in there somewhere. Whatever soft feelings he might have once felt toward her might be her only chance of survival.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think we\u2019re going to find the sorceress all the way out here?\u201d Pierced-face grumbled. \u201cWe\u2019re in fucking nowhere Georgetown. No one\u2019s lived here in decades.\u201d</p><p>So they really were in Georgetown? In what dimension?</p><p>\u201cWhich would make it the perfect place to hide,\u201d the bearded one countered. \u201cWe\u2019ve already flushed a dozen runaways out of hiding. We could still get lucky.\u201d The lurid tone in his voice sent another chill down Elizabeth\u2019s spine.</p><p>They took a right on . . . M Street? It would be M Street if this really were Georgetown. The streets were definitely laid out the same, but the buildings weren\u2019t right. Not at all. What happened to the colorful row houses that were the hallmark of Georgetown?</p><p>She stared around in consternation. What was this place?</p><p>They rode another block before Lukas pulled up. He dismounted, then turned to her, his back to his companions. As his gaze caught hers, emotion flared in those once-beloved blue eyes\u2014anger and dismay, and something more. Something softer. Something that gave her hope that the man she\u2019d loved wasn\u2019t entirely gone.</p><p>Her breath turned shallow.</p><p>Breaking eye contact, he pulled her off the horse and set her on her feet beside him. \u201cGive me your purse.\u201d When she did, he stuffed it into one of his saddlebags.</p><p>\u201cSpread out,\u201d Lukas commanded. The two older males each headed for a different deserted, crumbling house along the street. The kid with the glowing hair accompanied the pierced one. Lukas took her wrist as if she were a difficult student in need of a chat with the principal and led her across the street toward what appeared to have been some kind of general store.</p><p>Once upon a time, he\u2019d have taken her hand, lacing his cool fingers between hers. The thought flared with new meaning, with fresh understanding. He\u2019d always been cool to the touch\u2014his hands, his face, even his body, though he\u2019d always assured her he didn\u2019t feel cold.</p><p>No wonder he\u2019d only ever come to her after dark. Vampires couldn\u2019t handle sunlight.</p><p>Dear God.</p><p>Memories continued to cascade through her mind\u2014the way he was always gone by morning. Always. The marks on her neck. . .</p><p>Her fingers rose, her flesh going cold, as she remembered how she\u2019d often . . . always? . . . awakened with a couple of red spots on the side of her neck when she was dating him. They usually faded by noon, then reappeared the next morning. She\u2019d never figured out what they were. Then Lukas had disappeared and, with him, the spots.</p><p>Bite marks?</p><p>How could any of this be real?</p><p>Lukas tried to open the door, but it was locked. Without a moment\u2019s hesitation, he lifted a foot and kicked in the door as if it were made of cardboard. He ushered her into a room that, in the dim light, did appear to have once been a store though the goods had long since been removed.</p><p>None too gently, Lukas pulled her around the corner and pushed her back against the wall, staring down at her with a look as different from the one he\u2019d given her on the street as a look could be. The coldness, the hardness, fell away like a mask. The longing in his expression almost brought tears to her eyes, and suddenly he was kissing her as if it had been hours since he\u2019d last seen her and not two years, as if they\u2019d met one another at the theater and not this . . . this godforsaken place.</p><p>As if he weren\u2019t a vampire.</p><p>Turning her head, Elizabeth broke the kiss. \u201cStop,\u201d she gasped. \u201cI don\u2019t even know you.\u201d</p><p>Cool, gentle fingers gripped her chin, turning her back to face him. \u201cYou know me, Lizzy. I haven\u2019t changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a vampire!\u201d Did she really say that out loud? \u201cWhen, Lukas? When did you become a vampire?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCenturies ago.\u201d</p><p>Her head dropped back against the wall with a thud. \u201cThe least you could do is laugh at me and tell me there\u2019s no such thing.\u201d</p><p>Cool fingers slid into her hair, caressing her scalp. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lizzy-mine. You should never have found out this way. I never wanted you to know at all.\u201d</p> <p>She pushed away from the wall, from him, her mind awhirl. Centuries ago. He\u2019d been turned centuries ago. All this time, she\u2019d thought he was human. She\u2019d thought he was falling in love with her, as she\u2019d fallen in love with him. A vampire.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to be sick.\u201d Reaching out blindly, she touched his arm, felt his hand close around hers, and she snatched it back, pulling away. \u201cYou bit me. When we were dating, you bit me.\u201d She turned back to him slowly, his face faintly illuminated in the twilight from the back window.</p><p>He smiled, but in his eyes she saw only regret. \u201cYour blood was sweet. And you loved it, Lizzy girl. You came and came and came when I sucked on your neck like that.\u201d</p><p>Speechless, she stared at him. \u201cGod.\u201d Her cheeks turned to flame. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I remember any of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took your memories. Only the ones that would damn me.\u201d His eyes pleaded with her to understand. \u201cI never hurt you. I would never hurt you, my Lizzy.\u201d He reached for her, but she jerked her hands out of his reach and stepped back.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t. I\u2019m not your Lizzy. I\u2019m not your anything.\u201d The heat in her cheeks deepened, not from embarrassment now but from utter humiliation. She\u2019d thought he loved her, when all she\u2019d been to him was food.</p><p>At the sound of footsteps outside, Lukas moved between her and the door.</p><p>The pierced one poked his head in through the doorway. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>Lukas scowled. \u201cYou have your own slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been sharing with you. I think it\u2019s time you returned the favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I think you should get back to work.\u201d Lukas turned and started walking toward the stairs. \u201cCome, Elizabeth,\u201d he snapped, holding out a hand for her.</p> <p>She glanced at the hungry eyes of the other vampire and flew to Lukas\u2019s side, sliding her hand into his, gladly. His cool fingers closed around hers, and he led her up the stairs, warning her to watch her step. As one of the stairs splintered and crumbled beneath her foot, he pulled her clear as if she weighed nothing.</p><p>Finally, at the top of the stairs, he released her hand. \u201cWait here.\u201d Then he disappeared, or moved away from her so quickly that he might as well have. She sensed rather than saw him dart in and out of the upstairs rooms. And then he was back at her side, his strong hand once more closing protectively around her own.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking for a woman?\u201d Elizabeth asked, as they started back down the treacherous steps.</p><p>\u201cYes. Or evidence that anyone\u2019s been hiding here.\u201d</p><p>Pierced-face was waiting for them when they returned to the shop level, his pupils white as snow, his fangs elongated as he watched her hungrily, making chills race over her skin.</p><p>\u201cHave you told her the way of things around here, Lukas?\u201d he asked silkily. \u201cDoes she know that we don\u2019t just need blood to survive, but various emotions? Have you warned her that Butch is a pain-feeder, that he\u2019s watching her, waiting for the chance to snatch her away from you and hurt her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to touch her,\u201d Lukas growled.</p><p>But Pierced-face continued as if Lukas hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cMy guess is he\u2019ll rape her and probably sodomize her. But he might go the quick route and just yank out a couple of her fingernails.\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth\u2019s blood turned to ice.</p><p>Pierced-face threw back his head in delight.</p><p>Lukas\u2019s grip on her arm tightened. \u201cIgnore him, Elizabeth. The asshole is a fear-feeder, determined to scare you. Butch won\u2019t touch you.\u201d His voice rose, turning hard as granite. \u201cNeither of them will if they want to live.\u201d</p><p>Pierced-face grinned. His words had hit their mark, and they all knew it.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Lukas said, tugging her past the prick and out the door.</p><p>Elizabeth\u2019s grip on Lukas\u2019s hand tightened. Lukas might be a vampire who\u2019d fed on her without her knowledge, but she still trusted him a thousand times more than she did his companions.</p><p>As they walked toward the next building, a small house, Pierced-face remained close behind them, apparently hoping to scare her again. Her mouth tightened in annoyance even as her spine tingled and crawled as if, at any moment, she might feel a knife plunge between her shoulder blades. Or fangs sink into her neck from behind.</p><p>She fought the scaremongering, struggling not to succumb. Hardening her jaw, she glanced at Lukas. \u201cDo vampires really feed off emotions?\u201d</p><p>He met her gaze, his blue eyes touching something deep inside her even in that brief and hooded look. \u201cEmoras do. We\u2019re just one race of vampires, but we\u2019re the predominant race in Vamp City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how much this is twisting my mind?\u201d</p><p>His hand squeezed hers gently. \u201cI have some idea.\u201d</p><p>She peered at him. \u201cWhat emotion do you need?\u201d</p><p>Meeting her gaze, his mouth tightened, then turned rueful. \u201cPleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour own or others\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly others\u2019.\u201d His voice lowered to a whisper. \u201cI fed well from yours.\u201d</p><p>Her breath stuttered, the thought incredibly . . . hot. No wonder he\u2019d lavished such sweet attention on her body. She\u2019d thought him the kindest, most thoughtful lover any woman had ever had. He\u2019d loved to make her come\u2014before he entered her, while he was inside her, over and over and over. Then yet again when they lay close and sated and complete. He\u2019d told her he got as much pleasure from her orgasms as she did.</p><p>Apparently, that was, quite literally, true.</p><p>Bastard.</p><p>She pulled her hand from his, her stomach clenching with yet another spasm of betrayal. He hadn\u2019t brought her to orgasm for her. He hadn\u2019t done it to make her happy. He\u2019d done it for the simple, cold reason that he\u2019d needed to eat.</p><p>\u201cYou used me,\u201d she said, her tone flat. Hurt.</p><p>\u201cYou were my slave, Elizabeth,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cEven if you didn\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw clenched shut. Damn him.</p><p>As they reached the crumbling front walk of the house, Pierced-face spoke. \u201cJust wait until he gets you back to the stronghold, Elizabeth. Just wait until all those pain-feeders get their fangs . . . and cocks . . . and knives . . . into you.\u201d</p><p>Lukas released her and whirled, his sword suddenly free of its sheath. \u201cGo. Now. Before I cut off your idiot head.\u201d</p><p>Pierced-face grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s not as fearful as many new arrivals, but she\u2019s been a sweet little snack.\u201d A moment later, he was gone.</p><p>As Lukas led her up the rotting steps, he said quietly, \u201cI never used you. I never enslaved you. I . . .\u201d He didn\u2019t finish, and she wondered what he\u2019d almost said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. All that matters is that no one realize that I have feelings for you, Lizzy, or we\u2019re both going to suffer.\u201d</p><p>As he led her inside the old house, and they were finally alone, she turned to him. \u201cDo you? Do you really have feelings for me?\u201d</p><p>With a sound of misery, he pulled her into his arms, tight against his chest. \u201cYou have no idea, woman. You\u2019ve no idea how I\u2019ve suffered not being able to return to you, knowing you thought I\u2019d abandoned you.\u201d He pulled back, cupped her face in his hands. \u201cI have thought of you, missed you, every minute of every hour of every day for two solid, miserable years, Lizzy-mine. Yes, I have feelings for you.\u201d</p><p>As he kissed her softly, tenderly, his words slowly soaked into her mind, her heart, her soul, like a warm, summer rain on parched earth. Could she believe him? Did she dare believe him?</p><p>Her heart said yes. Her mind insisted on reserving judgment.</p><p>Finally, he pulled back and took her hand. \u201cCome. I have a job to do. And it\u2019s critically important.\u201d</p><p>As they began to search the fully furnished, if decrepit house, she glanced at him. \u201cThis sorceress you\u2019re looking for. Is she real? I mean . . . magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s the only one who can save us.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him sharply. \u201cSave you from what?\u201d</p><p>His expression turned grim. \u201cIn 1870, a powerful wizard created Vamp City, an exact duplicate of a portion of Washington, D.C. at that time. It was billed as a vampire utopia, a place where the sun never shone and where vampires were free not only to come and go as we wished but to bring in humans for whatever purposes we desired. An arena was built for games to be played only by vampires, where we were free to use all of our skills, all of our strengths, without fear of discovery by the far-too-prevalent humans. And for 140 years, it has been that\u2014utopia. Until two years ago, when the magic started to fail. Those of us within Vamp City at that moment became trapped here.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cThat\u2019s why you never came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He pulled her against him, kissing her hair. Then he stopped and turned her to face him, his hands gripping her shoulders, then cupping her cheeks, a plea in his eyes. \u201cI never would have left you willingly. There are millions who can provide me sustenance of the body, my Lizzy. It is you alone who feeds my soul.\u201d The pain in his voice soaked into her heart, nourishing the song there that had already begun, once more, to sing.</p><p>\u201cWhen the sorceress is found, will you be free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hope so. We hope that she\u2019ll be able to renew the magic and save Vamp City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if she doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>His thumb stroked her cheek. \u201cThose of us trapped are tied to the magic. If the magic dies . . .\u201d He shrugged. But she heard his unsaid words, and they ripped the heart right out of her chest.</p><p>If the sorceress failed to renew the magic, Lukas\u2019s immortal life was over.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>ELIZABETH ACCOMPANIED LUKAS back outside, her hand firmly tucked in his. She was so confused. So confused. For two years, she\u2019d ached, mourned, railed at Lukas for leaving her without a word of explanation. She\u2019d felt humiliated, angry, and sad. At times she\u2019d even wondered if he\u2019d died, and no one had known to contact her.</p><p>Now she\u2019d found him gloriously alive. Or, at least, thoroughly undead. And he claimed he\u2019d never stopped caring about her, that he\u2019d been unable to return to her. That he was trapped and in danger of dying, this time for real.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to think. Worse, she didn\u2019t know what to feel. Her heart sang at his nearness, at his touch, as it always had. And it trembled now with fear that he might once more be ripped from her life, this time for good.</p><p>But, my God, he was a vampire. A bloodsucker who\u2019d fed on her the entire time they\u2019d been dating, then wiped her mind clean of the memory each time. And he\u2019d not only fed on her blood but on the pleasure she\u2019d found in his arms. He\u2019d used her in the most despicable of ways. Yet he claimed he cared. That he\u2019d always cared.</p><p>What on Earth was she supposed to believe?</p><p>\u201cWe have to get you out of here,\u201d he said quietly, as they left the house and started toward the next one on the street. \u201cTell me what you remember. How did you get here?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him, her heart melting a little more at the beauty of his face and the intensity in his eyes. \u201cI was walking to school with Steph. Between one step and the next, right in the middle of P Street, everything changed. Everything went dark. Silent. I heard the sound of horses, then your friends came riding around the corner. And then you,\u201d she added softly.</p><p>His mouth turned grim. \u201cYou came in on the sunbeam. I figured as much. The sunbeams are the places where the real world is breaking through. As the magic crumbles, the real world breaks through more and more often and in more and more places. Every now and then, a human will slide into Vamp City through one of those breaks between the worlds. How, we don\u2019t know. Most can\u2019t. Most pass unaffected through the breaks and never sense them at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But you have to promise me something.\u201d His grip on her hand tightened. \u201cIf I get you out of here, you must never return to the area of D.C. overlaid by Vamp City, or you could walk right back in again through another sunbeam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will I know where that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can give you some directions. Your apartment is safe. It\u2019s just outside. Your school, unfortunately, is just inside. You can\u2019t go back to Adams Middle as long as the worlds are bleeding through this way. Not until the magic is renewed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I . . .\u201d She stopped, swallowing her automatic objection that she had to get back to school. One step at a time. First, she had to get home.</p><p>The rumble of a vehicle engine sounded in the distance, cutting through the unnatural stillness of this world, surprising her. The sound was so . . . anachronistic.</p><p>\u201cYou have cars here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d Lukas stopped at the base of the front steps. At the sound, he\u2019d tensed. \u201cCome on. He changed directions, heading back toward the street. \u201cSUVs are the only ones that can manage what pass for roads in this place. Most of us ride horses.\u201d</p><p>As they started down the street the way they\u2019d come, Elizabeth listened to the approaching vehicle. There were so few sounds in this place. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a single bird,\u201d she mused. \u201cOr heard one. Not even any insects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the sorcerer created Vamp City, he duplicated the physical aspects of D.C., but nothing living conveyed. No plants, no animals. The only creatures here are the ones we\u2019ve brought in. Horses, humans, and a handful of cats and dogs. All foodstuffs and supplies have to be brought in from the real world.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lukas and Elizabeth joined Lukas\u2019s companions as they converged in the middle of the street.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re about to get company,\u201d Lukas said. From the tense looks on the faces of the vampires, she could tell that wasn\u2019t a good thing. \u201cRicky, take Elizabeth and hide in one of the houses. Keep her safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my slave you\u2019re ordering,\u201d Pierced-face commented. His gaze slid to her. \u201cThere will be a price for his services.\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth shuddered before she could stop herself, knowing her fear would only please him. He wanted her blood. Maybe even her body.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not touching her,\u201d Lukas replied evenly. \u201cBut if you want my attention on the fight, and not on guarding what is mine, Ricky must protect her.\u201d</p><p>Pierced-faced watched him, his displeasure evident. But, finally, he nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss payment later.\u201d He turned to the kid with the glowing hair. \u201cTake her and hide in that house,\u201d he said, pointing to the one they stood in front of.</p><p>\u201cYes, master.\u201d Ricky motioned to her with his head and started toward the front steps.</p><p>Lukas stepped in front of her, blocking her view of the other men, hiding his own expression from his companions. \u201cIf you\u2019re in danger, scream. I\u2019ll come.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d Was she really telling a vampire to be careful in a fight? Apparently, she was.</p><p>Lukas\u2019s beautiful eyes crinkled at the corners, warming to the blue of a summer sky. \u201cI will. Now go.\u201d</p><p>He released her and stepped back. But as she hurried past the other two vampires, she felt their gazes following her, thick as tar. They made her skin crawl, both of them. If anything happened to Lukas, she was going to have to run.</p><p>Ricky waited for her in the doorway of the house she and Lukas had already inspected. When she stepped inside, he closed the door and headed for the dimly lit stairs. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a better view from an upper window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch the rotted step,\u201d she warned.</p><p>She followed him up the stairs and to one of the windows looking down on the street below.</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a slave?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I what?\u201d His tone was hard and not particularly nice. \u201cHuman?\u201d He snorted. \u201cYes, I\u2019m human. After a couple of years in this place, the magic turns humans immortal, and our hair starts to glow. They call us Slavas. Once we become a Slava, we can never go home.\u201d His tone was too matter-of-fact. As if he\u2019d long ago gotten over it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. How long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost eighty years.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, her jaw dropped. Eighty years? No wonder he was over it. He\u2019d have nothing, and no one, to go back to.</p><p>As she watched out the window, she saw the vehicle, a black Cadillac Escalade, pull into view, trailed by a cloud of dust. The moment it came to a stop, four males alighted with inhuman speed and grace.</p><p>The one in front curled his lip. \u201cYork scum. This is Gonzaga territory.\u201d</p><p>Pierced-face scoffed. \u201cDoes Cristoff Gonzaga attempt to claim all of the Nod, now? We\u2019re nowhere near Gonzaga lands, and you know it.\u201d</p> <p>The Gonzaga vamp pulled his sword. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re searching for the sorceress, wherever we choose to search is ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if we find her first?\u201d the bearded one, Butch, drawled.</p><p>The Gonzaga vamp scoffed. \u201cAnd what good will she do any of us in your hands? Cristoff is the only one who possesses the ritual to renew the magic. Without it, she\u2019s useless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Pierced-face said.</p><p>A second Gonzaga vampire pulled his sword. \u201cBe on your way, scum. Or would you rather die here?\u201d</p><p>Lukas\u2019s companions drew their swords. Lukas drew two.</p><p>Elizabeth caught her breath, glancing at Ricky. \u201cAre they really going to try to kill one another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. The York and Gonzaga kovenas are enemies.\u201d</p><p>Even as he spoke, the seven vampires all but disappeared, flying at one another so quickly that she lost sight of them. Four against three. Only Lukas took on two opponents at once, swinging his swords in an incredible display of strength and dexterity. She\u2019d often thought he should have been a Viking. Now she wondered if he\u2019d actually been one. Her fingers gripped the window frame, her breath turning unsteady. Watching him fight was at once terrifying and thrilling.</p><p>Lukas, dammit, you\u2019d better not die.</p><p>\u201cIf this battle turns against us, I suggest you run,\u201d Ricky said beside her.</p><p>If Lukas and his friends died. \u201cDo you think the other vamps will find us up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf any of them are fear-feeders, I guarantee they will.\u201d</p><p>The thought chilled. \u201cWhere would I run to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He made a sound of amusement as if it was all a joke. A sick one, but a joke. \u201cThere\u2019s no escaping this place. Once you\u2019re brought to Vamp City, you\u2019re here for life. For most people, that\u2019s not very long. For a few of us, it\u2019s very long indeed. Just run. Maybe you\u2019ll get lucky. The very last place you want to be taken is to Cristoff Gonzaga\u2019s castle. He\u2019s a pain-feeder of the worst kind.\u201d</p><p>As her gaze remained glued on Lukas\u2019s faster-than-lightning moves, a yell turned her attention briefly to the other two battles. She watched as Pierced-face\u2019s head rolled from his body and hit the dirt with a thud.</p><p>Elizabeth gasped, clutching the window frame.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell,\u201d Ricky muttered. \u201cHe was my master. Sorry, chickadee, you\u2019re on your own. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d Without a backward glance, he darted out of the room. Escaping.</p><p>For one pregnant moment, Elizabeth wondered if she should follow him. But, no. Not as long as Lukas was still alive.</p><p>Her pulse racing with fear for Lukas as much as herself, she turned back to the window just as a second head rolled, this one belonging to one of Lukas\u2019s opponents. The battle was now three against two, but Lukas once more battled two at once. How long could he keep that up?</p><p>In the street, the remains of the two dead vampires exploded suddenly, one after the other, raining down around the fighting vamps like ash, leaving nothing visible behind. And then a third head rolled as Butch took down his opponent, at last, leaving only Lukas fighting two Gonzaga vamps.</p><p>Elizabeth expected Butch to go help Lukas. Instead, he disappeared.</p><p>Had he run? The coward!</p><p>But a moment later, she knew exactly where he\u2019d gone when she felt a strong, unwelcome arm grab her from behind and yank her away from the window, that bushy beard scraping against her temple.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she cried. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you helping him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine. And I\u2019m hungry.\u201d He struck, his fangs impaling her neck like two red-hot spikes.</p><p>Elizabeth screamed.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>ELIZABETH GASPED, STRUGGLING against the vampire\u2019s iron hold, moaning with a pain far worse than any she\u2019d ever known. Her vision began to waver, her stomach started to roll. Lifting her foot, she drove her heel back into her attacker\u2019s knee, but he didn\u2019t even grunt. With her arms pinned to her sides, she was helpless. And he was draining her blood!</p><p>God, so much pain. Tears ran down her cheeks, tears of agony, of fury, and of frustration that she couldn\u2019t do a thing to stop him.</p><p>\u201cLukas.\u201d She tried to scream his name, but the word came out as little more than a gasp, her vocal cords all but immobilized.</p><p>The vampire released her suddenly with a furious growl, the fire in her neck increasing tenfold as she felt her flesh rip. She cried out, stumbled forward, then turned to find not one vampire but two in the room with her. The one who\u2019d bitten her. And Lukas.</p><p>She sank back against the window with relief.</p><p>Lukas looked like a berserker of old as he stared at his companion, his eyes burning with rage, the sword at his side dripping with blood.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted a taste.\u201d Butch lifted his hands like a kid caught swiping a cookie off a classmate\u2019s lunch tray.</p><p>Lukas blurred. His sword whistled. A second later, the bearded one\u2019s head rolled with a thud to the floor.</p><p>Elizabeth\u2019s legs gave way, and she slid down the window until she was crouched low, shaking, a warm stream of blood running down her throat.</p><p>Lukas whirled toward her. His eyes dark with concern, he started forward, wiping off his sword and sheathing it.</p><p>But she shook her head. \u201cStay back.\u201d The words were but a whisper. She was so cold. Still in so much pain.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in shock, sweetheart.\u201d He reached for her slowly, his voice low and soothing. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you. You know I won\u2019t hurt you, Lizzy-mine, but I have to do something before you lose too much blood.\u201d</p><p>She started to list sideways, and he caught her, sweeping her into his arms and pulling her tight against the hard body that she\u2019d once known so well. The smell of battle clung to him, but beneath it was the familiar and beloved scent of Lukas, and she sank against him, curling her arm around his neck.</p><p>She held on tight as he carried her downstairs and laid her on the leather sofa. As she looked up at him, he stroked the hair back from her face with a featherlight touch, his eyes pained.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d he murmured, sinking to his knees on the floor beside her. \u201cI promise, sweetheart.\u201d Then he dipped his head to her bleeding neck.</p><p>\u201cLukas?\u201d She stiffened, tried to push him away, but like the other vampire, he was impossible to move.</p><p>She went rigid in anticipation of more pain, but she felt only the tickle of his soft hair against her jaw and a featherlight brush of lips. And then the strange sensation of tugging, of pulling. Had he bitten her? She\u2019d felt no hot, stabbing spikes this time. No stabbing at all.</p><p>Little by little, the pain began to lessen, then ebb. With the realization that Lukas had bitten her without hurting her, as he\u2019d promised, the tension began to leave her body, only to be replaced, moments later, by a tension of another kind.</p><p>An erotic, intense, pleasure began to build low inside her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she gasped, her voice normal once more.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, and how could he when his mouth was fastened to her neck? But his hand lifted to stroke her hair, his touch calming her, as his bite stole the last of the pain and filled her only with a pleasure that made her gasp, that made her body hot and restless.</p><p>\u201cLukas, stop.\u201d She tugged at his head. \u201cPlease stop.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, he did, lifting his head, looking at her behind a monster\u2019s mask. His pupils had turned stark white, his incisors had lengthened and thickened and sharpened to fine points. And they were covered in blood. Her blood.</p><p>She stared at him in horror. He closed his eyes and turned away. Lifting her hand, she felt the stickiness along her neck, but her fingers encountered only sores, not the open flesh wounds she knew should be there.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d she asked quietly, this time reaching for him, touching his jaw.</p><p>He turned back to her, his eyes once more normal, but guarded. Sad. His mouth was closed, his fangs no longer visible, if they were still elongated at all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve initiated your healing,\u201d he said simply, and she saw that his fangs were about half the size they\u2019d been before. \u201cVampire saliva contains healing properties that rush into your bloodstream with my bite.\u201d</p><p>Pressing her hand against his cool cheek, she shuddered. \u201cThank you for saving me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes warmed slowly, his mouth softening to something close to a smile. \u201cYou mean the world to me, Lizzy. I hate that you were brought here. This is no place for you.\u201d Pulling her close, he pressed his cheek to her hair. \u201cBut I\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d His words were filled with such pain, such a depth of longing, mirroring the misery she\u2019d lived with these past two years.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter what he was or how he fed. He was her Lukas.</p><p>Snaking her arms around his neck, she buried her face against him. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too. I thought . . .\u201d</p><p>Her voice cracked, and he pulled her tighter, stroking her hair. \u201cYou thought I\u2019d left you. That I\u2019d walked away. Never, Lizzy-mine. Never.\u201d Slowly, he pulled back until she could see his face. He ran his thumb along her cheekbone. \u201cIf there had been any way to return to you, I would have.\u201d</p><p>The depth of emotion in his eyes rocked her, filling her heart until she thought it might overflow. \u201cI believe you. Deep inside, I could never accept that you\u2019d intentionally left me without even saying good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d His cool palm stroked her cheek. \u201cA hundred times I thought about sending word to you. But I could think of no logical reason for my staying away without telling you a truth that would be impossible for you to believe. All along, we\u2019ve held out hope for a sorcerer or sorceress who would save us. I told myself that once I was free, once I knew my life would not end here, I\u2019d find you and try to make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cHow could you get word to me if you\u2019re trapped here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all vampires are trapped within Vamp City. Some can still come and go as they please. I have a friend, Micah, whom I would have trusted to give you a message. He\u2019s the only one I trust to get you safely out of here if I can get word to him.\u201d He kissed her softly, passionately, then pulled back, his eyes shining with so much emotion, the same emotion that pulsed inside her.</p><p>\u201cI want you safe, Lizzy-mine. I love you,\u201d he said tenderly, his eyes aglow. The words she\u2019d waited so long to hear.</p><p>Tears sprang to her own eyes. \u201cI love you, too, Lukas. I have almost from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again. \u201cI know,\u201d he whispered against her lips. \u201cThe way you used to light up when you saw me warmed me in a way nothing and no one has in centuries. I tried to harden my heart against your sweetness, not wanting you to know of my world or the sordidness of it. But I failed, Lizzy. I failed within days of meeting you and fell head over heels in love with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tears began to leak out of the corners of her eyes, her chest so full she thought it would burst. She buried her fingers in his hair, pulled his mouth back to hers, and kissed him deeply, drowning in his taste, in his scent, in the sheer joy of his love.</p><p>Her hands slid down to his massive shoulders, to the hard muscle that played along their sculpted breadth. \u201cI want to touch you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back, a smile playing at his mouth, then sat up and pulled the black shirt over his head, revealing the most beautiful male chest ever made. As her fingers found his abs and began an upward slide, luxuriating in the feel of the hard planes beneath her palms, his own fingers found the buttons of her blouse and began unbuttoning it with slow deliberation, as if he savored every new glimpse of her skin.</p> <p>When he had her shirt undone, he parted it slowly, his gaze intent as he reached for the front clasp of her bra and flicked it open. With cool fingers, he parted the cups, freeing her to his gaze. His eyes feasted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much,\u201d he breathed, reaching for her, claiming her breasts with his fingers, his palms, and, finally, his mouth. Cool lips closed over one taut nipple and he sucked her fully into his mouth making her moan and arch with pleasure. Her hands slid once more into his hair, and she held him close, loving the feel of him in her arms again. Loving him, fangs and all.</p><p>\u201cLukas?\u201d</p><p>He lifted slowly, licking across her nipple, tightening things low inside her body. His gaze flicked up to meet hers. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you bite me, do you ever hurt me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen promise me something. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t enthrall me anymore. Don\u2019t take my memories, again. Not unless I ask you to. Please?\u201d</p><p>He leaned up, kissing her mouth thoroughly before pulling back. His gaze bore into hers. \u201cI promise, Elizabeth. No more secrets between us.\u201d His eyes turned tender, a boyish smile lifting his mouth as his expression took on a look of wonder. \u201cI was so afraid for you to learn the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re a vampire?\u201d</p> <p>He kissed her again. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy thing to overlook.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo, I suppose it\u2019s not.\u201d Lifting a hand, she stroked his beloved cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re still my Lukas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d He turned and kissed her palm.</p><p>\u201cLukas, do you ever . . . ?\u201d Her cheeks began to heat, making him smile. \u201cDo you ever bite me . . . places other than my neck?\u201d</p><p>His eyes warmed, heated. \u201cI haven\u2019t, no, though I\u2019ve wanted to. I wouldn\u2019t engage in that kind of intimacy with you when you weren\u2019t fully aware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you still drank from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I brought us both incredible pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t your bite hurt me, when Butch\u2019s fangs . . .\u201d She shuddered. \u201cThey burned, Lukas. It was horrible.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes darkened. \u201cHe\u2019s . . . he was a pain-feeder. It was his gift to cause pain with his bite. My gift is to offer only pleasure with mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d She smiled shyly. \u201cPerhaps we can take it one step at a time since this is all so new to me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes crinkled at the corners. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it however you wish, Lizzy-mine.\u201d His fingers went to the button of her pants. \u201cBut I need to taste you again, if only with my tongue. Will you let me?\u201d</p><p>Heat rushed through her body. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>As he tugged off her shoes, she shrugged off her shirt and bra, then watched as he slid her pants down over her hips and legs, pulling them off, leaving her in nothing but a pair of silky black panties.</p><p>A growl of need rumbled in his throat, the corners of his mouth lifting as he shot her a look of pure masculine approval. His blue eyes flashing with white heat, he held her gaze as he dipped his head between her legs, then licked her right through the silk. His rough tongue made her arch with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lukas, how I\u2019ve missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>With a low laugh, he slid one finger beneath the edge of her panties, pulling the crotch aside, then laved her bare flesh with his tongue, making her cry out with joy. He was teasing her, playing with her, and, as she watched him, his eyes once more began to turn white where his pupils should be black.</p><p>\u201cWhy are your eyes changing?\u201d</p><p>His lashes swept down.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Lukas. No secrets.\u201d</p><p>He looked up again, worry in that beautiful face. \u201cI\u2019m a pleasure-feeder though no one\u2019s pleasure has ever pleased me more than yours. When I taste it, the need inside of me, the hunger, awakens. And that\u2019s when my eyes change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your fangs lengthen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot always at the same time, but soon, yes.\u201d His expression turned achingly tender. \u201cI will never hurt you, Lizzy. Do you believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Then she gasped again as his hand moved, his finger sliding deep inside her. \u201cOh, yes. Oh, Lukas.\u201d</p><p>Tired of the game, he pulled her panties down and off, then eased her legs apart, eyeing her with a hunger that stole her breath. His face lowered, his mouth kissing her, licking her, sucking at the core of her pleasure until she was rocking against him, gasping, her head thrown back. His hands caressed her hips, her thighs, as the pleasure mounted, as her body tightened, rising, rising.</p><p>The orgasm broke over her, shattering in its brilliance, her body clenching and contracting deep, deep inside in a glorious explosion of joy. And then his mouth was on her abdomen, rising to suckle her breast.</p><p>Her fingers dug into his hair. \u201cInside, Lukas,\u201d she gasped, still riding the aftershocks. \u201cI need you inside me.\u201d</p><p>When he lifted his head, his pupils were still white, his fangs long and sharp, though she\u2019d felt no prick, no pain. But those inhuman eyes gleamed with love, and she wasn\u2019t even the slightest bit afraid.</p><p>\u201cDid you bite my breast?\u201d she asked, curious.</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019ll know when I do.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>Pulling away, he stood beside the sofa, unbuckled his belt, then removed his boots and socks, and pushed his pants down over lean, hard hips, revealing white Jockey shorts that barely held his massive erection.</p><p>Her thighs dampened, a low moan escaping her throat as he pushed down his shorts and that erection sprang free. It was huge, straight, thick, and gorgeous. Oh how she\u2019d missed this man.</p><p>Lowering himself over her, his bare chest brushing the tips of her breasts, he slowly positioned his big body until the tip of him pressed at her slick gates. Resting on his elbows, staring into her eyes, he slid firmly, yet gently inside her.</p><p>His eyes nearly rolled back into his head. Her own almost did the same as the thickness of him stretched her, claimed her, thrilled her.</p><p>Her breath left on a groan as he pulled most of the way out, then slid in again and again, setting up a gradually escalating rhythm until he was pounding into her, and she was thrusting against him, needing him deeper, deeper.</p><p>Fingers in his hair, she watched him, loved him.</p><p>\u201cGive me your neck, Lizzy-mine.\u201d</p><p>His words shivered through her on a thrill of danger, but she didn\u2019t hesitate. The dark thought rose that if she were going to die, this was the way she wanted to go.</p><p>She tipped her head sideways, giving him access, then tensed ever so slightly as his head dipped, as his lips kissed her neck, as his fangs sank into her flesh.</p><p>As he\u2019d promised, she felt no pain at all, just a weird and wonderful sensation of . . . connection. And then his lips closed onto her skin and he sucked, pulled, and she cried out with the incredible erotic pleasure. How she felt it there, she couldn\u2019t begin to guess, but with every pull of his mouth, she felt the tug more strongly between her legs. Again and again he sucked, and she cried out, her body rising, climbing, preparing to shatter all over again.</p><p>He rode the crest with her, driving into her harder and harder, his body straining toward that ultimate release. And, suddenly, they were flying together, soaring, shattering, then floating slowly and blissfully back down to Earth.</p><p>Lukas lifted his head, then managed to roll them over on the sofa until he was on the bottom, and she was lying atop him, cradled in his arms, her head tucked against his chin.</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo. I never imagined anything so wonderful.\u201d As she stroked his chest, she wondered how this male could be real. And how, even if he lived, they could ever have a life together, coming as they did, from such totally different worlds.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>LUKAS STROKED THE warm, silken back of the beauty in his arms, the precious darling of a woman who\u2019d stolen his heart the first time she\u2019d smiled at him. Sweet and beautiful, his Lizzy. Never had he known anyone so full of life, so full of love.</p><p>\u201cYou are mine,\u201d he said quietly, wonder in his voice that she could love him at all, let alone after he\u2019d revealed himself completely\u2014his fangs, his eyes, his need for blood.</p><p>Lifting up, she propped her forearms on his chest and met his gaze, softness glowing in her lovely brown eyes. \u201cAs you\u2019re mine, Lukas Olsson. Since you can\u2019t leave here, neither will I.\u201d</p><p>His heart clutched. \u201cNo, sweetheart.\u201d His hands slid down her back to her buttocks, reveling in the feel of her soft curves, then up again. \u201cYou must go, Lizzy-mine. You aren\u2019t safe here, and I can\u2019t keep you so. Too many vampires within Vamp City have lost hold of their consciences. Too many want only to feed off your fear or your pain. And if I try to protect you and fail, too many will enjoy hurting you just to get at me. I\u2019ve never been a fan of the kovena to which I\u2019ve been forced to pledge allegiance, and many know it.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand, pulled it to his mouth, and kissed it. \u201cSomehow, I will find a way to set you free, then you must go. For me.\u201d</p><p>That stubborn light ignited in her eyes, and as much as he wished it hadn\u2019t\u2014not over this\u2014he loved that she treated him no differently than she ever had, even knowing what he was.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be separated from you again,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>He gripped the back of her head and lifted his own, kissing her. When he pulled back, he found tears in her eyes, and they were almost more than he could bear. \u201cI would give anything to keep you by my side, Lizzy-mine, but my mission is to hunt for the sorceress, to find her before Cristoff Gonzaga\u2019s vamps do. My master\u2019s own liege wishes to control the power, and, at the moment, the sorceress is that power.\u201d</p><p>She nestled against him again, her cheek pressed against his heart. He stroked her hair, his heart melting.</p><p>\u201cVampires don\u2019t sleep, Lizzy. We work day and night, hunt day and night. I haven\u2019t stopped in more than a week. What would I do with you?\u201d His fingers weaved into her silken hair. \u201cI would have to hide you, but then I wouldn\u2019t be able to protect you. And there are far too many here who would do you harm.\u201d</p><p>He placed a kiss against her hair. \u201cYou have to go back to the real world. Then I want you to leave Washington and not come back until I contact you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her head popped back up as she frowned at him. \u201cYou said I needed to stay out of the Vamp City area. Not all of D.C.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But you\u2019d be safest far away from both Washingtons. Outside the Vamp City area, you won\u2019t accidentally walk in through a sunbeam again, but there are still those who hunt humans to sell at the slave auction. You\u2019d be safest away from here.\u201d He held her gaze, willing her to hear the truth of his heart. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear it if anything happened to you, sweetheart. I couldn\u2019t bear it.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze turning pained, she tucked her precious head once more beneath his chin, then plucked gently at his nipple with her fingers, making him smile even as he stifled a groan. His body began to stir all over again, but hers was softening in that way it always did when she was tired and ready for sleep.</p><p>\u201cYou have to come back to me, Lukas,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>He kissed her hair. \u201cThat is my only life\u2019s goal, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Her hand stilled, tucking beneath her chin. Peace enveloped him, a peace he\u2019d never known in Vamp City. A peace woven with steely resolve to keep her safe.</p><p>Love pulsed inside him as he held her, stroking her back, listening to her precious heartbeat. If it was the last gift he gave her, if it was the last good thing he did in this too-long life of his, he would see this woman safely out of Vamp City once and for all.</p><p>Even if he could never follow.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>SEVERAL HOURS LATER, Elizabeth rode nestled against Lukas\u2019s chest through a dimly lit forest on their way to meet someone. A vampire named Arturo. Lukas\u2019s arm curled around her waist, his thumb gently stroking the underside of her breast. The ride itself wasn\u2019t particularly comfortable, but there was no place she\u2019d rather be than here, with Lukas. The thought of saying good-bye to him again filled her with an aching misery.</p><p>Forcing her mind on other things, she studied the twisted, gnarled trunks of the trees all around them, trees totally lacking in foliage despite the fact that it was only early September.</p><p>\u201cThe trees look dead,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cThey are dead. They grow that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic, dearest,\u201d he said, giving her waist a gentle squeeze.</p><p>Magic. The evidence of it continually boggled her mind. And yet this world\u2019s very existence was the greatest evidence that it did. She was glad to be getting the opportunity to see a little more of Vamp City before she left. Assuming Lukas could really get her out of here. As badly as she didn\u2019t want to leave him, neither did she want to make his existence an ordeal, as she could if he were forced to constantly try to hide her. He needed to be able to concentrate on finding the sorceress who would save him so that he could come back to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A couple of hours ago, they\u2019d left Georgetown, stopping at a small house in Foggy Bottom that, for a change, had been occupied. Lukas had bought a small loaf of freshly baked bread and . . . of all things . . . a cold can of root beer from the owner. Then he\u2019d given the man a hefty amount of cash to deliver a message.</p><p>Afterward, they\u2019d headed back toward Georgetown, this time riding down to the Potomac, where they\u2019d dismounted and wandered around the fascinating ruins of the nineteenth-century waterfront while she devoured the bread and washed it down with the root beer. Mounting again, they\u2019d headed into the woods just north of Georgetown, where they\u2019d been watching . . . and waiting . . . ever since.</p><p>Arturo was apparently a friend of Micah\u2019s, the vampire Lukas trusted to help her. Unfortunately, Arturo lived somewhere Lukas couldn\u2019t take her. And without cell phones, hand-carried messages were the only form of communication, as unreliable as they might be. Arturo might never show up. For all she knew, they might have to wait for him for days.</p> <p>\u201cDo you hear that?\u201d Lukas asked.</p><p>The sound of a vehicle, a Jeep, if she wasn\u2019t mistaken, carried faintly on the breeze. \u201cIs that him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d He lifted her onto the horse and mounted behind her but stayed within the questionable shelter of the trees.</p><p>Down one of the streets, Elizabeth caught a glimpse of what looked like a Jeep Wrangler. Moments later, it came fully into view. Yellow, she thought, though it was impossible to tell for sure with so little light.</p><p>As the Jeep came to a stop, Lukas urged the horse forward.</p> <p>The driver cut the engine and alighted, walking toward them with long, confident strides. He had the look of the Mediterranean\u2014his hair and eyes dark. With a name like Arturo, he was certainly Italian.</p><p>\u201cLukas,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cArturo. Thanks for coming.\u201d</p><p>Arturo dipped his head. \u201cYou claimed it was urgent?\u201d</p><p>Lukas tensed slightly. \u201cI need to get a message to Micah. I\u2019m in need of his assistance.\u201d</p><p>Arturo looked at him for a long moment, then began to smile. \u201cWhat is this about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForgive me, Arturo, but you are one of Cristoff Gonzaga\u2019s most trusted. The favor I would ask of Micah is a task I can only entrust to one I\u2019ve worked with many, many times.\u201d</p><p>Arturo watched him for several moments more, then dipped his head, as if conceding the point. \u201cWhat do you want Micah to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need him to meet me at the Boundary Circle. As soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Arturo\u2019s gaze flicked to her, his eyes narrowing in speculation. \u201cI see.\u201d Slowly, he nodded. \u201cBe at the Rock Creek entrance at midnight. Micah will be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d With that, Lukas turned the horse and headed back into the dead woods.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Gonzaga,\u201d Elizabeth said with disbelief. \u201cAnd you trust him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, no. But I do trust Micah, who is also Gonzaga. Arturo\u2019s the only one who might be able to get word to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this could all go south.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt could, yes. But Micah\u2019s our one chance.\u201d</p><p>And if Arturo didn\u2019t come through? What if he betrayed Lukas and sent more Gonzaga vampires to kill him, instead?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this plan,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Lukas kissed her hair. \u201cIt\u2019ll work. It has to work.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth sighed. The thought of going with any vampire who wasn\u2019t Lukas made her queasy. But apparently only a vampire could set her free. And Micah was the one Lukas trusted.</p><p>Her bigger fear was that in his determination to see her safe, Lukas was risking his own life. And that scared her most of all.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cIT\u2019S GETTING DARKER.\u201d Elizabeth peered into the woods around her, barely able to see the shapes any longer. \u201cEither that, or my eyesight\u2019s going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight is upon us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll really be in the dark.\u201d</p><p>Lukas pressed a kiss to her hair, his arm around her as they rode the horse. \u201cOnce the moon rises, you\u2019ll be able to see. For now, though, I\u2019m taking you someplace where I can get you a decent meal and a soft, warm bed with clean linens. You need some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you just described Heaven. And where is this miraculous place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the Cleveland Park area. Though in V.C., it\u2019s still country. The house is owned by a couple of vampire friends of mine, neither of whom are likely home. Their Slavas will feed us and give us a room where we can pass the evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trust them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Both vampires and Slavas. Unfortunately, they\u2019re all as stuck in this place as I am.\u201d</p><p>Through the trees, Elizabeth thought she saw lights. Soon, a house became visible through the night\u2019s shadows, an old-style two-story farmhouse with a wide, wraparound porch. The flicker of candlelight or hearth flames were visible through several of the windows.</p><p>Pulling up in front, Lukas dismounted and tied up the horse, then he swung Elizabeth down and led her up the steps to the shadowy porch. He rapped on the front door, and, several moments later, a woman appeared.</p><p>\u201cLukas, welcome!\u201d An attractive woman of perhaps forty stepped back and let them in. \u201cThe masters are out. What can I do for you?\u201d Her hair, while blond, glowed with that same shimmery shine that Ricky\u2019s had.</p><p>Lukas smiled at the woman fondly even as he curled his arm around Elizabeth\u2019s shoulders and pulled her close. \u201cCyn, this is Elizabeth. She\u2019s newly arrived to V.C., human, hungry, and in need of a soft bed for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Elizabeth.\u201d Cyn\u2019s expression turned sad and sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you got caught here.\u201d Her gaze swung back to Lukas. \u201cWould you like her to eat with me, or shall I bring a tray to her room?\u201d Her knowing look said she knew exactly what Lukas was about.</p><p>\u201cA tray to her room would be preferable.\u201d</p><p>Cyn smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the back room to the left of the stairs. It\u2019s the only one ready for company.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth looked around with interest. The house was actually very nicely furnished if a bit old-fashioned\u2014150 years old-fashioned. The living room sported a wide, blazing hearth with a beautifully carved mantel, a velvet sofa, and a couple of chairs. A writing desk sat against one wall, and against the other . . .</p><p>Elizabeth laughed. \u201cA foosball table?\u201d</p><p>Lukas snorted. \u201cYou haven\u2019t time-traveled, woman though it might feel that way.\u201d</p><p>Cyn chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that. The majority of the vamps in this city haven\u2019t left in decades. Some not since 1870. There aren\u2019t that many of you who feel comfortable in the twenty-first century, Lukas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on upstairs,\u201d Cyn said cheerily. \u201cI\u2019ll bring your tray. One meal or two, Lukas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one.\u201d</p><p>Cyn\u2019s smile turned knowing again, and she turned away.</p><p>As Lukas led her up the stairs, Elizabeth eyed him curiously. \u201cI didn\u2019t think to offer you some of my bread earlier. But you eat food, don\u2019t you? Of course you do. When we were dating, I was always feeding you, or you were taking me out to dinner.\u201d She looked at him with confusion. \u201cI thought vampires only drank blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need food to survive, but I\u2019ve always enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not hungry?\u201d</p><p>He took the hand he held, lifting her wrist to his mouth and slid his tongue along the veins there. \u201cNot for food,\u201d he said huskily.</p><p>Elizabeth shivered. And not from fear.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll eat first,\u201d he murmured, placing a kiss on her sensitive wrist before lowering her hand. \u201cThen we\u2019ll see to . . . my appetites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to realize just how much I don\u2019t know about you.\u201d</p><p>As they reached the top of the stairs, he turned left toward an open doorway. \u201cWhat would you like to know?\u201d</p><p>A hundred things. A thousand. \u201cWhere are you from? When were you turned?\u201d</p><p>He ushered her into a small, if neatly furnished, room that looked as if it could have been modeled after one in her great-grandmother\u2019s house. A double-spindled bed sat in the middle of the room covered in a colorful, patchwork quilt. Small throw rugs lay scattered across the hardwood floors, while calico valances hung atop windows that appeared . . .</p><p>\u201cAre the windows painted?\u201d she asked in surprise.</p><p>\u201cThey are. Many have taken to painting the windows black or boarding them up in case a sunbeam breaks through outside.\u201d</p><p>She sat on the bed. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow, a smile hovering at the corners of his mouth as he sat beside her. \u201cSo . . . what?\u201d</p><p>She broke into a full smile. \u201cAre you avoiding telling me how old you are?\u201d The funny look he gave her made her laugh, and she nudged him with her shoulder. \u201cGive it up, old man. No secrets, remember?\u201d</p><p>With a pained sigh, he took her hand and started playing with her fingers. \u201cI was born in Sweden. The best I can figure, since we didn\u2019t keep track of time the way people did in the Roman lands, it was around the tenth century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA.D.?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He scowled at her. \u201cYes, A.D. I\u2019m not that old.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him. \u201cYou\u2019re . . .\u201d The breath escaped her lungs on a whoosh. \u201cYou\u2019re a thousand years old. More.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought you were close to my age. Were you a Viking? I\u2019ve always thought you\u2019d have made a wonderful Viking.\u201d</p><p>He curled his arm around her neck and pulled her close. \u201cSorry, baby. I was only a hunter, my tribe nomadic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had many wives?\u201d she asked quietly, not really wanting to know. Of course he had. A thousand years.</p><p>\u201cA few. Not many. None in the past few centuries. Vampires make lousy wives\u2014I\u2019d never take one as my mate\u2014and wedding a human is complicated and difficult, requiring tremendous amounts of subterfuge. And they die,\u201d he added quietly, the pain in those last three words radiating out, sucking the laughter out of the room. He rested his cheek against her hair.</p><p>The impossibility of their sharing a future hit her fully for the first time. She would age, grow old, and die. And, assuming Vamp City was saved, he never would. They\u2019d have two or three decades together before she started looking like his mother. Unless . . .</p><p>\u201cYou could turn me.\u201d The words were out of her mouth before she even gave them any thought.</p><p>Lukas straightened, turning her to face him, his hands firm on her shoulders, his eyes suddenly deathly serious. \u201cI love you, Elizabeth Bryant. More than I\u2019ve ever loved another.\u201d She heard the great big but hanging like a noose at the end of his words.</p><p>\u201cLukas . . .\u201d she said miserably. \u201cI wasn\u2019t serious.\u201d The last thing she wanted was to force him to try to explain that while he might have feelings for her now, they wouldn\u2019t last.</p><p>He gripped her chin. \u201cI\u2019m serious, Lizzy. I have loved before, don\u2019t get me wrong. Or I thought I had. But with you . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWith you, it\u2019s different. It\u2019s as if I\u2019ve always known you. It\u2019s as if you were made just for me. There is nothing I want more than to keep you close to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . I heard the but, Lukas. You can say it.\u201d</p><p>His mouth softened. \u201cSweetheart, there is no but concerning my love for you. The problem is, turning a human is extremely dangerous. Most don\u2019t survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd for some reason, the women who do survive often lose their souls in the process. Or they act like they have.\u201d He gripped her face in both hands, tipping his forehead against hers. \u201cIf I were to try to turn you, I would lose you, Lizzy-mine. Either in death, or by turning you into a woman incapable of love. I would kill the you I love, either way, and I can\u2019t do that to you, or to the people who love you. Or to me.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back to where he could see her clearly, his hands still cupping her face. \u201cI\u2019d rather know that you\u2019re living your life as you should be than to know I destroyed the most beautiful soul I\u2019ve ever encountered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you share my life with me? At least until I start to get too old?\u201d</p><p>His expression turned pained, and yet unbearably tender. \u201cI can\u2019t give you children, Lizzy. I can\u2019t go near sunlight, not even daylight. That means no picnics, no trips to the beach, no running errands together, or going out to lunch. You\u2019ve seen the kind of life I have to give you. You lived it for eight months, seeing me only at night. That will never change and it will never be enough.\u201d</p><p>She stared into those sad, beloved eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cWithout you, my heart stops singing. My soul goes silent. My world is more colorless than Vamp City. I would rather live my days alone than my life alone, Lukas. I know I\u2019ll turn old someday. Just give me the years you can, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you truly want me, I will give you all the years of your life, Lizzy-mine. Without you, my life is meaningless.\u201d</p><p>Cyn\u2019s footsteps sounded on the wood stairs. Lukas kissed Elizabeth softly, then rose and met Cyn at the bedroom door, taking the tray from her.</p><p>Elizabeth joined him, and Cyn smiled at her. \u201cIf you\u2019re still hungry when you\u2019re done with this, I\u2019m happy to fix you something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Cyn.\u201d</p><p>Lukas set the tray on the desk and pulled out the chair for Elizabeth. Cyn had prepared a large bowl of hot beef stew with carrots and potatoes, blueberry muffins, and a small pot of butter. A pitcher of cold water completed the meal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook good?\u201d Lukas asked, relaxing back against the wall.</p><p>\u201cIt looks delicious.\u201d She devoured the meal in no time, and when she was done, Lukas pulled out her chair for her, turned her to face him, and began undressing her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my turn to feast,\u201d he said huskily.</p> <p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>ELIZABETH REACHED FOR Lukas as he reached for her, each unbuttoning the other\u2019s shirt, pulling it from the waistband, pushing it off the other\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThe door,\u201d Elizabeth said on a laugh.</p><p>Lukas pressed a hot, lingering kiss to her bare shoulder, then moved away to shut the door. On his way back to her, he pulled his arms out of his sleeves and tossed the shirt on the back of the desk chair. She did the same with hers, and they came together, chest to chest, his arms curling around her waist, hers around his neck, as their mouths found one another\u2019s, tasting, licking, stroking.</p><p>The kiss turned hot, his taste nectar, the feel of his cool, hard body, like Heaven. He smelled of winter nights and warm fires, and never, never did she want to be parted from this man. How was she ever going to return to being alone?</p> <p>Lukas pulled back, his gaze soft and sad, as if he\u2019d felt the change in her mood, as if he shared it. \u201cWe\u2019ll be together again, Lizzy-mine. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t promise that. You have no idea what will happen.\u201d</p><p>He swept her into his arms and deposited her on the bed, following her down, lying halfway over her, his face inches from her own. In the glow of the lamplight, his eyes gleamed with soft blue fire.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m going to willfully ignore that fact for now. I\u2019m going to believe that nothing will keep us apart. I\u2019m going to love you tonight. And in a few weeks, after the equinox, after the sorceress has renewed the magic of Vamp City and those of us trapped are free to leave again, I\u2019ll come to you and crawl into your bed, and I will love you again. For the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hands, framing his beloved face. \u201cI\u2019m going to hold you to that.\u201d Her fingers slid up into his hair. \u201cNow love me, my vampire. I need you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled the sweetest, sexiest of smiles and dipped his head to her neck, licking and kissing his way slowly up her throat while his hand slid down her chest, cupping one breast, then the other, caressing, tweaking, then moving down, his palm sliding over her abdomen to the waistband of her pants.</p> <p>And all the while, he rained kisses over her jaw, her cheek, her forehead, her nose.</p><p>\u201cLukas,\u201d she sighed, stroking his shoulders, his neck. The play of muscles beneath her hands delighted her.</p><p>His fingers, deft as ever, unbuttoned her pants, unzipped the short fly, then burrowed beneath the waistband of her panties, sliding down into her dampness, into her body.</p><p>With a gasp, she arched into his touch, driving his finger deeper. \u201cLukas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome for me, baby,\u201d he whispered against her temple, as his finger stroked in and out, his thumb flicking her clitoris. \u201cCome for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me, Lukas. It felt so good.\u201d</p><p>He rose over her slowly, his gaze catching hers, his eyes already white-centered, his fangs elongating as she watched. And all she felt at the sight was a thrill of excitement and anticipation.</p><p>Tipping her head to the side, she gave him access to her throat. His eyes crinkling at the corners, he dipped his head, kissed her neck, and sank his fangs into her flesh. As he took the first pull, she cried out at the pleasure, shocked by the orgasm that was already beginning to build low inside her. As his finger moved in and out, his thumb working its magic, his mouth pulling at her neck, she exploded in a fiery shudder of intense, wonderful, pleasure.</p> <p>As she floated back to Earth, Lukas removed the rest of her clothes and his own. Opening her arms and her thighs, she welcomed him to her.</p><p>\u201cLove me, Lukas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways, Lizzy-mine.\u201d Then he slid into her body, and she rose to meet him as they came together, one, driving each other up, gasping and straining and loving, until release broke over them in a brilliant fragmenting, a blinding blaze of ecstasy, a rapture beyond comprehension.</p><p>Finally, they lay together in a tangle of sheets and limbs, exhausted, replete, and thoroughly loved. Tucked tight against Lukas\u2019s chest, Elizabeth drifted toward sleep.</p><p>This was the only place in the world that she wanted to be. And it was the one place she couldn\u2019t stay.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>ELIZABETH WOKE TO the stroke of cool fingers along her cheek, followed by a soft, sweet kiss.</p><p>\u201cWake up, Lizzy-mine. It\u2019s time to go.\u201d</p><p>She rose groggily, and dressed, Lukas helping her. He was already fully clothed and wide-awake. Then again, by his own admission, he never slept.</p><p>\u201cWill it take long to get there?\u201d she asked, putting on her shoes.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not usually.\u201d But his tone held a grim note she didn\u2019t like.</p><p>\u201cWhat aren\u2019t you saying?\u201d</p><p>His jaw tensed, but he met her gaze. \u201cThere are dangers in Vamp City. As you\u2019ve seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the place we\u2019re going is dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery place is potentially dangerous. Less so nearest the outer boundary of the city, but in recent weeks, wolves have been spotted even there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWolves? I thought there were no animals in Vamp City that you didn\u2019t bring in.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cWerewolves.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped. \u201cOh, that doesn\u2019t sound good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>When she was fully dressed, he ushered her downstairs and out the back door. Cyn was nowhere to be seen, but given that it was midnight, she was probably in bed.</p><p>Lukas lifted Elizabeth onto the horse, swung up behind her, then headed out across the open ground to the trees beyond. The night was dark, but the moon was bright and illuminated the landscape nicely, turning the dead trees white.</p><p>They rode in silence for a time, the knowledge that they were about to part again thick between them.</p><p>\u201cLizzy, I have money,\u201d Lukas said out of the blue.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a random comment, woman. I\u2019m telling you I can support you since you can\u2019t return to your school. And with extra money, you can afford to leave. Fly to Hawaii or something. Get out of D.C., sweetheart, please? Just get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents moved to Florida a few years ago. I can go visit them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Then later, if I don\u2019t get out . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>But he continued. \u201cOver the centuries, I\u2019ve accumulated far more wealth than I could spend in a dozen human lifetimes. And if I can\u2019t use it, it\u2019s yours, sweetheart. Micah can access it and give you all you need. All you will ever need.\u201d</p><p>Money, more than she could ever spend. The thought offered her a measure of comfort but little more. Because without Lukas, she would have nothing that mattered.</p><p>\u201cIf I need money, I\u2019ll let Micah know.\u201d</p><p>Lukas released a less-than-happy breath. \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>They continued in silence, Lukas\u2019s arm tight around her waist, his breath teasing her hair. Finally, he said, \u201cThe Boundary Circle is just ahead.\u201d</p><p>Oddly, the moonlight only extended another thirty or forty yards, then darkness enveloped the land.</p><p>\u201cThe shadows? Is that where the world ends? This world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They\u2019re not shadows. It\u2019s a wall of magic. Until two years ago, I could walk right through it and find myself in the real world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had to be careful to do that only at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be right about that.\u201d His arm tightened across her middle, his body turning suddenly rigid.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cWe have company. And I don\u2019t mean Micah.\u201d</p><p>She looked right and saw nothing, but when she glanced left, she saw them. Three massive, hulking beasts stalking them like prey. Wolves.</p><p>Werewolves.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>ELIZABETH STARED AT the hulking werewolves, her heart beginning to pound. As she watched, one of them began to slowly change shape. Moments later, where the wolf had been, now stood a large, very naked man. With his hair long and unkempt, his beard full and scraggly, she suspected he didn\u2019t spend much time human.</p><p>\u201cGive us the woman, and we\u2019ll let you pass, vampire.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth\u2019s heart stuttered.</p><p>\u201cYou come near us, and I\u2019ll kill you, wolf,\u201d Lukas countered. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can try,\u201d the werewolf said grimly. \u201cBut we\u2019re hungry. And we will eat tonight.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth\u2019s mind seized. \u201cEat? They eat people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen they\u2019re starving, they\u2019ll eat anything that moves. Hold on to the reins, Lizzy.\u201d He thrust them into her hands.</p><p>\u201cLukas, I don\u2019t ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. I\u2019m staying right here, but I need room to swing my swords. Just hold the reins, lean forward, and hug the horse tight. And whatever you do, keep your head down.\u201d</p><p>As she walked her hands forward up the horse\u2019s maned neck, Lukas gripped her waist until she was fully prone. She did as he said, clutched the reins and hugged the horse tight, its coarse mane scratching her cheek and tickling her nose. The horsey smell overpowered her senses.</p><p>Her stomach churned with fear.</p><p>Behind her, she heard the metallic swoosh of Lukas\u2019s swords breaking free of their scabbards. Out of the corner of her eye she caught the gleam of a blade rising high, ready to cut down the nearest foe.</p><p>A moment later, one of the wolves leaped. As the horse shied, Elizabeth gasped and tightened her grip. \u201cEasy, horse. Easy boy. Or girl. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Another flash of gleaming silver, another whistle of steel as Lukas swung, catching the beast in the face, knocking it back. But while the wolf whined and growled, it only lunged again.</p><p>Over her head, Lukas\u2019s blades sang, whipping back and forth faster than her eye could track. Vampire fast. She heard a beast\u2019s howl of pain, another\u2019s growl of fury. Yet still they attacked. And, somehow, Lukas managed to keep his horse from bolting.</p><p>Over and over, the blades whistled. Her muscles tensed, quivering, as she half expected, at any moment, to feel teeth sinking into her flesh. It was terrible being able to see only one direction, not knowing if she was about to be attacked from the other. But Lukas continued to fight them, and all she could do was hold on to the horse and trust Lukas to keep her safe.</p><p>\u201cHere, Fido!\u201d a male voice called from a short distance away.</p><p>A hand landed lightly on Elizabeth\u2019s back, and she jumped.</p><p>\u201cStay on the animal,\u201d Lukas said behind her. \u201cBut you can sit up. You\u2019re safe now.\u201d</p><p>She felt him dismount. Her pulse still racing, Elizabeth rose slowly, finally able to rub her nose and scratch the itch. As she gazed around warily, she saw one wolf lying dead on the ground nearby. The other two were still fighting, leaping at Lukas and another man, the one who\u2019d made the Fido quip, she assumed. A male Lukas clearly trusted. Micah?</p><p>A wolf leaped at Lukas, jaws open wide as if it meant to bite off Lukas\u2019s head. Her breath caught as she watched her vampire strike as if in slow motion, his blades swinging as one. In fascinated horror, she watched as that furred head flew up into the air, separated from its body.</p><p>Lukas turned toward the other vampire just as the third werewolf, too, lost its head.</p><p>A moment later, Lukas was at her side, his eyes full of concern. \u201cYou\u2019re unhurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her and pulled her down, then pulled her purse out of his saddlebag and handed it to her. Once she\u2019d slung it over her shoulder, he pulled her against his side and led her to the stranger.</p><p>\u201cThis is Micah,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Micah was a big man, though not as big as Lukas. He was nice enough looking except for the scar on his cheek, but his eyes were kind, if a bit surprised.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth wandered in on a sunbeam,\u201d Lukas told him. \u201cFortunately, I was nearby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her home.\u201d</p><p>Lukas nodded. \u201cI owe you, Micah. Show her the boundary, if you would, so she can steer clear of it until this is over. And transfer a healthy chunk of my funds into her account. If the sorceress is not found, transfer all of it.\u201d</p><p>Micah didn\u2019t seem the least bit surprised by the directive.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Lukas,\u201d she said quietly. He certainly didn\u2019t need to give her his money, but he clearly intended to do it anyway. And she\u2019d be lying if she said she wasn\u2019t grateful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you two a few minutes to say good-bye, then we\u2019ll leave.\u201d Micah smiled at her, his eyes soft with sympathy.</p><p>This was it, the moment she\u2019d been dreading. Turning to Lukas, she felt as if her heart were being ripped from her chest all over again. Their gazes collided, misery thick between them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He cupped her face with one hand, his eyes wells of pain. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go. But I want you safe.\u201d Holding her face in both hands, he pressed his forehead to hers. \u201cIf I don\u2019t come back, live for me, Lizzy. You are my heart, the only heart that has beat firmly and fully in my chest for more than a thousand years.\u201d</p><p>Tears began to run down her cheeks. \u201cI love you, Lukas Olsson.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms and kissed her soundly, thoroughly, stroking her hair, her back, her head, as she drank of his cool winter taste and immersed herself in his strength, his scent, the feel of his arms around her.</p><p>When he finally pulled away, she stroked the hair at the nape of his neck. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live without you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNor I you, my love. Nor I you. I love you, Lizzy-mine.\u201d He kissed her softly, sweetly.</p><p>\u201cCome back to me, my Lukas.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, but made no promises.</p> <p>Finally, pulling her against his side, he led her to where Micah waited. Micah held out his hand to her, and Lukas let her go. Elizabeth shuddered with the need to cling to him. Instead, she slid free of his hold, turning to meet his gaze one last time.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered back, a gleam of moisture in his eyes.</p><p>Turning away, she placed her hand in Micah\u2019s. The vampire led her forward three steps, four, five. Her skin felt queer, trembly. And suddenly noise and light exploded all around her.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d someone growled, and Micah pulled her out of the way of a couple of youths they\u2019d nearly run into.</p> <p>She looked around, the sounds of the normal world a shock. Welcome, and yet . . .</p><p>\u201cElizabeth.\u201d Micah tugged on her hand, and she followed him to a black sedan parked nearby. He handed her into the passenger side before sliding into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cDo you think the sorceress will be found?\u201d she asked, as he pulled into traffic.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be found. I\u2019m certain of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I hope you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her, his expression rueful. \u201cUnfortunately, the sorceress has very little magic. Her name is Quinn Lennox, she\u2019s about your age, and she didn\u2019t know she was a sorceress until a couple of weeks ago. Whether or not she\u2019ll actually be able to save Vamp City is very much up in the air.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Elizabeth. But I think it\u2019s best that you know the truth. I have friends who are doing all they can to save V.C., but the only thing most of us can do is hope.\u201d</p> <p>With her heart so heavy, it was minutes before Elizabeth realized that Micah was heading straight for her apartment building. And he\u2019d never asked her how to get there.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know where I live?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her with a small smile. \u201cLukas may not have been free to come to you, but that doesn\u2019t mean he forgot about you these past two years.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him askance. \u201cHe told you to watch me?\u201d</p><p>His smile softened. \u201cHe asked me to keep an eye on you\u2014to watch over you and let him know how you were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not trapped by the failing magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I wasn\u2019t in Vamp City the night the magic began to fail. I can still come and go as I always could. Like Lukas and the other vamps used to be able to.\u201d He gave her a wry look. \u201cI wanted to run off your dates, but Lukas wouldn\u2019t let me. He didn\u2019t want you to be alone, especially if he could never return to you.\u201d His expression tightened. \u201cIf there\u2019d been a bad one, you wouldn\u2019t have seen him again. But you have good taste in men, Elizabeth. They were all good guys. Just not the right ones for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou met them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA few. Most I just kept an eye on.\u201d</p><p>She sank back against the seat, raking a hand through her hair. \u201cMy very own vampire guardian angel.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cYou could do worse.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, she returned his smile, feeling a bit dazed. \u201cMaybe instead of spying on me, you could come by for dinner sometime. Food dinner. Human-food dinner.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>And so would she. He could bring her news of Lukas and of the hunt for the sorceress.</p><p>A short while later, Micah double-parked in front of her apartment building, escorted her upstairs to satisfy himself that her apartment was secure, and to show her on a map precisely where the Boundary Circle lay. Then he said good-bye.</p><p>Alone, Elizabeth took a long shower, then pulled on her pajamas, marveling that she\u2019d been gone less than twenty-four hours. Steph . . . Poor Steph. She was sure to think Elizabeth had joined the ranks of the missing. Her friend wouldn\u2019t be sleeping tonight, she knew that.</p><p>Steph answered her call on the first ring. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me. I\u2019m home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Elizabeth. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. It\u2019s been a long day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou disappeared! You were there, then you disappeared. What in the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story, and I\u2019ll tell you everything tomorrow. I saw Lukas,\u201d she added softly. \u201cHe loves me, Steph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetie.\u201d She sighed deeply. \u201cI\u2019m just so glad you\u2019re safe. You\u2019re home? Are you going back to class tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m at my apartment. No, I\u2019m not going back to school for a little while. I can\u2019t. Long story, like I said. Come over as soon as class is over tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell. I\u2019m coming over now. I\u2019ll be there in ten. You don\u2019t have to tell me a thing tonight if you don\u2019t feel like it, but I have to see you. I have to see for myself that you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>Her heart full, yet heavy, Elizabeth set down her phone and reached into her nightstand drawer to pull out the picture of her and Lukas. The love that shone in his eyes as he smiled at her wrapped around her all over again, filling her with warmth and longing and warm certainty.</p><p>With her fingertip, she traced his beloved likeness.</p><p>\u201cCome back to me, my warrior. My vampire.\u201d The tears slipped down her cheeks. \u201cMy love.\u201d</p><p>She gazed at Lukas\u2019s face until the doorbell rang, then she slipped the picture back into the drawer and prayed that someday soon he found his way back to her arms.</p><p>First Dates Are Hell</p><p>A Those Who Wander Story</p><p>Amanda Arista</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>VALIANCE WALKED UP behind the Prima as she lounged at her favorite table. Six. There were six ways he could attack her while her back was to the main entrance of the coffee shop.</p><p>He looked around. The space hummed, pulsed with life. Even under the coffee\u2019s aroma and the espresso-soaked floors, he could smell the life of this place, the life of every person in here. His stomach growled.</p><p>This was a test of some sort. Prima Violet was famous for them, pushing everyone the extra step to make them better. Scheduling his monthly meeting here instead of in his own place of business was a test. Her directive to be unarmed was a test. And judging by the uncomfortable nakedness between his shoulder blades and the pressure of the others\u2019 energy, he wasn\u2019t going to pass this one.</p><p>But he could at least teach her something. Make her better.</p><p>Finding the ebb and flow of the life around him, he moved toward her, in sync with the others in the caf\u00e9. Their heavy steps along the wooden floor covered the sound of his boots as he slid up behind her. He wasn\u2019t going to ignore the irony of stalking a were-panther.</p><p>Valiance knelt slowly and whispered in her ear. \u201cYou could be dead.\u201d</p><p>The tall woman jumped in her seat and turned around almost as fast as he could blink. Then she laughed as she smiled down at him. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t stalk people like that, Val.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t sit with your back to the door.\u201d</p><p>Prima Violet pointed to the amulet above the door. \u201cMost powerful charm in existence. Nothing bad is getting through these doors, Val. You\u2019re safe here.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled. Her faith was going to be her downfall, but he would fall with her for the faith she had put in him. \u201cYou still shouldn\u2019t make a habit of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLesson learned, Solider boy. Sit.\u201d</p><p>Valiance slid into the seat across from her, folding his hands on the table between them. From this vantage point, he could see everything. At least one of them should be on the offensive, no matter how protected the Prima thought she was. Better a thousand times safe than once dead.</p><p>The Prima finished a text message and put the phone on the table. She swept her dark hair over her shoulder and settled her content moss green eyes on him. \u201cSo how is my favorite vampire this evening?\u201d</p><p>His gaze darted to the surrounding tables to see if anyone heard her. The caf\u00e9 had become the primary haunt of the Wandering community, the magical taking refuge in the haven the Prima had created, but he still wasn\u2019t used to the openness. He\u2019d spent a hundred and sixty-seven years trying to hide what he was from everyone, other Wanderers included. Violet was the only one in the pack who had reached out to him, who took a moment to realize that he wasn\u2019t the monster from the movies.</p><p>\u201cI am fine, Prima.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou rolled around in ghoul guts with me. You can call me Violet.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward on the table. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not fine. You\u2019re pale, gaunt even. Have you been feeding?\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, keeping his eyes to the table between them. He bounced his leg to relieve some of the pressure down his unprotected back.</p><p>\u201cValiance, look at me.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, her burnt magnolia scent, laced with pure concern, swirled around him like a warm, spring breeze. He drew his gaze up to clear eyes practically glowing with power and licked his suddenly dry lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? And remember my policy on honesty. Are you eating?\u201d</p><p>Valiance nodded. \u201cOnce a month. Just like we talked about. They don\u2019t remember anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it? You look like a ghost.\u201d</p><p>Valiance adjusted in the seat, knowing it wasn\u2019t the seat that was uncomfortable. \u201cNothing. Life is very . . . quiet,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>His Prima smirked. \u201cI don\u2019t understand that word. Quiet. What is this quiet that you speak of?\u201d</p><p>The smile crawled slowly across his mouth until he was smiling with her. The Prima\u2019s infectious humor. Some days it was more powerful than the panther that lived within her.</p><p>Prima Jordan was rarely alone, constantly bombarded by her pack mates. If it wasn\u2019t the minutiae of their everyday lives, it was the demon last August that had to be beheaded or the invasion of imps that swarmed Dallas until they were netted and sent back through the Veil. She always called him in for the fight, but after all the action, she went home to a full house, and he went back to an empty apartment.</p><p>Violet reached across the table and rested her hand over his knotted fingers.</p><p>The action startled him, and his entire body tensed. In the connection, he could feel her power and the slow rhythm of her heart. It was strong, steady, and echoed in the vastness of the energy undulating around them.</p><p>Violet only tightened her grip with his flinch of protest. \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to imagine how hard it was for you after your Clade up and left you. But now, you\u2019ve got to be brave again.\u201d</p><p>Valiance looked up. \u201cAnother demon?\u201d For a moment, his heart raced with the thought of battle. A purpose for him and his blade. Something to draw him away from the stillness of his life.</p><p>Violet laughed. \u201cNo, but good one. You\u2019ve got to start living. Get out of the shop, get an assistant. Take up quilting. Hell, take a vacation and come back to tell me what it\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>And here it was. This entire evening was a test. He knew it. A test to see if he was capable of rejoining the human race or, at least, walking beside them again.</p><p>She leaned back in her chair, her hand and her power retreating. \u201cDo anything new lately that didn\u2019t involve sneaking up on people?\u201d</p><p>The monotony of his life flashed through his mind in a matter of moments. \u201cBought some sheets?\u201d</p><p>She raised her dark eyebrow sharply. \u201cThat was your big adventure? You\u2019re killing me, Val. I expected romance, intrigue, danger.\u201d She leaned forward again and lowered her voice. \u201cYou\u2019re a vampire. That\u2019s got to get you into some trouble. Hell, being so blasted good-looking should get you into trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted us to stay out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you to stay out of danger. Living life comes with trouble.\u201d</p><p>Life was uncomfortable, like a wool sweater he hadn\u2019t gotten used to wearing. But there was one softer moment he could remember, where it didn\u2019t feel like life was trying to suffocate him. \u201cThere was this girl.\u201d</p><p>Violet\u2019s energy sizzled around them, and she smiled. \u201cGirls are always trouble.\u201d</p><p>Valiance shook his head. \u201cIt was nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you mentioned it to me, she was something. Let me guess. Tall and exotic? No, wait. I bet she\u2019s a redhead with legs for days.\u201d She leaned forward, her chin in her hands. \u201cTell me a story.\u201d</p><p>Valiance couldn\u2019t believe he was about to tell this to his leader, the one he followed into battle. But frankly, he didn\u2019t have anyone else to talk to about the girl. Maybe if he talked about her, she wouldn\u2019t keep circling around in his head. \u201cComplete opposite. The girl who sold me the sheets. Dark hair. Brown eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEsme.\u201d Saying her name out loud only coalesced all the thoughts of her into something bigger and brighter.</p><p>\u201cList three reasons you didn\u2019t ask her out right then.\u201d</p><p>The first one screamed through his brain every time he thought about the petite brunette: she was human, fragile and human. Valiance leaned back in his chair, letting his hands drop to his lap. He pinched the flesh on his ring finger and watched the near-bloodless skin slowly smooth out. \u201cThis is ridiculous. You\u2019re my Prima, for Christ\u2019s sake. You shouldn\u2019t be worried about my personal problems.\u201d</p><p>Violet sat up straight in her chair. \u201cValiance No-Last-Name, my entire job is to make sure you choose your own problems, and they don\u2019t come after you. You don\u2019t need me like the others do. I still can\u2019t figure why you don\u2019t have a Clade of your own. So if you need me to be an ear so you can talk about a girl, I\u2019m right here. And if you need Chaz to hunt her down, I can lend him to you for an evening.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes flicked up to his Prima, and she was smiling. In the past six months, he\u2019d learned she meant every word she said, after you got through the Violet-speak. Frankly, she was the closest thing to a friend he had in Dallas since his Clade brothers left him there. Left him because he took a stand for their future in Dallas. Left him because he showed an ounce of spine in a moment of crisis. He looked down at his hands in his lap only to find his fists, white and bloodless.</p><p>\u201cWill we see you at the full moon?\u201d</p><p>He wriggled his fingers to get the little blood left in him flowing again. \u201cAre you going to hassle me about dating?\u201d</p> <p>Violet shook her head. \u201cNo. Maybe. Do you want to go to the full moon? You can bring your sword. I\u2019ve been practicing a little. Might give you a run for your money this time.\u201d</p><p>He actually had to think about the question. Did he want to go? Sitting on a porch being lonely around other Wanderers didn\u2019t really seem like a great way to spend a weekend. He knew they saw him as the worst of their kind, something that stole the life they fought for. Alone with his thoughts, he saw himself like that most days.</p><p>But if he didn\u2019t go to the full moon, he knew Violet would just drag him someplace else. \u201cI need to return Chaz\u2019s whetstone.\u201d</p><p>Violet smiled. Just as he thought she was going to hound him more about his current activities, her phone began to vibrate. She grabbed the dancing device, looked at the screen, and rolled her eyes. As she rose, she answered the line but didn\u2019t talk.</p><p>Valiance stood with her. He knew his manners were outdated for this century, but there were certain habits he could not break. Stand when a lady enters and exits. Always carry a handkerchief, and be on time.</p> <p>She almost looked him straight in the eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t make me worry about you, Valiance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Violet just winked at him as she left the coffee shop, taking the next caller in a long line of people who needed her help.</p><p>He sighed and sat back down at the table. His Prima had just told him to \u201cGet a life.\u201d How pathetic was that?</p><p>\u201cEXCUSE ME, SIR. I\u2019m looking for Esme?\u201d</p><p>Her skin prickled. It started on the back of her head and shimmered down her spine. She\u2019d never heard that before. Ever. She looked up from her work of stocking the pillowcase wall and saw the back of a man talking to her manager. He was a million feet tall, with hair that, under the fluorescent lights, looked like the inside of a down comforter.</p> <p>\u201cEsme?\u201d her manager asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the man said. His voice was deep, smooth, and not from around here. \u201cShort, slender, biggest brown eyes you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you mean Hannah Jane up in Juniors.\u201d</p><p>The man sighed. \u201cWhy would I shop in Juniors? No, she works in Housewares, and her name is Esme. It\u2019s on the receipt.\u201d</p><p>She dusted her hands off on the apron and put the box cutter in her pocket. Slowly, she made her way around to the back of the register, careful to keep behind the display of AS SEEN ON TV products until she got a look at him.</p><p>It only took one glimpse of him running his fingers through his hair before she recognized who it was. Black damask sheets. Seven-hundred-count. Credit card. His hand had trembled as he handed her the card.</p><p>As she rounded the display, her manager sighed. \u201cThank God. Do you know someone named Esme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Esme.\u201d</p> <p>Her manager sighed and walked away, which left her in the very keen sight of the man with the black sheets.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d The words didn\u2019t feel natural coming out of her mouth. She rarely had to speak at work, let alone help a customer. It\u2019s why she worked in Housewares, the only department without a monthly sales quota for its workers.</p><p>His broad shoulders relaxed, but he didn\u2019t smile. \u201cI was in here a couple of days ago, and you helped me pick out a sheet set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven-hundred-count Egyptian cotton in black with a damask stripe.\u201d</p><p>There was a twinge at his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a great memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my only sale this month.\u201d She finally saw a white plastic bag hanging around his wrist. \u201cDid you need to return them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Actually, I\u2019d like another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Um. This way.\u201d</p><p>She walked him over to the exact same spot they had stood last week. She felt stalked, like a dark cloud just before a storm was following her. It only intensified when she turned to him at the display and found that the storm was in his dark blue eyes.</p><p>She really wasn\u2019t sure what happened next. She didn\u2019t really do the customer thing, except at Christmastime when everyone was looking for the electric blankets, and that was mostly pointing like a game-show host, like she was doing now. \u201cTa-da.\u201d</p><p>God, she had actually said that out loud. She was pathetic. She tucked her hair behind her ear and waited, staring down at his unusually shiny black shoes. Come to notice it, he was a little dressed up for sheet shopping.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said as he took another set, exactly the same.</p><p>In his smooth movement, she was flooded with the smell of him, a musky cologne with undernotes of Downy, but there was a darker twang to it. Something familiar tickled her nose.</p><p>As he inspected the plastic package, she looked up at him. His tired blue eyes, his pale skin. But even her caramel skin looked peaked under these lights. It was probably nothing.</p><p>\u201cDid you need the matching comforter? It\u2019s on sale.\u201d Wow, maybe she was cut out for this sales thing.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><p>She walked him over to the wall of comforters. \u201cThe store brand is pretty nice. Comes with a bed skirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever really understood the need for a bed skirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy abuelita believes it keeps the dust bunnies from nesting.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. It was a deep laugh, short but honest. \u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have pillows, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m good on pillows. I have to walk home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalk? No one walks in Dallas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI enjoy the exercise.\u201d</p><p>And it showed. Even under his black trench, she could see the broad expanse of his chest and how his buttons strained when he\u2019d reached for the sheets. Given the wrinkled shirt under her dusty apron, she looked like she didn\u2019t shower. But then again, until him, no one had noticed her. Ever.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you find anything else?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth but closed it again and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThen the cash register is this way.\u201d</p><p>As she walked him back to the register, she felt it, that pressure in the back of her head. She wondered if all girls got this when they were being followed, like she could feel him looking at her, watching her messy ponytail bob back and forth.</p><p>And he just kept looking at her, and she just kept smiling like an idiot as she rang up the bed set. \u201cTotal is seventy-three ninety six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a good sale.\u201d He handed her the credit card again, and again, his hand trembled. This time she paid attention to the name. Val Lance. Very knightly.</p><p>She ran the card and handed it back to him. Their fingers brushed for a second, and his fingers were cold, like touching an ice cube. She snapped her hand back.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d he apologized as he put his card back in his wallet and his wallet in his coat pocket, not in the back pocket like most boys these days. \u201cI really should start wearing gloves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have gloves in men\u2019s wear.\u201d She blushed when she realized that she hadn\u2019t talked so much in ages. She was like a babbling brook under his intense gaze.</p><p>Esme pulled her hair behind her ear and slipped his purchases into the handled paper bag.</p><p>\u201cI came to get your number.\u201d The statement spilled out of his mouth like a gangly kid in a foot race.</p><p>Her jaw dropped as her brain contemplated the possible answers to \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His blond brow furrowed. \u201cTo ask you out for coffee?\u201d</p><p>Excited goose bumps trickled down her arm. \u201cWhy do you need my number to do that? Just do it now.\u201d</p><p>He laughed that one short laugh and let out a long breath. \u201cWould you do me the honor of having coffee with me?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him and into those tired blue eyes. They were old. Older than her abuelita\u2019s, but she felt seen. For the first time in a long time, she felt like she was a normal girl. That should be something, right? Even if it was just a cup of coffee before he realized how completely boring she was, and he forgot her like everyone else did. \u201cYeah. Yes.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, and something glowed within him. It was a wide smile that completely changed the dynamic of his features. It lit up his eyes and chased away the storm clouds. \u201cWonderful. May I have your number so we can set up a time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t have a phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one remembers to call me.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to giggle but fought the light, fluttering feelings in her stomach. She knew exactly where to meet. One of her favorite places in Dallas, where the baristas never forgot her order. \u201cThere\u2019s this coffee shop off Oaklawn. Big black cat in the window?\u201d</p><p>She watched as what little blood colored his cheeks faded, and his Adam\u2019s apple bobbed slowly.</p><p>\u201cDo you know it?\u201d</p><p>He licked his lips. \u201cI sort of know the owner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I love that place.\u201d She let one excited smile slip.</p><p>\u201cThursday night?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo Thursday. Coffee shop. Eight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. I\u2019m Esme, by the way.\u201d She stuck out her hand.</p><p>\u201cVal,\u201d he said.</p><p>As his cool hand slipped into hers, she shivered again, this time with excitement as the hair prickled on the back of her neck.</p><p>He squeezed gently, then pulled away. \u201cSee you on Thursday, Esme.\u201d</p><p>She stayed behind the counter for at least fifteen minutes after watching him walk away. What had gotten into her? Did someone seriously just ask her out on a date? And not just a someone. A tall, Viking-looking thing who should be wielding a sword and not sipping coffee.</p><p>Esme smiled. Her first date. Her abuelita was going to be so proud. And she might just go upstairs and visit Hannah Jane in Juniors to find something to wear.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>UP UNTIL THAT moment, Valiance was convinced vampires didn\u2019t sweat. One hundred and sixty-seven years old, and he was as nervous as a long-tailed cat. It made him smile. Violet would appreciate that. Violet wound be proud of this whole endeavor, no matter how badly it ended. He wiped his palms on the legs of his jeans before he took a deep breath and pulled open the door.</p><p>The smell of humans hit him hard in the gut. He should have fed. He\u2019d thought about it, but there was an echo within him whispering he shouldn\u2019t pulse with someone else\u2019s blood, someone else\u2019s life, on his date with Esme. Some very old-fashioned part of him wanted him to be pure for this.</p><p>Like he could ever be pure again. He had the lives of a thousand people running through his veins. One more shouldn\u2019t have mattered. But it did tonight.</p><p>His nose twitched with the soft scent of baby powder and flowers. His gaze was drawn to the front window, where Esme was sitting in the window seat, watching him with doe-like eyes.</p><p>She stood and smoothed her green skirt over her dark leggings and pulled at her jacket. Her rose sweater reminded him of just that, a flower, with her soft scent and delicate features.</p><p>Esme met him halfway to the register. \u201cHi.\u201d Her eyes fluttered somewhere around his elbow as she pulled her dark hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d He led her over to the register. \u201cWhat\u2019s your usual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Mexican Mocha. It\u2019s got this kick like Abuelita makes.\u201d</p><p>Valiance turned to the manager. Bastian was one of the few humans in Dallas who knew of the Wanderer community and happily served them coffees and cookies. It struck Valiance that this might be the first time he\u2019d ordered anything here. \u201cTwo Mexican Mochas.\u201d</p><p>Bastian raised his eyebrow at the order. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Valiance pressed his lips together in a tight smile. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>The manager shrugged and rang up their coffees. \u201cIt will be a moment. I\u2019m a little behind on orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hiring?\u201d Esme asked.</p><p>Bastian laughed as he went to make their drinks. \u201cDon\u2019t I wish.\u201d</p><p>Valiance saw an instant of sadness cross her eyes, and a metal hook pierced his heart. He needed to change the subject quickly. \u201cYou talk about your grandmother a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live with her.\u201d Esme dropped her face into her hands, and the flower scent around her increased as she blushed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to tell you that. Now I look pathetic. A twenty-two-year-old still living at home.\u201d</p><p>Valiance chuckled. \u201cFamilies should live together.\u201d</p><p>She peeked out from between two fingers. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>FROM THAT MOMENT on, he was sunk. She was adorable. And nervous. And honest. She spun the porcelain cup in its saucer as she talked about her college literature courses and how the poetry class she was taking now was her last before she graduated though she didn\u2019t know what she could do with her degree. She talked about her incredibly large family and how she had to live with her grandmother to get any peace because everyone in her family was loud and in each other\u2019s business. She talked about how he was the first customer who ever asked for her again.</p><p>\u201cOh God. I shouldn\u2019t have said that. You\u2019re going to think I\u2019m even more pathetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to think you\u2019re pathetic.\u201d</p><p>She scrunched her nose. \u201cCan you tell I don\u2019t talk to people much?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cProbably more than I do.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cSo now we\u2019re going to play who\u2019s more pathetic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d win. I work in a storefront alone, selling things online. The only person I talked to this week was the mailman. And you.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled up at him, her sparkling brown eyes, her rosy lips, her sharp chin. The only thing that could have pulled him away from that moment was the spike of icy energy that rammed down his spine and made him jerk.</p><p>The caf\u00e9 was suddenly less illuminated than it had been a moment earlier, a grim shadow quickly cast over his evening. His hand moved to his neck and inside the collar of his jacket. He brushed the familiar hilt just to make sure. He\u2019d tried to leave the house without his sword, but it had been his only companion through all this. And, frankly, he felt naked without it.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Esme asked. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. You went all stony.\u201d</p><p>He was honest. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it get cold in here?\u201d She rubbed her hands up and down the arms of her jacket.</p> <p>\u201cMore than just cold,\u201d he said as he scanned the front windows of the shop. It was never cold here, part of the spell the Prima had put on the place. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Um. Okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the lot out back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t question him. She just grabbed her bag and put it across her chest, taking one last drag of the mocha before he escorted toward the rear of the caf\u00e9.</p> <p>\u201cAre we allowed back here?\u201d she whispered as he ushered her through the storage room.</p><p>\u201cI know the owner, remember?\u201d</p><p>He guided her through the dark and toward the glow of moonlight from the back door window. His senses heightened by the fear creeping down his back, he was completely lost in the smell of her hair, the flowers, and her warmth as it pushed against him in the darkness.</p><p>He knew right then that she was too good for him. Too sweet. Too pure. What was he thinking even talking to her?</p><p>Valiance reached around her to push open the back door, and they broke out into the cold night.</p><p>\u201cWhich one is yours?\u201d he asked as he reached into his front pocket to get his cell phone.</p><p>\u201cThe . . .\u201d</p><p>Esme sucked the words back in with a gasp as a dark figure swooped down and skittered in the gravel before them. Valiance pulled her behind him. He inhaled sharply as she buried her face between his shoulder blades, pressing the long, hard edge of iron against his spine.</p> <p>The darkness faded around the figure, and his Clade Brother Mondrian\u2019s violently blue eyes smiled at him. \u201cNice to see you again, Valiance.\u201d</p><p>Six months of loneliness hit Valiance like a load of bricks in the pit of his stomach. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Mondrian ran his fingers through his long brown hair, then pulled at the cuffs of his black leather jacket. \u201cA little hospitality, for starters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Mondrian?\u201d Valiance repeated.</p><p>Mondrian spread his hands out. \u201cJust to talk, older brother.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Valiance pressed his cell phone into Esme\u2019s leg. Her hand wrapped around the phone, catching his fingers in hers for a moment. The thrill of it jumped up his arm and made him stand straighter. \u201cNow is not a good time.\u201d</p><p>Mondrian\u2019s rage twisted his usually perfect face. \u201cYou think you\u2019re too good for your Clade now? That shifter bitch tell you that?\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t right. Mondrian\u2019s first emotion wasn\u2019t anger. His brother would have tried charm first, seduction. Swung around to flattery before resorting to anger. This wasn\u2019t a hospitality visit, and the knowledge grated on Valiance\u2019s nerves, setting everything on edge.</p><p>Valiance\u2019s power spiked around him, and the magic enhanced him. His muscles readied, his vision focused, and his fangs pressed down on his lower lip. \u201cYou do not talk about the Prima like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve actually gone native?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing to make this harder than planned.\u201d</p><p>A shadow swooped down and plowed into Valiance. He slammed against the pavement, the wind knocked from his lungs. The figure was gone as quickly as it attacked.</p><p>Valiance\u2019s only thought was that Esme was exposed and defenseless against them as she stood frozen.</p><p>He sat up too quickly, and black spots swarmed in his vision. \u201cRun.\u201d</p><p>His hoarse voice must have made something click within her, because she ran off into the night.</p><p>When Mondrian didn\u2019t blink, Valiance scoured the darkness around the parking lot, looking for others, waiting for the next attack. He didn\u2019t have to wait long. The shadow swooped again, but this time he was ready. His hand reached behind his head and pulled out his sword. When the figure hit him, he rolled and grabbed the material on the man\u2019s chest. He slammed him down to the gravel and had his sword to his throat in less than a breath.</p><p>\u201cFinnegan?\u201d</p><p>Valiance dropped the man\u2019s shirt, and both were on their feet in the blink of an eye. His muscles rejoiced at the feeling of his sword in his hand, at the use of his speed again, but his heart sank at seeing another one of his brethren on what now had to be a mission from Andrin, the leader of his former Clade.</p><p>\u201cBrothers don\u2019t attack brothers in the darkness.\u201d</p><p>Mondrian just smiled, and Valiance remembered everything the two of them had done together. Every war. Every city. Every woman. His stomach churned as he remembered the carousing, the drinking, and, most of all, the camaraderie he had desperately missed in the past six months.</p><p>Valiance\u2019s gaze bounced between the men. Three. There were three ways out of this. None left him unscathed, but Esme would be safe. \u201cYou left me here, Mondrian. That\u2019s not a very brotherly thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrin ordered us to leave. It wasn\u2019t our fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrima Jordan was fighting for all of us. Fighting to make sure we could still have something to fight for.\u201d</p><p>Finnegan snickered. \u201cHe really did drink the Kool-Aid.\u201d</p><p>Valiance heard the rumble of an engine, and Mondrian began to turn his head. Valiance flicked the tip of his sword and pressed it to Mondrian\u2019s chest. \u201cAndrin was a coward, running from the fight. I will not align with cowards or those who follow them.\u201d</p><p>Mondrian looked down at the blade against his jacket and shook his head. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019re in the compromised position here.\u201d</p><p>A yellow Volkswagen Bug revved its engine and flew out of the parking lot. A weight lifted off Valiance\u2019s shoulders as he saw Esme\u2019s features in the window, her knuckles glowing white on the steering wheel. But he also knew he was watching his last chance for any sort of normal relationship drive terrified into the night.</p><p>Mondrian brushed away the tip of Valiance\u2019s sword and continued with his speech. \u201cAndrin wants you back. He\u2019s gotten us into trouble, and he needs his warrior prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you good enough?\u201d Valiance tested the weight of his sword in his hand. She was perfect, had always been perfect.</p><p>He could hear Mondrian\u2019s teeth grind across the space between them. \u201cHe wants you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve pledged my allegiance to Dallas and to the Prima. I will not break my word for a coward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like you\u2019re still in the eighteen hundreds, Val. Back when you were still Thomas Valmont, son of an aristocrat. Your perspective needs to change. It\u2019s not about honor and codes now. It\u2019s about survival and us against them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never had honor and codes, Mondrian. You wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Mondrian had always been faster. At least that part of him remained the same. Mondrian slammed Valiance against the brick wall so hard he was sure they\u2019d shaken the foundation of the coffee shop. Mondrian\u2019s breath was fresh with blood, but there was something else beneath the metallic scent.</p><p>\u201cAre you drinking from Andrin?\u201d The words themselves left a sour taste in Valiance\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cHe shares his power with us.\u201d</p><p>Valiance strengthened his jaw against the fresh pain in his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to control you. You know that, Mon. We\u2019ve seen this frantic power grab before. Next, he\u2019ll start trying to bond new vampires to the Clade.\u201d</p><p>Mondrian\u2019s face didn\u2019t betray him, but his teal eyes did. The look told Valiance that his former leader had already started hunting for purebloods with the vampire potential. Once Andrin bit them, and their power had been solidified, they\u2019d be his Clade Brothers forever. Like Emilio had bitten Valiance, and Valiance had bitten Mondrian.</p><p>Valiance dropped to the ground and swept Mondrian\u2019s legs out from under him. The boy never could predict a leg sweep. The younger vampire bounced against the concrete like a child\u2019s play ball and came at Valiance again, but Val\u2019s sword was faster.</p><p>The iron blade pressed into the hollow of Mondrian\u2019s throat. \u201cI will not go.\u201d</p><p>Something happened to Mondrian. He shivered, from top to toe.</p><p>\u201cYou will rejoin your Clade.\u201d It wasn\u2019t Mondrian\u2019s voice. Mondrian had been born in the Americas, like Valiance. This voice was deeper and had the lilt of an Irishman in it. Full possession. It was worse than Valiance thought. Andrin\u2019s energy coursed through Mondrian.</p><p>Valiance couldn\u2019t believe what he saw. His best friend reduced to the point that another could possess him. It both fueled him and disgusted him.</p><p>\u201cI will not live under the tyranny of a coward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you will die under one.\u201d</p><p>WHEN ESME REALIZED she could barely see where she was driving, she pulled into the parking lot of a brightly lit convenient store and tried to get her brain to stop yelling at her.</p><p>Of course, he\u2019s a monster, and you were just about to be one of those girls in the movies who gets eaten. You are nothing. Why would a guy like him even notice you in the first place unless it was for dinner? How stupid could you be? Maybe there is a reason your parents gave up on you.</p><p>Her brain went a little numb after the last thought. The following tears were hot and thick, and she sobbed for a good ten minutes before her tear ducts ran dry.</p><p>But he saw her. She shuddered through a deep breath. He saw her, and he had told her to run when those other things showed up.</p><p>Esme looked over at the cell phone in her passenger seat. Why\u2019d he given her the phone? Because he knew she didn\u2019t have one. What kind of a monster gives you a phone so you can call for help?</p><p>Her hand still shaking, she reached out to take the phone. The simple flip model jumped to life when she opened it. Did she call 9\u20131\u20131? What could they do? These things moved faster than she could see. What were the cops supposed to do about that?</p><p>Did she call his family? She\u2019d heard them say brothers. Maybe they were looking for his brother?</p><p>Not used to the phone\u2019s buttons, she pressed a few and ended up opening his contacts list.</p><p>His extremely short contacts list. One. Jordan. She\u2019d heard that name before. The coffee shop, as a whisper in the air. He\u2019d said he knew the owner. Was that his only contact?</p><p>Taking in another breath, she made a decision. Call this person. Let them know Val was in trouble, then race home and never leave her abuelita\u2019s couch ever again. That was all she owed him for the coffee.</p><p>The phone rang a few times before a woman answered. \u201cHey, Val. How\u2019d the date go?\u201d</p><p>Esme didn\u2019t exactly know what to say, so she was honest. \u201cNot good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this? Is this Esme?\u201d</p><p>Her skin prickled. How did this woman know who she was? \u201cVal was attacked at the coffee shop. He needs help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy coffee shop. Nothing can get into the coffee shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehind it. Look. I don\u2019t know what those guys were, but he\u2019s in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo, that I saw. I hightailed it out of there pretty fast.\u201d</p><p>The woman actually laughed. \u201cThank you, Esme. You may have just saved his life.\u201d</p><p>Esme closed the phone. Did she want to save his life? Would he try to eat her now?</p><p>She didn\u2019t know, but she started up her car and wished she\u2019d just stayed hidden down in Housewares.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>MONDRIAN SLAMMED VALIANCE\u2019S face against the car door and Val heard his jaw crack. That was going to hurt in the morning. If there was a morning.</p><p>Mondrian turned him around and buried his nose into Val\u2019s shirt and inhaled deeply. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a girl on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave her out of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you chasing dames the old-fashioned way?\u201d Finnegan asked as he swung Valiance\u2019s sword around. \u201cJust sway them. It\u2019s easier.\u201d</p><p>Valiance ground his teeth together, and his vision was lost for a moment in the spinning pain of his broken jaw and his concussed brain.</p><p>\u201cOh, I think he likes this one.\u201d Mondrian dropped Valiance\u2019s shirt, and Val slid down the car, landing hard on his ass. He felt a rib shift like it really shouldn\u2019t have shifted, and his sword arm, ripped from its socket, dangled loosely at his side.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you won\u2019t come back with us?\u201d Mondrian asked. \u201cSome girl. We can find her, you know. See if she\u2019s right for the bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Valiance growled as he pushed himself up to his feet.</p><p>Mondrian let him. Valiance knew he was being played with. After the possession had faded, Mondrian was just enjoying kicking Valiance\u2019s ass on principle for all the times he had had to rein Mondrian in, keep him from crossing a line Valiance knew didn\u2019t even exist for him anymore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs she pretty, at least? Tall, dark, and exotic. Like that Jolie woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s totally one of us,\u201d Finnegan pitched in as he spun Valiance\u2019s sword around like a parade rifle.</p><p>Valiance looked from one to the other. They didn\u2019t see Esme. She\u2019d been right there, and they hadn\u2019t seen her. How could they not have seen her?</p> <p>The sudden realization ripped a gasp from him. It wasn\u2019t just her quaint manner. She might actually be invisible to some people.</p><p>Valiance chuckled at the sheer cosmic joke of it all. That he could see invisible girls. Next thing he would discover was that she was a ghost who had died in a tragic pillow avalanche. Sounded about par for this year.</p><p>\u201cGoing to share the joke?\u201d Mondrian asked.</p><p>Finnegan was at his throat in a blink, the sharp edge of Val\u2019s own blade pressed into his sensitive skin. \u201cYeah, Brother. We like a good joke.\u201d</p><p>The smell of burnt magnolias filled the parking lot. \u201cThen you\u2019re going to think that I\u2019m hilarious.\u201d</p> <p>Valiance had never been more relieved to smell Prima Jordan. He swore in that moment he would never make a long-tailed cat joke for the rest of his long life.</p><p>She sauntered through the parking lot. When she was within striking distance, she studied both men. \u201cThese those Clade Brothers you keep talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery family has its fights,\u201d Mondrian said, leaving Valiance for a moment. \u201cStay out of this one.\u201d</p><p>Violet shrugged. \u201cNot impressed, Val.\u201d</p><p>Mondrian was fast as he charged her, but Violet\u2019s reactions were faster. Something like pride swelled within Valiance as he watched Violet throw Mondrian across the parking lot. Maybe he had taught her something in their sparring sessions.</p><p>She took a moment to recover Valiance from the ground. \u201cSo, night going well?\u201d</p> <p>Valiance took her offered hand and got to his feet. His ears were ringing courtesy of the last slam into the car. \u201cI don\u2019t think your phrase friggin\u2019 peachy has ever really made sense until now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Finnegan and Mondrian didn\u2019t give them time to organize a proper strategy. Mondrian went for Valiance\u2019s throat, teeth out and ready for blood.</p><p>Valiance was ready for him. He knew every move Mondrian would throw at him, every just-off-center punch and the way he favored his left claw to his right. Even after a harsh blow to the ribs, Val felt a smile cross his lips.</p><p>\u201cPlease share the joke, Brother.\u201d</p><p>Mondrian landed a fast backhand across Valiance\u2019s jaw but couldn\u2019t shake the smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too predictable. Always have been.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPredictable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven down to your taste in clothes. Must everything be black?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrings out my\u2014\u201d</p><p>Valiance landed a hard right hook on Mondrian\u2019s jaw, reveling in the sound of the contact that echoed off the brick building.</p><p>Blood trickled out of the corner of Mondrian\u2019s mouth, and he wiped it with the back of his hand. \u201cSo you\u2019re really not going to consider coming back to us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>There was a shimmer in the air, and Violet\u2019s panther made a black streak across the parking lot after Finnegan. The young vampire ran in panic, dropping Valiance\u2019s sword as he fled.</p><p>The two vampires saw the sword at the same time, but Valiance was faster this time. They slid across the parking lot, but Valiance felt the familiar thrum in his fingertips as touched the metal.</p><p>He curled his fingers around his sword, and she felt amazing in his hand. Good girl.</p><p>\u201cAre you forgetting I have one of those, too?\u201d Mondrian pulled his own blade out from its sheath.</p><p>\u201cMine\u2019s bigger.\u201d Valiance winked before he swung the sword in the first of a dozen attacks. He wasn\u2019t as strong with his left arm, but Mondrian hadn\u2019t trained any more than what Valiance had put him through the past seventy years. Valiance had never stopped practicing. Even Violet had taken up swordplay and had the speed to be a challenge for Valiance. She had made him better.</p><p>Mondrian had only slowed him down, made him wait for his younger brother to play catch-up.</p><p>Valiance was tired of waiting. He wanted this done. He hated waiting. He hated that he\u2019d been in limbo for six months, and the one night he decided to try to get back on the horse, they showed up.</p><p>With every angry thought, Valiance\u2019s blade lashed out. For every word he couldn\u2019t say, his iron spoke for him.</p><p>Until Mondrian was pressed against the wall, unarmed, bleeding, and smelling of fear. Valiance took in a deep breath of his scent though he didn\u2019t need a reminder of Mondrian\u2019s smell.</p><p>Iron sliced through flesh with a sickening sucking sound that made Valiance turn away from his brother just in time to see Finnegan\u2019s head roll under a parked car.</p><p>Violet, in human form, stood over the body, weapon hanging at her side.</p><p>Valiance was frozen by the feeling of his Clade Brother as he died. A cold chill ran over his skin despite his battle-charged heat. It was like spiderwebs drawn across his chest as Finnegan\u2019s energy was released back into the earth.</p><p>Mondrian obviously didn\u2019t have the same reaction. He grabbed Valiance\u2019s wrist and wrenched his injured arm outward and spun under it.</p><p>The tendons in Valiance\u2019s shoulder ripped around the dislocated shoulder. The pain numbed his hand and screeched into his ear. Mondrian rammed his knee into Valiance\u2019s torso, then was gone, like the air in Valiance\u2019s lungs.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d Violet said as she dropped the sword and went to help Valiance up.</p><p>The power of her panther still ebbed around her, and the heat of her pressed against his injured body. As they shuffled over to the dead body, he might have held on to her shoulder longer than he needed just to have her soothing power close to him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to . . .\u201d Violet said as she stood over the headless vampire. \u201cI think you taught me a little too well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. You didn\u2019t mean to chop his head off.\u201d Valiance shook his head. Pain flared from his right knee to his left ribs to his right shoulder to his left jaw. He was a zigzag of pain. Thinking in a straight line was nearly impossible.</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d Violet turned to him. \u201cWant me to fix that arm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou a medic now, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just accident-prone. I\u2019ve had to do it enough times that I\u2019m an expert. Take off your jacket.\u201d</p><p>There really was no saying \u201cno\u201d to her, so he slipped off his jacket carefully. His new dress shirt was shredded, blood drying in long lines across his chest. He had the thought that more blood was on the outside than on the in.</p><p>He could feel the heat of her hands through his shirt, She walked her fingers down his shoulder blade. Carefully, she took his wrist and brought his arm up to a right angle. \u201cWe probably need to talk about something happy because this usually hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrin\u2019s using his blood to possess the Clade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your idea of happy?\u201d</p><p>She carefully rotated his arm outward, and every inch she moved it made his head swim in pain. She could relocate it, but the ligaments would still need time to mend. She kept moving his arm, her fingers at his back to gauge the process.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like it is in the movies, you know. That dramatic pop as the hero slams his shoulder back into place. You need to relax. This isn\u2019t going to work if you\u2019re tense.\u201d</p><p>He knew she was talking to keep his mind occupied, keep it from focusing on the pain, on the betrayal of his Clade. His failure to his brothers. She was kind of great like that.</p><p>Violet kept cranking his arm back and forth, but he couldn\u2019t relax with her touching him. It hadn\u2019t been that long since he\u2019d been with a woman, but he was definitely affected by the heat of panther power against his side. It reminded him of Esme, her soft warmth that smelled like flowers.</p><p>The thought of her relaxed him for a moment, and Violet hit him like linebacker in the shoulder. A pop echoed through the parking lot, and Valiance grabbed his shoulder as he jerked away from Violet.</p><p>\u201cFinally got you to relax enough.\u201d</p><p>Valiance bent over and let the pain consume him for a second before it settled into a dull throb. He stood and slowly rotated his arm. He\u2019d be better by morning, providing he got something to eat.</p><p>\u201cYour girl called me. Told me you needed help.\u201d She pulled out her phone and began texting.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my . . .\u201d Valiance stood quickly as the pain cleared his head, and his thoughts resumed in a straighter line than before. \u201cMondrian said he\u2019d go after her, and she might be special.\u201d</p><p>Violet looked up from her glowing phone with a raised eyebrow. \u201cLike Wandering special?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But I wouldn\u2019t put it past Mondrian to go after her just to get me to come with him. He never could disobey an order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like there\u2019s a story.\u201d</p><p>Valiance looked across the dark and empty parking lot. \u201cWe went through three wars together, and we got the job done. Mondrian was . . . overzealous on occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the cause was right. Never dull a good blade on an evil purpose. The purpose and the sword will betray you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSound advice.\u201d</p><p>Violet\u2019s phone buzzed in her hands. \u201cThe Cleaners are on their way to get rid of the body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them to box and burn the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid he\u2019ll come back? \u2019Cause I don\u2019t think he\u2019s coming back.\u201d</p><p>Valiance sighed but still relinquished a small smile at her ability to bring levity to every situation. \u201cIt is a show of respect,\u201d he explained. \u201cNow you need to find Esme. Make sure she\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe. No. This, this is all you, honey.\u201d Violet started toward the back of the coffee shop. \u201cI got you out of the trouble that came to you. You have to get out of the trouble that you caused yourself.\u201d</p><p>She threw open the back door, and Valiance had to lengthen his stride to follow her. \u201cWhat are you talking about? There\u2019s a potential innocent about to get attacked by a vampire.\u201d</p><p>They hit the bright lights of the coffee shop, and Valiance flinched and blinked away his enhanced vision. The light hurt his eyes, and the scent of blood on the both of them overwhelmed him. He probably looked like death, yet the few customers just looked at him, then went back to their reading. Maybe this is what Esme felt like all the time?</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>Valiance\u2019s feet stopped as Violet leaned against the counter casually, like a waiting customer.</p><p>He studied her. Six months wasn\u2019t enough to completely decode her. He had no sympathy for her husband. \u201cIs this one of those tests? You\u2019re forcing me to grow up somehow. Listen, I\u2019m a full century older than you. I\u2019m grown. You need to stop being childish and go help a Wanderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? I know her name, and that\u2019s about it. I don\u2019t know what she looks like, what she smells like. How am I supposed to help her?\u201d</p><p>Bastian slid a hot cup of coffee across the pickup area, and Violet sipped it. There was a shimmer in her energy as the hot liquid touched her lips and a glimmer in her eye as she looked back at Valiance, waiting.</p><p>He needed a drink.</p><p>ESME THREW OPEN the door of the little house, and the walls shook.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness, child, no need for\u2014\u201d</p><p>Esme threw her arms around her grandmother\u2019s neck and knocked the words from her as Esme began to sob. Again. She took in a deep, safe breath of her grandmother\u2019s baby-powder scent and tried to focus on that one thing instead of the fifty-seven other things running through her head.</p><p>Her grandmother stroked her hair and cooed in Spanish. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, little bird. It\u2019s okay, palomita. You\u2019re safe here. You\u2019re safe now.\u201d</p><p>Esme let herself be led to the couch and dropped down into the well-worn cushions. The flight response had left her body tired and her bones aching.</p><p>Her grandmother locked the door and kicked down the ash branch that always rested in front of it. Within minutes, Esme\u2019s hands were wrapped around a cup of hot chocolate with a bit of her grandmother\u2019s special spice. One sip, and she immediately calmed down, her mind seemed to focus, and the fear of monsters\u2019 chasing her subsided.</p><p>Her grandmother sat next to her, her knees creaking all the way down. \u201cWhat happened, little bird?\u201d</p><p>The words flew out of her mouth so fast Esme didn\u2019t have time to filter out any of the crazy. \u201cThis guy asked me for coffee and I met him at the same place I always go, and then he got this stony look and said we had to go and I thought he was just ending the date early because I\u2019m not the most interesting person in the world. When he walked me to my car, this guy, like, attacked him, but it was like he couldn\u2019t see me and then he gave me his phone and then this shadow thing knocked him down and he told me to run. So I did and then I called his sister or something and she knew who I was and then I drove home because I got the distinct feeling they wanted to eat me.\u201d</p><p>Esme watched her grandmother process the information, too calm for Esme\u2019s liking. Her grandmother stirred her cocoa. \u201cYou had a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the part of the story you\u2019re paying attention to? These things were monsters. They moved too fast. He moved too fast, and he had a freaking sword down his back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIron or silver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas the blade shiny silver or a dull gray?\u201d</p><p>Fear crept across Esme\u2019s skin despite the hot drink in her hands. She didn\u2019t need to think about it. The image of his pulling the blade out of his coat like a sinister magic trick was burned into her retinas. \u201cDull. Not like the ones in the movies.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her grandmother let out a long breath and muttered something in Spanish Esme didn\u2019t catch. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrink your cocoa, palomita.\u201d</p><p>Esme did as she was told. She relaxed again, swirling the spicy flavor around in her mouth before swallowing.</p> <p>Her grandmother\u2019s eyes focused sharply on Esme. \u201cThe others didn\u2019t see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooked right past me, like I wasn\u2019t even there. But everyone looks past me. Except Val.\u201d That thought kept dancing around her brain. He had seen her. But saying it out loud made the thought even more real and even more frightening.</p><p>\u201cGood to know the magic is still there. I was afraid the spell had worn off.\u201d</p><p>Esme realized she was about to freak out and took the precaution of putting her hot cocoa on the coffee table. \u201cSpell? Abuelita, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all real, my little bird. All the fairy tales I told you. All real.\u201d</p> <p>Esme\u2019s thoughts stopped. She just stared into her grandmother\u2019s brown eyes, which had always held all the answers before. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chupacabra, la llorona, the skin-walkers, all real. And all alive and well in Dallas.\u201d</p><p>The flight response was back and in double force. Esme leapt off the couch and started to pace. Her Mary Janes echoed off the wood floors. \u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur blood is very faint. The magic only surfaces once a generation. Skipped your mother entirely. \u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic?\u201d Esme stopped before her grandmother. \u201cAre you trying to tell me you\u2019re a witch? I\u2019m a witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFairy actually.\u201d</p> <p>Esme laughed. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>A furrow formed between her grandmother\u2019s brow, nestled between her other wrinkles there, and she rose from the couch. \u201cI would never lie about this, palomita. Not now. Not that you\u2019ve been seen by one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeen?\u201d Esme\u2019s entire life flashed before her eyes. Everyone ignored her; she slipped by in every class because the teacher never called on her. She was ignored in movie lines. She\u2019d started wearing steel-toed boots at work because people stepped on her feet so often. Everything clicked in her head. \u201cI\u2019m invisible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my little dove. You burn too brightly. The magic keeps you hidden from those who would take your light. Take another sip of your cocoa.\u201d</p><p>Esme looked down at the table. That clicked, too. \u201cThe spice. Have you been drugging me all these years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Esme. It\u2019s just nutmeg, cayenne, and maybe some ground poppy seed.\u201d He grandmother didn\u2019t meet her eyes, suddenly very interested in the rug beneath them.</p><p>\u201cOh God. You\u2019ve been using magic on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, just a bit of garden magic, palomita. It\u2019s part of our heritage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother grabbed her shoulders and poked a stubby fingernail into Esme\u2019s chest. \u201cYou need to listen to me if you\u2019ve got vampires after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires?\u201d Esme\u2019s knees gave, and her grandmother pushed her toward the chair, where she landed with a jarring bounce. \u201cHe\u2019s a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIron blade. If it were silver, I would have said shifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just went on a date with a vampire.\u201d Even when she said the words out loud, they didn\u2019t feel real. Didn\u2019t jibe with what she knew of vampires. He\u2019d been kind, and opened the door for her, paid for coffee.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t drink it. He\u2019d just spun it as they talked, as he watched her talk. And he\u2019d probably just opened the door for her to see the long line of her neck in the moonlight. See what his next meal was going to look like.</p><p>\u201cBut he saw you,\u201d her grandmother said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, probably as dinner.\u201d Esme pinched the flesh of her pinky, the pain focusing her thoughts as the tip turned bright pink with blood.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d her grandmother said. \u201cHe saw you. He saw through the magic. You said the others didn\u2019t.\u201d Her grandmother smiled. \u201cHis intentions are good, Esme.\u201d</p><p>Esme huffed. \u201cWell, his intentions can stay on his side of town.\u201d</p><p>She rose and brushed past her grandmother as she grabbed her bag and went back to her room and made a spectacular show of slamming her door. She was going to have to find a new place to work, a new coffee shop, and maybe a new life altogether.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cHE\u2019S HERE.\u201d</p><p>Valiance could smell his blood on the wind. Mondrian had always been good at tracking, but Valiance had never fully appreciated his brother\u2019s skills until his scent stopped right outside a house with a magical border around it a mile thick. The white stones around Esme\u2019s house glowed in the moonlight, creating a boundary around the property Valiance was sure he couldn\u2019t even get through.</p><p>Violet crouched beside him. \u201cThink we just confirmed your girl is family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my . . .\u201d Valiance dropped it. Violet wasn\u2019t going to stop, and he didn\u2019t have the breath to waste.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Valiance had to shift his weight to accommodate the fire burning down his injured leg. \u201cWait him out. And then you can see if she\u2019s okay tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the Valiance I saw stand up against his Clade Source.\u201d</p><p>Valiance clenched his jaw, and the entire back of his head lit up like a lightning storm, all bright lights and pain. His jaw was still throbbing though he\u2019d set it himself on the way over here. The blood from the crack on the back of his head was dried now and made the leather of his sheath itchy.</p><p>Violet winced for him. \u201cYou need to feed, don\u2019t you? It\u2019s why you\u2019re not healing. Not enough of your own power to heal yourself. Isn\u2019t that how it works?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou volunteering?\u201d</p><p>Violet finally shut up for two seconds, so he could think. Mondrian wouldn\u2019t be able to get through that border, especially if his intentions were to hurt Esme. But even if Valiance was right and Mondrian couldn\u2019t see Esme, he might be able to see her grandmother.</p><p>Valiance might be able to make it through the border. Make sure they were okay. But if Esme had seen three seconds of what happened in the parking lot, she was never going speak to him again, let alone invite him in to wait out the night against another vampire.</p><p>His head dropped down to his chest. His true colors had shown through, and she\u2019d seen them and ran.</p><p>\u201cI smell pity,\u201d Violet said.</p><p>\u201cYou smell a man realizing he should have stayed in the shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Self-pity. Smells a little like rotten milk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you always so campy?\u201d He looked over at his Prima.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes, actually. But I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>Violet jumped and reached for the glowing cell phone in her back pocket. \u201cJust when things were getting good.\u201d She sighed as sat down on the cold ground. \u201cHello. What? Now? I\u2019m kinda in the middle of something, Nash. Oh, well talk about burying the lead. Of course. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>Violet hung up the phone, and her energy danced around her. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Valiance snapped.</p><p>\u201cKandice just went into labor a month early. I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a hostile vampire hunting innocents in the city.\u201d</p><p>Violet patted him on the back. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got my best Riko on the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiko? That\u2019s a shifter title.\u201d</p><p>Violet ran her fingers through her long hair as she pulled it back into a ponytail. She slipped off her tennis shoes and shoved them in her messenger bag. \u201cI\u2019m a shifter. The words are pretty. Do you accept?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccept what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rules and responsibilities of being the warrior and the protector of the pack?\u201d She zipped up her jacket against the cold wind. She dropped her personal borders, and her power sizzled around them. \u201cDo you accept?\u201d</p><p>Valiance knew you didn\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d to Violet, and even if you did, it didn\u2019t stay a \u201cno.\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful. From what I\u2019ve heard, there\u2019s a vampire going around and attacking innocents. Take care of it. Call Tucker if you can\u2019t handle it.\u201d</p><p>Violet winked. In a blur of black and a whirl of energy, her panther form streaked down the street in the direction of downtown before Valiance could even manage a protest.</p><p>He clenched his jaw, and the pain flared again. \u201cI don\u2019t have my cell phone,\u201d he finally said to the wind.</p><p>\u201cTold you she wasn\u2019t worth it.\u201d Mondrian appeared in the street before Valiance, his hands casually in his pockets.</p><p>Valiance rose. The slick red over Mondrian\u2019s lips was unmistakable, even in the dim glow from the streetlights. He\u2019d gotten a chance to feed. It was like hitting a reset button on the evening. He\u2019d be faster now, stronger than Valiance who barely had anything, power or blood, left.</p><p>\u201cThe Prima trusts us to clean up our own messes.\u201d</p><p>Anger made the angles along Mondrian\u2019s face sharper, uglier. \u201cIs that what I am? A mess to clean up?\u201d</p><p>Valiance walked out onto the street, hiding the wince of every step. \u201cDestroyed my evening.\u201d</p><p>Mondrian looked at the small house. \u201cSo your girl is special?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to kill me, your own brother, to protect her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The honesty rang through Valiance and made the sword on his back hum with anticipation.</p><p>Valiance saw another figure in the darkness. Female. Older. And completely under the sway. He recognized the glassy eyes of the woman as she stumbled this way and that. Like a marionette on strings, she danced how Mondrian wanted her to dance.</p><p>Valiance didn\u2019t have time to get her before she fell to her knees beside the white stone periphery of the house, her teeth snapping against each other as she dropped. Where a vampire couldn\u2019t touch the protective border, an innocent human would have no problem pulling a stone out of place to break the spell.</p><p>He ran for her, but Mondrian met him in the middle of the street. His brother slammed against him with the force of a semitruck, and they flew down the street. Valiance landed hard on the pavement, with his brother on top of him, and they rolled, both struggling for the upper hand.</p><p>There was a distinct clap of flesh meeting something solid, but it didn\u2019t come from him.</p><p>Valiance looked over from his position beneath Mondrian to see an old woman with a baseball bat standing over the limp body of the puppet woman. It had to be Esme\u2019s grandmother, the abuelita she spoke so lovingly about, wielding the bat like Babe Ruth himself.</p><p>The older woman\u2019s courage gave Valiance the kick he needed. He threw Mondrian over his head and jumped to his feet. He used the last of his energy to enhance himself, heal his leg, and give his muscles the strength they needed to wield his sword.</p><p>\u201cKeep the circle,\u201d he called out to the old woman.</p><p>The woman yelled something back at him. But he missed it when his eyes landed on Esme standing in the doorway of their small house. The entire world stopped for a moment, and he was caught up in the sight of her. Her dark hair unbound, her cheeks flushed, she glowed in the doorway of her home with her tear-filled eyes.</p><p>He heard Mondrian\u2019s sword sing as it cut through the air behind him. Valiance ducked and felt the wind of the attack against his hair.</p><p>Valiance swung his arm back hard, and Mondrian\u2019s ribs cracked under his blow. He turned around sharply and swept Mondrian\u2019s legs out from underneath him. The other vampire bounced against the concrete like a rubber ball. Valiance caught his shirt in his fist and threw him at the protective spell.</p><p>Mondrian slammed against the magical border and sizzled and seized within the white energy before being thrown across the street into a car. There was no alarm, just Mondrian\u2019s long groan.</p><p>Valiance tried not to smile, but it was the first break he\u2019d gotten all evening.</p><p>He turned back to the house, where Esme and her grandmother were together on the porch. He walked over to the edge of the white stones but didn\u2019t dare step across. He looked at Esme. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem here,\u201d her grandmother said, her grip still tight on the bat.</p><p>\u201cStay inside. I\u2019ll be right\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mondrian\u2019s boot landed square between Valiance\u2019s shoulders, and he flew forward through the white-stone protective spell and landed hard on the frozen ground of her front yard.</p><p>Mondrian\u2019s hand clamped down on Valiance\u2019s ankle and raked him back along the ground. As Valiance struggled to stop, he felt the protection spell break around him as he pulled a white stone from its place, like the pop of an electrical transformer.</p><p>Mondrian ripped him from the ground and threw Valiance into the same car that had broken his own fall. Valiance let gravity take him and slid down to the pavement. He couldn\u2019t feel his legs for a moment and fell forward to his knees, seeing nothing but stars.</p><p>He leaned back against the car and shook the celestial array from his vision. He had to blink a few times for his sight to focus.</p><p>Mondrian was already on the porch. He grabbed Esme\u2019s grandmother and locked an arm around her neck, swinging her petite frame around like a rag doll.</p><p>He was less than a foot away from Esme, who had plastered herself against the outside wall next to the door.</p><p>His brother didn\u2019t need to yell; the wind carried his threats fine enough. \u201cBet she never goes out with you again if you let her grandmother die.\u201d</p><p>Mondrian cloaked him and her grandmother in darkness and blurred away into the night.</p><p>Valiance tried to push himself up against the car, but the power was gone. He fell to the concrete. He couldn\u2019t breathe. Everything hurt, but it wasn\u2019t over. He might not have his unnatural strength, but he was still breathing. He wouldn\u2019t stop fighting until he stopped breathing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Slowly, he pushed himself up to his feet and stumbled to the edge of the yard. He carefully put the stone he\u2019d dragged out of alignment back into place.</p><p>He looked up to see Esme still standing on the porch, like a frightened statue, only her wide eyes following him across the yard.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where the locking stone is?\u201d he asked. He started to walk the periphery. He didn\u2019t know much about this kind of magic, but he knew the locking stone needed to be recharged if the border was going to go up.</p> <p>Esme didn\u2019t answer, just watched him.</p><p>He kept walking. Fairy magic wasn\u2019t foreign to him; he was one, for Christ\u2019s sake. The glamour, the seeing of the unseen. The taking and giving of natural magic. Granted, he was the darker distant cousin of what normal people thought as fey, but the same principles applied. Too bad he\u2019d never dabbled too much in garden magic.</p><p>It could have been his raw state, but as he passed the corner stone in the yard, a power sort of tickled at his ankle. He knelt. Well, it was supposed to be a kneel, but really he fell forward, landing next to a larger than average white stone half-buried in the yard.</p><p>He put his hand on the stone, and it was warm. A normal fae could probably just push power into the stone, but he was a vampire. It had to be blood with him.</p><p>He looked down at his hand to find a small trickle seeping from a wound on his knuckles. He smeared it against the stone. The periphery jumped back to life, like plugging back in a line of Christmas lights. What did you know? He did have it in him.</p> <p>He had to take a deep breath before he pushed himself to his feet. When he did, Esme was standing right next to him. The spell between them didn\u2019t prevent him from smelling the flowers in her hair or seeing the bright sparkle in her eyes from the fearful tears that stayed wavering on the edge.</p><p>\u201cWhere did he take her?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI do not know. But I will get her back.\u201d</p><p>Esme looked him over from head to toe. \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me much except that you\u2019re a . . .\u201d</p><p>Valiance cringed. He didn\u2019t want her to say the word; it would kill everything within him to hear the disdain in her voice.</p><p>\u201cThat you can see me because you\u2019re a good guy.\u201d</p> <p>Valiance felt like he could breathe again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better come inside. You don\u2019t look so good. And someone\u2019s going to notice that car.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWe need to find your grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbuelita is strong, apparently stronger than I ever gave her credit for. You need help before you go and get yourself flattened. Again.\u201d</p><p>SHE TOOK HIM into the kitchen, but when she flipped on the light, he flipped it off right behind her. It left the only light in the small room the glow from the stove top and the moonlight that filtered in from the small window.</p><p>Fear sizzled down her spine as she went to the far side of the room to get the first-aid kit. However, all the fear turned to a kind of strange excitement as she watched him gingerly take off his jacket and his shredded dress shirt, exposing the sword running down the length of his back. His shoulders were broader than any man\u2019s she\u2019d ever seen, and the handle of the sword seemed to wink at her in the moonlight streaming in from the windows.</p><p>He slowly walked across the kitchen to the sink and began to wash his hands.</p><p>She grabbed a few towels for him and quickly set them beside him before scurrying back to her place at the end of the counter.</p> <p>She could see pain in his eyes as he moved. He slowly dried his hands. He wetted the towel and held it to his face, wiping off some of the dried blood and sweat.</p><p>He drew in a tired breath before he spoke, his voice low, soft. \u201cDo you still have my phone? I think I need to call for help.\u201d</p><p>Esme had to think. The encounter already seemed like a lifetime ago. \u201cIt\u2019s in my purse.\u201d She scooted around him quickly and dashed into her room to find it.</p><p>The foreign phone was easy to find in her familiar purse, and she slipped back into the kitchen swiftly, setting the phone between them on the counter.</p><p>Valiance took it and popped it open. He hit a few buttons and growled as he put the phone to his ear. At least, it sounded like a growl. \u201cNo answer.\u201d</p><p>Esme gulped. \u201cSo no backup?\u201d</p><p>Valiance turned around and leaned against the kitchen counter. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said that too many times.\u201d</p><p>Valiance turned his blue eyes to hers. \u201cI am sorry, Esme. I never meant to . . .\u201d</p><p>Her spine stiffened, and the words that came out of her were hers but from someplace within her she wasn\u2019t familiar with yet, someplace jarred loose from this evening\u2019s activities. \u201cIt\u2019s too early in the evening for apologies. What do you need to get her back?\u201d</p><p>Valiance sighed. He walked over to the table and sat down, looking much smaller than he had just moments ago as he put his bruised face into his hands.</p><p>He was less than two feet away, and she swore that every cell within her pulled toward him, pulled toward the fragility draped across his shoulders.</p><p>The decision solidified within her as she spoke words that were hers but not hers. \u201cI\u2019m willing.\u201d Her voice was barely a whisper across the kitchen.</p><p>His steel blue eyes were grayer now, as if the color had drained out of them, along with his blood, as he looked up at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Her voice was stronger as she reached for the unused first-aid kit. She cut an appropriate-sized piece of gauze. \u201cI mean I think I know what you need. Abuelita told me stories about people like you. You need blood to heal, and I can\u2019t find my abuelita without you.\u201d</p><p>She ripped off four pieces of tape and dangled them over the edge of the kitchen counter. Then she rolled up the sleeve of her jacket and held out her arm. \u201cI trust her, and the only thing she said to me tonight that made any sense was that you wouldn\u2019t be able to see me if you really wanted to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>His cool fingers reached out and slid around the inside of her wrist, just holding it gently. Goose bumps shot up her arm, and she gulped.</p><p>\u201cI made a promise to myself that I . . .\u201d He was so exhausted, he couldn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had to make promises to myself. I\u2019ve never had anything this horrible ever happen before.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her pale wrist as he stroked it with his finger. \u201cYou think I\u2019m horrible.\u201d</p><p>She took in a deep breath, trying to calm the stammering of her heart. Her words might be brave, but her body was still catching on to the idea. \u201cNo. But as far as first dates go, I\u2019m sure this is up there with the worst ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was selfish of me. I just wanted to have a pleasant evening with a pretty girl.\u201d</p><p>His words caused a flutter in her stomach. She tried to convince herself he would say anything right now to get blood, but she couldn\u2019t believe it. Especially after he looked up at her, his skin paper white in the dim light. The heavy look in his eyes made her forget about the press of sharp white on his lower lip.</p><p>\u201cEsme, I . . .\u201d</p><p>She cut him off. \u201cI did nothing, Valiance.\u201d The name those men had called him fit better as she said it out loud. It was more him than the abbreviation. Even more regal than the name on his credit card.</p><p>Esme went on. \u201cHe was three feet away from me, and I froze. I couldn\u2019t even move until after he\u2019d already taken her. I need to do this. I failed in my first attempt at bravery. I will not fail in my second. I will not fail her.\u201d</p><p>His hand tightened on her wrist, and he pulled her down the edge of the counter until she stood before him. Her pulse raced in her ears as he leaned forward, his forehead almost resting against her breasts as he pulled something off the counter behind her. He pressed that something into her right hand as he pulled away.</p><p>She looked down at the silver knife. \u201cWill this really do any damage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sharp enough to ensure I stop.\u201d</p><p>Esme curled her fingers around the handle though she wasn\u2019t sure she could use it on him.</p><p>His eyes trailed down to her tender wrist, still in his hand, as he sat back down on the chair before her. \u201cI promise this will not hurt much.\u201d</p><p>When his lips touched her arm, heat flew up her wrist and burned into her core. She barely felt the slice of his teeth against her skin. She was more focused on the other hand he slid around her waist, pulling her closer to him, keeping her still.</p><p>His tongue began to coax out the blood, undulating slowly against her skin. Not that he needed to work much, her stammering heart was rushing blood to all her extremities and warming every part of her.</p><p>She leaned back against the cabinets, and her eyes fluttered shut. Immediately, her thoughts traveled to what else he could do with that tongue, where else it might have the same flushing effect.</p><p>He gripped her waist tighter, and the pressure on her arm increased. She gasped as she felt a stronger pull of blood out of her veins.</p><p>\u201cVal,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>When his fingers began to dig into her arm, she gasped, and cool fear fought the intense heat that had spread throughout her.</p><p>\u201cVal,\u201d she repeated. She tried to pull her arm back, but his grip was too strong.</p><p>\u201cValiance,\u201d she cried out.</p><p>He was standing above her in less than a blink. His eyes were livid blue with blown pupils, and his mouth was stained red. His body pressed her against the counter, and she was awash in the smell of blood and sweat. The monster was here, and still hungry.</p><p>But just as fast as he had risen, Esme had the knife to his throat. The flash of the silver blade dug into the pale skin, and her eyes steadily gazed into his dark pools. Her heartbeat steadied, and she let out a long breath. That other part, that braver part, saved her and settled in for the evening.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d she ordered.</p><p>Valiance did as he was told, and the moment he was in the chair, he looked away.</p><p>Esme looked down at her wrist to see nothing more than an inch-long slice on her lower forearm. It wasn\u2019t like the movies at all, probably wouldn\u2019t even scar, but then again, she didn\u2019t need anything to remind her of what happened tonight. She grabbed the bandage and taped up the small wound, keeping her fist to her chest to stop any bleeding.</p><p>He was looking down, away, his neck exposed.</p><p>She watched the fair flesh come back together at his cheek, mend itself until it was a bruised reminder of what had happened earlier. Esme couldn\u2019t believe the magic before her eyes. That a little bit of her blood could do all that wonder. Maybe she really was something special.</p><p>\u201cValiance?\u201d She kept her voice soft as she reached out to his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked, still looking away from her.</p><p>\u201cYou were the one pulverized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Esme.\u201d When he looked up at her, she\u2019d never felt so seen. His blue eyes glowed with power, and everything about him was perfect. The bruises on his cheeks were gone. He looked rested, flushed even. His cheekbones could cut leather, and his lips were the most perfect shade of rose.</p><p>He still wasn\u2019t as beautiful as when he had smiled at her in the coffee shop the first time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she finally managed.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t look at me like that.\u201d He stood and strode across the kitchen to a darker corner.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of the blood, part of the glamour. It attracts, and I feed. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe power makes you pretty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes me attractive, so I can feed.\u201d He licked his lips of any red still left there. \u201cAnd you\u2019re fey, right? I wasn\u2019t really sure.\u201d</p><p>Esme grew colder as she thought about the why of his perfection and that he was tasting the magic in her blood. She shivered. \u201cBut you\u2019re faster, stronger, too. I mean, I saw you fight that other vampire, and you were\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome days, the other perks aren\u2019t worth it.\u201d</p><p>She tried to lighten the mood, get the conversation going again because the guilt that shaded his eyes struck a pain through her heart, and the last thing she needed right now was a sullen vampire on her hands. \u201cDid you know that to her family and friends, Emily Dickinson was more known for her gardening than her writing, and she would send bouquets to her friends with poems attached?\u201d</p><p>Valiance frowned, but his expression slowly turned into a smile. \u201cYou really do like that poetry class you\u2019re taking.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, relieved, and started packing up the first-aid kit. \u201cI just relate to them. All the great ones looked in from the outside. We loners have to stick together.\u201d She thought she heard him chuckle from the other side of the kitchen. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d</p><p>Valiance looked down at his hands, his long fingers, and turned them over to inspect them. He rubbed his chin and tested it. \u201cI should be able to track him down now. He\u2019s not a strategist, so he\u2019ll go where he feels safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will he do with my abuelita?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. He\u2019s still trying to get me to go with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about kidnapping my abuelita will convince you to go with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. Just managed to piss me off really. You don\u2019t touch grandmothers. They are universally off-limits in the rules of engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRules of engagement? You sound like one of those old generals in a Civil War movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was one of those generals in the Civil War.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That meant he was old. Like really old. She let the fear wash over her again before she took a deep breath and just integrated it with what she knew about him. He opened doors, he drank blood, he fought to protect her, and he was older than her grandmother.</p><p>It was more interesting than her list of traits: inviso-girl. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Esme put away the first-aid kit and rolled down her sleeve. \u201cSo what do we need to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my grandmother. I\u2019m going after her. Don\u2019t exactly know what I can do as the invisible girl, but I\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p> <p>Valiance stepped out of the darkness and into the light from the stove. Gold fell across his perfect features, and her breath caught in her throat as he continued toward her.</p><p>Even his voice was smoother now, deeper, softer. \u201cI want you to be sure about this, Esme. Once you\u2019ve seen violence, seen evil, it changes you, and I don\u2019t want to be the reason you see the world a little darker.\u201d</p><p>Esme\u2019s skin flushed with his words and with his scent as it beat around them both. \u201cWhat\u2019s your real name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat thing called you Valiance, but it\u2019s not the name on your credit card. What\u2019s your real name?\u201d</p> <p>Valiance licked his lower lip.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She was honest. \u201cValiance sounds made up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d</p><p>Esme looked up and tried to fight a smile. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Clade Source Emilio, the one who made me, renamed us into our new life. One word to describe us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd yours was Valiance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarrior prince, he used to call me.\u201d</p><p>Esme knew that no other name could suit him. \u201cLike the fairy tale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fairy tale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying you are,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI\u2019m simply saying that it\u2019s like a fairy tale. Like everything else that\u2019s come true tonight. And if vampires and fairies can be real, then I think we have a good chance of getting my abuelita back.\u201d</p><p>Valiance watched her for a long moment, then went to get his jacket from the kitchen chair. His movements were fluid, smooth, not the jerky pain from before. \u201cThere are three places he might go. The apartment, the shop, or this warehouse off Industrial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Let\u2019s go find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need more of a plan than just knocking on the door.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I knock?\u201d she asked. Her stomach tightened. Where would an insane plan like that come from?</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Esme licked her lips. \u201cWhat if I knock, he doesn\u2019t see me, and I sneak in? Distract him somehow?\u201d</p><p>Valiance thought. It took him a long time, and Esme was suddenly nervous. What did she know about covert ops and rescue missions? It was probably a ridiculous idea that might lead straight to her death. Or worse, her grandmother\u2019s.</p><p>Slowly, a smile spread across his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re the same girl I asked out for coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been through a lot this evening. I\u2019m not the same girl I was five minutes ago. I woke up this morning a normal human girl with low self-esteem, and now I\u2019m some fairy who\u2019s invisible to bad guys. Who knows what I might be by dawn?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. That one deep laugh as he looked at her. \u201cWe need to get going. Can you drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you walk everywhere? You can\u2019t drive a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver a hundred and fifty years old, and I still can\u2019t get the hang of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have a cell phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like texting.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>VALIANCE WAS HAVING a hard time sitting still in the front seat of her car. The power, the energy that flowed through him, was like nothing he\u2019d ever had before. The little bit of blood that he had taken had given him more power than he\u2019d had in a decade. Everything smelled sweeter, everything felt softer. His muscles tingled anxiously, waiting for action again. Not only was she a fairy, but she was powerful one.</p><p>When his cell phone rang, he jumped in the passenger seat, and Esme swerved.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Valiance looked at the caller ID and put it on speakerphone. \u201cTalk quick. Phone\u2019s almost dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took Esme\u2019s grandmother. We\u2019re hunting him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d volunteer to send Chaz, but there\u2019s a swarm of ghouls tearing up some butcher shop in Oak Cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your night is going well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever a dull moment. How\u2019s your girl holding up?\u201d</p><p>Valiance looked over at the driver\u2019s seat. He wanted to say Esme was the most luminous thing he had ever seen. But it was only a first date. Maybe all first dates were like this, minus the kidnapping and bloodletting.</p><p>Esme beat him to it. \u201cWe are going to get my grandmother back, then you and I are going to discuss getting me a job at the coffee shop.\u201d</p><p>The phone line was quiet for a moment. \u201cWell, Bastian is really the manager there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of folding towels, and I\u2019m sure the owner could put in a good word for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVal, take me off speaker.\u201d</p><p>Valiance did as he was told, prepared to get an earful.</p><p>Instead, Violet only said. \u201cKeep her, please. You don\u2019t meet a girl every day who can just fall into violence and still be confident enough to backtalk the Prima of a city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep her. Sounds like you\u2019ve got some pretty good backup. But if you really need help, send up a flare, and I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Valiance hung up but looked down at the phone in his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat didn\u2019t I know?\u201d Esme asked.</p><p>Valiance licked his lips as he prepared his words. \u201cViolet\u2019s not just a coffee-shop owner. She\u2019s the most powerful Wanderer in the region. Possibly in the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just told her she needed to get you a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Valiance smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re just nothing that I\u2019ve seen before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nothing anyone has ever seen before apparently.\u201d Esme flashed him a smile as she continued down the highway.</p><p>ESME PARKED ALONG the curb. It was an older neighborhood she had never been to before. Just another example of her universe expanding this evening.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to my second home,\u201d Valiance said as he pointed to the shop across the street. Emilio\u2019s Antiques was a restored home in a long line of restored homes turned into shopfronts. If this looked like a normal shop, she wondered how many other places her grandmother had dragged her to were also run by things that went bump in the night.</p><p>Suddenly, Valiance turned to stone in the passenger seat next to her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here, isn\u2019t he?\u201d she whispered, as if Mondrian could hear them.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Valiance said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to feel him like this before. Forgot how much of an effect we have on each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means he knows we\u2019re here, too. So much for the element of surprise.\u201d She sighed. \u201cWhat about me? Can you feel me in your head since I\u2019m supposed to be magical or something?\u201d</p><p>He looked over at her. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he whispered. \u201cMy head\u2019s a little funny around you anyway.\u201d</p><p>Esme bit her lower lip and suddenly found the edge of her jacket very interesting. This was now officially the worst best date ever.</p><p>Valiance turned to her in the car. It was a bit comical, his long legs twisted up in the front of her VW, as he reached down by his boot to unlace a bowie knife from his calf. \u201cWhen we get in there, your only goal needs to be getting your abuelita out of there.\u201d</p><p>The skin tightened along her shoulders as his perfect accent caressed the familiar word.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to knock on the door.\u201d</p><p>Esme laughed. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely. You knock on the front door, and I\u2019ll go in through the back door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he\u2019s got both covered somehow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hide. I\u2019ll fight. Now take this.\u201d He shoved the leather-sheathed knife at her. \u201cHe will get violent. Ultimately, he wants me to come back with him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means he doesn\u2019t care about me and abuelita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Valiance sighed.</p><p>\u201cSo we protect ourselves and leave you to the wolf?\u201d</p><p>Valiance looked into her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to survive. I want you to live with all your parts in place. I\u2019m not leaving you in there like a coward. If I\u2019ve discovered anything about myself in the past four hours, it\u2019s that I am not a coward.\u201d</p><p>Valiance blurred before her, and his lips were upon hers before she could finish her thought. His lips were warm but hesitant. He slid his hand up to hold her jaw but didn\u2019t deepen the embrace.</p><p>Her body hummed like a fluorescent bulb. Energy danced along her skin with the novelty of being kissed in the front seat of her car like a high schooler, something she hadn\u2019t actually had done as a high schooler.</p><p>She kissed him back, taking in more of his soft lips, tasting the slight copper of him. She burned the taste of him into her brain, the warmth that pulsed against her. Their warmth, she thought again. Her bravery had brought him back to life.</p><p>He was the one who pulled away, and when he did, she knew he was different, changed from the moment before to the moment after. Everything she\u2019d ever read about warriors flashed through her mind, and she had half a notion to give him a token as he went off to war.</p><p>Valiance licked his lips, leaving them shiny in the moonlight and completely distracting. \u201cYou knock on the front door. I\u2019ll go in through the back, and we\u2019ll meet in the middle.\u201d</p><p>Esme looked ahead and tried to focus on the plan. Knock on the door and sneak in. But as she shifted in the seat again, his arm brushed against hers, and all she could think of was his lips on hers and how she wanted to do that again.</p><p>\u201cEsme?\u201d</p><p>She could feel his breath on her neck. \u201cYes?\u201d She gulped as she stared at the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re glowing.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her hands, held out before her. They looked like her hands, all normal and small. \u201cI think you might be seeing things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d He turned the rearview mirror toward her, and she could see what he had seen. Like someone had sprinkled her with candlelight, there was a slight illumination to her skin. And there was a sparkle in her eyes that wasn\u2019t normally there.</p><p>Her gaze snapped over to Valiance. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>Valiance shrugged and put the rearview back where it had been. \u201cI only know one fairy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd does she glow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when she\u2019s happy.\u201d</p><p>Esme looked away but fought the urge to bury her hands in her face. \u201cSo much for being dark and exotic and not pathetic at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDark and exotic has nothing on you.\u201d</p><p>Esme tried to bite back the smile that accompanied the butterflies in her stomach. She didn\u2019t think that one human could feel so much in one moment. Fear for her grandmother, embarrassed that he could see right through her, and complete admiration for the man in the seat next to her.</p><p>But then again, she wasn\u2019t all human, so maybe this was just par for the course.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better get going.\u201d</p><p>He hurried out of the car and swooped around to the driver\u2019s side to open her door for her. He offered his hand to help her out. She knew that she shouldn\u2019t be smiling, but she did as she slid her hand into his. It was warm, soft, and gave her just enough support as she exited.</p><p>It was a horribly outdated gesture, but effective. It gave Esme the distinct feeling that this was still a date. There might still be some hope, providing they survived the night.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>VALIANCE STILLED HIMSELF at the back of the building and drew the darkness around him. It was an old talent he hadn\u2019t used in a while and the power, the glamour, was hard to hold.</p><p>He locked his eyes on Esme. She\u2019d taken a position at the front of the building and was leaning against the wall, her head against the brickwork as she prayed. He watched her cross herself and close her eyes. Her rose lips muttered a prayer</p><p>For the first time in a century, Valiance prayed, too. It wasn\u2019t to God or anything. It was just to the wind and the dirt. He didn\u2019t know any blessings or anything. He kept it simple. Keep Esme safe. If you gave her this power, then keep her safe so she can learn how to use it.</p><p>The wind carried Esme\u2019s floral scent to him, and for a moment, he thought maybe the wind had heard him. Maybe the wind was at their back. Maybe the earth was a fan of grandmothers as well.</p><p>Esme let out a long breath and fluttered her eyes open to look back at him. Despite his cloak of darkness, Esme waved and gave him a thumbs-up. With a soft smile, she slipped around the front of the building.</p><p>She was going to be something amazing, and every ounce of him wanted to be there when it happened.</p><p>Valiance squared his shoulders and turned the hilt of his sword over in his hand before finding a grip. He walked softly up to the back door and surveyed it. Carefully, he reached out and touched the door handle. No electrical charge. Not iron. No precautions.</p><p>Did Mondrian want to get caught? Was a part of him asking Valiance to kill him to get it over with? There was only one way this was going to play out. One.</p><p>He closed his eyes and listened, with a capital \u201cL,\u201d for Esme to knock on the front door.</p><p>The sharp rap on the door echoed through the building. Valiance counted to ten before he turned the knob and pulled open the door.</p><p>The explosion lifted him up and off the ground. The flames burned his jacket, and his fair eyebrows were forfeit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The chain-link fence at the back of the property cradled him like a wiry catcher\u2019s mitt, and he rolled forward onto the ground. He landed on his knees, and his lungs smoldered as he tried to catch his breath.</p><p>Mondrian wasn\u2019t going to give Valiance those brief seconds to recoup. He charged toward Valiance, his sword slashing out before him. Valiance had moments to flatten himself against the ground to avoid the edge of the blade.</p><p>Valiance grabbed Mondrian\u2019s leg and jerked him to the ground. Mondrian crashed, and his sword was knocked out of his hand.</p> <p>Valiance shook the ringing from his ears before he went on the offensive. He jumped to his feet and darted to where his own sword rested in the long grass. The sword vibrated in his hand as if agreeing to his purpose.</p><p>It took Valiance one thought, one flash of a second to let his power consume him, let his energy enhance everything about him, heal his burns, and adjust his eyes to the dim lighting in the yard. The thought that this energy was Esme\u2019s fueled him further; that he was doing this for her made him stronger</p><p>Mondrian still searched for his sword. \u201cDidn\u2019t peg you to come alone. Thought you\u2019d have that pussy Prima of yours.\u201d</p><p>Valiance waited. His brother might have taken the wrong path, but he still deserved an honorable death. \u201cYou\u2019re stalling. You always get mean when you stall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stalling. I\u2019ve got \u2019til dawn to convince you to come home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy home is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur place in Atlanta is amazing. The old family seat, Valiance. It really would be Thomas Valmont coming home.\u201d</p><p>Atlanta. The memories were so far gone that Valiance\u2019s mind fogged trying to recall them. For a moment, he saw himself happy. He saw himself with his family, with his grandmere on the porch, her soft sweet smile as she hummed into her needlepoint.</p><p>Valiance shook the memory from his head. His grandmere was dead. The house had been burned in one bout of violence or another. There was no home for him there anymore because there was no family there anymore. He wasn\u2019t Thomas Valmont anymore.</p><p>Just as Valiance was about to say that, Mondrian slammed into him. Valiance doubled over the man\u2019s shoulder and rammed the hilt of his sword into Mondrian\u2019s spine. The man cried out and crumpled beneath him.</p><p>Valiance kept hold of his sword as the fight became a twisted mesh of swinging arms and wrestling legs. Once they regained their footing, Valiance always had the upper hand; his sword did not fail him. Mondrian\u2019s grunts punctuated the heavy staccato of metal on metal.</p> <p>Valiance spun Mondrian\u2019s sword off into the darkness, only adding fire to his fury. As Mondrian set up for another attack, Valiance watched as his friend, his brother, disappeared and was replaced by a monster. Valiance would mourn later, only after he\u2019d put him out of his misery.</p><p>Valiance cried out into the darkness as he ran at the man. There was another exchange of blows. This demon was fast, but Valiance was smart. He tasted blood, smelled blood, but his energy, her power, was a fire that ran through him.</p><p>The sound of a car door distracted Valiance for a moment, and in that one moment, Mondrian pinned him to the ground. His lips were pulled away from his sharpened teeth, and his eyes burned with a dark fire. A kind of dark Valiance hadn\u2019t seen since, well, since the demon he and Violet had taken out six months ago.</p><p>Until Violet, he had never known true darkness.</p><p>Until Esme, he\u2019d never known true light.</p><p>\u201cI will never go back.\u201d</p><p>Mondrian\u2019s Master spoke. \u201cWhat have you got that\u2019s worth dying for?\u201d</p><p>For the first time, he was honest with his brother, and the wind and the stars that shone down on him. \u201cHope.\u201d Hope in her. Hope in his city. Hope that someday he could be that man.</p> <p>\u201cPfft,\u201d the Master said. \u201cHope is a city in Arkansas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope is a thing with feathers.\u201d</p><p>Mondrian\u2019s blade flashed above them. The sword made a sickening thud as it sank into the back of Mondrian\u2019s neck.</p><p>The man reared up and spun on his invisible attacker.</p><p>Esme screamed and ran.</p><p>Valiance jumped to his feet. He grabbed the handle of the sword and pulled it out of Mondrian\u2019s neck. The force pushed Mondrian off balance, but he still stumbled in Esme\u2019s general direction, his claws lashing out into the night, his head dangling by his windpipe.</p><p>Using gravity and the sheer need for this to be over, Valiance swung the blade over his head to deliver the last strong blow to Mondrian\u2019s neck.</p><p>Blood sprayed the small yard as Mondrian\u2019s body fell lifeless to the ground. His head rolled but found a resting place in a soft patch of weeds.</p><p>Valiance\u2019s chest heaved as his heart raced. His arm dangled at his side as he looked at the still body. For the second time that night, he found himself praying. Keep him. Take his energy back into the earth and remember him, remember what he was.</p><p>That\u2019s when Esme started screaming.</p><p>Valiance dropped his sword and rushed to her. \u201cAre you okay? Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>Esme burrowed her face into his chest and shook. He wrapped his arms around her and felt every ounce of his fight response seep away, replaced by a warm pulse, her pulse. It was only when he realized he\u2019d synced to her heartbeat that he let her go. Her fingers were wound tightly in his cotton shirt, so he couldn\u2019t go far.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Esme. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Her wide brown eyes were not filled with tears, but her body still shook. \u201cI just killed someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, you just injured him really bad.\u201d</p><p>A strand of her dark hair fell across her forehead and caught in her lashes. \u201cBut he\u2019s dead. I did that.\u201d</p><p>Valiance reached up and pushed the errant strand of hair behind her ear. He\u2019d been wanting to do that all night.</p><p>Esme frowned slightly. \u201cAnd I did it to protect you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou did. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Esme smiled, then her entire body shook.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your abuelita?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the car with the bowie knife. She told me I needed to rescue you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems you have.\u201d</p><p>Esme closed her eyes and took in a long breath as she rested her head on his chest. Valiance\u2019s eyes closed as he reveled in the heat of her, the pulse of her, so close and so unafraid of him. This was a quiet he could get used to.</p><p>Slowly, the shaking stopped. \u201cIt\u2019s grass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just rolling around in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the deeper smell. I thought it was just a cologne or something, but that\u2019s the real you. The underneath you. A vampire that smells like fresh-cut grass.\u201d</p><p>Valiance couldn\u2019t stop smiling; his cheeks were beginning to ache with it. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t notice it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I smell like? My deeper smell.\u201d</p><p>He knew part of this was the trauma talking. He took the opportunity to run his arm around her shoulders and begin to nudge her slowly toward the front of the house.</p><p>\u201cWildflowers. Sun-warmed wildflowers.\u201d</p><p>They cleared the backyard, and Esme\u2019s fingers finally unfurled from his shirt.</p><p>\u201cI guess for a fairy, smelling like flowers isn\u2019t very original.\u201d Esme pulled away from him and seemed steady enough to walk on her own.</p><p>\u201cI can with all honesty say that I\u2019ve never heard someone quote Emily Dickinson before delivering a deathblow.\u201d</p><p>Esme stopped and put her face in her hands.</p><p>Valiance\u2019s stomach tied up in knots. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said quickly.</p><p>Esme started to softly chuckle. \u201cNo,\u201d she said as she dropped her hands from her face and shrugged. \u201cI guess that\u2019s what I do in times of action. Something else I learned about myself today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the grand total?\u201d</p><p>They stopped by Esme\u2019s car. Valiance gave a small wave to her grandmother, who sat in the front seat with the knife clearly displayed.</p><p>Esme counted the newly learned facts on her fingers. \u201cI\u2019m invisible to bad guys. I\u2019m a fairy. I\u2019m not a coward. And I quote poetry when I fight. What have you learned today?\u201d</p><p>Valiance took in a deep breath. There was a dead body in the backyard that the Cleaners would need to dispose of, and he was pretty sure he should call their contact in the police force because an explosion would catch someone\u2019s attention, even in this neighborhood. But none of that seemed to matter. \u201cThis was probably the worst best date ever. Or the best worst date ever.\u201d</p><p>A blush spread across Esme\u2019s cheeks, and her floral scent filled the air around him and seemed to seep into him. \u201cIt was a first date. I\u2019ve been told all first dates are hell.\u201d</p><p>Valiance found his hands shaking as he asked the question, so he jammed them in his pockets. \u201cIs it too early to ask for a second?\u201d</p><p>Esme looked down at her hands. He saw the blood crusted in her fingernails, the crimson spray across her shirt. The moonlight caught the white bandage at her wrist, and again, he felt his palms begin to itch with nerves.</p><p>But when she looked up, and those wide brown eyes caught his, the hope that he had spoken about earlier seemed to flutter through him.</p><p>\u201cSure beats folding towels on a Saturday night.\u201d</p><p>Blood and Water</p><p>Kim Falconer</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>6:12 P.M.</p><p>Sunday, April 15, 1906</p><p>STELLAN SHOT TOWARD the ferry, his naked body gliding through the water just under the waves. He swam over sharks and knobble-backed sturgeons, while above, the setting sun turned everything to gold. Brilliant clouds were mirrored on the glassy surface. Beautiful . . . but worrisome. There would be dozens of passengers on the observation deck tonight. Dozens of deaths.</p><p>The more the merrier, Salila said, her voice rippling through his mind. She wasn\u2019t too far behind him.</p><p>He swam harder. The ferry was heading southwest and coming up on Goat Island, a rock in the middle of the bay. Listen to me, Salila. You don\u2019t have to do this!</p><p>Oh, but I do!</p><p>The paddle wheel churned through the waves. It rose over the hum of the steam engine and the distant siren sounds of whales traveling slowly along the coast. Stellan was tempted to break the surface when he reached the Bay City ferry, but the sun, and better judgment, kept him beneath the waves. He dove, skimmed the hull, and came up on the port side, sticking to the shadows. In a leap, Stellan grabbed the lifesaver netting and climbed until he could see the main deck.</p><p>People were chatting in small groups, gazing at the horizon, taking in the last rays of the sun. Stellan counted them, sweeping his eye across the deck, up to the wheelhouse, and down the other side before stopping short. The fine hairs on the back of his neck stood on end.</p><p>A woman walked toward the starboard railing, her breathtaking figure radiant in the light. The wind danced in her floor-length skirt, revealing the outline of long, slender legs. Fine lace pulled tight across her lower back, accentuating the curve from hips to breasts. Stellan felt a pounding in his chest. Impossible, he thought. Everything else was falling away, his vision a vignette with only the center, only her, in bright clarity. She was like living fire, or was that the sunset? Magnificent! What are you playing with, my lady? She seemed inordinately preoccupied with a small wooden box mounted on stilts. He watched, fascinated. Ah, a camera . . .</p><p>Isn\u2019t she lovely? Salila cut into his mind.</p><p>He growled deep and twisted around, his dark hair trailing over his shoulders and down his broad back as he tried to spot the Mar woman in the water. This has to stop!</p><p>That\u2019s not what Teern says. She surfaced and disappeared again. Taunting.</p><p>Stellan\u2019s eyes went back to the deck. The object of his attention was sliding a glass plate into the camera. Quickly, she ducked under a black hood, and the whole thing flashed like a shooting star. A photographer! The thought would have made him smile if he weren\u2019t so busy working out how to save her life.</p><p>The sun dropped into the sea, and the belated fog began to rise. A Mar fog. It was Salila\u2019s shroud against detection. Stellan tore his eyes away from the woman long enough to dive back in and swim to the prow. The ferry chugged on, but the sound of the whales vanished. They tended toward silence when the Mar were hunting. The waves beat against his back as he clung directly underneath the main deck. He couldn\u2019t see her anymore, but he could hear.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s enough light for one more shot.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s optimistic.</p><p>\u201cPut your cape on and come inside, Miss Ralston! It\u2019s gone quite cold and will be pitch-dark before we dock. You\u2019ll catch your death . . .\u201d</p><p>He hoped she would heed the warning. It would be the death of all those left chatting under the stars if Salila and the others had their way.</p><p>\u201cAngelina Ralston!\u201d The well-dressed matron beside her continued. \u201cYou\u2019re not listening.\u201d</p><p>Angelina . . . Stellan licked salt water off his lips. An angel . . . Her hair was auburn red and reminded him of autumn trees along the Atlantic Coast. Her eyes were dark like Egyptian onyx, and her lips full, inviting. She wore a long-sleeved ivory dress with pearl buttons that ran from her slender waist, between her round breasts to her high, lace collar. On her head was a matching hat, cocked up on one side. Stellan\u2019s throat went completely dry when she spoke.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Blackwell, I am comforted by your concern.\u201d She donned a forest green cape that hung to her black leather boots. \u201cI assure you, though, I\u2019m not the slightest bit cold.\u201d She lowered her sweet voice. \u201cThe sea is mesmerizing, and the vista like warm embers. Look how the pale evening light dances across the rising mist. It\u2019s so beautiful. If only I had a camera that could make sense of these subtleties . . . this other world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVERY POETIC, I\u2019M sure . . .\u201d Mrs. Blackwell huffed.</p><p>\u201cAh, but light is poetry,\u201d Angelina said to herself. Then louder, over the chatter of the other passengers, \u201cThere\u2019s too much to experience on deck, Mrs. Blackwell. I can\u2019t bear to walk away from the sensations.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMiss Ralston! Now I must insist you retreat to the safety of the cabin. Your father wouldn\u2019t have you lingering in \u2018sensations\u2019 of any kind, I am sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFortunately, Father is not here,\u201d Angelina whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p> <p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m a hunter of light, Mrs. Blackwell. I put my consciousness upon its reflection, watching, waiting to capture what I can.\u201d</p><p>Stellan\u2019s eyes widened as he listened.</p><p>\u201cLife isn\u2019t all about photographs, Miss Ralston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is this evening. Father\u2019s instructed me to record the seascape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, for the bridge . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBridges.\u201d Angelina emphasized the plural. \u201cOne along this ferry route, from Oakland Mole to Market Street Landing, and the other . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAcross the Golden Gate, I know!\u201d Mrs. Blackwell sighed. \u201cThe esteemed Mr. Ralston, and my son, your fianc\u00e9\u201d\u2014she exaggerated each syllable of that last word\u2014\u201cspeak of nothing else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps you\u2019ll appreciate . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate nothing in this damp, cold fog and endless sloshing of water all around. It\u2019s unnatural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me.\u201d Her voice was wistful.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve heard about your proclivity toward swimming.\u201d The older woman fussed with her coat buttons, doing them up to her chin. \u201cI\u2019m going inside, and you are to follow directly. Gather your things. I\u2019ll not have you out here unattended.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course, Mrs. Blackwell.\u201d Angelina kept her eyes on the sea, making no move to leave.</p><p>The matron turned to a man who stood a small distance away with his hands clasped behind his back. \u201cAssist her, Gerald.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can manage myself, thank you,\u201d Angelina said. She turned to the man. \u201cCould you please see Mrs. Blackwell safely inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will my son think if I allow his fianc\u00e9e to catch a chill?\u201d Mrs. Blackwell said over her shoulder while being escorted to the doors.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he will think nothing unkind of you, Mrs. Blackwell.\u201d</p><p>The woman snorted at that and disappeared into the cabin.</p><p>Stellan struggled with conflicting desires as he watched Angelina lean against the railing. There were other people still on the deck. He had to be ready. Salila would act soon.</p><p>You should be helping us!</p> <p>I think you do fine without me.</p><p>We are Mar, Stellan. Have your forgotten your own nature in all these centuries?</p><p>No! He frowned. But your way is. . .</p><p>That of the Ancients!</p><p>We don\u2019t even know who they were! A master race from the sunken continent? Remnants of children sacrificed to the sea? We\u2019ve lost our history, Salila.</p><p>But not our traditions! Her voice stung. We need human blood to rise from the tombs. We need it to walk on land.</p><p>We don\u2019t need so much that they die! I\u2019ve found. . .</p><p>A better way? So I\u2019ve heard. What\u2019s Teern think of your big idea?</p><p>Stellan didn\u2019t have an answer for that. He\u2019d yet to discuss it with their leader.</p><p>You might want to move away from the bow, brother. Salila\u2019s warning shot into his mind. There\u2019s going to be a little spill.</p><p>The Bay City ferry had two ballast tanks with a thirty-ton capacity each. If one malfunctioned, the nose of the vessel would momentarily dip, and any passengers on deck would slip right down into the sea. Salila was very good at making things malfunction.</p><p>Don\u2019t do it!</p><p>Too late.</p><p>The ferry lurched, and Mar began to tear up the side of the vessel, splintering the hull in their race to the top. The prow smashed nose first into the swell, and the main deck, moments ago a stately, horizontal surface, upended. People lost their footing, all but Angelina. She gripped the railing with both hands and held fast. Salila made to jump at her, but Stellan caught the Mar woman by the ankle, a bone-crushing hold.</p><p>She spun and snarled. What\u2019s wrong with you! With a disgusted look, she kicked free and dove, hitting the water, where people were splashing and waving.</p><p>Angelina screamed, her grip nearly gone. Stellan threw himself into motion, ripping apart the railing in his vertical ascent. As he launched toward her, the bow of the ferry bounced back up, tossing passengers into the sky, Angelina among them. Stellan\u2019s collision course ended with a resounding thud, his chest slamming into the woman as his arms encircled her.</p><p>Thousands of sparkling water drops sprayed out from their impact. Streams arced from his long hair, reaching toward her face. The sounds of the paddle wheel and engine, the screams of drowning humans, and the clang of bells faded into the background. But suddenly there was only this young woman, this angel, in his arms. The scent of her filled his nostrils, her warmth turning his head light as air. Angelina\u2019s heart pounded hard against his bare chest as she clung to him. Her eyes were shut tight, and she was still screaming as they began to fall.</p><p>\u201cAngelina!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Her lids flew open, and she stared straight at him.</p><p>Stellan couldn\u2019t breathe. Seeing her, holding her . . . it felt like sunshine, open fields, and a fullness of heart he\u2019d never known. She pierced him with her beautiful, dark gaze, a weapon more potent than anything imaginable. They held each other tight, speechless, until, like a stone, they plunged into the sea.</p><p>A CACOPHONY OF sound rushed by, punctuated by the snap and flare of misshapen voices. Comprehension was futile. When she managed to grasp hold of anything, it disintegrated into blind, meaningless noise. Then darkness settled, calm until a whoosh of air inflated her chest. Heat rolled over her skin. Pain registered, then a heartbeat, pounding, earsplitting. She sucked in the air, hungry for more. Pins and needles shot down every nerve. Pressure built, and Angelina\u2019s eyes flew open.</p><p>Who are you? The question echoed off luminous walls.</p><p>A figure hovered close by. His hair was long, and water dripped from the ends onto her exposed neck. For a moment, she could see the contours of his face. Then they blurred into memory, a strong jaw, full lips. A man planting his mouth over her own, breathing life back into her body. His shoulders, beautifully curved as he leaned in, were marble white . . . Then the shouting started.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the dead bone\u2019s deep did you bring her here for? Have you lost your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would have drowned otherwise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do!\u201d</p><p>The words tumbled together, mixing with the incessant ring of high-pitched water drops and rolling waves that surged up and down the walls of her reasoning. A shadow streaked into view and was immediately banished. Angelina licked the salty tang of the sea from her lips. It tasted like blood.</p><p>\u201cFine. Protect her if you want. But Teern will never let her live, now that she\u2019s seen you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t remember!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d</p><p>Angelina\u2019s head throbbed. Water splashed over her face, and a deep, commanding energy slammed her.</p><p>\u201cYou have interfered with the hunt, again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeern, forget what Salila says. The girl can be useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows about the bridge.\u201d</p><p>Bridges, Angelina thought. She managed to lift herself up on her elbows.</p><p>A hand pressed ever so gently on her bosom. It replaced the swirling void with warmth. Peace. She closed her eyes and drifted away.</p><p>\u201cI can take the human girl back. Learn more of their plans.\u201d</p><p>A single word taunted her. Human? Angelina fought against the confusion as she was swept up in strong arms. The rush of cold air forced her eyes wide open. Into them stared two jewels, gray-green like the sea. She stared back. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>04:12 P.M.</p><p>Monday, April 16, 1906</p><p>SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAD happened, Angelina was sure of it, but for the life of her she couldn\u2019t recall what. Sun shone onto her face, and she could hear waves pounding the sand. Buoys clanged, or was that the sound of cable cars? Her fingers traced across the sand. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe, Miss.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes to find a gentleman bending over her. He reminded her of someone, and she wondered at herself for imagining smooth marble skin beneath his white, high-collared shirt. He wore ferndale striped trousers, a gray-green vest that matched his eyes, black silk puff tie, black riding boots, and a tweed frock coat. His face was . . . beautiful, and his long, wavy hair was secured at the nape of his neck. She studied him until the sun\u2019s glare made her look down. He must have been wading in the surf, for his trouser cuffs and boots were soaked. With his help, she sat up. Her clothes were wet and utterly disheveled. She touched the top of her head. \u201cMy hair\u2019s come down,\u201d she said, her mouth feeling like it was stuffed with cotton.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you remember?\u201d</p><p>Angelina frowned. \u201cI was returning from Oakland with Mrs. Blackwell, taking photographs for my father.\u201d She rubbed the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cOn the Bay City ferry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Her hands went to her mouth \u201cThere was an accident! People went overboard!\u201d She raised her voice. \u201cMy fianc\u00e9\u2019s mother, Mrs. Blackwell! Gerald, our manservant! Did they survive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe event was in the papers this morning, Miss. No mention of names, but seven people were still unaccounted for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I must be one of them.\u201d She buried her face in her hands and exhaled long and slow. \u201cThis is terrible!\u201d With another deep breath, she looked up. \u201cBut you saved me? Pulled me from the sea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the surf,\u201d he said. His voice was warm and rich. \u201cYou washed up on a raft of driftwood. I spotted you from the wharf.\u201d He pointed to the pilings near the water channel.</p><p>She took in the industrial waterfront, with its warehouses and longshoremen working the docks. Facing west was a sign reading PIER 42. \u201cChina Basin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her mouth open. Angelina didn\u2019t remember hitting the water or swimming to the driftwood, or anything else past hanging on to the railing for dear life when her tripod went over. \u201cMy camera!\u201d She looked about as if it might appear beside her.</p><p>\u201cNo sign of that, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d He helped her to stand. \u201cPlease let me introduce myself. I\u2019m Stellan Fletcher.\u201d He shrugged off his coat and draped it over her shoulders. \u201cIs your home far away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPacific Heights.\u201d Her mind was in a whirl. Stellan. She turned the name over with her tongue. Where was he from? She couldn\u2019t detect an accent. \u201cMr. Fletcher,\u201d she offered her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Angelina Ralston and deeply in your debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t mention it.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met, and chills went down her spine. For a moment, she thought her knees would give way. \u201cThis is a most peculiar event, Mr. Fletcher, but I do think you\u2019ve saved my life. That is worth more than a passing mention.\u201d</p><p>He gave a small bow. \u201cI\u2019m at your service.\u201d</p><p>Angelina smiled and brought her hand to her neck. It was wet even though her lace collar was beginning to dry in the breeze. Her fingers came away bloody. \u201cI must get home.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cAnd avoid the press if at all possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will find a cabdriver and escort you.\u201d He pointed toward the docks. \u201cIt\u2019s not far to King Street if you can manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d Angelina allowed him to take her elbow and lead her up the sandy dune to the pier and on toward the bustle of the city. She sat on a bench while he hailed a taxi. It didn\u2019t take long. Inside, she sat for a moment with her eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cDirections?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFillmore and Washington Street.\u201d</p><p>Stellan repeated the location to the driver and climbed in the other side. With a chug and backfire, they were off, swerving through the traffic. The cab was a Model A Ford that had seen heavy use. It moved at a snail\u2019s pace, which was fortunate considering the reckless driving on Market Street. Stages, hack carts, donkey traps, and cable cars vied for right of way along with what Angelina thought were far too many pedestrians. They bumped over the tracks, veering out of the way of oncoming cable cars just in time. The noise jarred her mind. Out the dusty window, the angle of the light was severe.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d She stuck her head out from under the canopy before Stellan could answer. Captivated by the light, she watched it cross the tall buildings, glinting off windows, forcing shadows to lengthen.</p><p>\u201cNearly sunset,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been twenty-four hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince the accident? I believe so.\u201d</p><p>Angelina pulled her head in, suddenly thinking of her hatless appearance and her wild hair blowing in the breeze. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s a miracle I survived.\u201d The smell of city refuse, horse manure, engine oil, and bricks wafted in. It jolted her back to the present, reminding her there was a strange man, her rescuer, sitting quite close. Automatic manners took over. \u201cDo you live in the city?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Before he could answer, the driver slammed on the brakes and pounded the horn. A man on a wheel, one of those bicycles she\u2019d been wanting to try, much to her family\u2019s vexation, had nearly plowed into them.</p><p>Stellan stared after the contraption. \u201cI\u2019m a visitor.\u201d</p><p>The way he looked at the world going by, she was sure he was glad of that. \u201cWhere then?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cEurope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat hardly pinpoints it, Mr. Fletcher,\u201d she said, and pressed her forehead into her hand. It was getting more and more difficult to keep up the social niceties.</p><p>He noticed. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you my full life story if you like, but perhaps for now you\u2019d rather rest.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Angelina closed her eyes. \u201cI think I will. Please rouse me when we reach Fillmore and Washington.\u201d</p><p>NOTHING\u2019S CHANGED, STELLAN thought. He didn\u2019t want to breathe. The air was foul, the land dust dry, and the crowds of humans, more visible than ever in daylight, smelled acrid. San Francisco had no order, no symmetry. There certainly had been no improvement to the system of traffic since his last visit. People crossed at any and every point, as did riders trotting into view from behind wagons or blind corners. He\u2019d witnessed three near calamities since they started and it had only been a matter of minutes. At that point, Stellan wondered if his whole plan seem mad. Maybe it is. But when he looked over at Angelina, resting quietly, with her hands in her lap and her eyes closed, her long hair falling in tangles over her shoulders to brush the seat of the car, he knew he\u2019d made the only possible choice. He drank her in until the driver dropped speed and shifted into low gear. They were moving away from the business district, driving nearly straight uphill. Upon reaching the top, they turned again and descended a short way, pulling over to the curb. Stellan placed his hand lightly on Angelina\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMiss Ralston?\u201d</p><p>She straightened and attempted to put her clothes in better order. \u201cHello.\u201d She gave him a soft smile. \u201cCome. You must see the view.\u201d</p> <p>Stellan got out to get her door, but she was already climbing out. She pointed toward the sea.</p><p>The homes lining the hilly street were grand, but the vista took his breath away. He could see all the way to the marina. Beyond that was the Golden Gate Channel, turning red with the sinking sun. And beneath it . . . ah, beneath it lay the sheltering tombs. \u201cThe light is extraordinary.\u201d</p><p>Angelina tilted her head. \u201cAre you an artist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like you.\u201d</p><p>She raised her brows but didn\u2019t reply. For a few moments they stood side by side, watching the sun go down. It was a rare sight for Stellan, considering what it took for his kind to tolerate the day. He glanced at her neck and frowned. Hopefully, no harm would come of his choice.</p> <p>The driver stepped up, dusting off his cap and clearing his throat. Stellan pulled a fine leather wallet from his breast pocket and paid.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fletcher, I will not be any more of an inconvenience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is no trouble, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>She curtsied. \u201cShall we face the family then?\u201d</p><p>He offered to support her, but she kept a slight distance between them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m rattled, Mr. Fletcher, I\u2019ll admit, but I\u2019m not an invalid. I only hope the news is that all have been as lucky as I to survive.\u201d Angelina led the way up wide steps that began at the sidewalk. They were lined with an ivory, wrought-iron fence. Wandering roses grew over the metal, their vines following the contours of every loop and curlicue, dotting them with apricot and yellow blossoms.</p> <p>\u201cThis is your home?\u201d he asked as he tilted his head to take in the three-story mansion.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my father\u2019s.\u201d Her back straightened. \u201cHe designed it when he and my mother first married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father is an architect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn more ways than one.\u201d</p><p>Stellan looked at her sidewise. \u201cControlling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s planned my life from birth to grave.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cBut it is a lovely house.\u201d</p><p>Stellan felt obliged to make some show of actually looking at the building and not her. \u201cMarvelous rooftops. Copper cupolas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, capping the turrets and oriels, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWonderful bay windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy favorite is on the south wall. The stained glass is from Italy. I will show you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. His face actually hurt from how much he\u2019d been doing that today. \u201cI anticipate viewing it with pleasure, Miss Ralston.\u201d</p><p>Angelina laughed, and he felt heat rush through his body. \u201cI think you really are an artist, Mr. Fletcher, a quite famous one perhaps, who is keeping his identity a secret.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to say he had no secrets, but instead, he winked at her. In moments, they reached the entranceway, where pillars and arches supported the high ceiling. From the beams, hanging baskets overflowed with ferns and colorful flowers. \u201cYour home is extraordinary, Miss Ralston.\u201d</p><p>She leaned toward him. \u201cI must warn you about my family . . .\u201d</p><p>For a moment she was close enough for him to catch the pulse of her heart. It was so distracting, he didn\u2019t immediately register the front door\u2019s opening and the voices\u2019 exclaiming in surprise. Soon shouts and a rush of people crowded the entrance, all talking at once. Angelina was whisked inside, and Stellan followed, for the moment forgotten.</p><p>\u201cGerald! Call for the physician!\u201d a booming voice commanded. \u201cAnd send word to the Blackwells this instant!\u201d He pointed his finger at Angelina. \u201cTwenty-four hours, young woman! That\u2019s how long you\u2019ve been gone without a word! Nearly ruined our new connections. Your fianc\u00e9 was ready to cut all ties. He thought you were dead!\u201d</p><p>She went red in the face. \u201cMy sincere apologies, Father.\u201d</p><p>The family closed in, assaulting Angelina with questions.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking, not doing as Mrs. Blackwell asked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you no concern for your own future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you survive?</p><p>\u201cYou look like something the tide washed in!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like something the tide washed in,\u201d she managed to say. \u201cBut I\u2019m alive and well, and it\u2019s a relief to know that Mrs. Blackwell and Gerald are, too.\u201d Her eyes went to the servant.</p><p>\u201cOf course they are,\u201d her father yelled. \u201cThey went inside the cabin, where passengers ought to be.\u201d He glared at her. \u201cHow did you manage to get home?\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips slightly. \u201cWe have Mr. Fletcher to thank for that.\u201d</p><p>Stellan felt the entire gathering turn to him. \u201cIt was no trouble,\u201d he said, his eyes still on Angelina.</p><p>She returned his gaze and mouthed the words \u201cthank you,\u201d as several women led her up the stairs. \u201cHe pulled me from the surf,\u201d she said before disappearing into a room.</p><p>Stellan sagged for a moment as if released from a spell.</p><p>One of the women, her mother, he guessed, from her age, called down the stairs. \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there, Mr. Ralston. See to this man who\u2019s found our daughter.\u201d She called to a maid. \u201cHot water for the bath! Quickly! Where is that physician?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Ralston stepped forward and extended his hand as he introduced himself. \u201cThe ferry situation is appalling! What we need is a bridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thought exactly,\u201d Stellan lied.</p><p>The older man smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll dine with us, at the least. Are you visiting the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a few days . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay here! I insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Ralston. That will be a pleasure.\u201d</p><p>ANGELINA WAS IN her own bed, freshly bathed, with the comforter pulled up to her chin. The elderly physician, Dr. Medleys, had poked and prodded her from toe to tonsils while he mumbled questions to himself, supplying his own, unintelligible answers. Eventually, he gave her a clean bill of health, dressed her neck wound, an injury she could have received when falling over the broken railing, and told her mother to feed her a simple meal and let her sleep. Angelina got the meal, a small portion of fish broth and a piece of sourdough bread, no butter. She also took a few moments to dash off notes to several friends who would be frantic by the news of her disappearance, but even with that accomplished, her mother seemed reluctant to let her rest.</p><p>\u201cYou did well, Angelina, keeping your counsel in front of Dr. Medleys. He\u2019s competent, of course, but he doesn\u2019t need to hear the details. You know how word gets around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t keeping my counsel, Mother. I truly can\u2019t remember what happened.\u201d Until I opened my eyes and saw Mr. Fletcher standing on the shore . . . She sighed into her pillow.</p><p>Mrs. Ralston proceeded to test her memory by asking her everything she could think of, from \u201cWhen did you know you would fall\u201d and \u201cAren\u2019t we blessed you\u2019re such a strong swimmer\u201d to \u201cWho would have thought that a useful skill?\u201d She wasn\u2019t quite through scolding her, though. \u201cMrs. Blackwell assured me you\u2019d been asked several times to vacate the deck . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she suffered no injury?\u201d Angelina cut in, hoping to change the topic.</p><p>\u201cA nasty bruise on the arm and an attack on her nervous system are all. She was seated inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mother. And did all survive?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Ralston shook her head. \u201cSadly, no,\u201d she said, then started talking about the tea she\u2019d had to cancel on Angelina\u2019s account.</p><p>Angelina closed her eyes to feign sleep, deepening her breathing until she heard footsteps brushing over the rug. There was a pause at the door, then it clicked shut. She peeked to make sure a maid wasn\u2019t stationed in her bedside rocker. Finally alone, Angelina felt free to contemplate recent events. Her mind went out to those lost though she couldn\u2019t picture any of the others who\u2019d stayed on deck. Then slowly she felt pulled toward the young man who had found her, Stellan Fletcher. What incredible happenstance to put him in her path at just such a moment. Or put me in his path is more likely. With that thought, her lids closed softly, and Angelina drifted away.</p><p>THE HOUSE WAS deadly silent, but Angelina felt another presence in her room. The door hadn\u2019t opened, and there were no footsteps approaching the bed. Still, something had roused her, like a warm mist rising between the cracks in the floorboards. She opened her eyes and startled. Stellan?</p><p>Pleased don\u2019t be alarmed, Angelina.</p><p>What are you doing here?</p><p>If you can forgive the intrusion, I was only hoping to see that you were recovered from the ordeal.</p><p>Part of her thought it was beyond forward to be making such a private inquiry. And at this hour! Another part thought the gesture was both sincere and endearing. While she tried to focus on the outlines of his face, he took her hand and lifted it to his lips.</p><p>My beautiful Angelina.</p><p>The kiss on her hand lingered, causing sensations to spread throughout her body. The next thing she knew, he was embracing her, his mouth kissing her lips once, very tenderly, then moving to her neck. A pleasurable sound escaped before she could contain it.</p><p>Just a few drops . . . he whispered.</p><p>Her lids became heavy, and she had the distinct sense of falling into the sea.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>6:00 A.M.</p><p>Tuesday, April 17, 1906</p><p>ANGELINA SAT BOLT upright, gasping for air. She checked the scream about to escape her lips and took in the room. She was alone, the dawnlight tinting the bay windows rosy red. Slowly, her hand went to her throat. The dressing was in place, but her satin gown had slipped off one shoulder. Her hair had escaped its braid and was damp with sweat. She sat there, in the middle of the bed, trying to make sense of it all.</p><p>What happened last night? Her face was flushed, but the images in her mind were fading fast. Whatever it was, it had made her feel good . . . to the core. She got up and filled her washbasin with water from the pitcher. After a wash, Jeanie came in to help her dress. Breakfast was served early at the Ralstons\u2019, and no doubt Mason Blackwell would call to see that she had indeed survived. And discuss the latest engineering developments with her father. She frowned. Mason . . .</p><p>The engagement had not been her idea. Mr. Ralston simply announced one day that it was time for her to do her duty to the family.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of such obligations,\u201d she\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m glad to have enlightened you, daughter,\u201d he\u2019d answered back.</p><p>Mason Blackwell was a young architect in the Ralston firm, and not without independent means.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a logical choice,\u201d her father had insisted.</p><p>\u201cHardly the best motivation for marriage!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d dismissed that outright. \u201cWhat else would you base your choice on?\u201d</p><p>Shortly after that conversation, Mr. Blackwell came to call. Angelina thought him too much like her father, but both families were congratulating them before she got the first protest out.</p><p>\u201cThink it through,\u201d her mother had said in private. \u201cYou\u2019re twenty-seven and have yet to accept any prospects. Enough is enough!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t accepted any because none have shown the least interest in my art, or my philosophies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear! Why on earth would you want them to?\u201d</p><p>Angelina thought of her photographs hanging in New York galleries and being purchased for publication in the Yellow Ribbon, a statewide suffrage newspaper. How could she wed someone who didn\u2019t recognize her creative goals or respect her politics? What am I going to do? The families were pressuring them to set a date, her mother hoping for June! It didn\u2019t give her much time to figure a way out. I must make a stand!</p><p>Angelina held on to the thought, as well as the back of a chair, while Jeanie laced up her corset. It was yellow satin with white ribbing, made from the latest pattern out of Paris, La Mode Illustr\u00e9e. Thank you, cousin Emily. Yesterday, her corset strings had come completely loosened in the accident, and the freedom of that sensation was hard not to long for. Jeanie helped her slip on a pale rose tea dress and buttoned it up the back. Her hair was untangled, put up, then on went the matching hat, with its trail of paper roses on one side.</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d Jeanie said, as Mrs. Ralston pushed into the room.</p><p>\u201cA great improvement over yesterday\u2019s appearance!\u201d her mother confirmed.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Angelina cleared her throat. \u201cIs Mr. Fletcher at the table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Where else would a young man be? Though his appetite for conversation seems bigger than his stomach.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s as obsessed with the Golden Gate as Misters Ralston and Blackwell. I suspect he\u2019s an architect or an engineer. How many men of such persuasion can fit into my house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree at least, it seems.\u201d Angelina turned from the mirror. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother narrowed her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re positively glowing, child. Are you sure you\u2019re not fevered? How\u2019s your appetite?</p><p>\u201cI could eat a horse,\u201d she said, making Jeanie smile and her mother gasp. Angelina headed downstairs, leaving them to follow.</p><p>STELLAN GLANCED NOW and then at Mason Blackwell. The human was unimpressive, as far as he was concerned. Stocky build but leaning toward portly, a weak jaw, and hairline receding like a full-moon tide. None of this would matter if he had heart. Strength of spirit. Reverence for Angelina. So far, these attributes had not been displayed. Blackwell had barely asked after her, making Stellan\u2019s opinion of the man fall even lower. Utterly unworthy.</p><p>Stellan. . .</p><p>He startled, turning his gaze to the dining-room entrance. It was empty. Now I\u2019m imagining her voice in my head?</p> <p>Moments later, Angelina appeared in the doorway, her eyes going to Stellan\u2019s and resting there.</p><p>\u201cMiss Ralston,\u201d he said, and stood. \u201cAnd, Mrs. Ralston,\u201d he added, as her mother came straight in and sat down.</p><p>The other men finally rose as well. Mr. Ralston gave his daughter a cursory look. \u201cI trust you\u2019re fully recovered and have written formal apologies to Mrs. Blackwell and her son?\u201d He indicated Mason, who stood next to him.</p><p>Angelina seemed unable to respond.</p><p>Mr. Ralston sat back down, leaving Stellan to pull her chair out, seating her next to him. It put her directly across from Mason, who was still standing. When the other man spoke, Stellan had to contain the low growl threatening to escape his lips.</p><p>\u201cDear Angelina.\u201d Blackwell spoke as if reciting a passage. \u201cIt was such a relief to hear of your safe return. Mother is still recovering from the shock of it all, of course.\u201d Somehow, he managed to make it sound as if it were Angelina\u2019s fault. \u201cA harrowing experience, I am sure, but all\u2019s well that ends well.\u201d He smiled briefly, then sat back down to his morning paper.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Blackwell, for your, and Mrs. Blackwell\u2019s concern for my welfare.\u201d She kept her hands in her lap as her breakfast was served: two fried eggs, bacon, and toast with blueberry jam. Along with it came a silver tray with a mountain of envelopes. \u201cI can see my recovery is an utter relief to some. Thank heavens.\u201d</p><p>The paper rustled. \u201cYes, thank heavens.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply, but Stellan thought the San Francisco Call might ignite from her look alone. He turned to her slightly. \u201cDo you feel completely yourself today?\u201d</p><p>She blushed. \u201cI feel more myself than I ever have in my life. I might go so far as to say a new self is emerging.\u201d She focused on her breakfast, attacking it with knife and fork, taking large bites of egg followed by the toast. After washing it down with tea, she said to the table, \u201cI seem to be ravenous.\u201d</p><p>I, too. . .</p><p>Her head jerked up, eyes on Stellan\u2019s. \u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . . a beautiful day.\u201d He tried to cover his shock. \u201cSunny again. I\u2019d always thought your city was filled with fog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot always, sir,\u201d she said softly.</p> <p>Blackwell, ignorant of the small exchange, interrupted by reading aloud from the morning paper. \u201cDockworker found in the early hours of the morning, drowned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA careless man, no doubt,\u201d Mrs. Ralston said. \u201cFalling down on the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite careless, I agree. He also managed to have his throat torn out.\u201d Blackwell read on. \u201cSecond man found in such a state in as many days . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSharks?\u201d Stellan asked in a level voice.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they usually take the whole torso?\u201d Mr. Ralston asked, his paper lowering as he took a sip of tea.</p><p>\u201cMr. Ralston, please. How morbid,\u201d Angelina\u2019s mother said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a scientific fact. Sharks feed in a kind of frenzy, dismembering . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Mrs. Ralston snapped. \u201cOur daughter was only just fished from the very same bay. Please don\u2019t conjure such frightful images.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine Miss Ralston being too distraught,\u201d Blackwell said from behind his paper. \u201cKnowing her, she\u2019d want to photograph the scene.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>Mrs. Ralston didn\u2019t approve of that statement either.</p><p>\u201cOnly if the light was good,\u201d Angelina said. But her hand went to her neck. Stellan watched as a drop of blood escaped the confines of the dressing and trickled toward her collarbone. Quickly, Stellan handed her his napkin. She blotted up the drops and secured the dressing tighter. It took her a moment to recover, but when she did, she squared her shoulders and addressed Mr. Ralston\u2019s paper. \u201cFather, I must prevail on your generosity. My camera was lost . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNegligent of you,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope you learned from the experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Father. But if I am to photograph the shores . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He dismissed her with a wave. \u201cProcure the camera. I need those images by next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Father. I shall be about it today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday?\u201d Mrs. Ralston said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a little soon to be traipsing about the Emporium?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll not go out alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am perfectly capable of . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will escort her,\u201d Stellan said. \u201cIf that suits you, Miss Ralston.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThank you, Mr. Fletcher. I know you have an interest in the arts. Your presence would be helpful.\u201d Her voice was even, but she was blushing.</p><p>\u201cIf there are no objections?\u201d Stellan said to the other men in the room.</p><p>Slowly Mason put the paper down and folded it in thirds. \u201cNone from me.\u201d He turned to Mr. Ralston. \u201cWe\u2019re going over the designs with the steelmaker today, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>In moments, Ralston and Blackwell were in deep conversation, Angelina\u2019s shopping expedition forgotten.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s settled then,\u201d Angelina said. She dabbed the corners of her mouth and stole a look at Stellan.</p><p>Mrs. Ralston didn\u2019t miss it. \u201cYou\u2019ll not go out with this young gentleman unattended, Angelina,\u201d she said. \u201cMr. Blackwell may condone it, but I do not. Think of the press . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGerald will drive us,\u201d Angelina cut in. \u201cBut really, Mother, it\u2019s the twentieth century. Women are . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs capable as men, yes, I know. Emancipated whatnot. Take Gerald to chaperone. That would suffice.\u201d Mrs. Ralston knit her brows. \u201cBe back by dinner. Six o\u2019clock sharp.\u201d</p><p>ANGELINA WAS BEAMING. The Emporium on the corner of Market and Fifth, two blocks down from the Call Building, was one of her favorite stores. It had everything from garden tools to lingerie, hot coffee, books and sheet music, furniture, horse harnesses, and china teacups. Most important, it catered to the arts, with a section of brushes, paints, and canvases, stage props, costumes, and the latest in photographic equipment. She smiled as she led the way up to the second floor and toward the back corner, where the scent of linseed oil, fine leather, and boar bristles was welcoming. As soon as the shopkeeper spotted her party, he gave a frantic wave. \u201cMiss Ralston! What a comforting sight. I read all about it in the papers! Are you quite alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Higgins, thank you. I\u2019m fine, but my camera was lost. I must replace everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a relief to see you alive and well,\u201d he said. \u201cGave us all a shock.\u201d He hefted a thick catalog and opened to a bookmarked section. \u201cI can order in exactly what you had before, but you might like to consider some new innovations. \u201cA plastigmat lens, for example . . .\u201d</p><p>Angelina was lost for some time in the catalog. The Plate Series D was an improvement, indeed, and it sported a price tag to match. \u201cNinety-seven dollars and fifty cents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus shipping, but you get what you pay for, as I am sure Mr. Ralston knows. It\u2019s superior quality. Aluminum body, nickel frame, mahogany inserts, and fine leather cover. Two tripod sockets.\u201d He tapped the picture. \u201cNothing surpasses Eastman Kodak, and a woman of your talent deserves the best.\u201d</p><p>A woman of my means can afford the best, I\u2019m sure you mean to say.</p><p>Stellan, who was studying the photographs along the far wall, chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d Angelina smiled. \u201cHow soon will it arrive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tripod is in stock. The rest will be sent as soon as I telegraph the order through. Call back late next week. We should have it by then.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThat long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so, unless you\u2019d like to rent in the interim? A similar setup for, say one dollar a day, with your tripod and plates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone!\u201d She signed the various documents Mr. Higgins pushed in front of her and nearly jumped out of her skin when Stellan appeared at her side as if from nowhere.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve found what you were looking for?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her eyes to his. \u201cI believe I have, but you must see something over here.\u201d She stopped herself from taking his hand. \u201cThis way.\u201d Angelina went to the visual arts display and looked on as he studied the range of oil paints, tube upon tube, mounted in fans of colors on the wall.</p><p>\u201cExtraordinary!\u201d He leaned in very close and motioned her to do the same. \u201cLook at the subtle shifts. From yellow ochre to sienna to gold. Like the sun.\u201d</p><p>She quivered, wondering if he could hear her heart pound. \u201cI love the names,\u201d she whispered. \u201cTerra Rosa, Prussian Green, Quinacridone Magenta . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are the colors of daylight, but your photographs are of the night, the shades of gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI capture the truth of light,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is seen in the absence of color.\u201d</p><p>You would love my world then . . .</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her blankly, and in her nervousness, she reached out to touch the indigo tube at the exact same moment he did. Their hands collided and seemed to entwine of their own accord. She pulled back. \u201cPardon me . . .\u201d</p><p>Gerald cleared his throat behind them, and they both straightened. \u201cAre you ready to proceed, Miss Ralston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d She looked to Stellan. \u201cJoin me for late lunch? The clam chowder on Fisherman\u2019s Wharf is beyond superb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be a pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Gerald frowned but hoisted the camera gear and followed them out of the Emporium.</p><p>Fisherman\u2019s Wharf was across town, across being a misnomer. They drove up steep inclines, streets rattling with cable cars and all manner of traffic, and down such severe slopes that if the brakes failed, there would be no saving them. Angelina let it all rush by as she sat in the backseat, chatting with Stellan. \u201cDo you want to stop in Chinatown?\u201d she said, her face lighting up. \u201cIt would make an exotic background for a portrait of you, Mr. Fletcher. I shall try the camera today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Chinatown wise, Miss Ralston?\u201d Gerald said from the driver\u2019s seat. He made no apology for eavesdropping. \u201cThe quarantine has only just been lifted.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI suspect that affair was motivated more by politics than good medical practice, a heinously racist move by Governor Gage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you say, Miss Ralston.\u201d</p><p>She glared at the back of Gerald\u2019s head.</p><p>Stellan spoke before she could say more. \u201cI agree he\u2019s not taking his custodianship seriously, at least not in favor of American-Chinese civil rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She nodded to Stellan. \u201cFar from helping, it appears Gage is thwarting all advancements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, is it wise?\u201d Gerald let his protest hang.</p><p>As they crested Telegraph Hill, she gazed out at the East Bay. \u201cVery well. The fog\u2019s rolling in anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be a cloud sea about us,\u201d Stellan said.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll take photos here then.\u201d She gestured out the window. \u201cWhile we still have the sunlight.\u201d Her eyes danced. \u201cI will capture you yet, Mr. Fletcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Stellan smiled.</p><p>\u201cAre you shy of being photographed?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot by you.\u201d</p><p>Gerald parked the Ford, and he and Stellan made to unload the newly rented camera gear. Angelina elbowed in before they could get very far. \u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d she said to both men. \u201cI need no assistance, thank you.\u201d</p><p>STELLAN WAS CAPTIVATED as Angelina moved here and there, testing the light, feeling the wind. She chose a gnarled old oak as the backdrop and had him stand beside it, his hand resting on the trunk. The light dappled through the branches like ripples in a tide pool. The touch of the wood was solid as reef.</p><p>\u201cYou like trees?\u201d Angelina approached him to straighten the fall of his coat.</p><p>\u201cI like all living things.\u201d</p><p>She paused. \u201cWhat a splendid and unusual response. Are you a humanitarian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say so, yes.\u201d He was lost in her dark eyes and the gentle floral scent that rose from her body. He memorized her every movement, comment, and instruction, letting her fill his mind completely.</p><p>\u201cWith the coat over your shoulder, I think.\u201d</p><p>He obliged her.</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Can you hold that?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer but instead studied the tree with its twisting branches that reached for the sky, dark arms against the glimpse of blue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very good subject,\u201d she said, sliding in a glass plate. She had him strike different poses until Gerald pulled out his pocket watch and cleared his throat, a practice that was beginning to make Stellan\u2019s upper lip twitch.</p><p>\u201cOne more,\u201d Angelina said, and she turned to Gerald. \u201cIt\u2019s all set. Just shoot when I give the word.\u201d</p><p>Gerald\u2019s face became even more dour as Angelina stood on the other side of the trunk and placed her hand on it as well. The sensation, through the tree, jolted him. He could hear her heartbeat through the living wood.</p> <p>\u201cNow, Gerald,\u201d she said.</p><p>They were meant to be looking at the camera, but somehow their eyes found each other\u2019s and remained engaged until Gerald, having taken the shot, asked them if that would be quite enough.</p><p>\u201cTo the wharf?\u201d he whispered before she could move away. \u201cFor lunch?\u201d If he didn\u2019t get a full breath of sea air in his lungs and fog on his face soon, he didn\u2019t know how he would continue.</p><p>Angelina touched her neck, feeling the edges of the dressing. \u201cYes, to the wharf!\u201d she replied, and gathered her camera gear. He carried the tripod back to the car while she speculated on how the shots would turn out. Best not think about that . . . They jumped in the backseat laughing, while Gerald\u2019s posture became even more rigid than usual.</p><p>Chapter Four</p> <p>5:30 P.M.</p><p>Tuesday, April 17, 1906</p><p>THE WHARF REVIVED him. Angelina revived him, and relief flooded his body. The fog formed droplets on his lashes, and the lull of the waves below made it possible to relax though he longed to strip off and dive headfirst into the sea. They sat across from each other at a small table outside the fishmongers\u2019. The aromas were heavenly, a mixture of salt air, whitecaps, and fresh fish. Colored lanterns hung on strings overhead. They radiated bright, glowing auras that turned Angelina\u2019s hair red as starfish. Stellan took full mouthfuls of the chowder. \u201cDelicious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too salty for you, Mr. Fletcher?\u201d Angelina looked up from her bowl.</p><p>\u201cI enjoy the salt, Miss Ralston. You can be sure of that.\u201d His left hand rested on the red checkered tablecloth.</p><p>Angelina laid her gloved fingers on top of his. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you do.\u201d She pulled back immediately, as if she\u2019d touched a hot stove.</p> <p>Heat rushed through his body from the contact. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything I wouldn\u2019t enjoy in your presence.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, a light sound. \u201cI\u2019m sure you exaggerate, sir.\u201d</p><p>For moments uncounted, he basked in her presence. The distraction and bustle of the wharf receded until all he could hear was her, the rhythmic flow of her breath, and, unfortunately, Gerald\u2019s incessant throat clearing. The man stood over them, his look admonishing.</p><p>Angelina turned to the valet, her eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cI believe we must leave at once, Miss Ralston, if we are to arrive on time for dinner.\u201d Stellan watched her response. It was a shrug at best even though Gerald made it sound as if they were breaking universal laws with their impromptu repast. The man was actually getting his watch out, again, and throwing them both accusatory looks.</p><p>\u201cShall I bring the car around?\u201d he asked in a flat voice.</p><p>Angelina dabbed at the corners of her mouth. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be more expedient if I . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll walk fast.\u201d She cut in. \u201cIf you go start the car, we\u2019ll not lose a moment. You know how long it takes to crank over in the cold.\u201d</p><p>Gerald\u2019s frown lines creased. \u201cVery well.\u201d He left at a clip, apparently wanting to set an example.</p><p>Stellan rose, as Angelina did, but instead of heading for the car, she went to the edge of the wharf. He joined her, and they stood side by side, listening to the water slosh against the pilings.</p><p>The lanternlight made extraordinary patterns on the surface.</p><p>\u201cHow beautiful,\u201d she whispered, and her whole body shivered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cold.\u201d Stellan took off his coat and draped it over her shoulders. \u201cShall we go?\u201d</p><p>Yes, do hurry, Stellan. You\u2019re missing all the fun.</p><p>Stellan\u2019s blood froze. Salila? Where are you?</p><p>I am having quite a time entertaining the Ralstons and that delectable Mr. Blackwell.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon me?\u201d Angelina turned toward him.</p><p>\u201cGerald is right. It\u2019s best we return home with all haste.\u201d</p><p>ANGELINA DIDN\u2019T HAVE time to ponder the change that had come over Stellan. Their easy intimacy and the pleasure of the day had suddenly evaporated, and he seemed preoccupied with his own thoughts. She inquired again to no avail and decided to let it drop. Whatever had assailed him on the wharf would come out, or not. A person was due his privacy. She knew she needed her own. And why would he want to discuss his personal feelings in front of the enormous ears of Gerald anyway? She clasped her hands in her lap and stared straight ahead. I\u2019ve been too forward.</p><p>Never. . .</p><p>She stared at him, but he didn\u2019t acknowledge her until they were home.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies, Miss Ralston,\u201d he whispered, when they reached her front door.</p><p>It flew open before she could respond. \u201cDinner is already served, Miss,\u201d Jeanie said behind the butler. \u201cShall I help you get ready?\u201d They were ushered into the foyer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure my tea dress will do tonight, Jeanie. Better that than arriving any later.\u201d The look on her maid\u2019s face told her something was quite out of the ordinary, but she stuck to her decision. \u201cShall we, Mr. Fletcher?\u201d Angelina offered him her arm, and they headed for the formal dining hall. Nothing could have prepared her for the scene they walked in on.</p><p>The room was a din of conversation, laughter mostly, and much of it coming from Mason and her father. Mrs. Blackwell and her mother seemed quite stiff, if anything, and it didn\u2019t take her long to discover why. Between her fianc\u00e9 and the esteemed Mr. Ralston was a woman in a provocative evening gown, a gold-and-black affair that plunged far lower in front and back than even the latest fashion from Paris demanded. She had shimmering hair done up high on her head with a few curling strands falling down her flawless white cheeks. Her face was extraordinary, with full lips and feline eyes. The air around her positively zapped and crackled.</p><p>Both men were intoxicated, displaying manners far less than formal. Their guest, this Aphrodite, was telling a story about a voyage in the Mediterranean. Stellan and Angelina stood in the doorway, staring, until all conversation stopped.</p><p>\u201cStellan! There you are!\u201d The shimmering goddess put her hand on Mason\u2019s forearm while leaning in to Mr. Ralston to whisper none too quietly, \u201cYou have no idea how long I\u2019ve been looking for him.\u201d The men laughed and swigged down their wine. Then she stared at Angelina, and said, \u201cWhatever have you done to my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalila.\u201d Stellan\u2019s voice was icy.</p><p>Heat rushed to Angelina\u2019s face. \u201cYour brother?\u201d Somewhere in the shock of it all she felt relief, until noticing Mason again. Mason, my fianc\u00e9. She\u2019d had no right to entertain thoughts of Stellan, not when she was spoken for. Angelina, pull yourself together. She stepped forward. \u201cHow delightful to meet you. Miss Fletcher is it?\u201d</p><p>Mason and Mr. Ralston got to their feet, dropping their napkins and scraping their chairs. \u201cAllow me to introduce you to Mrs. Fisher, of late from the Mediterranean.\u201d Her fianc\u00e9 slurred his words and smiled stupidly.</p><p>\u201cPleased, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Angelina gave a very small curtsy.</p><p>Stellan mumbled something under his breath. She couldn\u2019t catch the words. There was much fuss settling everyone back at the table, but once they were seated, the story of the voyage, to Crete, it turned out, continued. Angelina didn\u2019t think her mother\u2019s face could get any tighter, but Mrs. Blackwell appeared to be surrendering to the fiasco. She started guzzling down wine as fast as the servant could refill her goblet. Stellan didn\u2019t say a word as Mrs. Fisher carried on though his jaw clenched tight, and his eyes stared daggers. Angelina would not have wanted that gaze turned her way under any circumstances. No sooner did she think this, he looked at her, but his expression had changed. Instead of frightening her, it brought a rush of heat and excitement. Angelina fanned her face and took a sip of wine.</p><p>As the food was served, the whole table became even more animated. Salila devoured an entire salmon, then downed a whole bottle of Napa Valley white herself, alternately enveloping Mason and Mr. Ralston, whispering in their ears and hanging off their broad shoulders. During one prolonged intimacy, Mrs. Ralston stood, tossed down her napkin, and said she would oversee the coffee. She turned to Mrs. Blackwell, but the woman was sound asleep in her chair. That seemed to disgust her mother even more, and she left abruptly.</p><p>STELLAN GLARED AT Salila. What in the dark tomb\u2019s mercy are you doing here? He gripped his goblet tight enough to turn his knuckles white.</p><p>I could ask you the same thing! She wrapped herself around Mr. Ralston and whispered into his ear. The man bellowed with laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhy have you come, dear sister? What news?\u201d Stellan spoke aloud.</p><p>\u201cBrother! You\u2019ll be thrilled. I\u2019ve a message from our father!\u201d Salila said, as the servant took her plate, with its entire fish skeleton.</p><p>\u201cDo tell.\u201d He tried to keep his voice even.</p><p>\u201cHe wonders when you\u2019re coming home.\u201d</p><p>I said I would be back in due course!</p><p>True, but nobody thought \u201cdue course\u201d would involve sightseeing trips through the city with your little angel. You were to get in, get the information, and get back.</p><p>I\u2019ve done my part! Studied the plans for the Golden Gate Bridge. Discussed them. . .</p><p>And?</p><p>They\u2019re preposterous. Enormous cantilevers to counter the span. The cost of materials alone is prohibitive. More importantly, even if they could build it, such a monstrosity won\u2019t touch us.</p><p>How can you be sure?</p><p>It\u2019s a suspension bridge. The pilings are nowhere near our tombs. He was aware of Angelina, her face pale as she stared at him. \u201cI\u2019ll be home soon enough, Mrs. Fisher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Father will be so pleased.\u201d Salila batted her eyelashes. \u201cYou must come back with me then.\u201d What I mean to say, Stellan, is I\u2019m not leaving until you do, and you know what that means. . .</p><p>You\u2019re not to touch these people!</p><p>But my fun on the dock has already made the papers, twice. I shouldn\u2019t risk a third.</p><p>Then go back to the sea! Angelina isn\u2019t food, nor is her family!</p><p>Really? What keeps you in the daylight then?</p><p>His grip tightened, and the glass shattered in his hand. The contents spilled over the white tablecloth.</p><p>Angelina startled and immediately reached out to him. She blotted his hand with her napkin as servants came to clean up the mess. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>His eyes softened. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I alarmed you.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Salila burst out laughing. I see. Love?</p><p>You see nothing at all!</p><p>Salila went on as if he hadn\u2019t spoken. But your little angel is engaged. Silly human tradition. Anyway, it\u2019s not like you could offer her your hand. Is that how they say it? \u201cYour hand?\u201d So quaint. She looked over at Mason. Though he\u2019s hardly interested, is he? Not with me here anyway. How fickle. . .</p><p>\u201cSalila, stop!\u201d Stellan shouted aloud, bringing all eyes to him.</p><p>Mrs. Blackwell roused for a moment, snorted, then went back to sleep, her chin dropping toward her bosom.</p><p>I think you best call me Mrs. Fisher, while we\u2019re guests, don\u2019t you? It already appears we are overly familiar. She winked. Just as Mason leaned in to whisper something in her ear, she turned to him and planted her lips on his mouth.</p><p>I will not witness this! Angelina clenched her fists.</p><p>Angelina? Stellan pressed his temples and turned to her. Did you say that?</p><p>What are you talking about, Stellan? The girl hasn\u2019t opened her mouth all night. Salila caught the look on his face. Unless . . . She leaned back in her chair and slowly clapped her hands. My dear Stellan, I do think you have created a blood bond. How utterly inconvenient.</p><p>Don\u2019t be ridiculous. Blood blonds can only be formed between two Mar who are. . .</p><p>Yes, I know. Deeply in love. For an instant, Salila\u2019s eyes softened, and she touched the hollow of her neck. Or of the same family line, she went on briskly. Unless she\u2019s our lost sibling, or secretly Mar, I believe we have something rather unique! Salila cackled as she applauded them both. Wait until Teern hears of this! Another Mar-human coupling. It will kill him!</p><p>Another?</p><p>Never mind! This is priceless.</p><p>Mr. Fletcher? What did you say? Angelina looked at him with round eyes.</p><p>Stellan stared back, unable to respond. Finally, he cleared his throat and spoke aloud. \u201cYour neck. It\u2019s bleeding.\u201d</p><p>Gerald appeared in the doorway, interrupting them all. \u201cAfter-dinner drinks are served in the reception room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful!\u201d Salila smiled. Shall we? No point in raising their suspicions, is there. Not if we want to stay on? Though I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to explain this all to the angel. Did you drink from the girl nonstop?</p><p>Twice! Only twice! And, you\u2019re not staying on, Stellan said with a mental growl.</p><p>Oh but I am. They\u2019ve offered me a room on your floor. Isn\u2019t that sweet? Shall we visit her together tonight?</p><p>Touch her, and I will destroy you.</p><p>She laughed. I\u2019d like to see you try.</p><p>ANGELINA PRESSED A clean cloth against her neck. The wound wasn\u2019t healing, and the evening\u2019s madness hadn\u2019t helped.</p><p>\u201cAngelina, are you alright?\u201d Stellan rose, and they all made a move toward the reception room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course she is,\u201d Mrs. Fisher answered. She stood tall and elegant, making Mason look like a red-faced garden gnome clinging to her side. \u201cFresh and . . .\u201d</p><p>Shut up!</p><p>Angelina flinched.</p> <p>\u201cI am well, Mr. Fletcher, Mrs. Fisher, though somewhat confused.\u201d Angelina took a moment to glare at Mason, who didn\u2019t register her presence. \u201cI might forgo drinks and retire . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense! We haven\u2019t even had a chat.\u201d Mrs. Fisher dropped Mason\u2019s arm and offered it to Angelina. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>Stellan pulled his sister back. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, dearest, I would like a moment with Miss Ralston.\u201d And you keep away from her before I stake you with the first shard of wood I find!</p><p>Angelina startled. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Fisher chuckled into her hands. \u201cDefinitely a problem, brother.\u201d</p> <p>Stellan whispered something to his sister, and the woman literally bared her teeth at him before taking Mason\u2019s waiting arm and walking away. He turned to Angelina. \u201cMiss Ralston, let me explain.\u201d</p><p>Angelina composed herself. \u201cPlease do.\u201d</p><p>They stood in the hallway and allowed the others to precede them, all but Mrs. Blackwell, who remained snoring in the dining room.</p><p>Stellan let out a long slow sigh. \u201cI have to return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s realm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRealm?\u201d she whispered. \u201cIs he a king?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot precisely, but my presence is urgently needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She waited for more, and when nothing came, her brows knit. \u201cThat\u2019s the sum of your explanation?\u201d</p><p>Stellan took a step closer. There is so much to tell you. \u201cMy family is . . . eccentric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that,\u201d she said. Her uncertainty melted as their eyes met. Stellan took her hand, and warmth washed over her like a tide. She breathed deeply. \u201cMr. Fletcher, will you be coming back?\u201d</p><p>He stopped outside the reception room, and they faced each other. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . not as simple as that, but I will, if I can.\u201d</p><p>Her smile slowly faded. \u201cThere is much mystery about you, Mr. Fletcher. I fear . . .\u201d</p><p>The reception-room door burst open, and Mason Blackwell, arm in arm with Mrs. Fisher, waltzed right past them.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are they going?\u201d Angelina asked</p><p>Salila!</p><p>Angelina pressed her temples. She was hearing voices in her head more and more. \u201cStellan? Did you just say . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe your fianc\u00e9 is showing Mrs. Fisher to her room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow considerate.\u201d The man she was engaged to couldn\u2019t care less about her, and the one who turned her world upside down was leaving, with no foreseeable return. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, Mr. Fletcher, I really must retire.\u201d</p><p>Before he could reply, her father threw open the reception-room door. \u201cMr. Fletcher, there you are! Come! I must show you those alternate designs, as promised.\u201d</p><p>Angelina and Stellan exchanged a lingering look until she whispered good night and headed up the stairs. It was beyond her ability to resist glancing into the guest room as she passed. Mason lay facedown on the bed, apparently unconscious, boots being pulled off by his valet. She shook her head and entered the comfort of her own room. Jeanie was fluffing pillows and turning down her bed.</p><p>\u201cWhatever was I thinking,\u201d Angelina said, and flopped into the overstuffed chair by the window.</p><p>\u201cAbout what, Miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither of them!\u201d But in her mind, she felt Stellan\u2019s warm touch and caught the faint scent of the sea. As the sensations engulfed her, she let the tears fall silently down her cheeks.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>3:00 A.M.</p><p>Tuesday, April 17, 1906</p><p>A KNOCK ON the door jolted her awake. Before she could say a word, it creaked open, then closed with a soft snick. Angelina held her breath, feeling the presence in her room. The hairs on her arms lifted, and chills zipped down her spine. His presence engulfed her. Stellan . . . She knew it was he.</p><p>I wanted to make sure you were alright. He came to the edge of her bed and stood there, looking down at her, just as he had when she\u2019d washed up on the beach. The window shade must have been left up because she could see him clearly. He was luminous in the moonlight, his eyes deep and penetrating.</p><p>You\u2019re so thoughtful. Angelina sat up, letting the covers slide down. She wore a sky blue satin nightgown, one sent to her by a cousin in Paris. Her mother thought it completely improper, so Angelina wore it often.</p><p>I can think of nothing but you, Angelina. He had taken off his vest and tie, letting them fall to the floor. When she looked up again, his shirt was gone, and there in the moonlight, for a brief moment, her mind went to another vision, in which a beautiful naked body was leaning over her. Is this a dream?</p><p>It\u2019s whatever you want it to be, Angelina.</p><p>The thought made her smile for the impropriety, Stellan in her bedroom in the wee hours of the night, shirtless . . . She looked again. Naked! It was both shocking and thrilling. Something nagged in the back of her mind, but for the life of her, she couldn\u2019t figure out what it was.</p><p>Angelina . . . His voice caressed her, and she shivered.</p><p>I was hoping you would come. She opened her arms, and a moment later, he was wrapped in them. The warmth of his body embraced her as heat rushed to her limbs. He pulled her into his lap and tilted her chin. Angelina\u2019s lips parted in a smile. He smelled like a fresh sea breeze.</p><p>What is it about you that has captured me so completely? His lips closed over hers in the softest of kisses. She twined her legs around his back, wanting to get closer, wanting nothing to come between them. As the kiss deepened, she felt sweat prickle down her spine. For long moments, they shared the intimacy, barely able to stop for breath. She drank him in, astonished by her building hunger. Stellan answered her need, kissing her more fiercely. He slipped the satin straps off her shoulders, exposing her round, ample breasts. She called out when he suckled her, one breast, then the other. Dampness spread between her legs. In that moment, the world fell away, and Angelina couldn\u2019t imagine a place where her body ended and his began.</p><p>Stellan held her tight, lifting her up as he lay back, his head at the foot of the bed. Angelina straddled him, kissing his neck, his checks, his hard abs. He groaned as she grasped his shaft, rock hard, with skin soft as silk. Angelina . . . His voice was deep and husky.</p><p>She laughed and covered his mouth with her hand to smother the moans.</p><p>He sat up, kissing her smile. Two can play that game! Before she could answer, he flipped her onto her back, pushed her hands over her head, and, excruciatingly slowly, kissed and sucked and licked his way to her mound. When his tongue found the folds between her now-parted legs and the hot moisture there, they both cried out. She grabbed his long hair as he thrilled her, again and again.</p><p>Stellan! she called like a wolf to the moon. Stellan, Stellan Stellan!</p><p>He ran his tongue up over her mound, her belly, her breasts. He kissed her face, her eyelids, her earlobes, and as his lips touched the fullness of her wet mouth, he pushed slowly into the heat between her legs. She called out again, hands digging into his back.</p><p>Open your eyes, he said.</p><p>Angelina looked up at him and for moments, like years passing, they stared into each other\u2019s depths. She began to rock beneath him, and he matched her rhythm, plunging deeper with every thrust. His eyes never left hers as he bellowed his pleasure into the night, his whole body shuddering.</p><p>Angelina tucked damp strands of hair behind his ears and traced the contours of his face. Stellan . . . Don\u2019t leave me. Ever.</p><p>I won\u2019t. He hesitated a moment, opened his mouth, and sank his fangs into her neck.</p><p>4:45 A.M.</p><p>Wednesday, April 18, 1906</p><p>STELLAN LEFT ANGELINA\u2019S room and closed the door behind him. The house was asleep, his footfalls dead quiet. He thought of her lying there, wrapped in a black-and-red-embroidered silk dressing gown, her body glowing from their passion as she drifted off to sleep. It was almost impossible to walk away. How could he leave her? How could he stay? For her to join him was to ask the unthinkable. But the blood bond. It would never be broken, at least it never could be between Mar. He wondered at his sister. Had it happened to her all those centuries ago? It might explain a few things, but if it was any indication of the outcome for a Mar-human coupling, it didn\u2019t bode well. Salila had lost her man, and it had left her more than a little jaded. No! It can\u2019t be like that for me and Angelina. Stellan went down the hall, each thought wrestling with the other. He\u2019d said his good-byes; he only wished she would remember them when she woke.</p><p>The smell of fresh blood halted his thoughts. He sniffed the air, the aroma rushing through his nostrils and tickling the back of his throat. It led him farther down the hall to Mason Blackwell\u2019s door. Salila? He tried the handle, but it was locked. She wouldn\u2019t . . . A loud thump sounded, and he shouldered in. It took him a moment to register the scene.</p><p>The room pulsed in the glow of soft candlelight. The bed was rumpled, the covers thrown back. On the floor was Salila\u2019s evening gown. The Mar woman hunched naked over a dazed, and equally naked, Blackwell.</p><p>In a blink, Stellan was there. He pulled her up and slammed her against the closet. Salila! Stop!</p><p>She flung hair out of her face and snarled. Faster than humanly possible he flipped her to the ground and pinned her down, his teeth grating against her ear. \u201cListen to me, sister, and listen carefully. You\u2019re going to get up, gather your things, and leave. In that order and nothing else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the problem with you?\u201d She ground out the words into the carpet. \u201cHe was willing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was extremely drunk!\u201d</p><p>She sighed, relaxing. \u201cYou do know how to ruin a good night, don\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking, Salila! You have to leave.\u201d</p><p>Let me up. She growled. Someone\u2019s coming.</p><p>Damn . . . As Stellan released her, there was a knock at the door. It squeaked open, and Angelina appeared. Her face was momentarily soft in the candlelight until she took in the scene. \u201cMr. Fletcher, what is going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I show you?\u201d Salila sprang at Angelina. Stellan grabbed the Mar woman and hurled her to the other side of the room. By then, Jeanie and Mrs. Ralston were at the door, gasping, then screaming.</p><p>Get out of here! Now! Stellan roared into Salila\u2019s mind. And put some clothes on! He threw the top sheet over Mason as the man tried to sit up. His hand clutched his neck.</p><p>Footsteps thundered down the hall. \u201cNobody move!\u201d Mr. Ralston\u2019s voice boomed as a rifle was cocked. He burst in on them, let out an oath, and leveled his rifle at Stellan. Salila got behind him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shoot,\u201d Angelina cried out. She moved directly in front of the gun.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d he shouted at her.</p><p>Mrs. Ralston grabbed her daughter and handed her off to Gerald, who stood near the door, eyes wide, his usual reserve abandoned. Mrs. Blackwell pushed past him into the room, and the screams began again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re so sorry to have caused a disturbance,\u201d Stellan said, as he and Salila backed toward the window.</p><p>Mr. Ralston looked from the bed, to the floor, to Salila. At that moment, Mason slumped, the bite wounds obvious as his head lolled to the side. \u201cDon\u2019t move, or I\u2019ll shoot!\u201d Ralston said.</p><p>Salila broke for the door, and Mr. Ralston squeezed the trigger.</p><p>\u201cNo, Father!\u201d Angelina yelled.</p><p>Faster than the human eye could follow, Stellan dove for Salila. He rolled with her and flung them both backward out the window, ahead of the bullet. They slammed hard into the ground, glass shattering around them like ice. Stellan released her, jumped to his feet, and ran toward the sea.</p><p>5:00 A.M.</p><p>Wednesday, April 18, 1906</p><p>ANGELINA\u2019S HANDS SHOOK as she sipped her tea. Jeanie tried to pour more, but she nearly dropped the pot.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Jeanie. Sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mustn\u2019t, Miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not the time for propriety. Sit down. I insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Miss.\u201d The young maid sat on the edge of the parlor chair and looked at her hands.</p><p>Angelina got Jeanie a cup and filled it for her. \u201cYou\u2019ve a right to be as distraught as the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>Her maid took a deep breath. \u201cI agree it was no small horror. What a scene! The gunshot was earsplitting. I was sure Mr. Fletcher and Mrs. Fisher would be splattered on the pavement, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were nowhere to be found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a man altogether nude. Quite startling.\u201d She glanced at Angelina. \u201cDoes this mean the engagement is off?\u201d Jeanie asked.</p><p>Angelina pushed her long hair back from her face. \u201cLet\u2019s not speculate on that topic right now, shall we, Jeanie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Miss.\u201d Her maid blushed.</p><p>Angelina nodded and sipped her tea.</p><p>The police had arrived and questioned everyone. They were upstairs now with her father and Dr. Medleys, and a very confused Mason Blackwell, who seemed to remember nothing but a knock at his door in the wee hours of the night. She frowned. Stellan was in the room. He and his sister ran . . .</p><p>But Stellan couldn\u2019t have been involved, she argued with herself.</p><p>Then what was he doing there in the first place?</p><p>He must have heard a noise, same as I . . .</p><p>Are you sure? Images of Stellan falling backward out the window flashed again into her mind. How could he survive and run away. Her most troubling question was, When will I see him again.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand this!\u201d Angelina stood up.</p><p>Jeanie jumped as if prodded. \u201cMiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s too much whirling in my head. I\u2019m going to my darkroom if anyone needs me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTo develop photographs, Miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to do something, or I\u2019ll go mad,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help, Miss?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d Angelina gave Jeanie a quick hug. \u201cGet to the kitchen with the others. They will all have their appetites back soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Jeanie curtsied and left. Angelina headed for the one place she could be alone with her feelings and put some kind of meaning to the night\u2019s crazed events.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>5:00 A.M.</p><p>Wednesday, April 18, 1906</p> <p>STELLAN DIDN\u2019T STOP running until he reached the end of the pier. Salila was ahead of him, and she dove from the edge, disappearing beneath the black swell. Stellan shucked his coat. There was no turning back, thanks to Salila. He could only hope Angelina would understand his sudden disappearance. But how? He stared at the water, dark and lapping against the pilings. Minutes passed as he watched the gray light of predawn give form to the city. I can\u2019t leave you, Angelina.</p><p>Salila surfaced beneath him. \u201cWhat\u2019s taking you so long? Get out of those ridiculous clothes and dive in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course something\u2019s wrong. You\u2019re not in the water.\u2019</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. Listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it. Nothing. It\u2019s dawn, and the gulls aren\u2019t screeching at the fishing boats. No sea lions barking . . .\u201d</p><p>Salila sprang from the water and stood dripping beside him. She grabbed his arm and made to drag him off the edge. \u201cYou need to stop worrying. I got us out of there in time, and now all we have to do is swim for it.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeern\u2019s set things in motion.\u201d</p><p>The color drained from his face. \u201cNo! He doesn\u2019t have to! The bridge isn\u2019t going forward, not for decades by the looks of it, and when it does . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it, Stellan. When it does . . . Teern\u2019s making sure that \u2018when\u2019 isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</p><p>The air grew still, as if the city held its breath. Before Stellan could say another word, the ground began to rumble. Whitecaps appeared on the water, and the whole length of the wharf undulated like a serpent. A thunderous roar welled up. Waves splashed high, soaking his clothes. It sounded as if the city would tear apart.</p><p>\u201cEarthquake?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Stellan, a large one, and it\u2019s arrived, so be smart, jump into the water, and swim to the tombs!\u201d She let him go and dove back into the choppy waves.</p><p>Stellan! A voice rippled through his mind.</p><p>Angelina! He turned toward Pacific Heights in the distance.</p><p>5:10 A.M.</p><p>Wednesday, April 18, 1906</p><p>ANGELINA IMMERSED THE photographic paper in the developing tray. The soft red light made it look as if it rippled in a bath of blood and water. As she moved it to the fixer, her frown lines deepened. Give it a minute, she told herself, but a minute made no difference. A photograph didn\u2019t lie, and this image of her and Stellan was missing one essential component: Mr. Fletcher himself. \u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>The camera had captured Angelina, one hand on the gnarled old oak tree and the other resting softly against the folds of her skirt. Her eyes were supposed to be on Stellan, if memory served, but instead they stared across time and space into . . . nothing. Not even a fog or blur. There was simply nothing where his body should have been. Where his body was! She dropped the picture back into the fixer and released the tongs as if they\u2019d caught fire. Who is this man? Her hand went to her neck, and she shivered.</p><p>The fixer settled over the image and went still, but as she watched, it began to ripple on its own. Soon, the liquid in all three trays became agitated and sloshed onto the table. The red light overhead swung violently, and upstairs, someone yelled \u201cEarthquake!\u201d Footfalls sounded above. Shouts and confusion. Someone called her name. The floor seemed to rise, and she buckled to her knees.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m down here!\u201d She tried to climb the stairs, but the floor tipped, and she fell, rolling toward the back wall, along with bottles of developer, tools, bags of flour, and boxes. When she struggled to her feet, the light winked out. \u201cI\u2019m down here!\u201d she screamed again. As the walls cracked and caved, she had one thought and one only. Stellan! Where are you?</p><p>5:12 A.M.</p><p>Wednesday, April 18, 1906</p><p>STELLAN BOLTED ALONG the wharf, past the ferry building, and up California Street. The buildings rushed by in a blur, his speed as fast as light. The paving warped under his feet. Whole sections of street dropped away. Others shot up as if punched by an underground giant. Teern! Stop this madness! But the only thing he heard was Angelina\u2019s voice in his mind.</p><p>He ran on. People were pouring out into the street, carrying their belongings, running for their lives. He tore past, only a rush of wind to them. Stellan reached the house and leapt the wrought-iron gate. It was still standing though the fence was gone, the bricks scattered into the street. The Ralstons\u2019 Queen Anne home looked as if it had been uprooted and slammed back into the lot askew. It listed downhill, shutters and doors dangling open. The entrance wall had fallen, and a turret lay in the garden. Inside was worse. Dust rose, thick and gritty. Mr. Ralston climbed over the rubble.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Angelina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Screams came from upstairs, and Mr. Ralston ran toward them. \u201cI have to get them out. Gas fire\u2019s started in the kitchen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngelina!\u201d Stellan shouted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the basement!\u201d</p><p>He was at the door in seconds, heaving aside timbers and bricks. Flames shot up from the adjacent kitchen. Faster than human sight could follow, he pulled the rest of the rubble and beams aside, stormed down the stairs, and jumped the last few feet to land in front of Angelina. Light from above flooded in, and black smoke billowed. Suddenly, the tremor stopped, and they fell into each other\u2019s arms. For a moment, the horrors of the world faded. The flames and falling ceiling, the broken ground and the devastation disappeared as he held her tight. He looked into her eyes, fire turning them golden. \u201cWe have to get out.\u201d</p><p>She took a step back. \u201cThe wound on Mason? Did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until you tell me who you are.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe photographs I took. You\u2019re not in them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngelina . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a demon, aren\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He took her hands. \u201cWe must go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat then?\u201d She pulled out of his grip. \u201cHow can we hear each other\u2019s thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngelina, there\u2019s no time. I promise you, I will not harm you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say it, Stellan. Ghost? Apparition? Angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing like that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me the truth!\u201d</p><p>He clenched his fists. \u201cMar!\u201d he shouted. \u201cI\u2019m Mar!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that means!\u201d she yelled back.</p><p>He looked around as if seeking an answer in the devastation. \u201cMar are what you would call sirens, or mer-people.\u201d</p><p>She knit her brow. \u201cYou saved me from the ferry accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, but it\u2019s complicated. I . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the sea, we are deathless. But blood sustains us on land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman blood. And, somehow, sharing yours has given us . . .\u201d</p><p>She touched her neck and stared at him. \u201cGiven us what, Stellan?\u201d</p><p>He took her face tenderly in his hands. It was only a few drops, but for us it seems it was enough to create a blood bond.</p><p>The far wall collapsed as a shock wave ripped through the basement. No more time! Stellan bundled her into his arms and took off.</p><p>Wait! The others! We have to help them. She struggled to get free.</p><p>He held her fiercely until they were out of the house. Gerald was in the street with Jeanie and the rest of the staff. He deposited Angelina there and turned to Gerald.</p><p>\u201cWhere are Mr. and Mrs. Ralston? The Blackwells?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t see them. We\u2019ll have to wait for the fire department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will be too late!\u201d He ran back to the front door as the entire entranceway collapsed. Flames lashed out at him, forcing a retreat. Fire was not his element, and, like the sun, it could consume a Mar\u2019s life force. He leapt to the side of the house and grabbed the base of the large bay window, tearing it from the framework with a single heave. He jumped through the gaping hole in the wall, calling for Mr. Blackwell.</p><p>The house was thick with smoke and falling plaster. It made it impossible to see farther than his hand. Heat seared him, and he fought every instinct to get away, get back to the sea. Above the crackle and roar of flames, his sensitive hearing caught screams. He followed the sound to the base of the stairs. Mr. Ralston was there, trying to lift a beam that blocked the way. He was nearly done in by the smoke. Stellan stepped up and wrenched it away, tossing the hardwood support beam as if it were a matchstick. Mr. Ralston collapsed in a fit of coughing, and Stellan, with one arm over his shoulder, raced him out the bay window and down the steps, depositing him in front of Gerald. Instantly, he ran back into the burning house.</p><p>Stellan!</p><p>Help your father. I\u2019m getting the others.</p><p>He dashed up the stairs. The floor gave way underneath his last step, and he slipped, grabbing hold of the step as he swung in midair. Stellan dragged himself up to the hallway and ran to the doors, throwing each open until he reached Mason\u2019s. Too hot to touch, he kicked it in. Black smoke spewed out as the fire sucked back. \u201cStay low! Crawl toward my voice!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Mason appeared, red-faced and panting, dragging himself along the carpet.</p><p>\u201cWho else is in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one!\u201d</p><p>Cries rose up from the room behind him. Without another word, he threw Mason over his shoulder, raced to the stairway, and jumped to the ground floor. In a few strides, he was close enough to stand Mason up and propel him out the gaping bay window. Pausing only long enough to see that the man could walk, Stellan tore back for the two women.</p><p>They were both nearly unconscious when he found them, huddled together in the middle of the last room. The fire had traveled up the walls and across the ceiling. It creaked, and the light fixtures fell, exploding the gas lines. Using curtains to beat a path to Mrs. Ralston and Mrs. Blackwell, Stellan hauled both women up, one on each shoulder and smashed out the window as the entire floor collapsed. Coughing and choking, he staggered toward the street.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>6:00 A.M.</p><p>Wednesday, April 18, 1906</p><p>ANGELINA STARED AT the gap in the wall where the bay window had been. Her hands clenched, fingers twisting into knots. An icy chill gripped her as she strained to see through the haze. When Stellan didn\u2019t appear, tears welled.</p><p>\u201cLook there!\u201d Gerald shouted.</p><p>She wiped her face in time to see a figure slowly emerge from the smoke. \u201cStellan!\u201d In one arm, he held up her mother. Over his shoulder was draped Mrs. Blackwell. Angelina stumbled toward him. His clothes were smoldering, his hands burnt. Gerald and the cook appeared behind her, ready to help with the injured women. For once, Mrs. Ralston had nothing to say and could only concentrate on catching her breath. Mrs. Blackwell remained unconscious, and Gerald carried her out. Angelina supported Stellan as they made their way to the curb. \u201cYou\u2019re injured,\u201d she said, breathless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Both women were settled into the Ralstons\u2019 car. The window rolled down, and Angelina was barely aware of her father speaking from inside.</p><p>\u201cCar\u2019s full,\u201d he said. \u201cTraffic bottlenecked. You and the staff will make better time on foot. Get going! The whole street\u2019s ablaze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d She turned from Stellan toward her father.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep her safe.\u201d Stellan pointed toward the bay. \u201cWe should all head for the eastern ferry terminal. The city\u2019s going up in flames.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Ralston held his hand out to Stellan. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you are, young man, but when you say you can protect her, I believe you.\u201d Angelina\u2019s father stared unblinking as they locked hands. \u201cYour strength . . . Your speed . . . It\u2019s uncanny.\u201d He shook his head to clear it. \u201cIf you can\u2019t find us on the ferry terminal, head for Sausalito.\u201d Just then, the family home\u2019s roof dropped into the maw of flames. Her father cursed and rolled the window up. Gerald revved the engine, pulling out into the street.</p><p>Angelina watched them go, then encircled Stellan with her arms. \u201cYou saved everyone!\u201d She looked up at him through fresh tears. \u201cI was so afraid you wouldn\u2019t come out.\u201d</p><p>He sagged against her, his legs almost giving way.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. We must get to the ferry.\u201d He straightened, but could only stagger forward a few steps.</p><p>\u201cStellan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need . . .\u201d He coughed uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cTell me what I can do!\u201d</p><p>He leaned heavily into her. \u201cAngelina, I need blood.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, and she touched her neck. \u201cThis will save you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded once.</p><p>Of their own accord her fingers started to loosen the wrap. \u201cI . . . trust you.\u201d Slowly, she turned her neck toward him. As the dressing fell to the ground, her eyes drifted across his chest. There was a gash that ran deep into the muscle.</p><p>\u201cAngelina,\u201d he whispered, and held her tight.</p><p>First she felt a tender kiss along the hollow of her throat, and then a fleeting stab of pain. \u201cOh,\u201d she exclaimed. It was followed by soft, longing moans from the rush of euphoria. She leaned against him, watching the wound on his chest heal without leaving a trace. \u201cMy blood can do that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Stellan said into her ear. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><p>She stumbled back a step. \u201cLight-headed. Nothing more.\u201d A sudden memory crossed her mind. There was a cave, a young man . . . a kiss. She touched her lips, noticing how his face glowed from the warmth of her blood. \u201cStellan, what will we do?\u201d she asked, oblivious of the raging fire around them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you to the ferry. You\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot that.\u201d She buried her face in his chest. \u201cI mean, what about us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngelina . . .\u201d He stroked her hair. \u201cI am of the sea. You are not. We have to say good-bye. There\u2019s no other choice.\u201d They stood like a statue, face-to-face, entwined, her long black robe snapping in the wind while, in the background, the city burned.</p><p>\u201cStellan,\u201d she whispered, \u201cthere is always a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I choose to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>The fires flared, and suddenly she was traveling at breakneck speed. Her eyes watered and colors blurred. In strobe-light flashes, she saw cable-car tracks stretched and snapped in two, traffic slammed to a halt, with vehicles skidding on their sides. Drivers were getting out of their cars, arguing, yelling, running. She was propelled past them, knocking into shoulders, tripping up legs, bumping pedestrians out of the way. Building fronts cracked and fell, exposing terrified people inside. Many were caught on fire escapes, dangling from broken rungs. The crowd thickened as they neared the ferry building. Flames blasted out every window and door; smoke blackened the sky. In the distance, fire bells clanged, and the foghorns sounded. Stellan didn\u2019t slow down until they reached the pier.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you on a ferry,\u201d he said, pointing toward the crowded dock. He led the way up the stairs and onto the loading platform. The noise was deafening. \u201cAlmost there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Angelina planted her feet, forcing him to stop and listen to her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be safe, Stellan.\u201d She pulled him to the side, away from the people pushing to get aboard. There, in the echoing clamor of the ferry building, Angelina took hold of his hands and focused on his eyes. Warmth caressed her body, making her heart jump. More images flooded her mind. The longer she held on to him, the clearer it became. \u201cI remember,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe were in a cave. You saved me from drowning, and from the other Mar! That was Mrs. Fisher!\u201d She sucked in her breath, remembering the way he had touched her heart, warmed her . . . excited her, loved her. \u201cThese nights in my bed! They were real!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngelina . . .\u201d</p><p>In the crowded public building, for all to see, she reached up and held his face in her hands. \u201cLook at me, Stellan.\u201d Tears spilled down her cheeks as she lost herself in his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be safe,\u201d she said again. \u201cI want to be with you.\u201d On tiptoe, she lifted her mouth to his, her lips barely touching at first. Heat exploded inside her as he responded. Together, they shared a long, exploring kiss, their bodies merging into one. Stellan. . .</p><p>He lifted her to him, pressing her hard against his chest. \u201cAngelina,\u201d he whispered, breathless. His dark gray eyes devoured her until he came back to himself. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen explain it to me. Make me understand!\u201d The noise of the burning city dimmed as the wind shifted. Her braided hair streamed wildly, and her body shook. \u201cTell me there is a way for us to be together.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cI would have to take you to our tombs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the bottom of the Golden Gate Channel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow deep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree hundred feet. More in some places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . I\u2019ll survive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it, Angelina.\u201d He kissed her forehead and relaxed his embrace. \u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cTo become Mar, you must give your life to the sea.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her breath. \u201cI have to drown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and you must remain entombed until the transformation is complete.\u201d</p><p>She let out the breath she was holding. \u201cBut you\u2019ll be there. When I wake up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still don\u2019t understand, Angelina. The long sleep can last for decades, maybe centuries, and when you stir, only human blood will give you life. Even then, you may never rise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe change doesn\u2019t always take.\u201d</p><p>Stellan held her shoulders, his hands trembling. \u201cAngelina! I can\u2019t lose you!\u201d</p><p>Tears streamed down her face. \u201cNor I you! There is a way for us to be together, and I choose it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have you give up your life for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I won\u2019t live a life without you!\u201d</p><p>Stellan took her hands in his and closed his eyes. The ferry was gone, obscured by smoke. The woman is as strong and stubborn as she is beautiful.</p><p>The same could be said of the man. \u201cStellan, it will work. I feel it in my soul. You have to trust me. Trust us.\u201d</p><p>Flames consumed the wharf. The fire moved toward them at an alarming rate. Boards snapped and fell into the sea. Hand in hand they raced to the far end of the ferry terminal. The wall had crumbled, and as he leaned over, he could see the sheer drop to the black water far below. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to find a way down.\u201d As he spoke, an aftershock rolled beneath them, and the platform collapsed. \u201cJump!\u201d</p><p>She fell through the air, holding him tight. The heat from the fire scorched her until she thought she would be consumed. Seconds later, they hit the surface and plunged down into the sea.</p><p>Stellan covered her mouth with his own and exhaled. She felt a rush of heat, and, suddenly, the terrifying urge to breathe vanished.</p><p>Angelina looked at him, at his face, suddenly serene. Bubbles escaped her lips and sparked as they captured the firelight. Stellan, it is extraordinary!</p><p>You can\u2019t yet imagine. . .</p><p>Down they glided, the world slowly draining of noise and color. The water was emerald green with bursts of orange flaring from the burning city. Bricks and charred beams sank with them. They passed a drowned team of pale horses hitched to a black carriage. It was caught against the pilings. Bodies were stuck halfway out the windows, the door crushed shut. Brass harness buckles and iron-shod hooves gleamed in the light while the dead beasts\u2019 manes and tails fanned in the current. Stellan turned her toward him, his hand at her back. With the other, he slowly untied her silk robe and slipped it off her shoulders. It floated away like a black medusa, soon disappearing from sight.</p><p>Another shock wave jarred the water, followed by a distant explosion. A boiler, twisted and ripped in half, plummeted past them like a comet. It was followed by a rain of bodies. The corpses drifted, floating soundlessly, faces slack, eyes unseeing. Their frock coats and fine dresses pulled away as if to break free of the inevitable descent. Pockets turned out and shiny coins spilled, a shimmering waterfall into the abyss.</p><p>I\u2019m disappearing . . . Angelina\u2019s face was momentarily stricken.</p><p>Stellan placed his hand over her heart, and she relaxed, the corners of her mouth turning up in a smile. You\u2019ll be safe in the tombs. He slowly turned her back to him and held her close, one arm across her breasts, the other around her waist. Deeper and deeper into the green darkness they went. As they fell, he gently unlaced her camisole, pulling it over her head and upstretched arms until she was finally free, the earthly garments left behind. Lastly, he unbraided her hair, and it streamed about them in the cold current.</p><p>Where are we? Angelina asked, her voice fading to a whisper in his mind.</p><p>Above the tombs. He laid her naked body down on the ancient slab of jade and felt the living rock mold to her form. His eyes held hers. Angelina. . .</p><p>Stellan, she whispered as her heart beat for the last time. I love you . . . I love you. . .</p><p>Sunset</p><p>Thursday, January 5, 1933</p><p>ANGELINA FELT A tingling in her limbs. Warmth infused her as silky water washed back and forth like a tide over her naked skin. Her hair floated and rippled down her body, tickling her belly and thighs. A rich, delicious aroma engulfed her, and she drank it in, the metallic taste searing down her throat, into her spine, and into her limbs. For uncountable moments, she basked in the offering until memory jolted her mind. Stellan! she screamed. Her eyes flew open, and she gasped. Stellan!</p><p>He smiled down at her. I\u2019m here. </p> </body></html>"]
