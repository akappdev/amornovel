Fiona and I received a summons to come to Moon, the town of the witches. These sorts of towns sat all across the United States and housed mainly the otherworldly due to the fact that the humans demanded segregation. Some of the towns allowed humans within their protective borders but Moon wasn\u2019t one of them. It was strictly witches and hidden to look like a forest to the unknowing eye. The town wasn\u2019t actually called Moon, its name was Latin\u2014Per Lucem Lunae\u2014which translated to \u201cby the light of the moon, but it was easier for everyone to just call it Moon.</p><p>The Northern American Witches Council (NAWC) was not happy to learn vampires knew they could harvest the magic in our blood. Vampires producing magic wasn\u2019t natural or safe. As witches we answered to the NAWC for our actions. If we use our magic for negative deeds, then we had to face the council. The vampires, though, could use our magic unrestrained without any laws governing their stolen abilities. Since the vampire council wasn\u2019t taking action, the NAWC was.</p> <p>\u201cPracticing,\u201d Kye answered.</p><p>As soon as Fiona and I arrived at Moon, the council paired me with Kye while Fiona was free to socialize. They were vague on why I needed to train with him which only ticked me off. It annoyed me that I was being kept in the dark for whatever reason. They were gearing up to strike back at the vampires, but I still didn\u2019t know what part I was supposed to play in their plan. My situation was complicated further by the fact I was dating a vampire. Aiden was still in Flora, our hometown. He wasn\u2019t happy I left for Moon without him, but it wasn\u2019t safe for him to visit a town full of witches and warlocks\u2014our two species weren\u2019t on good terms at the moment.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d I asked, tired of getting vague answers. If they had plans for me, I deserved to know what they were. I wasn\u2019t going to be a pawn in their game against the vampires.</p><p>\u201cAnyone ever tell you that you ask too many questions?\u201d Kye snipped.</p><p>\u201cAnyone ever tell you that you dodge too many questions?\u201d I retorted.</p> <p>Kye turned to look at me and grinned. He was nice looking, sort of the average boy-next-door type. Spiky brown hair framed his square face. His eyes were a rich brown that reminded me of cocoa. He stood around five-foot-eleven and had a no nonsense attitude. He rubbed his hands together like he was cold and then held them over a grave like it would warm him.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said. I eyed him warily but stepped closer to the weathered tombstone. The eroded words were hard to read, but I could make out the date, 1924. Moon had its own cemetery, so the body buried beneath my feet had to be a witch.</p><p>Kye knelt down, and I mimicked him. This was a crappy way to spend a Friday night but complaining wouldn\u2019t change that, so I was quiet as I waited for him to explain what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I concentrated on our surroundings and tried to figure out exactly what I was supposed to be feeling. Crickets chirped in the distance and a slight breeze blew against my face. It was the middle of November, but Moon was magically altered to feel more like spring.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cHere,\u201d Kye grabbed my hand and placed it on the ground.</p><p>The grass tickled my palm, and I furrowed my eyebrows, still clueless about what I was supposed to be feeling and then it happened. The ground began to vibrate. My fingers sunk lower and lower into the moist dirt. Magic prickled along my skin. My eyes widened as I watched my hand sink beneath the dirt. When Kye let go of me, I shrieked and yanked my hand away. \u201cWha\u2014what was that? What happened?\u201d I stammered.</p><p>My talents didn\u2019t include an affinity for nature. I couldn\u2019t manipulate the elements, so whatever happened wasn\u2019t me. I held a combination of magic, from being able to form objects out of thin air, shoot magic from my palms and the rarest ability I had was being able to read the memories of the dead. Witches all have a specific area their good at; it was just my luck mine lay with the deceased. Ms. Ozland, a very talented spell caster from Flora, told me I was a spirit walker, but I had a hard time accepting that. Spirit walkers were witches or warlocks who could pass between our world and the ghostly realm\u2014and control ghosts. Almost every spirit walker I ever heard of had either gone insane or been killed. The bad guys didn\u2019t like when someone could speak to their victims. Lucky me!</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a spirit hovering just beneath the ground. You could have connected with it, or you could have pulled it from its grave,\u201d Kye explained.</p><p>My mouth hung open in disbelief. I\u2019d been able to read the memories of the dead since I received my magic at sixteen, but I still refused to believe I was a full-fledged spirit walker.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would I want to do that?\u201d I had a couple encounters with a girl who was murdered for her blood a few weeks ago, Bridget Downing, and it was scary and confusing. My plans did not include running amok in graveyards and pulling spirits from their graves, whether or not Kye wanted me to.</p><p>I stood up to leave, but a woman\u2019s voice stopped me. \u201cGwen, you are more powerful than you realize.\u201d</p><p>I turned around to find Holly, one of the council members, approaching. I dusted off my jeans and crossed my arms. I wasn\u2019t interested in finding out just how powerful I was. All I wanted to do was head back to Flora and snuggle up with Aiden.</p> <p>\u201cWhy is the council interested in my powers?\u201d</p><p>Holly smiled, \u201cYou are going to be our secret weapon.\u201d</p><p>When the meaning of what she said dawned on me, I was speechless. What did that even mean? I didn\u2019t know what Holly thought I could achieve against the vampires, but I didn\u2019t want any part of it.</p><p>\u201cI would like to decline the offer, thanks anyway,\u201d I said with a shaky voice.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware I gave you an option,\u201d Holly replied. \u201cYou will fight with us.\u201d</p><p>I stared wide-eyed. The coldness of her attitude was shocking. I had only met her one other time, when I was sixteen, and she had given me Aura, my cat and familiar. I always wondered if Holly knew what I could do even then. Aura was able to feed me energy so I could read the dead\u2014she made me comfortable with my rare talent. Without Aura my gift might not have developed.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be an outcast, stripped of our protection and knowledge,\u201d Holly paused as she crossed her arms and cocked a brow. \u201cYour own kind are being killed by demonic creatures, will you really stand against us because you\u2019re sleeping with one of them?\u201d</p><p>That was a low blow, but deep down I wondered what I would do if I wasn\u2019t dating Aiden. Would I be gung-ho to stomp into the middle of a war? The answer was simple\u2014no, I wouldn\u2019t. I understood the severity of our situation and wanted nothing more than to end the fast acting vampire addiction to brew. A war, though, unsettled me, as it would any other normal person. It wasn\u2019t like we were going to be fighting with puppies. Our enemies were hyped up vampires for goodness sakes.</p><p>It ticked me off that Holly referred to the vampires as demonic creatures. Vampires originated from the devil, true. When he was cast out of Heaven for not loving God\u2019s children, he made children of his own, vampires. They were created to feed off of the humans God loved so much, but with the free will God bestowed in humans and evolution, the vampires evolved into more timid monsters. The virus made them allergic to the sun and hungry for lifeblood, but that was the only thing demonic about them now. Just like every other species, there were good vampires and bad ones.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Holly asked.</p><p>I glared at her while I considered whether I wanted to go against my heritage. Without the NAWC backing me, I would be a pariah amongst my kind. I wanted to tell her that was fine with me, but I\u2019d be lying. When I received my powers, I hated them. I lost my family because magic had chosen me. My parents were religious and thought I was evil. They kicked me out and sent me to Moon. I met Fiona here, and it was with her friendship I learned to embrace my magic. Everything I was today came from my magical roots; it wouldn\u2019t be easy to give up, and Holly knew it. She presented the illusion of giving me the choice, but she knew I wouldn\u2019t choose to be ostracized.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d I asked dumbfounded. I didn\u2019t understand how my power for reading the dead mattered in a war against vampires. Sure there would be a lot of deaths, but did the NAWC expect me to read my fellow witches and warlocks who\u2019d fallen in the middle of battle? That didn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>\u201cYou can do more than you realize,\u201d Holly smiled victoriously. \u201cKye is the best teacher we have; he\u2019ll teach you how to harvest your potential. You two can pick up tomorrow, it is time for our meeting, and there is much planning to do.\u201d Holly walked back down the path while I glared after her. When I first met her, she was nice and friendly\u2014so much for first impressions.</p><p>Everyone filed into the ballroom of the castle taking a seat amongst the rows of chairs that sat in front of a stage. Holly had left a permanent scowl on my face. I was too distracted to appreciate the beauty or the rarity of the old world castle that sat in the middle of a forest in Washington. I leaned against the interior brick wall wondering what everyone\u2019s reaction would be to the coming news\u2014I couldn\u2019t be the only one against it.</p><p>Fiona\u2019s head popped up and swiveled as she searched the crowd for me. When her eyes found mine, she waved me forward, but I shook my head. I gave her a small smile, and she shrugged and turned back around. Fiona was my best friend and my roommate. Her parents were big timers in the magical community, and therefore, Fiona was raised as a witch. She loved everything about the craft and used magic all the time. I was still learning to accept what I was. I had my powers for ten years, which may seem like a long time, but in the terms of a witch, I was still a young grasshopper. Witches, like a lot of other supernaturals had a longer lifespan. I was still a child compared to the council members who were around one hundred to two hundred in age.</p><p>The seven council members walked onto the stage in a single file line and sat. All except for Holly, who walked up to the podium. Half of her long auburn hair was drawn up with a vintage barrette, giving a clear view of her high cheekbones and alabaster skin. Her deep green eyes roamed over the crowd and settled on mine. A lump formed in my throat. Holly would make my life a living hell if I didn\u2019t comply with her demands. She smirked at me and then looked away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWelcome, my fellow brethren,\u201d Holly\u2019s voice reverberated off the stone walls. The crowd silenced and gave their attention to the council member, while I made snide remarks about her in my head. Government, in any sense of the word, is a pain in the ass, but forcing me to do something against my will or be snubbed by my community\u2014that\u2019s ridiculous. I hoped the community would be in an uproar against starting a war, it was my only chance to escape Holly\u2019s plan for me.</p><p>\u201cDark times have fallen upon us, and it\u2019s in these times we must act as one. Many speculations have surfaced about our trouble with the vampires, but tonight you will learn the truth. Tonight, we will end the fear they have bestowed in us and take action against them. The vampires have learned a long lost secret, the secret of our blood.\u201d Holly\u2019s hands fisted as they rest on the podium and her brows knitted together in anger. Her voice was strong and confident like a true leader.</p><p>\u201cThe gift of our magic lay in our blood, a gift from our Goddess. The vampires have tasted this gift and grown to crave what is not theirs. Vampires have their own magic which allows them to hypnotize their prey and binds them from entering another\u2019s home. Because of this, they can relate to the magic in our blood and twist it into something perverse, using our gift for their own selfish deeds.\u201d</p> <p>Gasps and angry mumbling echoed through the crowd as they listened to Holly.</p><p>\u201cWe have lost many to their greed, and that all ends tonight. A war is upon us, my friends. We must take back what is rightfully ours, or our kind will grow extinct. We must act in the Goddess\u2019s name and protect the gift she has given. Tonight, the council asks you stand with us in our war.\u201d Holly finished with a prideful smile. Cheers and claps echoed in the cavernous space and beat against my head.</p><p>\u201cDo not agree so eagerly, my family,\u201d Holly warned, causing the celebration to settle. \u201cIf you agree to fight against the vampires, this is binding. Anyone who is caught consorting with the enemy will be treated as such,\u201d Holly\u2019s eyes found mine, emphasizing her thinly veiled threat. My heart beat like a sledgehammer against my ribs. She was making me give up Aiden, even after I already agreed, against my better judgment, to aid in the war. My chest heaved with panicked breathing, and the familiar twinge of magic danced along my skin. My whole world was crashing down upon me, suffocating me.</p><p>\u201cAre there any questions?\u201d Holly asked. The crowd was hesitant at first, but a couple hands drifted into the air.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter is a vampire; does that mean I can\u2019t have contact with her because of the war? She hasn\u2019t drunk witches blood\u2014she\u2019s an innocent in this,\u201d A middle-aged woman with curly red hair and a kind face asked. Witches were chosen by the goddess, not necessarily born, like Fiona was. This woman\u2019s daughter must not have been chosen and decided to turn into vampire instead.</p> <p>\u201cI understand your predicament, but no vampire is innocent in this war. Sooner or later, they will all crave our blood. This is a decision you must make, no matter how difficult it may be,\u201d Holly answered with a sad smile.</p><p>I cursed her heartless words. The woman wiped a tear away, stood up, and left. When she passed me, I gave her a genuine smile and nodded; I was impressed she had the proverbial balls to stand against the council and for her daughter\u2014if only I could find the same courage.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Holly said to a man who looked to be around thirty.</p><p>The man stood up and looked around the crowd, hesitant to say what was on his mind. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we only punish those who have partaken of our blood? I know the council is looking out for our best interest, but why should those who haven\u2019t had our blood be punished?\u201d The man sat down and wiped off the sweat collected along his brow with a trembling hand.</p><p>Holly was silent for a moment while she eyed the crowd. Although she stood and spoke with confidence, I could tell she was worried about the compassion the people were showing towards the innocent vampires.</p><p>\u201cIt is easy to look at those who have not drunk from us as innocents,\u201d Holly began. \u201cWord is already spreading of the miraculous things our blood enables the vampires to do, and more and more vampires are tempted to drink from us. Loved ones are no exception, as I told the woman before you. We have a member here tonight who was betrayed by a loved one because the pull of our blood was too strong.\u201d Holly held out her hand towards me. My stomach sunk and my breath caught in my lungs.</p> <p>\u201cGwen Sparks was romantically involved with a vampire, and he betrayed her by becoming addicted to the magic in our blood. She trusted an innocent, as you call them, and in the end he deceived her.\u201d</p><p>Everyone turned and looked at me, while I stared holes into Holly. I should have known the council would find out that Aiden was addicted to brew. While he tried to find answers about the case, his friend, Louis, urged him to try witches blood. The addiction was strong and fast. Aiden was on his way to becoming a full fledge brew junkie before I discovered what happened. Because I felt responsible due to the fact that he wouldn\u2019t have gotten the addiction had he not been trying to help me solve the case, I offered to feed him so he wouldn\u2019t kill a witch for his next fix. I was so upset about what happened that I took him to Ms. Ozland\u2019s house, and we were able to break his addiction. It was painful for me, but worth it. Ms. Ozland was the only person, besides Aiden and me, who knew about that night\u2014the only person who could have betrayed my trust.</p><p>\u201cSo, hopefully I\u2019ve made it clear how serious our situation is,\u201d Holly said, and the crowd turned their attention back to her. I couldn\u2019t stand to be in the same room with her anymore so I walked out.</p><p>2</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d find you here,\u201d Fiona said. I made my early exit from the meeting and hid in the castle\u2019s library. The room was hardly ever active and the large arched windows were fitted with comfy seats, a perfect place to think. I had curled up on one and stared out at the moonlit landscape.</p><p>I looked up at Fiona. Her blond hair was swept to the side in a ponytail and her blue eyes studied me with concern.</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s done? A war is definite?\u201d I asked solemnly. I hated everything about the turmoil our two species were facing. The distribution of witches blood, or brew as the vampires called it, needed to stop, but a war seemed extreme.</p><p>\u201cYeah, besides a few doubtful people, everyone agrees it needs to be done,\u201d Fiona answered.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about you? Do you think it needs to be done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re torn on the situation because of Aiden, but we can\u2019t let them continue to kill us, Gwen. Of course we\u2019d love to settle it another way, but since the vampire council hasn\u2019t taken action, we have to.\u201d Fiona watched me like she was afraid I\u2019d tear her a new one for agreeing with the council.</p><p>Instead, I gave her a small smile, then turned and rested my head against the stone wall to stare out the window again, \u201cI know,\u201d</p><p>Fiona sat down on the bench next to me. She watched me with cautious eyes but I could see a twinge of anger within them as well.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me Aiden was addicted to brew?\u201d Fiona\u2019s eyes pinned me in my place while her mouth grew into a tight line.</p><p>I frowned, hating that Holly shared my personal life with the entire witch community. I didn\u2019t want people to think Aiden was a monster, and right now, with all of this ugliness going on, that\u2019s exactly what they would think. They wouldn\u2019t care how sweet he was or that he\u2019d never hurt me. When governments fight, they demand their people to take sides, and as far as the witches were concerned, Aiden was the enemy.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d I told her. \u201cIt happened when he was helping me find out who was distributing brew. He hasn\u2019t had it since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you know of,\u201d Fiona mumbled under her breath.</p><p>I jolted forward and gawked at her. \u201cEveryone here already looks down on me for dating a vampire, the least you could do is not voice your doubts about my relationship with Aiden.\u201d I paused; I really needed Fiona to be my ally.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gwen. Emotions are really amped up around here, and it\u2019s hard not to jump on Holly\u2019s bandwagon, but I\u2019ll try,\u201d Fiona apologized. \u201cBut, aren\u2019t you worried that Aiden might want to drink from you again? I\u2019ve heard the addiction stays with them. I know you said you broke it, but how do you know? It\u2019s not like he tells you everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is you trying?\u201d I snorted. Fiona had been pushing me to date Aiden, and now she acted like he was the scum of the earth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my best friend. I just want to make sure you\u2019re safe. I know how people in love can be blind to the things that are bad for them. I mean...Aiden was a nice guy, but you can\u2019t assume he still is. He\u2019s had a taste of your blood, the craving can\u2019t just go away especially when he could just go out and buy brew from a dealer. You\u2019d never even know.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes for a moment, pinched the bridge of my nose and took a deep breath. It looked like I wasn\u2019t going to have Fiona\u2019s support no matter what. Somewhere in the back of her mind she would always think of Aiden as a junkie. Exactly the reason I hadn\u2019t told her in the first place.</p><p>\u201cLook, I can\u2019t tell you how to think of the vampires, but when you say shit like that then you\u2019re calling me na\u00efve and dumb.\u201d</p><p>Fiona began to say something but I held up my hand.</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly think I\u2019d be with a man who killed my kind just to get high? Am I that blind? Don\u2019t you think I\u2019d know, like maybe his electric blue eyes would give him away?\u201d I had raised my voice so loud that it echoed through the large stone room. For some reason the magic in our blood turned a vampire\u2019s eyes bright neon blue. That was a sign no one could miss, not even a lovesick fool like me.</p><p>Heavy footsteps warned us of someone\u2019s approach in enough time to look up as Kye rounded the corner. I disliked him, even more now that I knew why I was paired up with him. It wasn\u2019t his fault, but it didn\u2019t matter. I was mad at the entire council for forcing me into something I didn\u2019t want to do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHolly has requested you and Fiona stay in the castle for the remainder of your trip,\u201d Kye said. Fiona squealed with excitement, it wasn\u2019t every day we got offered a room in a beautiful castle\u2014let alone the NAWC\u2019s castle. In human terms, it was the equivalent of being asked to stay in the White House or Buckingham Castle. It was supposed to be a compliment, but I couldn\u2019t muster up any appreciation.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. I\u2019m perfectly happy sleeping at the Inn,\u201d I didn\u2019t want to be close to Holly if I didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>\u201cWhen Holly requests something, it\u2019s more of a nice way of giving orders,\u201d Kye smirked. \u201cYour bags are being brought over as we speak. You\u2019ll be on the second floor, room 75, Gwen, and Ms. Bennett, you\u2019ll be in 76.\u201d Kye turned and walked out of the library.</p> <p>Fiona gave me a sad smile. \u201cOh, come on, how bad could it be?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I arched an eyebrow and pursed my lips, sure that she had just jinxed us. Annoyance at the entire situation snaked its way through my body.</p><p>Fiona\u2019s cell phone echoed throughout the stone room. She answered it, her smile growing wider as she talked. When she flipped her phone shut, she tucked it into her pocket and bit her lip looking at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was Ethan. He wants me to meet him, is that okay? Or do you want to discuss Aiden more?\u201d She paused. \u201cBy the way, I know you\u2019re not stupid and I\u2019m sorry it sounded that way. I just want you to be careful, things have changed.\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head. \u201cNope, I\u2019m done. You said what you needed to say and so did I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later, I promise,\u201d she called over her shoulder as she rushed out of the library. I laughed and shook my head. I was in a crappy mood and our fight hadn\u2019t helped but I could still be happy for my best friend. She met Ethan the first day we arrived in Moon. He had reduced her to a drooling fool with just a wink of his sparkling green eye.</p><p>Deciding not to drown in my self-pity, I went to the room Kye said was mine. At least it wasn\u2019t on the sixth floor where the council member\u2019s rooms were. The castle was big enough I could easily avoid Holly\u2014 at least I hoped I could.</p><p>I pushed the door to my room open. The bedroom was bigger than my apartment. A four poster bed sat on an upraised platform in the center of the room. Four large, arched windows dressed with red velvet drapes lined the back wall and looked over the hedge maze. My bags were sitting next to my bed, and Aura was peacefully sleeping on a chaise lounge. \u201cTraitor,\u201d I said to my black cat. She flicked her tail but didn\u2019t waste the energy of opening an eye.</p><p>My cell phone buzzed. I flipped my phone open and saw that I had a text from Aiden.</p><p>Busy? The message said.</p> <p>Nope, I texted back. Four days without Aiden had affected me more than I expected. We\u2019d known each other two years but dated for a few weeks. However, in that short time, I grew used to having him around. We spent every night together, and now it was hard to go through the night without seeing him.</p><p>Meet me in the maze, he texted back.</p><p>I rushed to the window and tried to spot Aiden but the lighting wasn\u2019t bright enough to make out anything. Be right there, I typed as fast as my thumbs would allow and ran out of my room. I was even more anxious for Aiden\u2019s safety than seeing him, which said a lot. If the council found out he was here, he\u2019d be a pile of ash before he knew what happened.</p><p>I hurried around the back of the castle and sprinted towards the maze. Tall lampposts lined the entrance, but once inside the maze it was completely dark. I ran my fingers along the leafy walls as I navigated my way into the labyrinth.</p><p>\u201cAiden?\u201d I called out in a whisper. He\u2019d be able to hear me, but I worried someone else might hear me too. I took a right turn then a left, which led me to a dead end. A soft chuckle danced on the wind and teased my ears. I whipped around and strained my eyes to find where Aiden was hiding.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny,\u201d I hissed. Aiden was always up for games when the situation called for him to be serious.</p><p>I walked down the next row of shrubbery and turned left. Arms wrapped around my waist and pulled me against the hardness of a chest. Aiden leaned down brushing his lips against my ear, \u201cHow lovely to see you, my Gwen.\u201d</p><p>I leaned into his chest and absorbed his energy that swirled around me like a playful tornado. He turned me to face him and leaned in pressing his lips to mine. My entire body relaxed as I enjoyed the sensual dance of our tongues. When the kiss ended, I rested my forehead against his chest and breathed in the scent of him.</p> <p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d he asked. Looking up at him, I admired how the moon highlighted his features. Dark black locks framed his handsome face, and his blue eyes broke through the darkness and met mine lovingly.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Reaching a hand up, I ran my fingers through his hair. \u201cWhat were you thinking coming here? Do you know the council just announced we\u2019re going to war with the vampires? They\u2019ll kill you if they find you here,\u201d my voice was thick with panic. Aiden brushed a stray strand of hair out of my eyes and placed both of his palms on either side of my face.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d have to catch me first,\u201d he grinned, and I rolled my eyes. He feathered a kiss against my forehead, \u201cI\u2019m very fast.\u201d Not even a price on his head would cause him to be serious.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say about us going to war?\u201d I spoke louder than I intended. I bit my lip and tilted my head to make sure no one heard us\u2014the last thing we needed was a mob of angry witches with torches and pitchforks. I wished I could have been as calm as Aiden appeared, but no matter how hard I tried, fear consumed me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all for the vampires responsible for killing witches being brought to justice. I thought you would be too?\u201d Aiden cocked his head.</p><p>I closed my eyes and shook my head, realizing why he seemed so calm. \u201cWhen I said the council wants to go to war with the vampires, I meant all vampires, Aiden. They don\u2019t care whether they\u2019ve drank our blood or not, and Holly is using me in her fight against them.\u201d</p><p>The realization set Aiden\u2019s blue eyes on fire. His hands gripped me tighter and his pupils dilated so hardly any of the whites in his eyes showed. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a bloodbath,\u201d Aiden mumbled, lost in thought.</p><p>\u201cThe vampire council hasn\u2019t reacted to any of the NAWC\u2019s warnings and more and more witches are being murdered. I understand why they want retribution, but I think Holly is taking it too far,\u201d I hated that this whole thing escalated to a war. The wind played with Aiden\u2019s dark hair and an intense emotion overcame me. My stomach knotted and churned with nauseous waves. Heat rushed to my face as a cold sweat broke along my brow. I didn\u2019t understand what it meant, but it wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>\u201cLeave with me tonight,\u201d Aiden\u2019s eyes burned into mine.</p><p>I shook my head, words failing to form.</p><p>\u201cGwen, if what you say is true and the council is using you as a frontrunner in their war, you need to leave with me, tonight. I won\u2019t let you become collateral damage while they start an endless war,\u201d Aiden paused and squeezed me tighter into his chest. He rested his head atop mine, \u201cI won\u2019t lose you.\u201d His voice was a mere whisper, but the intensity he coated those soft words with sent chills along my spine.</p><p>His offer was tempting. I didn\u2019t want anything to do with the fight, but the council already involved me. Running wouldn\u2019t change the fact that they planned to kill innocent vampires and start something far bigger than they probably realized. Once news got around that vampires were being murdered, all Hell would break loose. Witches were powerful and not to be trifled with, but vampires were killing machines\u2014especially those hopped up on brew. The playing field wasn\u2019t exactly even. We would be fighting against creatures that could move faster than the wind and heal whatever wounds we inflicted, not to mention they\u2019d have our magic on their side as well.</p><p>I ran all of the excuses, as to why I couldn\u2019t go, through my head and was almost to the point of believing them. The real reason why I couldn\u2019t run away with Aiden, as much as I\u2019d like to, was the threat of being shunned from the magical community. I had already been kicked out of my home when I was sixteen for becoming a witch\u2014something I had no control over. If I chose to run away with Aiden, I\u2019d be rejected by the NAWC for something else I had no control over\u2014love.</p><p>Maybe I can save him. Maybe I can convince him to return to Italy and wait out the war. He\u2019d be safe. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Aiden, I can\u2019t,\u201d I said with false confidence.</p><p>Aiden was from Italy and still owned a home there. My fate was sealed; I\u2019d fight in the war, but Aiden didn\u2019t have to. A tiny amount of weight lifted from my shoulders with the hope that my plan could work. The nausea in my stomach eased and I began to feel better the longer I thought about him leaving.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you can\u2019t?\u201d Aiden asked accusingly, like I was supporting what the council was doing.</p><p>\u201cI want you to go to Italy,\u201d I told him, ignoring his question. He walked a few paces away before turning around and staring at me. Worry and anger were evident on his beautiful face, and it pained me that I was the cause of it. I walked towards him and put my hands on his chest. Looking up I said, \u201cPlease, go.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, a slow and measured movement. His hand cupped my face and glided down to settle on my shoulder. His body was unyielding beneath my hands. \u201cI cannot and will not leave you, my Gwen. If danger is ahead of us, I\u2019ll be beside you until the end.\u201d</p><p>My breath caught, and I tried to swallow around the lump in my throat. The hope was squashed and replaced with fear. I could handle putting myself in danger, but I couldn\u2019t accept Aiden\u2019s life being threatened. He lived over six hundred years, and it could all end because of me.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I begged. \u201cThey know you drank witches blood, you\u2019re a target.\u201d I was hoping this news would send a jolt of awareness into him, but his only reaction was a slight twitch to his lips. My eyes blurred with tears as I realized he was steadfast with his decision to stay. He folded me into his arms while I held back the tears that threatened to fall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t the reunion I planned,\u201d he said with a shallow laugh. Somewhere deep inside I knew he was worried as much as I was, but he hid it with humor.</p><p>\u201cI saw her run out here,\u201d Kye\u2019s voice carried through the air. I raised my head from Aiden\u2019s chest and listened as footsteps approached the hedge maze.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d Holly called. My heart rate sped up while my hands pushed Aiden. \u201cYou have to leave,\u201d I whispered. He listened for a few moments then leaned down and kissed me. I forgot myself as our tongues swirled together, and Aiden pulled me into the hard plains of his body.</p> <p>\u201cWhat would she be doing out here?\u201d Holly questioned.</p><p>\u201cThe maze is quite lovely, perhaps she\u2019s meditating,\u201d Kye answered.</p><p>I broke our kiss and shoved Aiden again. If Holly found out he was here, she\u2019d kill him. \u201cI\u2019m staying in Seattle at the Hilton, meet me tomorrow night,\u201d Aiden whispered and vanished in a blur.</p><p>My hands were shaking and my breathing was labored like a kid who\u2019d been caught with her hand in the cookie jar. I closed my eyes and sucked in a deep gulp of air, releasing it through my nose. By the time I repeated the breathing exercise a few times my hands stopped quivering and my heart was back to a normal rhythm.</p><p>Holly and Kye rounded the corner, and I turned to face them. Kye grinned like he was onto me, while Holly inspected me with curiosity. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear us calling you?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>I shook my head and shrugged to feign innocence. \u201cI was trying to relax. I must have slipped into a daze. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t hear you, what did you need?\u201d I hoped my voice didn\u2019t betray my lie.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to make sure you were ready for training tomorrow,\u201d Holly said. Her eye twitched like she was daring me to refuse. My heartbeat started to pick up speed again. I had to follow her orders, so I nodded my head, afraid my voice would be too harsh if I spoke.</p><p>\u201cVery good. Itineraries have been delivered to every room. We must be organized if we hope to win the fight,\u201d she said.</p><p>I glanced at Kye to keep from rolling my eyes and saw his jaw tighten and his body stiffen. There was something going on with him, something I planned to find out.</p><p>3</p><p>I was scared awake bright and early the next morning by a loud banging coming from my door. I hopped out of bed and rushed to the door, expecting someone to tell me the sky was falling. Instead, Kye stood on the other side, his arms crossed and a scowl on his face as he observed I was still in my pajamas.</p> <p>\u201cYou have ten minutes to meet me out front,\u201d he turned and headed down the stairs.</p><p>I rolled my eyes but hurried to dress for the day. Deciding I needed to be comfortable, I slipped on a pair of black yoga pants, a black tank top and topped it off with a black and pink jacket. I tied my Adidas shoes and pulled my hair up into a messy ponytail. I wasn\u2019t much to look at, but then again, I wasn\u2019t trying to impress anyone.</p><p>I hurried down the stone staircase and made a detour to the kitchen, a girl had to eat. I scoured the expansive kitchen for something quick and easy, finally settling on a banana and a bottle of water.</p><p>When I walked outside, Kye\u2019s disapproval was obvious. I rolled my eyes and finished the last bite of my banana. \u201cSomeone must have woken up on the wrong side of the bed,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>\u201cAnyone who has to train you would be in a foul mood,\u201d Kye snapped back.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m all for not training. Tell Holly to pick someone else for her evil plan.\u201d I headed down the stone steps and waited for Kye to follow me. There was no way he would suggest Holly find someone else, she had her mind made up\u2014I was her sole focus.</p><p>Kye padded down the stairs and headed to the right. \u201cWell, come on then,\u201d he called over his shoulder. I snorted and followed him back to the graveyard. I was coming to accept I may be a spirit walker, but I didn\u2019t have to like it or graveyards. I didn\u2019t want to befriend the things that go bump in the night, well except for a certain sexy vampire. I followed Kye through the leaf-littered grounds. He stopped in front of a large tombstone which looked newer than the ones I\u2019d seen last night. The only words inscribed on the stone was a name\u2014Irene Bartlett. I found it odd that no dates or personal inscription was added.</p><p>\u201cI was told you interacted with a spirit a few weeks ago. What was it like?\u201d Kye asked.</p> <p>I stared at the ground and bit my lip while I thought of words to describe my time with Bridget Downing. She was the second victim found, only she had stuck around. She visited me through dreams, but Ms. Ozland assured me my time with her was in the ghostly realm. She knew this because I have gray swirling within my aura, something only spirit walkers have I guess.</p><p>I looked up at Kye, \u201cScary and confusing.\u201d Those were the best words to describe my experience, but they didn\u2019t do my encounter justice.</p><p>\u201cThat was the first time you interacted with the dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn a personal level, yes. I first read a dead person here when I was sixteen. Holly had just given me Aura, my cat and familiar, and then a warlock was murdered. Holly told me to check him and when my fingers made contact, I saw his memories.\u201d</p><p>She had to have known what would happen once I touched the dead warlock, or why would she have asked me to do it? How did she know what I could do?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t actually need your cat. Holly gave her to you so you would feel comfortable with your gift. Spirit walkers have their own connection with death, they don\u2019t need a conduit such as Aura,\u201d Kye explained.</p><p>I scrunched up my face. \u201cOf course I need Aura; she\u2019s my link to the spirit world.\u201d Every time I read the memories of the dead, Aura was there. She\u2019s a spirit who assumed the body of a cat. She fed me energy so I could delve into the ghostly atmosphere. Of course I never tried doing it without her. I assumed I needed her and even though she was just an animal, I felt safe having her with me while I read the dead.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever tried without her?\u201d</p><p>I began to speak but shut my mouth when I couldn\u2019t refute his observation.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so. So how do you know you can\u2019t interact with the dead without her?\u201d Kye tilted his head to the side.</p><p>\u201cHolly told me with her I would accomplish great things,\u201d I said. I was beginning to think I couldn\u2019t trust anything Holly told me.</p><p>\u201cAnd so you will, but with your own magic. I want you to place your palms on this tombstone and tell me what you feel,\u201d Kye instructed.</p><p>\u201cThe last time I did what you told me, my hands fell through the ground,\u201d I accused with an arched eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWhich proves your power, now, put your hands on the tombstone.\u201d</p><p>I did as he instructed. The marble was cold beneath my palms, but I felt nothing else.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d Kye ordered.</p><p>With an annoyed huff, I closed my eyes. I didn\u2019t know how running around the cemetery was going to help the NAWC win their war, but if all I had to do was touch gravestones, I wouldn\u2019t complain, much.</p><p>\u201cConnect with your magic and wield it towards the stone.\u201d</p><p>I concentrated on my magic\u2019s steady hum of energy. It was a constant purr under my skin, but when I focused on it, commanded it to come to the forefront, the steady hum became a prickling tickle which danced throughout my body.</p><p>I exerted the tickling energy out of my palms and into Irene Bartlett\u2019s tombstone. I could hear my magic sizzling and popping as it made contact but nothing substantial was happening.</p><p>Kye dusted something over my hands, and when I cracked an eye open to inspect, my hands were covered in dirt.</p><p>\u201cKeep concentrating, connect with the tombstone,\u201d Kye said as he continued to sprinkle dirt over my hands. Soon a steady stream of energy ran from me to the stone. I opened my eyes, and Kye was gone. The sky had turned gray along with the rest of the town. All of the buildings, the trees, and plants were in different shades of gray. The ground had a thin layer of fog rolling across, lending an eerie feeling to the already creepy graveyard.</p><p>\u201cKye?\u201d I called, my eyes roaming over the bleak landscape, but he was nowhere to be found. I turned around and gasped.</p><p>A woman in her late thirties, or early forties, was sitting on top of a tombstone. Her hair, although the color was muted, was red and cascaded over her shoulder. The woman\u2019s skin was ashen and contrasted against the black dress she wore. A smile played at her lips and mischief danced in her dark eyes.</p><p>She floated, literally floated, down from the tombstone and over to me. My feet were frozen in place while my heart pounded against my chest. I could see the similarities between her and Bridget, but unlike Bridget, this ghost seemed threatening. She threw her head back and laughed like the wicked witch of the west. Goosebumps danced along my skin, and my once frozen feet stumbled backwards. Her wide black eyes darted back and forth as her lip curled up over crooked teeth. She took a jerky, unnatural step towards me. My entire body trembled at the sight of her.</p><p>I tripped trying to get away and landed onto my back. Before I could scurry out of her reach, she was on me. She hovered horizontally just inches above me, her hair dangling in my face. She trailed a dirty nail down the side of my face, and I whimpered in pain as she scratched me. A cackle of joy filled the cemetery while she observed my blood on her pointer finger with wild eyes. The ghost smeared my blood across my forehead and swiped at my scratch again.</p><p>My magic revved up with my fear. I shoved both of my hands at her and sent a powerful jolt towards her chest, but my hands went right through her, an icy coldness caressing my skin. However, she floated up and off of me. I scrambled to my feet. She was sitting on the ground and rocking back and forth as she stared at her bloodstained hand.</p><p>My head felt heavy, and my vision blurred. Dizziness washed over me, and I fell onto the ground again. My vision darkened into nothingness.</p><p>When the world stopped spinning, I opened my eyes sluggishly\u2014afraid I\u2019d see the insane ghost again. The first thing I noticed was the grayness was gone. I could see the green of the grass and the blue sky.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d Kye said.</p><p>I blinked a couple of times before my eyes would focus on his face. He knelt over me with concern. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKye? What happened? Where is she?\u201d I sat up and looked around. It was the same graveyard, but it wasn\u2019t as dark, gray, and gloomy. I must have been in the ghostly realm. A shudder ran through me at the memory of what I\u2019d encountered.</p><p>\u201cHere, let me help you up,\u201d Kye offered an outstretched hand. I batted it away and stood on my own. \u201cWho the hell was that, and why did you bring me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only following orders, and you needed to see that,\u201d Kye hissed.</p> <p>\u201cI needed to be attacked by an insane ghost?\u201d my voice raised an octave with annoyance, so I took a deep breath. If the NAWC was trying to make me comfortable with spirits, they were failing.</p><p>\u201cYou needed to see what happens to a spirit walker who doesn\u2019t embrace her magic. Insanity is a high possibility for you, understand? As much as you dislike the NAWC right now, they\u2019re trying to help.\u201d</p><p>I cringed at the thought of turning into something like that. \u201cSo, how do I not turn into an insane ghost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s not a ghost. She\u2019s just trapped in the realm.\u201d Kye shrugged his shoulders and began to walk.</p><p>\u201cBut she floated and just appeared in front of me. Why is she trapped?\u201d I stumbled over the lumpy ground trying keep up with Kye.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s still a witch, Gwen. Seasoned witches can do all sorts of things with magic and she appeared because she can transport to different areas within the ghostly realm. You\u2019ll be able to do it too.\u201d Kye\u2019s lack of patience really annoyed me. How was I supposed to learn from someone who thought I should already know everything?</p><p>Kye stopped outside of a large mausoleum, pulled a ring of keys out, and unlocked the large iron door. \u201cAfter you,\u201d he held out an arm. I eyed the inside of the dark tomb. After what I just experienced, I was on high alert when it came to Kye\u2019s training methods.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What are we doing in there?\u201d I was unwilling to step inside the dusty darkness.</p><p>\u201cMore training,\u201d Kye said with a huff.</p><p>\u201cAm I going to be attacked or hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>I glared at him then stepped into the crypt. A large concrete tomb sat in the middle of the stone room. I batted at cobwebs as I inched my way inside, as far away from the tomb as possible. The clanging of the door being shut made my stomach drop.</p><p>\u201cKye!\u201d I beat against the door and tried the handle, but it was locked. \u201cKye!\u201d I screamed. The room didn\u2019t have any windows, so I was in complete darkness. My eyes strained, in vain, to capture even the tiniest bit of light.</p><p>Little witch, what have you gotten yourself into? Ian\u2019s voice said.</p><p>I jumped, expecting him to be behind me. The telepathic bond was hard to get used to. Shoo fly, don\u2019t bother me.</p><p>I can feel your panic. It woke me from a dead sleep, it did. Ian\u2019s English accent was thicker than it was before. I pressed against the door again, and when it wouldn\u2019t budge, I slammed my palm against it. \u201cKye!\u201d I screamed again.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Gwen,\u201d Kye finally answered from the other side of the door. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to concentrate if you\u2019re panicking.\u201d</p><p>I laughed bitterly, \u201cMaybe you should try explaining things first instead of ambushing me.\u201d</p><p>I look forward to seeing you very soon, little witch, Ian said, making me cringe.</p> <p>Ian Despereaux was the last person I wanted to see. Micah and Aiden both promised they\u2019d kill him and sever our bond, but three weeks later, Ian was nowhere to be found, and we were still connected.</p><p>\u201cShut up and leave me alone,\u201d I snarled out loud.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kye asked.</p><p>\u201cNot you,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one, just get me out of here!\u201d</p><p>Kye was silent for a few moments\u2014probably wondering if the insanity was already starting. If I kept hearing Ian\u2019s voice in my head, I didn\u2019t doubt I would go insane.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Gwen, I want you to close your eyes and erase all of the tension in your body. Meditate,\u201d Kye advised.</p><p>\u201cEasier said than done,\u201d I mumbled. Kye didn\u2019t know Ian was in my head, and there was no amount of meditation that could get rid of him. The council hadn\u2019t found out I was bonded to a vampire yet. Ian Despereaux wasn\u2019t just any vampire either. He was the man behind the brew outbreak, the reason our two species were going to war. I chewed on my lip as I considered whether I should tell Holly about the bond.</p><p>\u201cAre you concentrating?\u201d Kye asked. I sighed and tucked my thoughts away for another time. Obviously, if I wanted to get out of the dusty dark crypt, I had to focus.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I closed my eyes and imagined nothing. I breathed in through my mouth and exhaled through my nose.</p><p>\u201cGood. When you feel completely relaxed, imagine yourself outside of the tomb, and open your eyes,\u201d Kye said.</p><p>I mentally laughed, then cursed because I lost some of the emptiness I was trying to create. I focused harder and continued my breathing exercises.</p><p>My shoulders drooped and arms dangled as if weights were attached to my fingers. Soon my mind was a peaceful lake without so much as a ripple. And my body tranquil after another twenty minutes of breathing and focusing. I did what Kye instructed and imagined myself outside of the tomb. When I opened my eyes, Kye was leaning his back against the crypt with his arms crossed and eyes closed. He didn\u2019t seem to notice I was standing next to him.</p><p>\u201cKye?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He lifted an eyelid open then closed it again. I pursed my lips and waited for a few moments before I walked up to the door and slid the lock. I struggled to open the heavy iron door and gasped. My body was still inside the crypt. I stood with my eyes closed and my chest slowly rising and falling with each breath. A chill danced along my skin, and I shuddered. I walked up to my still body, my fingers reaching out to touch my peaceful face. It was bizarre to see myself like this.</p><p>\u201cConnect, Gwen,\u201d Kye said from the doorway. I turned around to look at him, but he was staring at my still body. I looked back at myself and walked behind my body. I took a deep breath and walked forward into myself. I awoke from my meditation. My eyes blinked a few moments before they settled on Kye.</p><p>\u201cI opened the door,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was in here, and I was able to be out there and open the door,\u201d I rambled from my astonishment, and Kye chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYes, you did very well, Gwen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...how? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard of astral projection?\u201d Kye asked, and I nodded my head.</p><p>\u201cWell spirit walkers can astral project; it\u2019s one of the ways they can travel to the realm of the dead. Right now you can\u2019t do much when you\u2019re in your astral projection body, but after I train you, you\u2019ll be able to do everything you can now and more.\u201d</p><p>It was creepy Kye knew more about me than I did. \u201cHow do you know all this stuff? Are you a spirit walker too?\u201d I leaned against the stone wall; it felt like I just had an intense workout. My muscles ached and my energy was drained to that of a sloth.</p><p>\u201cI am not, but my sister is. I learned a lot from her. I was fascinated with her powers, so I paid close attention,\u201d Kye answered.</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t she teaching me? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m learning a lot from you, but...well...your methods aren\u2019t the best.\u201d I yawned and fought to keep my eyes open, I did not want to fall asleep in the graveyard.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d want her to teach you, you seemed pretty frightened of her,\u201d Kye smiled.</p><p>My tired eyes popped open in surprise. \u201cThat insane woman was your sister?\u201d I said a little more rudely than I planned, but Kye took it in stride. It couldn\u2019t be easy having a sister who was crazy.</p><p>\u201cShe is. So see, I do know a little something about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you do,\u201d I yawned and fought to hold my body in a vertical position. \u201cWhy am I so tired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraveling to the ghostly realm and astral projecting will wear you out until you build up your tolerance. We\u2019re done for now, but we\u2019ll meet tomorrow night.\u201d Kye turned and walked away. He wasn\u2019t much for personality, or words, but I was happy to be learning what my capabilities were. I trudged back to the castle\u2014I needed a nap.</p><p>\u201cLittle witch, it\u2019s so lovely to see you again,\u201d Ian said.</p><p>My head swiveled as I searched the English garden. Rows and rows of colorful flowers weaved an intricate pattern all around me. The sun was high in the sky which led me to believe I was dreaming.</p><p>\u201cStay away from me,\u201d I warned and was answered with soft chuckles that filled the empty space around me. I walked down the stone path, searching for Ian. It was a weird feeling to know I was dreaming.</p><p>I turned a corner, and a large peony was held out in front of me. I looked around the cluster of pink petals and saw Ian Despereaux. His short blonde hair was cut closely to his head, and his blue eyes sparkled when the sun caught them. A grin tugged at his lips while I sneered. I took steps backwards, but with each movement, he stepped forward. I didn\u2019t know if he could actually hurt me in the dream, but I didn\u2019t want to find out.</p><p>\u201cYou act like you\u2019re not happy to see me,\u201d Ian said playfully.</p><p>\u201cYou hit the nail on the head. I don\u2019t want anything to do with you,\u201d I told him and then tried to pinch my arm</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to wake myself up!\u201d I continued to pinch my arm, but it wasn\u2019t working. Ian laughed at my attempt of escaping him.</p><p>\u201cLittle witch, we are bonded by blood, no amount of pinching will allow you to escape me.\u201d He took a moment to watch me, \u201cJoin me; we have much to talk about.\u201d Ian grabbed my hand and dragged me towards the edge of a pond. Magnolia trees with dark pink and white flowers bloomed all around and decorated the water with their blossoms.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d Ian ordered.</p><p>I scowled but decided to sit. It looked like I wasn\u2019t going anywhere until he said what he had to say. \u201cYou know Aiden is going to break our bond,\u201d I told him with a proud smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ian laughed. \u201cAiden could have broken our bond the moment it happened, but he hasn\u2019t because it\u2019s against the vampire law to do so.\u201d</p><p>I considered whether he was lying or not. There was no way it was true. Aiden would break the bond if he knew how. I wouldn\u2019t let Ian get to me by badmouthing Aiden.</p><p>\u201cAsk him,\u201d Ian said with a shrug of his shoulders. He sat on the park bench and rested his arm along the back, his fingertips caressing my shoulder. I leaned up and out of his grasp.</p> <p>\u201cAiden wouldn\u2019t do that. He wants to help me,\u201d I argued.</p><p>\u201cI did not conjure this dream to talk about Aiden. You will see I am right when you talk to him tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know...\u201d I let the sentence trail off. I didn\u2019t like that Ian knew my plans.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much you can hide from me, little witch. I also know the witches want to go to war with the vampires, and Holly is using you as her personal weapon. This aggravates me, since you\u2019re mine.\u201d Ian looked off into the distance, his jaw tightening with his anger. I didn\u2019t like the way he thought of me as his or that he cared enough to get angry about my problems.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not yours! You\u2019re a monster. You kill my kind, a parasite, nothing more,\u201d I told him.</p> <p>His eye twitched and the hand that rested on his lap balled into a fist. I began to speak again, but Ian held up his hand to stop me. \u201cBe very careful about what you say next, little witch,\u201d Ian warned.</p><p>I remained silent. I wasn\u2019t in a position to taunt a sadistic vampire who could wield magic. Until Kye taught me how to use my magic in different forms of reality, I couldn\u2019t hurt Ian.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d Ian smiled. \u201cNow, I can\u2019t repudiate the horrible things I\u2019ve done, but like everything else in the world, there are two sides to every story. I have reasons for what I did, and soon you\u2019ll find out what those reasons were.\u201d He moved closer to me on the bench. His arm wrapped around my waist and pulled me closer to his side. His other hand grabbed mine, and he brought his lips to my neck, his breath warm against my skin. A shudder ran through my body.</p><p>\u201cI could have killed you; it would have been so easy. Your blood is one of the strongest I\u2019ve tasted, little witch. If I am a monster as you say, why haven\u2019t I killed you? Why do I worry when you\u2019re anxious or upset? Would a monster be so interested in its prey?\u201d Ian pressed a kiss to my neck, and against my better judgment, I closed my eyes from the feel of it.</p><p>His mouth moved up my throat and around my chin, finally settling on my lips. A whirlwind of panicked butterflies erupted in my stomach as I tried to turn my face from his. But he didn\u2019t let me go; his tongue slipped inside of my mouth and swirled with mine.</p><p>I sat up in my bed panting like I\u2019d just run a marathon. My fingertips went to my mouth, my lips still wet from our kiss. Either I had been licking my own lips in my sleep, or Ian or I actually kissed.</p> <p>Jumping out of bed, I headed to the bathroom\u2014I needed water. I turned the faucet on and cupped my hands to bring the cold liquid to my mouth. I splashed some on my face as well and hoped it would snuff the panicked heat whirling in my body.</p><p>I stared at my reflection in the large mirror over the sink. I looked pale, and my dark brown hair was a tangled mess. My blue eyes were wide with worry. I inhaled a deep breath and released it slowly. Running my fingers through my hair, I noticed something had fallen out. There on the stone floor were two pink petals. Bending down, I picked them up and rubbed them through my fingers. Magnolia petals, the same petals floating on the pond. It was a dream, but I was able to bring things back with me. Not only did I have to worry about Ian trespassing in my mind, but now he could show up in my dreams.</p><p>I had two hours before the sun set, and I could see Aiden. I didn\u2019t believe what Ian said, but a small part of me wondered. I needed see him. I brushed through my hair and ran downstairs and to the kitchen. My stomach was in knots, too nervous to eat. I grabbed a cup of coffee and absorbed the heat.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s training going?\u201d Fiona asked.</p><p>I jumped not seeing her sitting at a corner table with Ethan. My mind was too occupied with Ian and Aiden to notice her. Ethan half turned and looked at me. He was good looking, but a little too preppy for my taste. He wore dark khaki\u2019s with a blue dress shirt tucked in. His light brown hair was cut stylishly, and he was currently glaring at me. He looked like he could model for J. Crew or attended an Ivy League college.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I answered Fiona and walked over to where they sat. It had been awhile since Fiona dated anyone, except for when she dated Ian a few weeks ago, but that was more of a spell than love at first site. I didn\u2019t like the way Ethan looked at me, like I was a bug to be squished. I\u2019d probably be getting a lot of those types of looks from my kind. I was the witch who was dating a vampire after all.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two up to?\u201d I asked to break the uncomfortable silence. I hadn\u2019t seen much of Fiona since she met Ethan, or at least that\u2019s what I told myself. I had the strange suspicion she was avoiding me like I was last year\u2019s fashion. I didn\u2019t have proof of it, just the underlying feeling of doubt.</p><p>\u201cEthan and I are attending the Midnight Magical. Are you going?\u201d Ethan grabbed Fiona\u2019s hand from across the table, and Fiona smiled wide. They were the perfect couple, at least in the looks department. They were the type of couple who would live happily ever after behind a white picket fence with two kids and matching BMWs. A small part of me was jealous of them, of how easy they could be together.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m heading to Seattle for some shopping, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be back in time,\u201d I told them. The Midnight Magical was thrown every Friday night. It was a convention of sorts where we could learn about magic, spells, and even get our fortunes told by the seers. A dance took place in the castle\u2019s large ball room with an assortment of all kinds of foods. I attended one when I was sixteen, but I wasn\u2019t in the mood to party and rejoice with the other witches and warlocks about killing vampires.</p><p>\u201cOh, by yourself?\u201d Fiona asked, her tone saying she knew I was up to something.</p><p>\u201cYes. I just need some time away from Moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell enjoy tonight because training for the war starts tomorrow,\u201d Ethan said. I turned to leave and Fiona and Ethan began whispering back in forth like junior high kids.</p><p>4</p><p>I called my shop, Broomsticks, to speak with Penny on the cab ride to Seattle. Until recently Penny was my only employee. She was nineteen but already more responsible than even me sometimes. Before I left for Moon, I promoted her to manager and hired one other girl, so she\u2019d have help. Sales had dropped enough to put a dent in my bank account, but Penny assured me she was working on something huge for the store.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Jillian doing?\u201d I asked as I watched the scenery out of the rain splattered window pass by. Jillian was two years older than Penny and had seemed hesitant to take orders from someone younger than her.</p><p>\u201cShe showed up ten minutes late today, but I didn\u2019t say anything. I kind of wanted to see if it was on accident or if she\u2019ll make a habit out of it,\u201d Penny said.</p><p>I rolled my eyes, there wasn\u2019t a lot of time to interview potential sales clerks before I left, but I hoped Jillian would do until I got back\u2014if I got back.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Penny. Keep notes on anything you think deserves my attention, and if it\u2019s not working out, I\u2019ll find someone else,\u201d I told her.</p><p>The cab driver slammed on the breaks, and I hit my head against the window. I let out a silent curse and peeked between the seats to see why he nearly gave me a concussion.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Penny asked with concern.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute.\u201d</p><p>I scooted to the edge of the seat and stared out of the windshield. Two cars had collided and caused a small traffic jam. A pale thin arm hung out of one of the broken windows and blood seeped down the side of the silver car. The other vehicle had slammed into the passenger\u2019s side of the silver car. Its driver stumbled out holding his head and crunching broken glass under his sluggish footsteps.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we call the police?\u201d I asked the middle aged cab driver. His eyes found mine in the rearview mirror and he scoffed. \u201cLady, I have other people to pick up tonight. I call the police we\u2019ll be answering questions all night.\u201d He looked at the horrific scene before us and then back at me. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m sure someone else called the police already.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head at him and told Penny I\u2019d have to call her back. Supernaturals always got pinned for being monsters, but the cab driver was very much human and just as much of a monster as the bad supernaturals.</p><p>I really needed to see Aiden, like right now, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the two injured patrons. I threw a twenty in the front seat. \u201cI\u2019m calling the police. Maybe you should take a trip to Oz and ask the wizard for a heart, jackass.\u201d I got out of the car and soon the traffic moved enough that the cabbie left my insult in his rain soaked dust.</p><p>I flipped the hood on my jacket over my head, but its defenses against the rain were pathetic. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d I yelled to the man. He was staring at the ground, teetering back and forth. I walked over and could instantly smell the alcohol like he\u2019d bathed in it. \u201cYou should sit down,\u201d I told him, afraid he\u2019d pass out and hit his head on the asphalt. I dialed nine-one-one, though I wasn\u2019t sure of our exact location, Moon sat about fifteen minutes outside of Seattle, but I wasn\u2019t paying attention before the crash.</p><p>I gave the dispatcher all of the information and hoped they\u2019d get here soon. I wasn\u2019t sure how bad the people were and it was raining buckets. The man was soaked and with the temperature being only in the forties, hypothermia was a possibility. It might not have been the smartest idea to jump out of the cab in the middle of the night during a thunderstorm. Maybe I should take my own advice and ask the wizard for a brain.</p><p>I walked over to the silver car and looked inside. A young girl, probably no older than eighteen, sat bloody and unconscious in the driver\u2019s seat. A large cut on her forehead trickled blood down her face and matted with her brown hair. Broken glass lay in her lap and the arm that hung out of the window had a large gash. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello?\u201d I said to the girl, hoping my voice would wake her up. I knew not to touch her because she could have internal injuries, but I wanted to be sure she was okay. The girl didn\u2019t answer, so I checked under the car to make sure no gasoline was leaking. It was a pointless action though, with the amount of rain we were getting, a fire was unlikely.</p><p>I walked over to the drunken man again and told him to sit. He looked down like he\u2019d just noticed I was there. He stumbled, and I caught his arm and helped him sit on the pavement.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cDan Collins.\u201d He spoke his name slowly as if speaking was a chore. I scanned the surrounding area and made sure no one was focusing on me. I turned my back towards Dan and conjured two umbrellas. My clothes were thoroughly soaked, and I was beginning to shiver.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I handed the man an umbrella and then opened mine. \u201cThe police are on their way,\u201d I told him. Although drunk as a skunk, worried awareness shone in his glazed eyes. He\u2019d be charged with a DUI at the very least and vehicular manslaughter if the young girl died.</p><p>Footsteps approached behind us. I turned and saw a tall man with long black hair that hit just above his shoulders and was as dry as the desert. I blinked a few times to make sure my eyes weren\u2019t playing tricks on me. None of the abusive rain beating against me touched him. He wore black dress pants that fit snuggly against his legs and a black V-neck sweater that hugged his broad chest.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t touch her!\u201d I yelled as the man reached his hand out to the young girl. He turned his head towards me, and I froze in my place. His eyes swirled with different shades of gray like an angry thunderstorm brewed deep within him. He had to be a supernatural, but I\u2019d never seen anything like him before.</p><p>The man smiled and gripped the young girl\u2019s shoulder. A rush of cold air whipped all around the car and penetrated me to the bone. I shook violently against the icy coldness. \u201cWhat\u2014who\u2014are you?\u201d I stuttered through my rattling teeth. The man didn\u2019t answer and as soon as I saw the ghostly figure of the young girl float out of the car, I knew what the answer was. My mouth hung open, and I stared wide eyed at the spirit who was staring down at her dead body.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a reaper, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I managed to choke out. The man smiled, and then the wailing of sirens made me turn my head. When I looked back, the man and the ghost were gone. The drunken man didn\u2019t seem to notice what had just happened.</p><p>Paramedics rushed to the girl and the drunken man, but there wasn\u2019t anything they could do for her. I gave them all the information I had, which wasn\u2019t much, and then called Aiden for a ride. Within ten minutes, he pulled alongside the road in a black escalade.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Are you hurt?\u201d He threw the questions at me in a hurried rush while his arms wrapped around my soaking wet frame. I absorbed what little heat he provided.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I was in a cab when the accident happened,\u201d I said against his chest. Aiden guided me to the SUV, and I happily climbed out of the rain. The ambulances took off with the man while the other medics were working on lifting the girl out of the car and onto a stretcher with a black body bag. My heart sank when they laid her atop the bag and began shuffling her arms and legs into it. I hated death, no matter the cause, but especially when the victims were young.</p><p>\u201cHow did you end up standing on the side of the road?\u201d Aiden asked as he cranked the heat to full blast. The contrast of the warm air hitting my frozen body made me shiver.</p><p>\u201cThe cab driver wasn\u2019t going to call the police, so I jumped out and called them. I wanted to make sure they were all right,\u201d I told Aiden. Out of my peripheral I could tell he was staring, but I ignored him. Aiden was really protective of me, sometimes to the point of being annoying.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m fine. I did the right thing, who knows how long it would\u2019ve taken the police to get here if I hadn\u2019t called them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call them from the cab? Why did you have to stay, in the middle of a thunderstorm no less?\u201d Aiden\u2019s voice was calm, but a twinge of anxiousness colored his tone.</p><p>I let out a heavy breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d It was the truth. It had been stupid to jump out of my cab in the middle of nowhere. I wasn\u2019t helpless though, I had magic on my side. \u201cCan we just go back to your hotel, please?\u201d</p><p>Aiden pulled back onto the road and within ten minutes we were in his hotel\u2019s parking deck. We walked to the elevator and rode up to the sixth floor in silence. When the elevator doors opened, I followed Aiden down the long skinny hallway and to room 614. Once the door was shut, Aiden\u2019s arms wrapped around me and our mouths met, eager to make up for lost time. It didn\u2019t matter that he was annoyed with my stupidity or that I was ticked he thought I was as fragile as an eggshell. In the end, we loved each other and were hungry for one another.</p><p>Aiden\u2019s deft fingers unzipped my wet jacket and let it fall off my shoulders where it plopped to the floor. He bent before me and untied my sneakers. When both shoes were off he moved upward where he skillfully tugged my tank top off and threw it across the room. Lowering his head to my cleavage, he bit through the front clasp of my bra, freeing my breasts. Aiden\u2019s tongue darted out and swirled around my excited nipples sending a flood of heat through my body that erased any chill I had previously felt. He nipped at one and sent a jolt of desire ricocheting through me. I moaned with delight as he led me towards the bed. Sex with Aiden was exactly the stress reliever I needed.</p><p>Aiden pushed me onto the bed, and I stretched out so he had a clear view of what was waiting for him. He stripped off my yoga pants and white lace panties, then stepped back to admire the view. Sitting up on my elbows, I gave him my best \u201ccome and get it\u201d look. A grin lifted one side of his mouth up and mischief played within his blue eyes.</p><p>Oh he wanted to play, did he?</p><p>I bent my left leg up and languidly raised my right crossing it over my knee, giving Aiden a slight peepshow. He unbuttoned his shirt while watching me. I smiled, my body excited and happy that this gorgeous vampire was mine.</p> <p>He walked over to the desk in the corner of the room and pressed a button on the CD player. Bad Company\u2019s I\u2019m Ready for Love rang out of the speakers, and I laughed hysterically. Bit by bit he pulled his shirt off while his hips rocked with the music. My laugh died down to mere giggles as I watched his abs and hips move.</p><p>He made his way to the bed with a satisfied smile and I grinned. The art of seduction wasn\u2019t over yet. I hopped off the bed and said, \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>Aiden laughed but complied by sitting on the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d I ordered, and he squeezed them tightly closed. I conjured a stripper pole and a black and hot pink lace corset and matching panties. I was determined my strip tease would bring him to his knees, and I\u2019d be declared the winner of our playful foreplay.</p><p>I magically produced my favorite Paula Cole CD and placed it in the radio. \u2018Feelin\u2019 Love began to play, and I gripped the pole with one hand and rested the other hand on my cocked hip. \u201cOpen your eyes,\u201d I told Aiden. The surprise on his face was priceless, but when I started to walk around the silver pole, his mouth hung open, making me laugh.</p><p>Fiona had dragged me to a pole dancing class at her gym a couple years ago, it was a great work out, but I didn\u2019t have much use for the moves, until now. Gripping the pole with both hands, I swung my body around and slid down the length. I whipped my hair around and did a bend and snap that would make Elle Woods proud. Aiden rested his arms behind him while his eyes devoured every inch of me.</p><p>I flipped up and gripped the pole with my legs so I was looking at Aiden upside down, and when I got to the floor, I bent so that my ass was front and center. Looking at him over my shoulder, I smiled and winked. I\u2019d definitely won.</p><p>An hour or so later Aiden and I lay naked in each other\u2019s arms, our desires sated. I was at peace beside him like all of my worries just fell away. I propped myself up on my arm and looked over at him. A stray piece of dark hair hung carelessly over his blue eye, a five o\u2019clock shadow lined his normally clean shaven jaw, and his chest rose and fell as he tried to slow his panting. The muscles in his arms bulged while they were tucked behind his head. My eyes ran the length of his body, settling on his fabulously chiseled stomach and the dark trail of hair that led beneath the sheets. He was beautiful, and he was mine.</p><p>\u201cGive me ten minutes and I\u2019ll be good to go,\u201d Aiden said with a smirk.</p><p>I laughed and lay back on the bed. Even if he was ready in ten minutes, I needed a day to recoup. Aiden had been rougher than normal and lost in my own desires I hadn\u2019t minded. Our separation had driven us nearly mad, but the sex was fantastic.</p><p>Thoughts of the man I\u2019d seen at the wreck occupied my mind as I stared up at the ceiling. He looked very normal, well maybe not normal, but human. He was gorgeous. The only clue that he was something otherworldly was his cloudy eyes. I was intrigued by him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>I looked over at him quizzically.</p><p>\u201cI can still feel you, Gwen. Your blood is still inside of me.\u201d I had fed Aiden when I found out he was addicted to brew so he wouldn\u2019t kill a witch to get his next fix. Since then he had been able to feel my emotions, though we weren\u2019t bonded like Ian and I were because we hadn\u2019t exchanged blood.</p><p>\u201cHow long will that last?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>Aiden shrugged his shoulders. \u201cNot long, a month at most. I\u2019ll be sad when it fades, I like knowing how you feel, especially when we\u2019re fucking. It\u2019s so intense to feel the want you have for me, drives me insane.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and imagined what it would be like to feel someone else\u2019s emotions. I was bonded to Ian, but he had nearly perfect control over his emotions so they didn\u2019t seep into me. I was happy he did, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d like to feel emotions that weren\u2019t mine. All of the talk about blood and connections directed my mind to what Ian told me, that Aiden could break the bond if he wanted to. I looked over at Aiden and wondered if I should bring it up or not. He wouldn\u2019t be happy that I had shared a dream with Ian, but the more I thought about it, the more I needed to know the answer\u2014or the reason why if he could break the bond, he hadn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave you found a way to break my bond with Ian?\u201d I asked nonchalantly. It was pointless though, Aiden could probably feel my anxiety.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close. I\u2019m going to meet with an old friend in two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t break it yourself?\u201d</p> <p>Aiden was quiet for a few moments before he sat up and looked over at me. I sat up too, pulling the sheet around my body. I could see guilt in his eyes and that worried me. I didn\u2019t want Ian to be right.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan told me you could break it if you wanted to,\u201d I reluctantly told him.</p><p>His guilt was quickly replaced with anger. He hopped out of bed and stalked across the room to where his clothes sat in a messy pile.</p><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeems like your mind is already made up that it is,\u201d Aiden said heatedly.</p><p>I got out of bed and wrapped the white sheet around my body. I placed my hands around his waist and met his eyes. \u201cI just want to know, if you could break it, then why haven\u2019t you?\u201d A small part of me worried that in order to break the bond with Ian; I\u2019d have to bond with Aiden. The scenario didn\u2019t sound bad, but I was concerned that Aiden was bothered by the idea. Perhaps he didn\u2019t want to be bonded to me. I couldn\u2019t begrudge his feelings if that was the case, even if it hurt my heart the tiniest bit.</p><p>\u201cYes, I could break the bond right now, but there would be repercussions and Ian knows that.\u201d Aiden\u2019s arms went around my waist and his body relaxed slightly.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of repercussions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce a vampire bonds with someone, they\u2019re considered their property. If I were to replace Ian\u2019s bond with my own, then it would be like me stealing one of his possessions and the vampire council would order a warrant for my death. I\u2019m sure when Ian told you he hoped you would guilt me into fixing the bond so the council would kill me. Vampires are very territorial, as you know, and for all intents and purposes, Ian owns you.\u201d</p><p>My heart pounded in my chest like a tribal drum while anger snaked its way through my veins. I hated vampire politics. I hated that they could claim an unwilling person as their own, and most of all, I hated that my supposed owner was Ian Despereaux.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I appeal to the vampire council? Tell them he tricked me into the bond?\u201d I asked hopeful.</p><p>\u201cVampires think of themselves as the superior race, they\u2019re not going to care that Ian claimed you without your consent. I\u2019ll find a way around this, Gwen. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I knew I should believe Aiden\u2019s promise, but my pessimism refused to let me be hopeful.</p><p>5</p><p>I walked up the stone steps in a daze of confusion and anger. My life had twisted so far from the norm that I didn\u2019t know what to think of it anymore. The celebration from the Midnight Magical rang throughout the castle and mocked my bad mood. I didn\u2019t want to hear laughter and happiness when my own existence was doomed to be miserable. My fellow witches and warlocks didn\u2019t have to deal with an ounce of the grief I was dealing with, and it only made my mood that much worse.</p><p>The thought of running away with Aiden popped into my mind, but even that was squashed by the fact that no matter how far I ran, Ian could always find me. I didn\u2019t understand his fascination with me\u2014other than my blood being a high potency because of my spirit walker status. Did he want to own me for the endless supply of powerful blood? Was being bonded to me some sort of game for him? Or did he have another trick up his sleeve? I didn\u2019t know any of the answers and I was getting tired of being in the dark about my own problems.</p><p>I trudged into my bedroom and flopped onto my bed. Aura meowed so I ran my fingers through her long black fur, and she quickly went back to sleep. I envied her, to be able to sleep all day and not have a care in the world. \u201cYou\u2019re one lucky girl, you know?\u201d I said to my lazy Persian. I wondered if she thought like a human or if she was as happy being a cat as I would be.</p><p>Two soft knocks brought my attention away from my cat. \u201cCome in,\u201d I called. My door opened, and I sat up when Kye entered my room. His eyes roamed my bedroom as if he were searching for something, or someone.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you need, Kye?\u201d I didn\u2019t bother to mask my annoyance. He crossed his arms over his chest and said, \u201cHolly has someone she would like you to meet.\u201d</p><p>I laughed bitterly. \u201cDon\u2019t you get tired of being her lapdog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said simply. I shook my head at his lack of backbone and hopped off my bed. I wished I would\u2019ve showered and changed my clothes after being with Aiden but that would have to wait. I grabbed a rubber band off of my dresser and put my hair into a ponytail.</p><p>\u201cLead the way,\u201d I told Kye.</p><p>We climbed four flights of stairs before we stopped and walked down an expansive hallway. The sixth floor looked exactly like my floor: stone walls and floors, arched beveled windows, and antique benches and rugs placed sparingly.</p><p>Kye knocked on a thick wooden door, and when Holly\u2019s voice ordered for us to enter, Kye opened the door. Holly was sitting behind a large desk, and a roaring fire danced within a large fireplace off to the side. An antique chandelier hung from the center of the room, the lights meant to look like candles, emanated a soft glow.</p><p>Two leather wingback chairs sat in front of Holly\u2019s desk. I caught a glimpse of a man\u2019s hand resting on the arm of the chair, but its tall back obscured his identity. The office door closed behind me, and I turned to see that Kye had left.</p><p>\u201cGwen, there\u2019s someone I\u2019d like you to meet,\u201d Holly announced. I looked back at her, and she motioned for me to sit in the unoccupied chair. With an annoyed grumble, I walked the short distance and sat in the offered seat. It was one in the morning, and I didn\u2019t have the energy to deal with Holly\u2019s antics or meet another anti-vampire patron. I crossed my legs and leaned back in the chair, but my curiosity got the better of me and I looked to my left. A man with short blonde hair and sunglasses watched me with interest and a smirk on his lips. He seemed familiar, yet I had never met him.</p><p>\u201cTraining starts tomorrow, as you may know,\u201d Holly began. Her voice seemed distant as I was locked in the mystery man\u2019s gaze. I didn\u2019t read auras, but I felt a coldness emanating from him, like his whole being was lonely and full of death. \u201cMr. Hade has offered his services in training you. Kye has been most helpful, but I\u2019m afraid you need training on a more personal level. Mr. Hade can offer spectacular guidance as you come to terms with what you are. I need you in tip-top shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHade?\u201d I hadn\u2019t meant to say it aloud.</p><p>\u201cDorian Hade,\u201d the blonde man said and held out his hand. I eyed him cautiously, my inner voice telling me that something wasn\u2019t right with him.</p><p>\u201cI believe we met earlier,\u201d Dorian said.</p><p>I gasped as I watched his appearance change to the man at the wreck. His short blonde hair darkened and lengthened. His face reshaped so his jaw line was squarer, and his eyes swirled with different shades of gray as he took off his sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d I rudely blurted out.</p><p>\u201cI apologize, Mr. Hade, Gwen\u2019s knowledge of her own kind is limited,\u201d Holly said on my behalf. I eyed her and then brought my attention back to Dorian. \u201cYou\u2019re a spirit walker?\u201d A smile crept onto his lips. He lifted one of his legs so it rested on his knee. He was dressed in jeans, a white t-shirt, a black leather jacket, and black boots.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m the Angel of Death. Spirit walkers descend from my kind.\u201d His gray eyes watched me with humor as my mouth twisted in confusion. I looked between Holly and Dorian as if they were joking. But that wouldn\u2019t happen; Holly didn\u2019t have a sense of humor that I was aware of.</p><p>\u201cSo, does that mean I\u2019m...part angel?\u201d my voice came out in a shriek, so I cleared my throat.</p><p>\u201cNo, but your darker gifts are given by us, not your goddess.\u201d Dorian said.</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d It was better if I kept my speaking to the minimal. I was too shocked to form complete sentences.</p><p>\u201cWe need soldiers just like everyone else,\u201d Dorian said simply with a shrug of his broad shoulders. My eyebrows scrunched up, and I frowned at his explanation. I could barely walk without tripping over something, definitely not a soldier.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe collect spirits and guide them to the hereafter. Spirits have a choice if they want to go or not, but if they stay, boredom is bound to drive them insane. If this happens, we usually call a spirit walker to track them down and take care of the problem. We can\u2019t do everything.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back in the leather chair and absorbed the new information. \u201cSo, I\u2019m like Death\u2019s bounty hunter?\u201d I laughed sarcastically.</p><p>Like I need another problem.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you could say that,\u201d Dorian agreed with a nod of his head. I glanced over at him and quickly away, his eyes frightened me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the changing appearance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy normal form is not accepted as well as a human one. I can make myself look like anything or anyone, but then so can you, Ms. Sparks.\u201d</p><p>My hands shook as I wondered what his normal form looked like. The only reapers I\u2019d ever seen had been in books or on Halloween decorations. Maybe Dorian Hade strolled around in a black cape and carried a scythe. I appreciated his current look much more than what I assumed an Angel of Death might look like.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re anti-vampire?\u201d I asked. I caught Holly shaking her head out of the corner of my eye, but I ignored her.</p><p>\u201cI am neutral. I do not pick sides in frivolous matters. I am only here as a favor to your High Priestess,\u201d Dorian said, his tone sounding almost bored. I was curious as to why the Angel of Death would owe Holly a favor, but I decided not to ask.</p><p>\u201cGwen was dating a vampire, one that I\u2019m sure she still has urges to meet with. I do not want you encouraging her. Our war may be frivolous to you, Mr. Hades, but it\u2019s very serious to us,\u201d Holly hissed and looked at me. \u201cI assume you are done with that parasite?\u201d Like every other question Holly asked, it was more of an order than a request for my opinions or thoughts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nodded my head, afraid she might have laced her question with a truth spell. The spell bewitched a person so they could only speak the truth, but it would not influence body movements, so the nodding of my head was the only confirmation she would get from me.</p><p>Dorian smirked and slid me a knowing look. I focused all of my attention on chipping the nail polish from my nails. I had complained about training with Kye, but now he looked like a saint compared to my new teacher. I didn\u2019t want anything to do with the dark angel.</p><p>\u201cYou will train with Dorian every other day. On days you are not with him, you will be training with us.\u201d Holly walked over to the fireplace. She reached her hands towards the dying flames. They reared up and licked the sides of the hearth.</p> <p>\u201cWhen do you plan to strike?\u201d I fisted my hands and tucked them under each armpit. My nails dug into my palms, but it helped channel my attention away from my rising anger.</p><p>\u201cWe strike in five days\u2019 time when the sun is high, and the vampires are at their weakest. You, however, will strike once Mr. Hade teaches you what to do.\u201d She walked back to her desk and sat in the large leather chair. Holly gave Dorian a threatening look that I didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly am I supposed to be doing?\u201d I knew it wasn\u2019t smart to question a council member, but I couldn\u2019t help it, I had to know what would happen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll raise the dead.\u201d Two pairs of eyes watched me with uncertainty while my stomach dropped and a lump formed in my throat.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014what\u2014how does that help?\u201d I stumbled over the words as a flood of questions bombarded my mind. \u201cLike zombies?\u201d My eyes volleyed between Dorian and Holly.</p> <p>Holly laughed. \u201cNo, not zombies. I should rephrase. You\u2019ll raise spirits. I have soldiers out collecting the blood of our targets and your job is to raise all of the people they\u2019ve killed and direct them to attack their killers.\u201d An evil smile spread across Holly\u2019s lips.</p><p>My face scrunched up as I thought about what she had said. \u201cYou want me to send the ghost of people they\u2019ve killed to haunt them?\u201d That didn\u2019t sound so bad. Ghosts were creepy sure, but they wouldn\u2019t be able to cause too much damage.</p><p>\u201cYes. Dorian will teach you what to do. It\u2019s late and training starts early tomorrow, you are dismissed, Gwen,\u201d Holly said. I gave Holly and Dorian one last look and then stood and left the office.</p><p>When I came around the corner, soft purple light glowed from the ball room. Couples slow danced to a peaceful symphony. It had to be close to two in the morning, but the Midnight Magical was still in full swing. My feet hesitated on the steps as I watched my fellow witches and warlocks enjoying themselves. None of them seemed too upset about Holly\u2019s plans and had gone about their business as if they wouldn\u2019t be going to battle in a week.</p><p>\u201cYou should not envy them.\u201d A male voice spoke behind me. I peeked over my shoulder to see Dorian Hade standing close to me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I protested. It was a lie of course, I envied how easy their lives were and how they could express their love without repercussions.</p> <p>\u201cThey are simple witches, Gwen. You hold a power they could never possess, and when I\u2019m done teaching you, you\u2019ll be the one who\u2019s envied.\u201d Dorian walked so that he was facing me. I studied his eyes. Dark cloud-like grayness rolled within them and reminded me of a coming storm. There was only gray, no pupil to break up the churning gloominess. Long chocolate locks brushed his shoulders. His t-shirt clung tautly to his body and the black leather coat fit like a glove. There was something very bad boyish about him.</p><p>I realized I was staring entirely too long when my eyes fell to his lips and saw the smirk on them. Blood rushed to my cheeks and warmed my face. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be envied. All I want is to be left alone.\u201d I said with frustration and then headed up to my bedroom.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d Dorian called from the bottom of the steps. I turned around and stared at his mischievous smirk with annoyance, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet Dreams.\u201d He winked and then walked away.</p><p>6</p><p>The next morning a small cardboard box sat on my dresser. I hadn\u2019t noticed it before I showered and dressed. Walking over to inspect it further, I saw a letter next to it. Gwen, do not open until your meeting with Dorian tonight\u2014Holly.</p><p>I crumpled the letter and threw it away, not interested in whatever was in the box. My day was wide open; I wasn\u2019t practicing with Kye anymore and the whole of Moon was training for battle so nothing was open except for a few restaurants.</p><p>I knocked on Fiona\u2019s door and waited. When she didn\u2019t answer, I headed downstairs and towards the kitchen. Yells and banging brought my attention away from my destination and towards the lower level of the castle. The further I walked down the winding stairway, the louder the sounds echoed.</p> <p>When I rounded the corner, groups of witches and warlocks stood in pairs fighting. Blasts of colorful magic shot and bursts of bright light flew around the cavernous room. One witch constructed an invisible shield all around her and when the warlock attacked he was bounced back five feet. Another warlock was in the process of conjuring stakes in rapid succession and flinging them at a padded wall.</p><p>\u201cGwen!\u201d</p><p>I dragged my eyes away from the fighting to see Fiona running towards me with Ethan in tow. I pasted a fake smile on my face instead of scowling like I wanted to. I didn\u2019t understand how I was the only one who had problems with going to war with the vampires.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to train with us? Ethan needs a partner,\u201d Fiona exclaimed with wide eyes and an even wider smile.</p><p>I eyed Ethan and then Fiona. He didn\u2019t look too thrilled to have me as a sparring partner which made me more interested in doing it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going to be on the front lines, Fiona. There\u2019s no point in her sparring.\u201d Ethan gave me a dirty look that vanished as soon as Fiona turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter you can still practice with her.\u201d Fiona turned back to me and asked, \u201cWill you help out?\u201d I smiled. Ethan didn\u2019t want to fight me, so I couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Fiona clapped her hands while Ethan and I walked onto the practice mats. I rolled up my sleeves and kicked off my high heeled boots. I hadn\u2019t had a lot of practice in fighting with magic, but I had taken a couple classes at the dojo in Flora\u2014 mainly to stay in shape.</p><p>\u201cMake your move, Ethan.\u201d I taunted with a sly smile. His eyes squinted with anger, and he conjured a plastic stake with a flat bottom, so that it wouldn\u2019t hurt if he got close enough to use it. Ethan stepped forward faster than I anticipated and knocked me backwards. I landed on my back hard and groaned when the air was jarred from my lungs. He didn\u2019t waste any time and tried to get into a position on top of me, but before he could, I rolled backwards and regained my footing. A smile crept onto his lips as we watched each other. My feet moved in sync with his as we circled each other.</p><p>I conjured a large net that hovered just above him, and when he took a step forward, I let it drop. His hands got tangled in the holes. I took the opportunity to swipe his feet out from underneath him. Ethan fell back with a thud and worked feverishly to untangle himself. Clapping brought my attention away from Ethan. Standing beside Fiona was Dorian Hade. He leaned against the wall and was dressed in jeans, a tight fitting t-shirt, and black boots. Sunglasses hid his eyes from everyone and a smiled crept onto his lips when I scowled at him. It was only ten in the morning and my training with him wasn\u2019t supposed to start until nightfall.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d My voice sounded harsh, even to me. Before Dorian could answer, Ethan attacked. His arms went around my body and held me so tight breathing became difficult. Bending backwards, I flung him over the top of me and to the mat. He growled with frustration, but before he could scramble to his feet, I conjured my own prop stake and flung it towards his chest. It hovered over his heart which would be a kill shot to a vampire.</p><p>\u201cI win,\u201d I announced happily. Ethan sneered, but I ignored his attitude and walked over to Fiona and Dorian. \u201cI don\u2019t think your boyfriend likes being beat by a girl,\u201d I told Fiona with a smile. She bit her bottom lip as her eyes shot between Ethan and me. She laughed nervously and rushed to aid Ethan. I disregarded the annoyance of her worry over the sore loser and turned my attention towards the Angel of Death.</p><p>A wicked smile bent his mouth upwards. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty good.\u201d Dorian smiled in Ethan\u2019s direction, and I heard the warlock scoff and walk away. Fighting had revved up my energy, I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected. \u201cThanks.\u201d I smiled. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Dorian crooked his index finger and motioned for me to follow him out of the gym. When we reached the top of the staircase, I leaned against the wall and waited for his explanation.</p><p>\u201cDid you get the package Holly left for you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head. \u201cWhat floor is your room on?\u201d Dorian watched the people coming and going and then looked at me.</p><p>Why did he want to know where my room was? The Angel of Death put me on edge, but I wasn\u2019t sure if it was fear or attraction that raised my awareness.</p><p>\u201cSecond floor, why?\u201d My eyes watched him with confusion.</p><p>\u201cBecause we have work to do,\u201d he answered and headed for the stone steps. It took me a moment to move from the space I was occupying. I didn\u2019t want Dorian in my bedroom. By the time I found my footing, he was waiting outside my door. My hand clasped the knob, and I pushed the door open. I grabbed the box, fully intending on leaving my room, yet he strolled into the space and lifted his sunglasses to the top of his head as he observed everything.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d My eyes watched him with unease as he walked over to my bed and sat on the edge.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be much quieter up here. Why\u2014are you afraid of me, Gwen?\u201d Dimples formed in his sculpted cheeks as his mouth lifted into a devilish grin. The grayness of his eyes seemed to darken as he stared at me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answered too quickly and my voice rose in pitch. I was definitely afraid of him and he knew it. Dorian laughed and patted my mattress. My heart thumped heavily with each step towards him. Instead of sitting on the bed, I stood next to it. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the box?\u201d My eyes focused on the cardboard square in my hands. I couldn\u2019t stand to be close to him and look into those gloomy eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSit down and we\u2019ll open it up.\u201d Dorian scooted his way onto my bed. I climbed onto the bed and sat Indian style as far away as I could. My eyes nervously flicked to my door, afraid I\u2019d be caught with a reaper in my bedroom. Guilt tugged at my conscience as I thought about what Aiden would think if he walked in on us. We weren\u2019t doing anything wrong, but sitting on my bed with another man just didn\u2019t seem right. The glint in Dorian\u2019s eyes told me he wouldn\u2019t object to something happening between us. Ignoring his lingering gaze, I pointed to the box. \u201cWell, open it up already.\u201d</p><p>His fingers slid under the tape and tore it away. My curiosity made me edge forward to peer into the container. When Dorian flipped the flaps back a tray of vials sat inside. Discarding the cardboard, he removed the tray and sat it on the bed. My stomach coiled when I realized the vials held blood. Holly mentioned last night that she had soldiers out collecting blood for me. I didn\u2019t want to know how they got close enough to the vampires to draw the blood. White labels wound around the tiny glass tubes with a sequence of numbers wrote on the side. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do with it?\u201d A shiver danced through my body at the thought of having to taste the blood.</p><p>Dorian uncapped a vial and sniffed it. My lips curled in disgust. \u201cThe darkness is strong in this one.\u201d He put the cap back in place and set it back into the tray.</p> <p>I watched him dumbfounded. \u201cAm I supposed to know what that means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to please, Holly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t everyone?\u201d I snorted. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like the type of person who would care about pleasing a council member.\u201d I still hadn\u2019t figured out why the Angel of Death would help Holy.</p><p>\u201cI have my reasons.\u201d Dorian\u2019s vague response wasn\u2019t what I had hoped for. His tone said he didn\u2019t want to elaborate, so I ignored the many questions still lingering on my lips. \u201cYou said that vial was filled with darkness, what does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s killed a lot of people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can tell just by sniffing it?\u201d I asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Dorian held out his hands palm side up in front of him. \u201cHold my hands.\u201d</p><p>My lips pursed as I looked at him. Reaching my hands out, I placed my palms into his. His skin felt cool and waxy against my own. Where our flesh met tingles erupted. Dorian\u2019s eyes closed and his head tipped back. I watched as his Adam\u2019s apple bobbed up and down with each swallow.</p><p>When his head fell forward, his eyes opened. The cloudy abyss raced within the sockets and icy tendrils wrapped around my wrist and traveled up the length of my arms. My body shook against the coldness, sending the hair to stand on end.</p><p>Soft echoes of moans and screams penetrated my bedroom. My eyes searched nervously for the owners of the sad cries. \u201cYou hear them,\u201d Dorian said.</p> <p>My head nodded. \u201cWho are they?\u201d The moans grew deeper and louder the longer I held onto Dorian\u2019s hands. A soft breeze grazed my face causing me to shrink back.</p><p>\u201cThe spirits of the deathly realm.\u201d His hands grasped mine tighter, numbness tingled throughout my hands. Dorian\u2019s eyes bore into mine. I was frozen in his dark gaze unable to look away. Our connected arms formed a circle and an opaque shadow grew within it. The shadow rose up through the bed, its form taking a human shape.</p><p>Dorian looked up at the spirit and unlocked from his gaze, I did the same. A young woman, probably no older than seventeen, wept in front of us. Her color was washed out in grayness, but I could tell her hair was black. The spirit\u2019s hands covered her face as she sobbed softly, her shoulders rising and falling from her sadness.</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d My eyes widened as I took in the unhappy girl.</p><p>\u201cA victim of the vampire. Killed before her time and left in an eternal world of depression.\u201d Dorian looked up at the girl and said, \u201cYou will have your revenge young one.\u201d</p><p>The spirit removed her hands from her face and stared at Dorian, an angriness overcoming her sadness. \u201cRevenge.\u201d Her voice was eerie like a haunting breeze that chilled to the bone. Dorian nodded his head and a sinister smile crept onto the girls lips. He reached a hand up to the girl, and she touched it with her own. Light swooshed through her body then faded as quickly as it had come. The spirit\u2019s body leaned over and when she stood straight again, all of the shadows had disappeared. She looked as solid as a living person.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d My voice was unsteady as I looked at the girl. Dorian ignored me and instead motioned for the girl to come closer. He spoke into her ear, and when he was done speaking, the girl floated off the bed and vanished through a wall. I choked on my words, unable vocalize my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been directed to torment her murderer just like Holly wanted. It\u2019s your turn now.\u201d Dorian lifted another vial of blood out of the tray and held it out to me.</p> <p>I bit my lip and eyed the blood with disdain. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d The truth was, I didn\u2019t want to raise an angry spirit. I knew my orders and knew what would happen if I disobeyed them, but I couldn\u2019t find my comfort zone when dealing with ghosts. Part of me was meant to do this. Still, the other part of me, the witch, was at war with the spirit walker. I wondered if I could ever find a balance between the two. To me it seemed I could be one or the other. I would either choose to be a spirit walker and embrace the darkness, or abandon the unique gift and live my life as a normal witch and store owner.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you have me to teach you.\u201d Dorian placed the blood into my palm and curled my fingers around the cylinder. I opened my fingers and stared at the red liquid, wondering who it belonged to. It didn\u2019t matter, they had all killed innocents and it was my job to raise their victims for vengeance and torment.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncap it and smell the blood,\u201d Dorian instructed. I frowned but did what he said. Pulling the stopper out of the vial, I held it to my nose. I wasn\u2019t sure what I was supposed to detect, it smelt like normal blood to me. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you smell the death within it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it smells like ordinary blood to me.\u201d</p><p>Dorian grinned. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been taught anything about who you are, have you?\u201d His words embarrassed me. His statement had made me feel like a juvenile amateur.</p><p>\u201cWho was supposed to teach me? It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a helpline for this sort of thing.\u201d I always knew it wasn\u2019t normal that I could read the memories of the dead, but denial was an easier road to take rather than dealing with my rarity.</p><p>\u201cActually, there is. If you would have acknowledged your gift and sought out the right people to teach you about it, you\u2019d know that.\u201d Dorian sounded aggravated which only caused my humiliation to grow. I didn\u2019t like being scolded like a child.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t want to. Maybe, just maybe, I don\u2019t want to be a spirit walker. Is that so hard of a concept for people to understand?\u201d I snapped back. I had no problem helping solve cases for the FPD (Flora Police Department.), but did I want to make it my whole life?</p><p>\u201cGwen, it\u2019s who you are. Whether you want to be a spirit walker or not doesn\u2019t matter, you are one. It\u2019s not something you can change. If you trust me, I can teach you it\u2019s not something to fear.\u201d Dorian\u2019s voice had lost its edge.</p><p>I looked at him through my lashes and felt connected with him in that moment. He was the only person I\u2019d ever met who could understand what I was. While Kye had tried to teach me the lessons he\u2019d learned from studying his sister, Dorian knew firsthand. He was the Angel of Death, his lessons came straight from the horse\u2019s mouth, so-to-speak.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Dorian was right, I couldn\u2019t change who I was. There was no point in complaining about it when I could just grit my teeth and learn to use the power.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he breathed. \u201cI think we should take a break and then return to sending ghost to haunt the vampires later. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>It sounded so ridiculous all I could do was laugh. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I climbed off of Dorian\u2019s motorcycle with shaky limbs. He drove so fast that my hands hurt from gripping him. \u201cYou do realize it\u2019s November right? It\u2019s too cold to be riding a motorcycle.\u201d I rubbed my hands together, hoping the friction would cause warmth to return to my numb fingers. Everyone we\u2019d passed had given us strange looks, but Dorian had been adamant about taking his bike.</p><p>\u201cI apologize. I don\u2019t feel the elements like you do.\u201d He pulled the bike helmet off his head and hung it on the handlebars. I pursed my lips in thought. Although Dorian was the only person who could relate to me, he was the furthest from being human. He could change his appearance and the weather didn\u2019t affect him. It was all very strange to take in and easy to forget just how different he was. \u201cA penny for your thoughts?\u201d</p><p>Heat warmed my cheeks when he caught me staring at him. His tongue darted out and licked his upper lip, and the heat surged to the rest of my body. I adverted my gaze. Aiden is your boyfriend. You shouldn\u2019t be devouring Dorian with your eyes. I chided myself.</p><p>\u201cCome on, I have something to show you.\u201d I turned to see Dorian making his way down the icy sidewalk. Tucking my embarrassment away, I followed.</p><p>We ended up walking into what looked like the world\u2019s scariest bar. Dim lighting lent a dangerous feel and casted dark pockets of shadows where people could lurk. Thick clouds of smoke permeated the air and danced in the beams of light like eerie spirits. The entire bar was constructed of wood, and the floors were covered with worn hardwood. Neon lights shone harshly from the various bar signs that hung over the pool tables and the haunting voice of Jim Morrison floated out of the jukebox alongside the wall. An array of torn pleather barstools lined a wooden bar and housed a collection of disconcerting patrons. Most wore leather of some sort and had disturbing tattoos covering their flesh. A few of the men wore bandanas around their heads and dark sunglasses to conceal their eyes.</p><p>When we stepped into the bar, all eyes traveled in our direction. I stepped closer to Dorian\u2019s side as sickening smiles grew on the men\u2019s faces, their eyes undressing every inch of me. The women devoured Dorian, their lust almost visible as they watched him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dorian\u2019s arm went around my waist and pulled me against his side. We moved towards an empty booth, and I slid against the black vinyl and sat against the wall. I watched as Dorian walked up to the bar and ordered two drinks. A man he stood beside gave him a head nod that he returned, and when the bartender set the glasses on the bar, Dorian slid him cash.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little early to be drinking.\u201d I commented when he set the amber filled glass in front of me.</p><p>Dorian slid into the booth and brought the mug to his lips. \u201cYou need a drink, you\u2019re too wound up.\u201d</p> <p>We stared at each other for a few moments. I lifted my glass and took a deep swallow of the beer. \u201cHappy?\u201d I wiped the foam from my mouth.</p><p>Dorian leaned back against the seat and appraised me. \u201cYou need to relax, Gwen. I can tell you\u2019re all tight and twisted inside. The world is filled with problems, has been since the dawn of time, it\u2019s not your job to clean it up.\u201d</p><p>I arched an eyebrow and snickered. It sure as hell felt like it was my mess to clean up. The NAWC and Ian Despereaux were most definitely my problems. I wished I could have thrown my hands in the air and been done with it, but I couldn\u2019t. \u201cIf I don\u2019t clean it up, then who will? Are pixies going to come in and sweep all of my problems under the rug?\u201d My throat suddenly felt dry. I hoisted my glass to my lips and flooded my mouth with the cold liquid. The beer did nothing to snuff my annoyance, but it had helped the dryness. I had no clue how to fix the problems I faced today when yesterday\u2019s problems were still a mess.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past them, they love to clean.\u201d Dorian laughed. I rolled my eyes and stared out the window. Cars crept along the snow covered road and a few humans walked down the sidewalk with shopping bags in hand.</p><p>\u201cPixies aside, I can\u2019t ignore the complexity of my life, Dorian.\u201d I looked over at him. \u201cI wish I could, but it\u2019s more difficult than you realize.\u201d I\u2019m sure he thought I was talking about the war, which was my number one hassle at the moment, but he didn\u2019t know I was also bonded to Ian. No one did, besides Aiden, Micah, and Fiona.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of your vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, well yes, but he\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg that my life\u2019s crashing into.\u201d I didn\u2019t really think of Aiden as a problem, except for the fact that I\u2019d been ordered not to see him. At the mention of him, I wondered if he\u2019d find anything that could help break my bond with Ian tonight. I didn\u2019t know who he was meeting, but it made me smile that he was at least trying.</p><p>\u201cAre you against the war?\u201d Dorian took another long drink of his beer. I tucked my leg underneath me and swung my free leg under the table. \u201cI\u2019m against how it\u2019s being executed. I don\u2019t think we should kill those who are innocent. That is only going to get the entire vampire population to hate us. If we just went after the ones responsible, make examples out them so to speak, then that would show the vampires we\u2019ll strike back should the problem ever arise again.\u201d I leaned forward and rested my arms on the table as thoughts rushed through my mind. \u201cPlus, what\u2019s to stop the addiction? Are we going to be at war with vampires for the rest of eternity?\u201d The more I thought about everything the more I didn\u2019t understand any of it. Nothing Holly was doing made sense and would only cause more problems.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should tell Holly your thoughts.\u201d Dorian leaned forward and rested his arms on the tabletop, his hands only a few inches from mine. I drew my arms back and crossed them on the table. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize the Angel of Death had a sense of humor.\u201d Telling Holly my reservations about her battle strategy would be like talking to a brick wall, useless.</p><p>\u201cI have my moments.\u201d Dorian wore sunglasses to hide his eyes, but I could almost see the dark clouds racing behind them. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you change your eyes to match your appearance?\u201d I hadn\u2019t meant to say it aloud but my curiosity had formed itself on my lips before I could rein it in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a misconception when people say the eyes are the windows to the soul. I can change everything about my appearance except that.\u201d A smile tugged at his lips. \u201cWhy, do they creep you out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey did when I first saw them, but now I kinda find them fascinating.\u201d I smiled. \u201cSorry that was rude, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, I enjoy your honesty.\u201d I wondered if he knew how refreshing that statement was. Not too many people appreciated honesty, not really. People want you to say what they want to hear. My foot had found refuge in my mouth on more than one occasion. I liked knowing that Dorian didn\u2019t see it as a flaw.</p><p>A peaceful silence settled between us. We both drank our beers and enjoyed each other\u2019s presence. It was something I hadn\u2019t expected when we first entered the shoddy bar. When I finished the last of my drink, I made eye contact with Dorian. He was watching me, the thoughts evident on his face. I didn\u2019t ask him what was on his mind; I really didn\u2019t want to know. I just wanted to enjoy this time together and leave the drama buried. I didn\u2019t want to dissect what that look meant.</p><p>\u201cHey, what made you choose this bar?\u201d I looked around and couldn\u2019t imagine the place being Dorian\u2019s regular hangout. Then again, I didn\u2019t know him that well.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of the lesson.\u201d He flicked his eyes to the roughnecks. \u201cDo you feel it?\u201d My lips tightened and I tried to sense whatever it was he was referring to but I came up with nothing. \u201cWhat am I supposed to be sensing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath?\u201d I frowned.</p><p>\u201cYou have to recognize it if you want to connect with it,\u201d Dorian said.</p> <p>I ran my fingers through my hair and took a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t want to connect with it. Honestly, I don\u2019t want anything to do with it.\u201d</p><p>Dorian snorted. I knew he wouldn\u2019t understand my unease about it; he was the Angel of Death after all. \u201cI\u2019ve told you, ignoring what you can do, won\u2019t change who you are, Gwen. Holly wants you to learn this, therefore I am teaching you.\u201d He paused. \u201cUntil you embrace who you fully are, you\u2019ll never be whole. I\u2019m sure over the years you\u2019ve felt different than your friends without an understanding why. Once you learn how to harness and control your spirit walker self, you\u2019ll be at peace with who you are. It\u2019s an all-around win-win.\u201d</p><p>I quietly grumbled. I knew he was right, I should learn who I really was. A small part of me was afraid to though. Reading the memories of the dead was creepy enough, but at least I was helping people when I did it. Dorian wanting me to connect with the darkness just to learn it scared me. Kye\u2019s insane sister flashed in my mind and gave me enough reason to want to study to be a spirit walker. I didn\u2019t know why she had gone insane, but I didn\u2019t want to end up like her. \u201cAlright, teach me, old wise one.\u201d My sarcasm tended to show itself when I was scared or pissed, at the moment I was a little bit of both.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes.\u201d Dorian instructed, ignoring my cynicism. My eyes snapped shut, and I waited for him to tell me what to do next. I heard the squeak of vinyl, and his body press along the side of me. Dorian slipped his hand underneath mine and made me to jump. \u201cKeep your eyes closed.\u201d I did as told, but my heart beat faster at our closeness. It seemed too intimate for a lesson.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Dorian began, his lips entirely too close to my ear. I could feel his cool breath on my skin and it caused goose bumps to erupt along my body. \u201cDo you feel it, Gwen? The cold darkness?\u201d His lips touched my ear, and I almost jumped away, but his grasp on my hand tightened and stopped me. \u201cConnect with the darkness, Gwen. Feel their souls calling to you.\u201d His voice was low and soothing like a steady hum that relaxed me. The air around us dropped a few degrees and a slow breeze stirred my hair. A symphony of voices whispered on the wind and called to me. Although my eyes were closed, I could see the owners of the voices. Gray figures stood against the darkness of my eyelids and walked towards me. I bit my lip to stop my teeth from chattering when one of the spirits touched me. His hand rested on my shoulder and traveled down the length of my arm. Icy pinpricks danced in his finger\u2019s wake and caused me to shiver.</p><p>Dorian released my hand and the spirits turned and walked back into the darkness. When my eyes opened everything came rushing back at once, the people talking in the bar, the music, the smokiness, and Dorian. It was so drastically different from the place I\u2019d just been it took me a moment to get my bearings. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d My voice was a mere whisper. I looked over at Dorian, who still had his arm around my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you feel?\u201d</p><p>I looked away because our faces were too close for comfort and focused on my hands. Visions of the gray figures occupied my mind as I tried to understand what had happened.</p><p>\u201cIt got cold and then I saw a crowd of gray figures,\u201d I said simply and paused. \u201cIt was...peaceful almost, like a dream.\u201d I glanced at Dorian and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cI told you it wouldn\u2019t always be scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought you here because most of these people are guilty of murder. Being close to those who\u2019ve killed is the easiest way to connect with the dead. We can connect with their darkness and therefore connecting with the ghostly realm is easier.\u201d</p><p>My eyes traveled over the bar patrons, and I saw them in a whole new light. Darkness clung to them and tainted their souls. I felt pain, hatred, and regret within them. Their emotions overwhelmed me and left me panting. My chest rose and fell heavily as I absorbed what they had done. \u201cI need to get out of here.\u201d I pushed against Dorian, and he slipped out of the booth. I quickly got to my feet and ran out of the door. The frigid winter air smacked my face as I burst through the bar doors. I leaned against the brick exterior of the bar and braced my hands on my knees as I bent over and sucked in the clean air.</p><p>Dorian followed me out and waited by my side while I tried to regain my calm. The experience had been fascinating, but seeing the people for what they\u2019d done had been like a fist wrapping around my lungs. The fury and ugliness weighted and crushed me and revved my anxiety and fear. \u201cYou okay?\u201d Dorian placed his hand on my back and I shrugged it off. I couldn\u2019t have him touching me; it only made the connection to the dead and evilness of the people stronger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was worse than seeing the dead,\u201d I said between heavy breaths.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because the dead are at peace, mostly. The living allows their emotions to control them. Their energy gives the more sinister feelings strength. It\u2019ll get better the more you learn.\u201d</p><p>I stood up and looked at Dorian. \u201cI\u2019m getting tired of you saying that. How much do I have to go through before it gets better?\u201d I released an aggravated sigh. \u201cI freaking hate this!\u201d</p> <p>Dorian began laughing which only pissed me off more. \u201cYou sound like a petulant child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? You\u2019re this creepy powerful Angel of Death, yet Holly has you by the leash like a little lapdog. I guess we both have problems, huh?\u201d I laughed sarcastically.</p><p>Anger hardened Dorian\u2019s face; he walked to his motorcycle, leaving me standing on the sidewalk. I laughed to myself because the name calling had been so immature; we\u2019d both acted like children. I couldn\u2019t seem to find regret in what I\u2019d said though, I didn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d do Holly\u2019s bidding, and he wouldn\u2019t explain it to me. Holly may have had control over him and Kye, but I could still practice free will and make my own decisions.</p><p>I hailed a cab and directed the driver towards Aiden\u2019s hotel. He was the only person who\u2019d be able to calm the storm that churned within me.</p><p>7</p> <p>I slipped the plastic keycard in Aiden\u2019s door. All it took was a little enchantment to get the lady at the desk to give it to me. Aiden would be asleep for the rest of the day, but at least I could be close to him.</p><p>The door swung open easily, and I made sure to close it quietly behind me. Vampires became very fatigued with the sunrise. They needed to sleep, but that didn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t wake up. There were a lot of attacks when the Revelation happened. Humans thought they\u2019d be able to kill the vampires during the day, but they were mistaken. Several lives were lost due to those inaccuracies.</p><p>I shrugged out of my coat and set it on the back of a chair. Aiden slept with both arms tucked under his pillow. The sheet draped across his legs leaving his chest uncovered. I loved the valleys of his muscular body as his chest rose and fell with each breath. His dark hair was a careless mess framing a peaceful face. The corners of my mouth turned up as my earlier tension slipped away from the sight of the man I loved.</p><p>I crawled onto the spare bed so I wouldn\u2019t disturb him and drifted off to sleep.</p><p>Sand squished between my toes as I walked across the desert. Tall, stone pyramids stood against the darkened sky, godly temples. Stars shone like diamonds above and the moon bathed the landscape in silvery beams.</p><p>\u201cYou are absolutely beautiful, little witch.\u201d Ian\u2019s voice came from behind me. He was dressed in white linen pants and a matching shirt. His blonde hair was cut close to his scalp and his blue eyes were bright even in the darkness. The color of blue that was associated with brew drinkers.</p> <p>Ian walked towards me and reached a hand towards my face. I jerked back to avoid contact, but his arms wrapped around me and held me against his chest before I could run away. He dipped his nose to my throat and trailed it up the length of my neck, moaning in delight from the scent of my blood. \u201cAnd you smell delicious.\u201d</p><p>His fangs scraped along my skin, and I tried to fight out of his grasp. Ian chuckled squeezing me harder. His tongue snaked its way up my throat his mouth stopping at my ear. \u201cYou will be mine, Gwen.\u201d His erection pressed through his pants, rubbing against my ass. A thread of fear overpowered me as much as his tight grip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never be yours! You\u2019re a disgusting monster.\u201d</p><p>Ian turned me around so we were face to face. His eyes were black, a sinister smile lifted his lips to reveal his fangs. \u201cYou\u2019re attracted to me, you can\u2019t help it. We\u2019re bonded.\u201d He laughed. \u201cFighting your desires will only torment you, Gwen.\u201d His hand caressed my backside and lifted the material of my skirt.</p><p>Panic surged through me at what was about to happen. I flailed in his arms, but he only pinned me against one of the pyramids. Ian captured my wrist in one hands and held them above my head while his free hand ripped my shirt open. Tears streamed down my face, but he ignored them. \u201cStop!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>His mouth captured my nipple, and he sucked until it had turned hard. His hand trailed down my body and began its decent between my legs. I clamped my thighs shut, but the attempt only made him laugh. Ian rubbed his fingers in circles over my vagina, then he struck. His fangs sunk into my neck, and I cried out in pain. It wasn\u2019t anything like what I had experienced before. His bite was agonizing. It felt as if an animal was chewing on my jugular. I screamed and cried but he only sucked harder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d play nice if I were you,\u201d he said against my skin. \u201cI can make it hurt,\u201d Ian warned and bit down to prove just how much pain he could cause. \u201cOr I can make it feel good.\u201d He continued to rub the spot between my legs and a euphoria washed through me when he bit down again.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that feel good, Gwen? Don\u2019t you crave it? Don\u2019t you want to feel me push inside of you while I drink?\u201d I was brought back to sanity while he spoke. The venom of his bite still made my body weak in the knees, but I could think more clearly now.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want anything to do with you. I hate you!\u201d I said between clenched teeth.</p><p>Anger flashed in his eyes and he struck again. The waves of rapture washed through me once again and moans tore from my lips. I knew what he was doing was wrong, but I couldn\u2019t control my reaction to it. If he wanted, he could have me naked and straddling his cock without a fight from me.</p><p>Ian continued rubbing between my thighs; the friction of his hands moving faster and faster building a feeling of torment deep within me until, with one last pull on my neck, an orgasm shot through me causing me to cry out from the strength of it</p><p>My eyes fluttered open, heavy with sleep and relaxation. Hands roamed my body and explored every inch of me. I sat up quickly and punched whatever was touching me. \u201cGet away from me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw, what was that for?\u201d Aiden asked, holding his cheek.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, I\u2019m sorry. I thought you were him.\u201d I jumped off of the bed and went to Aiden\u2019s side. Deceived</p><p>\u201cHim, who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan.\u201d Tears streaked down my face at the memory. I had been helpless against him, and he molested me. I felt queasy and had to sit down. I looked down at my shirt but it was still intact. My fingers reached up to feel my neck, but the flesh was unflawed.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Gwen?\u201d Aiden knelt in front of me and rubbed my arms. The action should have comforted me, but at the moment, I couldn\u2019t stand to be touched. I felt dirty and unworthy of his concern. I pushed past him. The longer I was awake, the more I remembered. Every detail slammed into focus. I slid down the wall, cradling my head and sobbed uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cGwen, please tell me what happened. What did he do?\u201d Aiden asked again. He walked over to me, careful not to touch and eyes filled with worry. Once he heard what I\u2019d done, he\u2019d hate me. I should have fought harder or used my magic to fend him off. I shouldn\u2019t have fallen under the spell of his venom.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Gwen. Tell me what happened!\u201d Aiden\u2019s voice rose in pitch and made me jump. I could imagine what he must be thinking, seeing me crouched and hysterical. His anger would only get worse once he learned what happened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Aiden. I should have stopped it, but he\u2019s so much stronger than I am.\u201d I managed to get the words out in a complete sentence. I looked up at him and saw fear set in his blue eyes. I could almost see the puzzle pieces forming a solid picture as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d he screamed and brought his fist down on the desk beside me. It cracked in two and fell to the floor, debris flying across the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry, Aiden.\u201d I pleaded for forgiveness.</p><p>Aiden took a deep breath, but it did absolutely nothing to calm the angriness shining through his eyes. However, when he looked down at me, it vanished.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault, Gwen. You have nothing to be sorry about.\u201d He bent down and lifted me into his arms and walked over to the bed where he cradled me against his chest. I closed my eyes, but all I saw was Ian. Aiden held onto me as I pushed against him and whispered calming sentiments.</p><p>My skin crawled with repulsion, and the scent of Aiden made me queasy. I didn\u2019t want to associate myself with anything male. I fought, clawed, and screamed to break free of Aiden\u2019s grasp. I knew in the back of my mind he wasn\u2019t a monster like Ian, but the dream left me a little unstable. I didn\u2019t care that we loved each other; I couldn\u2019t stand to be beside him.</p><p>Aiden let go of me, and I ran to the bathroom. I\u2019d barely made it to the toilet before I threw up what little food I\u2019d eaten. Though no evidence remained of my time with Ian, I knew what happened had been real. Somehow he had learned how to physically harm me in his dreams.</p><p>After I was sure I wouldn\u2019t vomit anymore, I climbed into the shower. I scrubbed every inch of my body, three times. I was so angry and hurt I couldn\u2019t begin to put those emotions into words. No words did my feelings justice. I sat huddled in the tub as tears continued to fall and the warm water beat against my back.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how long I\u2019d been sitting in the shower when Aiden knocked on the door. I was a lot calmer than before and slightly embarrassed about how I had acted.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d I called. The bathroom door opened and Aiden was silhouetted against the shower curtain. He hesitated to speak. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I could hear the strain in his voice, and it made my heart crack just a little bit. I didn\u2019t want what had happened to cause him pain. Guilt twisted its way through my mind. \u201cBetter, I think. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d My voice sounded alien to me, small and quiet. Ian had turned me into a scared little girl and I hated it\u2014 hated him.</p><p>Aiden sat on the toilet seat and released a heavy breath. \u201cGwen, quit apologizing. None of this is your fault. You don\u2019t have anything to apologize for, understand?\u201d His voice was hard, but I knew it was directed towards his anger with Ian and not me. Still, I felt I was responsible too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI should have done something,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cListen, I don\u2019t know exactly what happened, but I know you, Gwen. I know you fought back and didn\u2019t make it easy.\u201d</p><p>His words only caused more guilt. Not once had I tried to use magic to fend Ian off. Sure I had fought against him, but my strength was nothing compared to a vampire\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll deal with this. I have a meeting with the council tonight; I\u2019ll fix it, Gwen.\u201d</p><p>Two hard knocks banged on the main door and made me jump. Aiden left the bathroom and answered the door. \u201cWhere is she? What happened?\u201d I heard Fiona ask. I closed my eyes and took a couple deep breaths before climbing out of the shower. I slipped into a bathrobe that hung on the back of the door and eyed my clothes with disgust, I\u2019d burn them later.</p><p>Fiona sat on the edge of the bed with her head in her hands. Aiden stood next to the large window and stared out at the city below. When I walked closer, both of their heads turned towards me. I hated the pity in their eyes. Both of them watched me cautiously. I looked away to escape their stares.</p><p>\u201cGwen.\u201d Fiona stood but didn\u2019t touch me.</p><p>I gave her a sad smile and the tears began to fall again. Fiona\u2019s hesitation faded, and she wrapped me in her arms. All of the tension that had been building released as soon as I felt the comfort of her arms. She rubbed my back and started to sniffle along with me. I caught sight of Aiden over Fiona\u2019s shoulder, and I mouthed the words, \u201cThank you.\u201d I desperately needed my best friend and he had known. Aiden wasn\u2019t able to comfort me at the moment, but he had made sure someone would. It was only one of the many reasons why I loved him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to step out and give you two time alone. I\u2019ll be at the bar if you need me.\u201d</p><p>When he left, Fiona and I sat on the bed. \u201cWhat happened? Aiden said Ian had done something bad to you and you were hysterical.\u201d</p><p>My eyes closed and I hung my head, not sure if I wanted to explain the details of what Ian had done. I thought about what it would be like if it had happened to Fiona, and I knew I would go insane from not knowing. Fiona and Aiden were probably going crazy as speculations bombarded their minds. What Ian had done was horrible, but at least it hadn\u2019t gone further.</p><p>I ended up telling Fiona everything and watched as tears fell against her cheeks. She watched me with so much sympathy it made me feel worse. My own guilt demanded that she and Aiden be mad at me, as stupid as that sounded. I felt like I deserved it.</p><p>\u201cYou have to tell the council, Gwen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I gaped at her like she\u2019d lost her mind. I didn\u2019t want the attack to be public knowledge, and the last people I wanted to hear about this was the council.</p> <p>\u201cNot about what he did, but that you guys are bonded. It\u2019s dangerous, Gwen. They might know how to break it.\u201d Fiona\u2019s eyes begged for my cooperation. It made sense that the NAWC could have information on how to break my tie to Ian.</p><p>\u201cAiden is meeting with one of his council members tonight to discuss how to break the bond. If that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll tell our council, okay?\u201d</p><p>Fiona looked apprehensive, but nodded her head. \u201cAll right, if that\u2019s what you want. Now, what does a girl have to do to get a little room service around here?\u201d</p><p>An hour passed before Aiden came back to the room. Fiona and I were surrounded with food and a small pile of alcohol bottles we\u2019d swiped from the mini fridge. Will and Grace reruns played on the television, and we laughed as Grace poked her water bra and it spurted everywhere.</p><p>I looked at Aiden and smiled, finally feeling a little bit like myself. Warmth emanated within me as he watched me. He still seemed unsure on whether he should touch me, so I hopped off of the bed and hugged him. Now that my mind was a little clearer, being close to Aiden didn\u2019t send me running. I inhaled his spicy clean scent and let it soothe me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything. I know I was a little crazy earlier.\u201d I said against his chest.</p><p>\u201cIf I have to tell you to stop apologizing one more time, I\u2019m going to take away the chocolate,\u201d Aiden warned. Fiona and I had ordered everything they had in chocolate\u2014ice cream, cake and pudding.</p><p>\u201cWhat a horrible threat.\u201d I laughed.</p> <p>Aiden smiled and nodded his head. The atmosphere of the room was still touchy. They were being careful around me and I hated it. I didn\u2019t want to appear weak.</p><p>\u201cFiona, can I speak to you for a moment?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>I arched my eyebrows in confusion, not sure why he couldn\u2019t talk to her in front of me. Fiona hopped off of the bed and they walked outside the room.</p><p>I pressed my ear against the door, but it did nothing to help me hear their conversation. Deciding it was hopeless, I pressed my face to the peephole. Aiden had his arms crossed and a ticked off look on his face while Fiona spoke. It looked like she was telling him what happened, which annoyed me. Aiden should have heard it from my lips. The more Fiona spoke, the worse Aiden\u2019s anger became. He ran his hands through his hair and then fisted them at his side. I caught of glimpse of black in his eyes before he closed them.</p><p>When Fiona stopped talking, Aiden said some words and she nodded her head. They turned to come back into the room. I ran over to the bed and sat down so that they wouldn\u2019t know I had been eavesdropping. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d I pretended to watch television.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Aiden said with a smile. \u201cI have to meet with Aaron. You and Fiona are welcome to stay if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a member of the vampire council. I\u2019ll get this all sorted out tonight, Gwen.\u201d I nodded my head, not completely convinced the VC would be jumping to help a witch break free from a sadistic vampire.</p><p>\u201cAre you staying or going back to Moon?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll go back. Call me when you hear something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Aiden walked over and placed a kiss upon my head. He was careful not to let his hands linger on my shoulders too long. It made me sad that I had made him feel so cautious around me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later then.\u201d He gave me one last look and nodded his head towards Fiona before leaving. I rubbed my forehead and wished the motion would erase all of the dark memories of tonight. I was starting to feel like myself, but the dream was still vibrant in my mind and made my gut twist in disgust.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to go?\u201d Fiona used magic to clean up the mess of dishes that were all over the bed. Anger and sadness filled her eyes, although she pretended to be strong.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I just need to change.\u201d I went to the bathroom and shrugged out of the fluffy bathrobe. It pooled at my feet like a fallen cloud, and I caught my naked reflection in the mirror. My hair was limp and my eyes were swollen with the flood of tears I\u2019d cried. My skin was pale and my blue eyes looked almost haunted. Ian had violated me, and I hated that he had bestowed fear within me.</p><p>My eyes traveled to the heap of my clothes I\u2019d worn when I arrived at the hotel, but I couldn\u2019t put them on again. Looking away from the mirror, I concentrated on creating new clothes. I settled for yoga pants and baggy sweater and within seconds the clothes covered my body. With a deep breath, I stepped out of the bathroom, and Fiona and I headed back to Moon.</p><p>The car ride back was quiet. Fiona turned the radio on and changed the station every time a sad song played, like I\u2019d start crying if I listened to it. Frustration built each time the songs switched. When she was about to change the station again, I reached up and shut the radio off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Fiona. You don\u2019t have to watch yourself around me or monitor the music.\u201d I looked out the window then felt bad for snapping at my best friend. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know you\u2019re just trying to help, but I can\u2019t stand being treated like a victim.\u201d I gave her a weak smile.</p><p>\u201cBut you are a victim, Gwen. What Ian did was horrible, and you don\u2019t have to put on a brave face for anyone, especially me.\u201d She reached her hand out, grabbed mine and gave it a gentle squeeze. Why was she showing interest in my life now? Was Ethan busy tonight? I swallowed the words I wanted to throw at Fiona and accepted her comfort instead. Just like me, it\u2019d take Fiona and Aiden time to get over what Ian had done. As much as I hated the attention, I wouldn\u2019t throw their concerns back at them even if I really wanted to.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Fiona. I do appreciate your worry, but maybe dial it back just a little bit. I\u2019m not going to let Ian break me.\u201d I had my time to cry; now all I wanted was to figure out how to kill the son of a bitch.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but I\u2019m not letting this go. Ethan has been teaching me some pretty cool stuff, and I have something up my sleeve that\u2019ll prevent Ian from bothering you again,\u201d Fiona beamed, showing twin rows of sparkling white teeth.</p><p>Snorting, I asked, \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>8</p><p>Back at the castle, Fiona hauled me towards the herbal room. I leaned against the door frame while she rummaged through jars of dried plants and other questionable items. She pushed three jars into my arms and continued on her mission to find more ingredients for whatever spell she planned to keep Ian away.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure anything would help, aside from Ian\u2019s death. The magic that ran through his veins was strong from the brew he drank. Ian knew how to do magic I still hadn\u2019t learned. I\u2019d let Fiona perform her spell though I didn\u2019t have my hopes set high.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they have dried bat wings?\u201d A loud clatter echoed around the small stone room as Fiona searched.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do with bat wings?\u201d My voice rose in pitch at the thought of using something so disgusting. I was fine with herbs, but when spells called for animal parts, I became apprehensive.</p><p>\u201cHelp protect you, duh,\u201d Fiona answered. \u201cHere it is!\u201d She placed the supplies in a large glass bowl and motioned with her head for me to follow. We made our way upstairs and into my bedroom. Fiona sat Indian-style on the floor, and I mimicked her. She took everything out of the bowl and placed it in front of her. I watched the concentration on her face in awe. Fiona always used magic, but I\u2019d never seen her cast a spell. She manipulated objects all the time, but never did anything as ritualistic as this. Six white candles floated around us in a perfect circle. When they landed on the floor their wicks popped to life with a bright flame. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The glass bowl filled with a mixture of herbs and other unsavory objects as Fiona began concocting the spell. She held her hand out, palm side up, and I gave her my hand. She grabbed a pearl handled knife and held it to my finger before stabbing the tip inside. I shrieked and tried to tear my hand away, but she held it over the mixture.</p><p>\u201cWe need your blood to bind the spell to you,\u201d she said.</p><p>Crimson droplets dripped into the bowl and sizzled in the herbs. I looked up at Fiona with wide eyes, but the smile on her face said everything was all right. Spell casting was always fascinating, but I never had an urge to practice it because every spell called for blood. Call me crazy, but I preferred my blood to stay in my body. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d</p> <p>Fiona chanted words I couldn\u2019t understand and lit the mixture on fire. A whoosh of flames erupted within the bowl and dissipated just as quickly. Dark red smoke curled upward and traveled towards me. I sat rigid as the tendrils coiled around my body. The smoke appeared to be fading, but the more I watched it dance around my body, I realized it wasn\u2019t vanishing; it was soaking into my skin.</p><p>\u201cFiona, what\u2019s going on?\u201d I held out my trembling arms and swallowed back the horror as my skin absorbed the smoke.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s working!\u201d Fiona squealed as a huge smile appeared on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you sound surprised?\u201d</p><p>Fiona was quiet for a moment as she bit her bottom lip and looked at me through her eyelashes. \u201cI\u2019m a beginner, Gwen. Sometimes, not all the time...\u201d her voice trailed off and her face twisted slightly.</p> <p>\u201cGet on with it, Fiona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of my spells haven\u2019t worked, but this one is.\u201d</p><p>My eyes closed, and I took a deep breath. The last thing I needed was to be used as Fiona\u2019s guinea pig. I hoped she was right and that the smoke from the spell was supposed to absorb into my skin. \u201cOkay, so what is the spell supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>She picked up the supplies. \u201cIt\u2019ll block Ian from entering your dreams, cool, right?\u201d</p><p>A surge of energy rushed through my body like I overdosed on caffeine. I couldn\u2019t stop from pacing around my bedroom and fidgeting.</p><p>\u201cUm, Fiona?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d She looked up.</p><p>\u201cI think you did something wrong, I\u2019m energized like the Duracell bunny.\u201d My voice was excited yet panicked. I began jumping up and down, unable to control the hyperness and needing an outlet. I wanted to do a million things at once, but my mind couldn\u2019t figure out which one to do first.</p><p>Fiona watched me and then looked back down at the ingredients. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened; I did exactly what the book said. Stay here, I\u2019ll go get Ethan.\u201d She rushed out of room.</p><p>I rolled my neck to try to ease the tension, but the action did nothing to calm me down. I couldn\u2019t just stand and wait, my body wanted to move. Heading downstairs, I made my way towards the gym. A few people gave me strange looks as I ran through the castle laughing like a crazed woman. I\u2019m sure they thought I\u2019d lost my mind, maybe I had, who knows what spell Fiona accidently concocted.</p><p>I darted through the gym door and pausing a moment to take a breath, I rushed a practice dummy. \u201cYou want a piece of me?\u201d I bounced on my feet like a boxer and held my hands in front of my face ready to strike the dummy. My fist connected with the plastic face. \u201cTake that biatch!\u201d I laughed as I punched again. My leg kicked at the mannequin\u2019s stomach, but before I could make contact a voice disrupted my concentration, and I fell backwards.</p><p>\u201cWay to go, ninja,\u201d Dorian said from behind me. Tilting my head backwards, I saw Dorian standing a few feet away with a grin plastered on his face. My laughter rose as I watched him upside down.</p><p>\u201cYou drunk?\u201d Dorian asked.</p><p>Rolling onto my side, I bounced to my feet. \u201cNo, I\u2019m mad at you, Mr. Death Boy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr. Death Boy? What are you like five years old?\u201d Dorian chuckled.</p><p>\u201cHa ha very funny. You\u2019re the one who left me on the side of the street, so don\u2019t talk about maturity to me, bucko.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged out of his leather jacket and laid it off to the side and then chucked his sunglasses on top of his coat</p><p>\u201cI did, and I apologize for leaving you. You are very irritating sometimes. Looks like you made it back in one piece though, so no harm no foul.\u201d</p><p>My lip lifted on one side as I sneered. He didn\u2019t know what happened to me, and I wasn\u2019t planning on telling him. I was done playing the victim.</p><p>\u201cWanna practice on something real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I bit out and turned back to the dummy. My annoyance drove my energy over the edge. I punched the dummy again and it rocked back and forth from the force.</p><p>\u201cAfraid I\u2019ll hit back?\u201d Dorian teased from behind me.</p><p>I whirled around and stalked towards him, fully ready to take him down a few notches. Magic rushed through my veins like a wild river driven by the spell. My arm lashed out and a smile spread across my face at the notion of landing a blow to his pretty face, but I celebrated too soon. Dorian blocked my arm and with a flat palm, pushed me backwards with more force than I expected. A whoosh of air tore through my lungs and left me gasping. My body raced with adrenaline, so I recovered quickly. My emotions were just as amped as my body and my anger roared to life. I charged at Dorian like a bull attacking a matador, I think I even grunted.</p><p>Once I got close enough, I dropped to the floor and swung my leg out, sweeping his legs. He went down with a thud. I laughed in victory but was cut short when Dorian jumped up and came at me. The smile on his face made it evident he enjoyed sparring with me, which ticked me off more. We circled around each other, his cloudy eyes calculating my every move. Occasionally, one of us would strike, but the blow would either be blocked or dodged. He was a lot more fun to practice with than the dummy, but I wouldn\u2019t let him know that.</p><p>Footsteps sounded in the doorway, and he looked away. I used the distraction to my advantage and charged. I landed on top of him, my hips pinning his waist while my hands held onto his arms.</p><p>\u201cUm, am I interrupting something?\u201d Fiona asked from the doorway.</p><p>I recognized the way Dorian and I were positioned and realized it most likely looked intimate. I scurried to my feet after noticing the look of desire in his gray eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, we were just sparring.\u201d I squealed. Ethan stood behind Fiona and snickered. Dorian climbed to his feet and smoothed his shirt, throwing an amused look my way.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have the remedy,\u201d Fiona said, motioning with her head to follow her and Ethan. Without another look at Dorian, I walked away.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I turned around and faced Dorian. I kept my eyes down, not sure why I couldn\u2019t make eye contact with the angel of death or, at least, not willing to acknowledge the reason.</p><p>\u201cMeet me in the graveyard when you\u2019re done.\u201d He walked over and picked up his jacket.</p><p>I chewed on my lip. \u201cWhy?\u201d It was 9:00pm, so I couldn\u2019t use the late hour as an excuse not to meet him. At the moment, I didn\u2019t feel comfortable being alone with him.</p><p>\u201cWe have training to do. You\u2019ll be practicing with the witches tomorrow, so we need to use tonight to continue with our project.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. Project, that\u2019s what he called summoning pissed off spirits? The events of the day made me forget all about the vials of vampire blood that waited for my attention. Holly ordered me to do it and I gave my word I would; whether I wanted to be alone with Dorian or not, I had to.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I coated my words with irritation.</p><p>When I left the gym, Fiona and Ethan were waiting for me in the large entry way. The fighting helped dissolve some of the extra energy, but I was still jittery. We went to the library and sat behind a large bookshelf, obscured from anyone who might wander in.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you and that guy?\u201d Fiona waggled her eyebrows. She loved juicy gossip.</p><p>Ethan shook his head and kept his attention on mixing a new spell.</p><p>\u201cNothing. He\u2019s training me for my part in the war.\u201d</p><p>Her smile didn\u2019t falter with my explanation; she wasn\u2019t buying my explanation.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t waste any time, do you?\u201d Ethan scoffed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou just broke up with the leech, and you\u2019re already throwing yourself at a new guy. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I hate vampires, but you could show a little decorum.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows arched in surprise, it was the most Ethan had said to me since I met him. I was also surprised Fiona didn\u2019t tell him I was still with said leech. I was already a social pariah because I dated a vampire and sympathized with the innocent vamps, if they knew I was still dating one, I\u2019d be outcast whether I helped in the war or not.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your problem?\u201d I glared at Ethan. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, you don\u2019t add thistle,\u201d Fiona interjected. \u201cThat\u2019s what I did wrong.\u201d I could tell she didn\u2019t want Ethan and I to fight, but I was tired of the nasty looks he threw me and wanted to get to the bottom of his annoyance, despite Fiona\u2019s unease.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I don\u2019t, but you let a vampire feed from you, and that\u2019s all I need to know.\u201d He continued to add herbs to the mixing bowl. I couldn\u2019t be mad on principle, I was against vampires feeding off of witches, but the situation with Aiden was a special circumstance.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did, but not for the fun of it. There was reason behind my decision. Don\u2019t judge things you don\u2019t understand.\u201d My hands fisted and magic tingled within as my anger rose.</p><p>Ethan began to say something, but Fiona cut him off.</p><p>\u201cBoth of you need to stop! Ethan, Gwen is a good person, and you shouldn\u2019t hate her because of one decision she made.\u201d I smiled at my best friend, but then she turned her attention towards me and the ire in her eyes made the smile disappear. \u201cAnd, Gwen, don\u2019t be so quick to judge Ethan, he has his own reasons for hating the vampires. Both of you are important to me, and I don\u2019t wanna hear any more about it, understand?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said, and Ethan nodded. Of course I hated being reprimanded, but I was proud of Fiona for standing up against her boyfriend and best friend. I wondered what reason Ethan had for hating vampires but didn\u2019t ask, it wasn\u2019t any of my business. I had enough of my own drama without having to worry about his.</p><p>Blue smoke rose from the bowl and curled towards my body and around my limbs and torso. The smoke dissolved into my skin like before, but I didn\u2019t feel different, my energy and magic still buzzed underneath my skin like an electric current.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s working,\u201d I told Ethan.</p> <p>\u201cGive it a minute.\u201d His eyes rolled as he looked away.</p><p>If Fiona hadn\u2019t been sitting right next to me, I would have smacked him. Maybe if I was lucky, his eyes would stick like that. I giggled at the thought, and both of them looked at me. Shrugging my shoulders, I reigned in my amusement and picked a piece of fuzz off of my jeans.</p><p>We sat for ten minutes before I felt normal again. After being hyper for so long, normal felt sluggish in comparison. I frowned at the difference. I missed the extra energy but at least now the spell would protect me from Ian\u2014or at least I hoped it would. I didn\u2019t exactly trust Ethan, so I wasn\u2019t confident I wouldn\u2019t see Ian tonight.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Fiona laid her hand on my arm and watched me with curious eyes.</p><p>\u201cNormal. My energy buzz is gone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so excited about it,\u201d Fiona laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt was just cool to have so much energy, I felt invincible.\u201d</p><p>Ethan cleaned up his mess and stood. \u201cWell, if were done, I\u2019ve gotta get back to studying. You coming, Fiona?\u201d</p><p>She stood and looked down at me. \u201cGive me a minute,\u201d she told Ethan.</p><p>Without a word he turned and walked towards the door. Fiona grabbed my hand and squeezed it tight. Her eyes were filled with apprehension and sympathy. I knew what she\u2019d say before the words ever left her mouth.</p><p>\u201cGwen, are you sure you\u2019re okay? I can stay with you if you want.\u201d</p> <p>A smile spread upon my lips, even though I felt like frowning. I would act the same way if Fiona had been violated. As much as I wanted her to ignore it and just move on with life, I appreciated her empathy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, really. More pissed than anything. I have to train with Dorian, so you can\u2019t stay with me, unless you wanna hang out in the graveyard all night.\u201d I laughed because I knew Fiona hated graveyards.</p><p>Her eyebrows scrunched and the corner of her mouth went up in an uneasy smile. \u201cI think I\u2019ll stay in here, but if you need me, just let me know; I\u2019ll be in the ball room with Ethan and all the other soldiers.\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t...\u201d I began as I stood up. Fiona waited for me to finish my sentence, but I felt bad even asking her what was on my mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell Ethan about what happened, did you?\u201d It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t trust her, I just needed to be certain. I hoped she would understand that.</p><p>\u201cNope, I just told him the ghosts wouldn\u2019t let you sleep, so you needed a sleep protection spell. He didn\u2019t even question it.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Fiona.\u201d I gave her a tight hug. \u201cTell him thank you for me, will ya?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded before she turned and left to find Ethan. There was a big change in my best friend since we came to Moon. She was more mature and interested in things other than herself. Maybe she was done playing spoiled rich girl and was looking for a purpose in her life. Whatever the reason, I admired her development.</p><p>Like every other night since coming to Moon, tonight seemed like it lasted an eternity. It was only 10:00pm, but I very much wanted to head up to my bedroom and crawl under the plush cotton comforter.</p><p>Instead, I met with Dorian in the graveyard. I spent more time in graveyards in the past few weeks than I had my entire life. If someone asked me where someone was buried, I was sure I could draw them a map with the exact type of headstone marking the grave.</p><p>Just as I got to the front door, Kye walked into the large entry way. I hadn\u2019t seen him around much since Holly pawned me off to the Angel of Death. His sandy brown hair was spiked atop his head, and he wore khaki pants and a blue polo shirt that fit a bit snug. His eyes found mine, and I gave him a small smile. \u201cHey,\u201d I said as he walked closer to me.</p><p>\u201cGoing for a night jog?\u201d He crossed his arms and waited for my answer.</p><p>It took me a moment to understand his question. I looked down at my clothes, I still had on the yoga pants and baggy sweater I\u2019d conjured at Aiden\u2019s hotel.</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI have to meet Dorian in the graveyard, training again. I feel like I\u2019m in boot camp.\u201d I laughed. Kye\u2019s head bobbed up and down and an awkward silence filled the space between us.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna come with me?\u201d The words spilled out, and I rushed to explain. \u201cYou might want to learn, Dorian won\u2019t always be around to teach new spirit walkers.\u201d The truth was I didn\u2019t want to be alone with him. I\u2019d seen interest in his eyes on more than one occasion, and with Kye there he couldn\u2019t act on those feelings.</p><p>Kye looked away then back at me. \u201cYeah, I guess I could do that. I was just going to listen in on fighting techniques, but it\u2019d be nice to get out of the castle for a little bit.\u201d</p><p>We followed the cobblestone road that lead to the graveyard. The air was a bit chilly and carried the scent of smoke and food from one of the quaint restaurants. Kye seemed like he wanted to ask me something but was hesitant to speak. A small smile crept onto my lips as I waited for him to gain the courage to talk. After a couple minutes, I couldn\u2019t maintain patience any longer. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d</p><p>He looked over at me and then away, nervousness showed in his eyes. \u201cYour friend, the blonde one,\u201d he began, and I smiled wider.</p><p>\u201cFiona? What about her?\u201d I bit my lip to rein in my smile. It was obvious he was uncomfortable, and I shouldn\u2019t make it worse by laughing. But it was sort of nice seeing him unsure of himself when he made me feel exactly like that through his training.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d He waved his hand in the air like it would make me forget the conversation ever happened.</p><p>\u201cNo, really. What did you wanna know?\u201d I didn\u2019t know him all that well, and all the time I spent with him convinced me a large stick was probably stuck up his ass, but I still liked him more than Ethan.</p><p>\u201cIs she seeing anyone?\u201d He rushed the question so it sounded like one word.</p><p>Fiona was into Ethan so I felt bad about having to tell Kye, especially when he was so nervous to ask. \u201cEthan Rhodes, but I don\u2019t know how serious it is,\u201d I told him. We\u2019d only been in Moon for a couple weeks, it couldn\u2019t be super serious or, at least, I hoped it wasn\u2019t. I was sure Ethan was nice enough to the right people, but I hadn\u2019t seen that side of him yet.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Kye murmured.</p><p>Kye and I walked down the dirt path in silence. Seeing Dorian leaning against a large mausoleum was a welcome sight, although by the look on his face, seeing Kye with me wasn\u2019t one.</p><p>Sweetness on my lips, my tongue does yearn to lick.</p><p>I stopped in my tracks as Ian\u2019s voice penetrated my mind. Fiona and Ethan shielded him from my dreams, but the spell didn\u2019t stop him from communicating with me telepathically.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Kye asked.</p><p>My hands itch to caress your breasts, and my mouth waters to taste your sweet nectar.</p><p>My heart sped up as Ian continued to taunt me. I covered my face with both hands and rubbed my forehead like that would eradicate him from my brain.</p><p>You will be everything she is not, be by my side and claim your spot.</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I screamed and Kye jumped beside me.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d Dorian asked, beside me in an instant.</p><p>Ian\u2019s laughter haunted my mind and no amount of rubbing would erase the eerie sound. My anger intensified my magic to rush through my veins and before logic could penetrate my conscious, I shot my hand out and a blast of blue energy hit a nearby tree. A large branch snapped in two, almost hitting Kye.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Dorian asked Kye.</p><p>Shit, how am I going to explain this? I\u2019d have to tell them the truth, unless I wanted them to think I was going insane. Thoughts rushed through my head as Dorian and Kye argued. When I looked up, two pairs of eyes were watching me. My body shook with fear and anger, and my chest heaved with my panicked heartbeat. What would the NAWC do when they found out I was bonded to the vampire responsible for killing so many witches? It didn\u2019t look good that I lied about the bond with Ian for so long. I should have told the council as soon as it happened.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Kye rested a hand on my shoulder.</p><p>I nodded, but couldn\u2019t find the courage to speak.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell just happened, Gwen?\u201d Dorian crossed his arms and watched me.</p><p>Don\u2019t tell them, little witch. They\u2019ll lock you away; you\u2019re a liability in their war.</p><p>As much as I hated to admit it, Ian was right. The NAWC wouldn\u2019t trust me. With Ian bonded to me, he could infiltrate my mind and know their steps before they made them. But what if Ian knew they could break the bond and that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t want me to say anything? I was stuck between a rock and hard place and didn\u2019t know how to get out. I felt like I had an angel on one shoulder telling me to say something and the devil on the other telling me to keep my mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I told them. By the looks on their faces they didn\u2019t believe me. I didn\u2019t blame them, I was a horrible liar.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fine? Just like that?\u201d Dorian laced his words with sarcasm. \u201cYou almost took Kye\u2019s head off with a tree limb. I don\u2019t know you, but I doubt you just have random crazy fits.\u201d</p><p>I grumbled and pressed past both men. My hands trailed through my hair as I walked further into the cemetery. I\u2019d never known what hate was, not really, until I met Ian Despereaux. He was making my life a living hell, and unless Aiden found out how to break the bond tonight, I was stuck with him until he died. I made a silent promise that I\u2019d be the one who killed him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Don\u2019t be like that, you\u2019ll see things my way soon enough, Ian said.</p><p>Just leave me the fuck alone! I made sure I thought the words instead of speaking them\u2014another outburst would send Dorian and Kye into a tizzy.</p><p>A strong gust of wind whipped my hair around my face and heavy footsteps approached. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d I said as I turned around expecting to see Dorian or Kye. Instead, a man I\u2019d seen at the castle was running towards us. I watched as he took a moment to catch his breath and then he spoke to the two men. Fear was evident on his young face, and his hands danced in front of him as he spoke with rushed words.</p> <p>When he was done telling them whatever the news was, he turned and hurried back towards the castle. My eyebrows arched as I walked back to the two men. \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d I looked between Dorian and Kye. Dorian looked almost bored but Kye\u2019s features were alarmed. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked again.</p><p>\u201cTwo bodies were left at the front door of the castle with a letter,\u201d Kye said.</p><p>I gasped. \u201cWhat did the letter say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChallenge accepted.\u201d</p><p>9</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Dorian questioned as I headed towards the mayhem.</p><p>Kye was already half way back to the castle, where they\u2019d most likely call a meeting. I had little doubt the witches and warlocks were in an uproar, and I would be expected to be there.</p><p>\u201cBack to the castle,\u201d I said and took another step towards the path.</p><p>Dorian stepped in front of me. \u201cWe have training to do.\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my forehead and frowned in exasperation. \u201cIt\u2019ll have to wait.\u201d I shouldered past him and jogged up the trail. There was a large group of people huddled around the two bodies. Holly, and three other council members, stood on the stone steps and worked to calm the crowd. When we made eye contact her face lit up.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, please back away from the bodies so Gwen may see who killed them,\u201d Holly announced, her tone pretentious.</p> <p>The horde of people turned and stared at me expectant. I frowned but stepped forward. They backed away as I walked closer to the two bodies. Sprawled out on the front steps were two men in their early thirties with their necks ripped out. It was a miracle their heads didn\u2019t fall off of their bodies. Nausea gnawed at my stomach from the sight of their tendons and bone poking out. Blood caked the front of their shirts, and their faces were frozen in fear. It was the most macabre scene I\u2019d ever witnessed.</p><p>\u201cIf you would please assist us in finding out who did this, Gwen.\u201d Charles said, motioning towards the two dead men. He was part of the council, but Holly was the voice, so he was rarely in the public eye.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll need to get my cat,\u201d I told them. Dorian said I could penetrate the spirit realm without Aura, but I didn\u2019t want to use these two poor men as practice. With Aura, I\u2019d be able to read their memories without hang-ups.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d Dorian offered from behind me.</p><p>I frowned but didn\u2019t refuse his help, everyone was on edge from the murders and expecting answers. We knelt in front of the bodies, and I placed my hands on the temples of the dark skinned man, cringing at the feel of the gooey, coagulated blood under my fingers. Ignoring my unease, I closed my eyes and focused. With Aura\u2019s help, I felt the stream of magic that connected me with the body; without her, I didn\u2019t feel anything.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not working,\u201d I whispered to Dorian.</p><p>He placed his hand on my forearm and an icy sensation crawled up the length of my arm. A shiver sneaked through my insides from our contact.</p><p>\u201cConnect with the death,\u201d Dorian whispered.</p> <p>I nodded and focused. Sparks of light danced behind my eyelids, and a large home came into view.</p><p>The man strolled up the stone walkway, checking his cell phone. When his head came up, realization that something was wrong was evident in his wide eyes and still body. His eyes roamed the area as he looked for the threat. Taking cautious steps, he moved closer to the home. He continued up the walkway, his eyes darting to the side as he watched for danger.</p><p>His friend, the other man who lay dead on the steps of the NAWC castle, stood just behind him, his eyes also roaming the area for any danger.</p><p>The only warning was the slight ripple in the night air and then she was on him. A woman with jet black hair that hung to the small of her back ceased him by the throat, slamming him against the brick exterior. His head make a sickening crack as it made contact with the stone. Her fingers dug into his throat as she pinned him against the building. Her fangs scraped against his skin as she leaned into the crook of his neck. \u201cYou\u2019re either really stupid or really generous. Have you come to make a donation?\u201d Her tongue darted out and lapped at the scratch her fangs made on his throat.</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d The warlock snarled. \u201cI\u2019ve come to let you know the NAWC has declared war.\u201d As soon as the words were out of his mouth, the vampire sunk her fangs into his throat. The man wailed in pain, and his friend fought the vampire who held onto him. It was useless though, the woman had ripped his throat out, her mouth covered in the sticky red liquid.</p><p>She rushed the other man and ripped out his throat too. His body fell to the ground. Both men were dead within seconds of their approach of the home.</p><p>The connection waned, and I was back to staring at the dead man in front of me. \u201cDid they get the message to the vampires?\u201d Holly asked, her voice devoid of any emotion over the lives lost.</p><p>I shook my head in aggravation. \u201cYes, and they were killed for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what war is, Gwen, people die for their cause,\u201d Holly replied.</p><p>I wanted to ask why she wasn\u2019t the one delivering the message for the cause, but I bit my tongue. As I looked down at the two dead men, I wondered how many more would die. The crowd still hovered around the bodies, and I pondered if the scene was enough to scare them into understanding just how serious Holly\u2019s war was.</p><p>\u201cThe vampires killed them once they declared war,\u201d I told Holly and Charles. Charles, at least, had the decency to look sad over the deaths. Holly, on the other hand, looked happy the message was received.</p><p>I stood up and shoved past Holly and Charles and went into the castle. My feet pounded up the stairs and I flopped onto my bed. Aura was curled on my pillow. She stood and stretched, then walked over and rubbed her black furry head against mine. \u201cYou\u2019re such a sweetie,\u201d I cooed. I hadn\u2019t spent much time with her, even though she slept twenty some hours a day, I felt bad.</p><p>My phone vibrated in my pocket. Pulling it out, I checked the display and smiled at Aiden\u2019s name. My visit to his hotel room hadn\u2019t gone as planned, and I missed him.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, you\u2019re still awake,\u201d Aiden replied.</p><p>\u201cJust caught me, I was on my way to bed. How did the meeting go?\u201d Aiden put more stock in his council than I did. With the witches declaring war on the vampires, I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d jump at the opportunity to help me break my bond with Ian Despereaux.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll help,\u201d Aiden said, but I could tell there was more he wasn\u2019t saying.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment. Worry trickled in and gnawed at my insides. \u201cBefore you hear what I\u2019m about to say, just keep in mind it\u2019s not as bad as it sounds.\u201d I sat up straight and hard-pressed the phone to my ear, my heart beat thudding harder in my chest. \u201cWhat do they want, Aiden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo things, actually. First, they want you to convince the NAWC to have a meeting with them.\u201d Aiden paused, whatever the second thing was, I wasn\u2019t going to like it.</p><p>\u201cSpit it out already!\u201d I said with exasperation. I couldn\u2019t stand the waiting. My mind raced with all of the worst possible scenarios, and I hated it.</p><p>\u201cThey want to sample you,\u201d Aiden said.</p><p>\u201cSample me? What the hell does that mean?\u201d My words lodged in my throat when I realized what \u201csampling\u201d meant. \u201cThey want to taste my blood? Drink from me? And you agreed to it?\u201d With each question my voice raised in pitch, and my anger grew heavier in my chest.</p><p>\u201cGwen, a gift of blood is customary when asking the vampire council for a favor. I know it sounds bad, but I wouldn\u2019t agree to it if it was, you know that. Gifting blood is a small sacrifice when it comes to getting rid of Ian.\u201d</p><p>What he was saying made sense. When it came to vampires, everything revolved around blood. But that didn\u2019t mean I wanted a council of vampire elders to sink their fangs into my neck. \u201cLet me think about it. As for the meeting with the NAWC, all I can do is ask. Holly\u2019s on a rampage to see every vampire turned into a pile of ash, so convincing her isn\u2019t going to be easy. Why do they want the meeting?\u201d</p><p>Two soft knocks sounded at my door. I walked over and opened it to see Dorian on the other side. I held up my pointer finger as a signal to wait. After the news Aiden gave me, I didn\u2019t want to deal with anything else, except crawling into my bed and sleeping.</p><p>\u201cThey think they\u2019ve come to a solution to end the war,\u201d Aiden told me. I eyed Dorian and turned around, not sure if I should be discussing this stuff with him nearby.</p><p>\u201cThat would be a lucky break, but I doubt she\u2019d go for it. Maybe I could convince the others members though.\u201d Ending the war before it got started would be an amazing lucky break. The vampire council was smart to not want to go to war with the witches\u2014aside from werewolves, we were their only other threat. Of course with vampires drinking our blood and learning how to produce magic, we were becoming less of a threat to the fanged.</p><p>\u201cI miss you, my Gwen,\u201d Aiden said out of the blue. A smile crept along my lips, and the slightest flutter of butterflies twirled within my stomach.</p><p>\u201cI miss you too,\u201d I told him, the yearning to see him was almost overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoga pants and a hoodie, why?\u201d I paused. \u201cOh, no. We can\u2019t do that.\u201d Looking over my shoulder, I eyed Dorian.</p><p>He smirked at me and my cheeks warmed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019d love to shuck my clothing, bury myself under my covers and feel myself while Aiden\u2019s smooth masculine voice instructed where my hands should go, but Dorian ruined that.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? And don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re shy. A shy girl wouldn\u2019t ambush me in my office and fuck me like a drunken college girl.\u201d Aiden laughed.</p><p>\u201cI resent you comparing me to a drunken college girl; I\u2019m more talented than that.\u201d A day before Fiona and I left for Moon, I visited Aiden at his bar, Vain. The popular vampire club was packed, but I wasn\u2019t going to let that spoil what I went there to do. I sauntered into his office, dressed in a black trench coat and not much of anything else. His eyes glinted with anticipation while I deliberately untied the belt and revealed a red and black bra and panty set I\u2019d bought that day. We christened almost every square inch of his office that night, and the memory still sent heat to rush between my thighs.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed you are, my Gwen. Why don\u2019t you tell me exactly how talented you are,\u201d Aiden goaded.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute, lover boy.\u201d I laughed and covered the end of the phone. I turned to Dorian and asked, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d The amusement on his face was evident. His gray eyes gazed me with a carnal curiosity.</p><p>\u201cHolly says we have to finish the blood rituals tonight,\u201d he said.</p><p>My eyebrows arched and my anger spiked. We\u2019d only gotten around to summoning one spirit, there were at least ten more vials of vampire blood.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we do it tomorrow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have training with the witches tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to train with them when I\u2019ll be up all night summoning ghosts with you? Do they think I don\u2019t need sleep?\u201d My grumpiness was a concoction of weariness and sexual frustration, not to mention Aiden\u2019s news about the vampire council wanting to use me as their personal Slurpee machine. I was being pulled in every direction, and one more tug would cause me to snap.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t make the rules,\u201d Dorian remarked.</p><p>I let out an annoyed grumble and uncovered the phone. Unfortunately, phone sex with Aiden would have to wait. \u201cHey,\u201d I said into the phone. Sorry, but the council needs me to finish something tonight. When does the VC need my answer?\u201d I prayed for the day I could return to my crappy, nine hundred square foot apartment and normal life. I was a simple woman and life in Moon was anything but since I arrived. Regrettably, I didn\u2019t think my life would get back to normal anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as possible,\u201d Aiden paused. \u201cHas Ian contacted you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Fiona and Ethan worked a spell to block him.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to worry Aiden over the telepathic episode earlier. I could handle hearing his voice in my head so long as he didn\u2019t have the ability to physically harm me.</p> <p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll call you tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Sorry, I know we haven\u2019t had a lot of time to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings are difficult right now. That just means there\u2019ll be a lot of catching up to do when you get home.\u201d His tone was sinfully seductive and tempted me to throw Dorian out of my room so we could continue with the phone sex.</p><p>\u201cI look forward to it,\u201d I told him, my own voice thick with want.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to take a shower. When my hand is wrapped around my cock, it\u2019ll be your body I\u2019ll be thinking about. Goodnight, my Gwen.\u201d</p><p>The click of the call ending didn\u2019t make me move. I was so turned on all I could do was picture Aiden stroking himself. Obligations were a bitch.</p><p>I shook the image away with resentment. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with.\u201d My frustration found an outlet with Dorian who was sitting on the floor, the vials of vampire blood in front of him. His arms wrapped around his bent up legs, causing his t-shirt to strain against his bulbous biceps. I took my place on the floor in front of him; all the while thinking of Aiden\u2019s soaking wet body in the shower.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d I snipped.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are your cheeks so flushed?\u201d Dorian\u2019s innocent question was anything but.</p><p>I looked up through my eyelashes and said, \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>He smirked but didn\u2019t comment further. Instead, he picked up a vial of blood and handed it to me. \u201cDo what I told you and concentrate on the death within the blood,\u201d Dorian instructed.</p><p>The glass vial felt ominous in my hand, but I did what the Angel of Death said and concentrated on the feeling it emanated. Without thinking, I pulled the stopper out of the tube and dipped the pad of my finger in the blood. As soon as my skin made contact with the sticky liquid, a shiver washed through me. The feeling of death and despair surrounded me. My body shook against the icy coldness crawling through me.</p><p>\u201cCall the spirits forward, Gwen.\u201d</p><p>That was easier said than done. The death within the blood was overwhelming. Whoever the blood belonged to, they had killed a lot of people. Instinct took over, and something inside of me commanded I take control of the ghosts. My body stopped quivering, a peaceful calm replaced the confusion. When I opened my eyes, a large cloud of gray hovered just behind Dorian\u2019s back. The cloud separated and formed what looked like human shapes. It took less than three minutes for the fog to completely separate. At least fifteen spirits stood in my room, their bodies shimmering like a heat mirage.</p><p>Dorian turned to see what I called forth from the blood. \u201cGood job. I\u2019ve never seen a newbie pull that many ghosts at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how I did it,\u201d I said flabbergasted.</p><p>\u201cI told you it\u2019d get easier. Once you learn to associate the feeling of death on someone, you won\u2019t even have to think when you summon their victims.\u201d The look of pride was hard to ignore on Dorian\u2019s face.</p><p>I thought about every time I read the memories of the dead and what that meant. When Holly said I was more powerful than I realized, she wasn\u2019t wrong. Reading memories of death was only the tip of what I could do. Mixed emotions gnawed at me. On one hand, I was excited I was strengthening my power, but on the other hand, I was scared shitless. My ability had everything to do with death and the feelings that came with it. When I interacted with death, I felt their despair, confusion and anger. It was tough to feel emotions that didn\u2019t belong to me. I had yet to come across a ghost that was happy. Spirit walkers were nearly extinct. Either killed by the bad guys or driven insane, like Kye\u2019s sister, we didn\u2019t have a long life expectancy. Being a spirit walker didn\u2019t come with a lot of perks.</p><p>With so many ugly emotions bearing down on me, how long would it be before they left permanent damage? My future would always be up in the air and that frightened me.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d</p><p>I looked up from the floor, my thoughts vanishing. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did a great job, why do you look like a house fell on your sister?\u201d</p><p>I snorted at Dorian\u2019s Wizard of Oz reference. In many ways, I could relate to him. He was death, after all. He knew all the emotions doing this caused. Fiona and Aiden didn\u2019t. It was nice I\u2019d found someone this side of me could to relate to, but he didn\u2019t understand the other half that was fearful of my gift. Or the part of me that wanted to return to Flora and run my shop like any other normal, red-blooded supernatural. I yearned for normalcy and tonight the revelation I would never be normal again was a sucker punch to the gut.</p><p>\u201cJust taking it all in,\u201d I told him and eyed the ghosts still hovering in my room. Their eyes were glued to me, their bodies still and lifeless. They were dressed in an array of different period clothing. Some wore eighteenth century garb while others wore more modern clothing. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do with them?\u201d I nodded towards the spirits.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re at your command. You won\u2019t need them until you guys go to war.\u201d Dorian pulled another tube of blood from the rack.</p><p>\u201cAt my command?\u201d I asked incredulously. \u201cI can control them?\u201d The news just got better and better. Controlling an army of ghosts wasn\u2019t my idea of cool tricks. \u201cIsn\u2019t this wrong? Shouldn\u2019t they be enjoying their afterlife in heaven, rather than being earthbound and controlled?\u201d</p><p>Dorian laughed. \u201cWhat a human thing to say. Heaven and Hell are subjective, Gwen. Do you think if you\u2019re good, you go to a place guarded by pearly gates? And Hell is a fiery pit below the earth?\u201d</p><p>I stared dumbfounded. The devil existed, vampires originated from him. Although I didn\u2019t have proof of God, I believed He existed too. They were sort like yin and yang, good versus evil. They balanced the world.</p><p>\u201cHeaven and Hell aren\u2019t as pronounced as humans make them out to be. Yes, if you\u2019re a good person then your afterlife will be good. And if you\u2019re a bad person, your afterlife will be hellish. But they exist within the ghostly realm, parallel to the human world, not a mystical place. If these ghosts are still holding a grudge towards the vampires who killed them, then don\u2019t you think we\u2019re doing them a favor by giving them a chance for justice? They\u2019ll return to their afterlives as soon as our mission is complete, no worse for wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are their lives horrible if they aren\u2019t in the Hell I imagine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of someone sinister, someone who\u2019s done all the horrible things you can imagine. Now imagine what it would be like to feel every single emotion of the people they\u2019ve wronged. That\u2019s how it is for them all the time, and it eventually will drive them insane. Can you envision an eternity of insanity? Plus, demons terrorize them just for the fun of it. They may not be dancing on hot coals, but they are in Hell.\u201d</p><p>Can you envision an eternity of insanity? Replayed over and over again in my mind. Perhaps an omen, or just my paranoia getting to me, either way, it was like a broken record in my head.</p><p>After a few moments of torturing myself with Dorian\u2019s words, I looked up. \u201cWhat about heaven? What\u2019s it like? Do we meet God when we die?\u201d I was brought up in a religious family; my curiosity of how the legends of Heaven and Hell were different than the reality kept me from focusing on anything else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dorian released an annoyed breath. \u201cHeaven is the opposite of hell. You live all your greatest moments with the ones you love. There\u2019s never any sadness or heartache, everything is peachy. As for God and the devil, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never met either one of them; they\u2019re reclusive\u2014even to us. I guess you\u2019ll find out when you die. Now, can we get back on track?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re an angel, the Angel of Death no less,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying God doesn\u2019t exist, I\u2019m just saying I\u2019ve never met him. Now can you please focus?\u201d</p> <p>Questions flooded my mind and just as I opened my mouth to ask another, Dorian held up his hand and shook his head. My mouth snapped shut, and I took the vial of blood he handed me. The rest of the night was spent summoning ghosts and ordering them to stalk their murderers. As soon as they\u2019d form and get their orders from me, they\u2019d vanish. It was a bit disconcerting to know a battalion of spirits was lingering and waiting at the ready, even more so that it was me they were connected to.</p><p>10</p><p>Morning came way too fast. With groggy eyes and a pounding headache, I stepped out of bed. The alarm clock screamed from my dresser. It felt like I hadn\u2019t gotten any sleep.</p><p>As I stumbled over to put the alarm clock out of its misery, I tripped over something hard. \u201cOw! Son of a bitch!\u201d I hopped up and down on one foot and cradled my toes in my hand to ease the pain.</p><p>\u201cYou have a filthy mouth in the morning.\u201d My useless hopping stopped, and I looked down at where the voice came from. Dorian was lying on his side, clad in nothing more than black boxer briefs. The pain in my toe forgotten, my mouth fell open and my eyes shot wide. Every square inch of Dorian\u2019s body was chiseled. Even his legs were toned, like he spent hours doing squats just for the hell of it.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing on my floor? And why are you naked?\u201d I pulled my eyes away from his bare skin and focused on the antique, woven rug beneath my feet. Come to think of it, I didn\u2019t remember falling asleep last night. The last clear image I had of the previous night, I was sitting on the floor with Dorian summoning ghosts. How did I get in my bed?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d appreciate it if I climbed in bed with you. Was I mistaken?\u201d He lifted himself off the floor so all six feet two inches was standing a couple feet from me.</p><p>\u201cNo, you were right. I would\u2019ve kicked your ass if you\u2019d gotten into my bed.\u201d My eyes traced the patterns on the rug, but when Dorian laughed, I looked up. He bent down and grabbed for his jeans, giving me a full view of his backside. The alarm clock still demanded attention, so with my growing frustration, I stomped towards it and slammed my hand down to shut it off.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you naked?\u201d My voice sounded panicked. Taking a couple deep breaths calmed me minimally. \u201cAnd how did I get into bed?\u201d</p><p>The amusement on Dorian\u2019s face was annoying as hell. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable to sleep in jeans, and I put you in your bed. I didn\u2019t take you for a shy girl.\u201d His eyes raked over me, his gaze too personal for my liking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not shy, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should be sleeping in my bedroom, naked no less. I have a boyfriend, one who I love very much! So if you thought you\u2019d get me all hot and bothered by seeing your sexy body, then you were wrong!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think my body is sexy, huh?\u201d</p><p>Damn, had I said that? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Dorian snorted at my lame attempt to cover my ass. \u201cYou\u2019re boyfriend, the vampire? The one you told Holly you weren\u2019t seeing anymore?\u201d</p><p>Double damn.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>Three rapid knocks pounded on my door. \u201cGwen? Are you awake? We have training and should\u2019ve been there like five minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Three things happened at once. One, I realized it was Fiona on the other side of my door. Two, the handle was turning and at any moment she\u2019d open my door. And three, the one that freaked me out the most, Fiona would see Dorian dressed in his jeans and come to the conclusion we\u2019d slept together. I\u2019d be interrogated about it for days, maybe months.</p><p>My tongue stumbled over words. I tried to tell her to stop, but before I got the first stammer out, she stepped into my bedroom. Her eyebrows arched in surprise at the scene and a knowing smirk lifted the side of her mouth. My hand went to my forehead, my headache growing more intense.</p> <p>\u201cSorry to interrupt.\u201d She held two coffee cups in her hand. Walking over to me, she held one out, her eyes glued to Dorian\u2019s bare chest. I grabbed it and took a big gulp, burning my tongue in the process.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what it looks like, Fiona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure it isn\u2019t.\u201d Her tone was less than convincing. As soon as we were away from Dorian the grilling would begin.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, he just slept in here.\u201d I turned to Dorian and said, \u201cTell her. Otherwise, I\u2019ll never hear the end of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just slept in here,\u201d Dorian said with a smirk I wanted to slap off of his face. They both laughed like this was all a joke while I grumbled to myself.</p><p>\u201cGive me five minutes to change.\u201d I told Fiona and then pointed a finger at Dorian. \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and snorted walking towards the door, but before he could leave, I snatched up his shirt and threw it at him.</p><p>Fiona mouthed the word, \u201cHot\u201d while his back was turned.</p><p>As far as days went, this one already sucked.</p><p>Ten minutes later I rushed downstairs and towards the ball room. Fiona stood off to the side with Ethan but rushed towards me when I walked in. Patrick, a fighter specialist on the council, was speaking at the front of the room while rows and rows of witches and warlocks stood in perfect lines. The castle turned into a military base overnight.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Fiona leaned towards me while we faced forward, pretending to listen to Patrick. Her tone begged for details of my night spent with the Angel of Death.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I pretended to not know what she was talking about.</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d Even whispering, I could tell how giddy she was for the details.</p><p>\u201cNothing happened.\u201d I bit out. It annoyed me she thought I was that kind of girl, especially when she knew I was dating Aiden.</p><p>\u201cHe was pretty much naked, Gwen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sleeps naked!\u201d I shrieked.</p><p>Patrick stopped talking and every head in the room turned towards Fiona and I. Oops, perhaps a bit louder than I intended. She giggled next to me while I wished the floor would swallow me whole.</p><p>\u201cGwen Sparks, up front,\u201d Patrick ordered.</p><p>My stomach plummeted. It was like I was in junior high all over again\u2014would he have me write my name on the chalkboard? With angry footsteps, I stomped up to the front of the room. Patrick looked like a general you\u2019d find at any army base; shaved blonde hair, square face, brown eyes, and muscles that tried to escape his shirt. Once I was standing in front of him, he crossed the tree limbs he called arms and glared at me.</p><p>This is ridiculous I\u2019m twenty-six years old! Why do I feel like I\u2019m twelve?</p><p>\u201cAs much as everyone is interested in finding out who \u2018sleeps naked\u2019, I will not tolerate you disrupting the class. You will be my partner to demonstrate the lesson today.\u201d Patrick\u2019s face was hard and the caterpillars he called eyebrows, pulled together as he scowled. Fiona giggled a few rows back, but she covered it as a fake cough; the strong urge to use magic to tie her shoelaces together teased my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cToday we will be practicing three different maneuvers,\u201d Patrick continued, addressing the room again. \u201cThe first will demonstrate what to do if you\u2019re being attacked. You will pair off. One will be the attacker and the other the victim.\u201d</p><p>I bet I can guess which one I\u2019ll play.</p><p>\u201cGwen, you will play the victim, and I\u2019ll attack you.\u201d</p><p>Ding, ding, ding! What do I win, Johnny?</p><p>While I was having a sarcastic conversation in my head, Patrick disappeared. Everyone\u2019s head swiveled in different directions as they looked for where he went. As his intended victim, I was scared. Patrick wasn\u2019t the type to pull punches. Being made an example out of at seven in the morning was a bitch.</p><p>Air whooshed behind me. I turned too late and was knocked across the padded practice mats\u2014hard. I lay on the pad for a few seconds as I regained my breathing. Patrick stood over me with a satisfied smirk.</p><p>\u201cYou always have to be aware of your surroundings people. Vampires are quick and stealth; you won\u2019t see them coming.\u201d He offered a hand to help me up, but I ignored it and stood on my own. Patrick snorted at my childish snub and continued to speak to his soldiers. \u201cSo how do you anticipate a vampire if you can\u2019t see them?\u201d</p><p>A few hands rose in the air, mainly woman who cared more about getting his attention than getting the answer right. He was cute, if you liked the \u201cI\u2019m Tarzan, you Jane\u201d attitude. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he used a club to hit woman over the head and dragged them back to his cave.</p><p>\u201cWe could use a beckoning spell so vampires are always on our radar,\u201d one woman said. \u201cYou know, because that way they couldn\u2019t hide from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that spell also make it so we were on their radar?\u201d Patrick asked.</p><p>The woman\u2019s cheeks turned a nice shade of red. \u201cYeah, I guess it would.\u201d</p><p>More hands rose in the air, but he ignored them and turned towards me instead.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how to spot a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re the ones with the fangs?\u201d A few people laughed at my sarcasm, but Patrick didn\u2019t look amused.</p><p>\u201cGive me ten,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cTen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPushups.\u201d</p><p>Ah hell. \u201cSeriously?\u201d Someone needed to tell this dude we weren\u2019t on an army base.</p><p>Patrick nodded as he held his arms behind his back. I could tell by the look on his face he didn\u2019t think I could do one pushup let alone ten. I loved proving people wrong, so I knelt on the mat and straighten my body to begin my punishment. The first six were easy peasy, but after that, the muscles in my arms screamed in protest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan you answer the question yet?\u201d Patrick barked at me.</p><p>\u201cYou....hear....them....move,\u201d I said between lifts. I finished my last pushup and stood, feigning indifference instead of exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cMs. Sparks is correct. Although vampires can move like the wind, you can still hear them, if you pay attention to your surroundings.\u201d</p> <p>Yay, gold star for me!</p><p>\u201cI want the front row to stay where you are, the rest of the rows take a step back.\u201d The obedient people did as he said so they were all spaced a little further apart. \u201cNow, close your eyes and listen as I run through the rows.\u201d</p><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes closed and he disappeared again. Now that I was paying attention, I could see the blur that was Patrick as he rushed through each row. There wasn\u2019t much of noise, but a small breeze stirred the air and the lightest whooshing sound echoed through the cavernous ball room.</p><p>When he was done with his example, he appeared right next to me. \u201cOpen your eyes,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cWhat did you hear?\u201d He pointed at a man towards the back.</p><p>\u201cWind,\u201d the man said.</p> <p>\u201cVery good. Raise your hand if you heard it as well.\u201d The majority of hands rose while some looked uncertain.</p><p>\u201cThose of you who did not hear me coming would be dead right now if I was a hungry vampire. So, today we will be working on heightening your senses. If the enemy gets the drop on you then magic is useless. Once their fangs sink into your throat you\u2019re dead. Got it?\u201d Heads nodded with seriousness across the room. \u201cBreak into pairs.\u201d</p><p>After everyone was paired, Patrick got to work to turning me into his own personal practice dummy. We began with my back turned while he snuck up on me, and I said if he was to my left or right.</p><p>Next, the physical contact began as he attacked from behind me. If I wasn\u2019t quick enough, he\u2019d push me to the mats and declared me \u201cdead\u201d. Patrick insisted we try it over and over until I won more times than I lost. I was pretty sure tomorrow morning I\u2019d have some nasty bruises coloring my entire body.</p><p>Exercise three included magical maneuvers to freeze our attackers in place so we could walk right up to them and shred their hearts or slice off their heads\u2014luckily, Patrick used a prop sword for this lesson. It was disconcerting to see how accurate the soldiers were with their weapons. Every time someone would slice off a dummy\u2019s head, I pictured it being Aiden. It made me wonder how many innocents they would kill because of what the guilty vampires were doing.</p><p>After a grueling three hours of training, we finally got an hour break. Most of the witches and warlocks headed for the kitchen, but I had more work to do. Heading up the stone steps, my muscles burned with fury. After climbing six flights of stairs, my legs were nearly rubber and wobbled to hold up my weight.</p> <p>I knocked on Miranda\u2019s office door while I let the stone wall support some of my weight. The coolness of the stone felt good on my sweaty face. Miranda was a member of the council, but she handled the financial side of things. I needed to talk to someone level-headed and not someone who had war on the brain. Holly and Patrick wouldn\u2019t listen, and Charles didn\u2019t seem to have an opinion either way. My only hope of ending this before it started was to find a council member who would listen to reason.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Miranda called.</p><p>With my last bit of energy, I opened the door and flopped into one of the office chairs. Miranda was very tall and lanky. Her short, blonde hair was cut in a bob that framed her long face and her green eyes looked at me with surprise.</p><p>\u201cMs. Sparks, what can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry for my appearance, I just got done training with Patrick.\u201d Sweat caked hair stuck to my head while the smell of sweat clung to me.</p><p>A smile lifted Miranda\u2019s mouth up and a sparkle lit her eyes. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s a tough cookie, huh?\u201d</p><p>My eye caught the gleam of a diamond ring on her left hand and the way she lit up when I mentioned the drill sergeant\u2019s name. \u201cForgive me for assuming, but are you and Patrick married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost six months now, why?\u201d She twirled the ring around her finger, the look of happiness was almost enough to make me throw up. I couldn\u2019t imagine Patrick making any woman as happy as she looked.</p> <p>\u201cNo reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re visiting me, to find out about my love life?\u201d she joked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I sorta have some good news; well, I think it\u2019s good news.\u201d</p><p>Miranda sat back in her chair, interest was evident on her face.</p><p>\u201cThe Vampire Council wants to have a meeting with you guys about ending the war.\u201d I sat up and leaned my elbows on my knees. I\u2019d practiced this conversation a million times in my head with each one of the council members. For some reason, Miranda took it the easiest. I hoped the imaginary discussion was a sign of things to come.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you speaking to me about this? Shouldn\u2019t you bring it to Holly or Charles?\u201d</p><p>She was right, I should have been discussing it with them, but Holly was bloodthirsty and Charles tended to be lazy when it came to his job, neither one of them would like the news. \u201cYes, but everyone around here is a little crazy. I thought you\u2019d handle the news better,\u201d I told her. If the council was leery about meeting with the VC, I couldn\u2019t blame them. The VC hadn\u2019t done much to stop the killing of witches. Hell, for all I knew, the VC was encouraging the use of brew.</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought I could convince them to meet, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You seem like the most level-headed one around here. Everyone else lives and sleeps war. To me, if the VC is willing to wave a white flag and end the war before more people are killed, then what\u2019s the harm in meeting with them. It would save a lot of lives.\u201d</p><p>While most of the witches and warlocks were learning how to fight, a lot would still die. I hoped saving lives would encourage the NAWC to meet with the vampires.</p><p>\u201cIt would be wonderful if we could stop the madness and a meeting wouldn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Miranda thought for a moment, her eyes darting to her wedding ring. Her thoughts were so transparent they might as well have been written on her forehead. If we didn\u2019t go to war, Patrick wouldn\u2019t go to war. The new bride didn\u2019t want to become a widow. \u201cI\u2019ll speak with the council, and we\u2019ll vote on it.\u201d</p><p>A smile spread across my face in hopes that everything could go back to normal. I stood and walked to the door. \u201cThank you, Miranda.\u201d When I turned to open the door, she stopped me with the one question I wasn\u2019t ready to answer.</p><p>\u201cMs. Sparks, how is it you found out about the VC wanting to meet?\u201d Her lips pressed into a thin smile, and her eyes glinted with knowledge. It was obvious she knew who my informant was.</p><p>\u201cAiden Blake and I used to date. We\u2019re still friends so he called me last night to tell me about it.\u201d I looked up from the floor hoping she\u2019d bought my story, but her smile widened.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t choose who we love, can we, Ms. Sparks?\u201d I hoped the question was rhetorical because I couldn\u2019t speak. Lying to the council was a major no-no, and Miranda just called me on it. \u201cHave a good day. I\u2019ll speak with Holly and the others about the meeting.\u201d</p><p>Three hours later, I was finally done training. Patrick had a field day busting my ass and laughing when I missed a step and fell flat on my face. Jerk.</p><p>The hot water pounded on my back and felt like heaven. I closed my eyes and absorbed the steam from the shower. It\u2019d take a few layers of soap to eradicate the sweat from my body. Small purplish bruises were on my legs and arms.</p><p>My cell phone chimed from the sink, grumbling I climbed out of the shower. Using the pad of my finger, I wiped away the fog on the display. Just the man I wanted to talk to.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening, my Gwen,\u201d Aiden replied, his voice as smooth as milk chocolate. \u201cAre you free tonight?\u201d It was amazing that just the sound of his voice could make me forget about the horrible day.</p><p>\u201cYes, what do you have in mind?\u201d My voice lowered as I imagined spending the night with my legs wrapped around Aiden\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cTake a cab to Thorn. I\u2019ll be waiting,\u201d he said mysteriously and then hung up.</p><p>Flipping my phone closed, I dried off and got to work at picking out an outfit. I didn\u2019t bring sexy clothes to Moon, so magic would have to do. Imagining a sexy black cocktail dress, I willed it to form around my naked body. Fabric climbed up my skin, connecting and forming into a dress worthy of a double look. A deep V-neck plunged just below my breasts and the skirt hit a few inches below my butt.</p><p>The nasty bruises weren\u2019t the accessories I was hoping for. Running my palm down one arm, I used magic to hide them. As my hand passed over the discolored blotches, they disappeared. I repeated the process on my other arm and legs. The dressed looked a lot better without the ugly purple spots decorating my skin.</p><p>Staring in the mirror, I envisioned my hair dry. Within seconds, it didn\u2019t hold an ounce of moisture. Next, I got to work at styling it. A section of my hair was lifted up and twisted as if around an invisible curling iron and then released into loose curls. While my hair was being magically styled, I got to work at putting makeup on. With two fingers, I swiped across my eyelids, leaving my eyes with a smoky effect. The lipstick traced my lips in a wine colored gloss and the blush brush caressed my cheeks with a soft pink. I put mascara on myself, not trusting a magically altered, makeup wand that close to my eyes.</p><p>Once I was happy with everything, I stared into the mirror. My blue eyes were bright and my hair was tousled and curled into perfection. I had no clue where I was meeting Aiden, or if I was overdressed, and I didn\u2019t care. When he saw me, it wouldn\u2019t be long before we retired to his hotel room.</p><p>Aura curled around my legs, an icy sensation crawling up my calf. My body shivered against the cold. The feeling was something I was coming to recognize as death. When Dorian took me to the bar and told me to concentrate on the underlying feeling of death from the patrons, I felt it like an artic chill. Aura emanated the same feeling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bending down, I picked up my black Persian. As soon as my hands made contact with her long black fur, they cramped against the coldness of her body. I was frozen with shock. Aura was a spirit of a witch who, when killed, was transformed into a cat to act as a familiar. Perhaps, I was honing in on my spirit walker skills easier now that I knew what to look for. The coldness from my cat had to be the spirit I was feeling.</p><p>Aura watched me with large green eyes. Her whiskers twitched from side to side, and her ears perked up like she was alert to something I wasn\u2019t. Although scared, I petted her, hoping the action would calm us both. But with each stroke, my hand fell further and further into the long black fur. I shrieked when my hand disappeared all the way through the middle of her. Stumbling backwards, I dropped my cat as fear wound its way through my entire body.</p><p>Aura\u2019s body lay on the tile floor unmoving. My eyes were glued to her small black form. I\u2019d just killed my cat. Tears stung my eyes and blurred my vision. My hands fisted at my side as I stared at what I had done.</p><p>Pin pricks shot through my left limb causing me to cry out in pain. Holding my arm out in front of me, a glowing light was clasped in my fist and shining through my fingers. I opened my hand. The pulsating light hovered just above my palm and then grew longer and wider. I backed against the wall as far as I could and watched in awe as the light formed into what looked like a humanoid shape. The luminescent figure stood in front of me, with almond shaped eyes and hair as black as a raven. A thin cotton dress hung from her shoulders and pooled at her feet. This spirit was different than the others I\u2019d encountered. Serenity surrounded her aura and filled the room with peace that put me at ease.</p> <p>\u201cAre you an angel?\u201d My words heavy on my tongue as I fought the weight of the calming effect she had. My entire body relaxed and my eyelids grew heavier the longer she stood in front of me.</p><p>\u201cNo, my dear, I am not.\u201d Her voice was melodic and more beautiful than music. A sweet smile spread across her pink lips as she watched me. With more grace than a ballerina, she bent down and scooped Aura\u2019s lifeless body up. \u201cYou have been very good to me, Gwen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAura?\u201d I breathed with disbelief. The ghost nodded and placed her hand over the cat\u2019s body. With each stroke of fur, a radiant light outlined the unmoving form. The tail twitched and then the ears flicked this way and that. Within moments the cat\u2019s head lifted and looked at me with confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need me anymore, Gwen,\u201d Aura said, handing the cat to me. \u201cBut a witch should never be without a cat.\u201d I took the feline from her arms and frowned when I didn\u2019t feel the connection. Aura\u2019s spirit was no longer in the cat, something that not only saddened me, but made me feel like something within me was missing. The bond I shared with her was something I was accustom to, not having it would take a while to get used to.</p><p>\u201cBut, I do need you,\u201d I pleaded.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sad. You\u2019ve released me from my prison and for that, I\u2019ll be forever grateful.\u201d Aura\u2019s spirit faltered and she vanished just like that. The peace from her presence was gone too. My new/old cat looked at me, its eyes curious as to who I was. It still looked like the same, long black fur, big green eyes, smashed nose, but it was like I was looking at a new cat.</p><p>My hand rested on its back, and I dragged my palm down the length of it. Soft purrs vibrated against my skin, but it lacked the energy I felt when Aura\u2019s spirit was in there.</p><p>I stood in the bathroom for a long while thinking about what I did. You\u2019ve released me from my prison. Her last words nagged my mind. What did that mean? I\u2019d always assumed witches made a choice whether they wanted to become a familiar after their deaths, like a human deciding if they want to be an organ donor or donated to science. Who imprisoned her and why?</p><p>I had to find Dorian; he\u2019d know what happened. I fixed my tear streaked mascara and rushed out of my room. The castle was busy with various activities. Some groups were practicing more maneuvers, while others studied maps. Shaking my head in frustration, I continued to check rooms for Dorian. Where did an Angel of Death hang out?</p><p>Making my way down another hallway, Kye was just ahead of me. \u201cKye!\u201d He turned around as I jogged to catch up. \u201cHave you seen Dorian?\u201d His eyes looked bloodshot like he hadn\u2019t slept. I guess being Holly\u2019s go to man was exhausting.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s in a meeting with Holly. What do you need?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just need to ask him something, thanks, Kye!\u201d I turned around and rushed up the stone staircase to the sixth floor. Kye was growing on me, but that didn\u2019t mean I trusted him, not that I trusted Dorian either, but he didn\u2019t share the same allegiance to Holly as Kye.</p><p>I was about to knock on Holly\u2019s office door when I heard my name from behind it. Pausing, I leaned my ear against the wood and listened.</p><p>\u201cHas she asked questions?\u201d Holly\u2019s voice carried through.</p><p>\u201cJust about her power,\u201d Dorian replied.</p><p>What the hell were they talking about?</p><p>\u201cGood. Make sure you strengthen her power and leave the rest to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>Creaking footsteps approached, and I rushed back downstairs so I wouldn\u2019t be caught. Questions bombarded my mind as I replayed their cryptic conversation in my mind. Maybe Dorian did share Kye\u2019s allegiance to Holly.</p> <p>I made it to the third floor before I needed to stop and breathe. It was lucky I hadn\u2019t tumbled down the stone steps in my haste. Leaning against the cool wall, I inhaled deep breaths through my mouth and exhaled through my nose, but it did little to calm my sporadic heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d Dorian asked from the landing. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was looking for you.\u201d My voice came out a little breathy.</p><p>His left eye squinted in suspicion. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed my cat.\u201d With the words, I remembered the original reason I sought Dorian. Whatever he and Holly were talking about could wait, I needed answers about Aura.</p><p>He paused for a moment. \u201cWhat do you mean you killed your cat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, I picked her up, and my hand fell through her\u2014literally! And somehow I pulled her spirit from her body. I mean the witch\u2019s spirit occupying the cat\u2019s body.\u201d The more I listened to myself, the more I sounded crazy. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me?\u201d</p><p>Dorian walked down the steps and placed his hand on my shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s discuss this in private.\u201d Being around him was even more nerve-racking now. It seemed everyone was keeping some sort of secret, and they all involved me.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Turning, I jogged down the stairs and stopped at my room, it was the only place that\u2019d offer privacy. Opening the door, I ushered Dorian inside and stepped in behind him. My eyes flicked to my new cat and sadness clung heavily to my heart.</p><p>Dorian walked over to the cat curled up in the chair and picked her up. He snorted and set the cat back down. \u201cIt\u2019s just a regular cat now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what I told you?\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cHad to make sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean? Am I going to kill people if I touch them?\u201d Dorian busted out laughing causing my temper to seethe.</p><p>\u201cWill you be serious? I just lost a friend!\u201d He may have trouble seeing how a cat could be considered a friend, but I didn\u2019t just lose a cat, I lost a friend, even if that friend was a ghost. The connection was gone, she was gone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He smiled. \u201cNo, you will not kill anyone if you touch them. Aura\u2019s soul was in a body that didn\u2019t belong to her, therefore you were able to reach in and grab it. Everyone else you know, their souls are connected with their bodies, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say? Your power is growing just like you were told. Spirit walkers don\u2019t just talk to spirits, Gwen, they can do many things.\u201d He crossed his arms while his eyes roamed over me. \u201cYou look very beautiful tonight.\u201d</p><p>In my rush to find answers, I\u2019d forgotten I was dressed in a very skimpy dress. The way Dorian\u2019s eyes traveled the length of my body said he didn\u2019t mind one bit.</p><p>His mouth opened and his tongue darted out to roll over his upper lip. His gray eyes darkened as the swirling clouds picked up in speed. I was very aware of my body with his admiring gaze on it. The dress was tight around my breast, causing a good amount of cleavage to spill out. And the length of the dress showcased a good portion of my legs, which was where Dorian\u2019s eyes were currently devouring.</p><p>\u201cA little overdressed for training, but I don\u2019t mind,\u201d he replied, his voice soft and filled with desire.</p><p>\u201cI have plans tonight, I\u2019m not training,\u201d I said in a quiet tone. We finished summoning the ghosts from the vampire blood, so he couldn\u2019t use that as an excuse.</p><p>\u201cThe deal was, you train with your kind and then with me every other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, and today I trained with my kind, so we\u2019re not supposed to train until tomorrow.\u201d I smiled at throwing his logic back in his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d he said as he tapped his chin. \u201cYou\u2019re meeting the vampire?\u201d</p><p>Dorian knowing about my ongoing relationship with Aiden was dangerous, especially now that I knew he was in cahoots with Holly about something having to do with me. What would Holly do if she found out I betrayed her by sneaking behind her back to see Aiden? The thought was daunting, but I wouldn\u2019t allow her or Dorian to control every aspect of my life.</p><p>\u201cYes, and if you wanna run off and tell Holly, then do it. I\u2019m a grown ass woman and will date whoever I want.\u201d The words seemed more mature in my mind than they sounded to my ears.</p><p>Dorian smiled and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a lion dating a gazelle. How long before the lion can\u2019t refuse his cravings and tears into the gazelle\u2019s neck?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot all vampires are bad!\u201d I should have become an activist for vampire rights after all the defending I did on their behalf.</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope that doesn\u2019t come back and bite you in the ass\u2014or throat for that matter.\u201d</p><p>My phone chirped, taking my attention away from Dorian. A text message from Aiden reminded me I was late. I ignored Dorian\u2019s comment; Aiden would never hurt me. Tonight we\u2019d enjoy each other\u2019s company and have great sex. All would be right in the world, at least until I came back down to reality in the morning.</p> <p>11</p><p>I stepped out of the cab and eyed the red sign that read \u2018Thorn\u2019 in black letters with a black thorny vine framing the title. A few patrons stood in a line waiting their turn to enter. Most were dressed a lot more casual than me. The men wore jeans or slacks and either t-shirts or polo\u2019s. Some of the women were dressed in skimpy skirts and tops, but most were in jeans and halter tops or tank tops.</p><p>I walked down the concrete steps, eyes twitching to the left and right, to a red door that had \u2018Thorn\u2019 written in calligraphy, across the middle.</p><p>A tall, thin woman dressed in skin tight leather pants and a shirt that barely covered her breasts, stood guard. Her washboard stomach didn\u2019t hold an ounce of fat and her bored expression never faltered.</p><p>\u201cI.D,\u201d she said. I knew right away she was a vampire, her energy projected off of her like a smack in the face.</p> <p>Rifling through my purse, I dug out my license and handed it to her. The woman\u2019s eyes scanned the thin plastic card and then her body tensed up. \u201cYou a witch?\u201d</p><p>Damn. When the supernatural revelation happened in the 80\u2019s, the humans required that all of our licenses state our species. Witch was in thick black letters right under my name\u2014something I never thought of as dangerous, until now.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d I kept my voice calm, but inside I worried whether she\u2019d attack me right now or at least wait until I was behind closed doors. \u201cI\u2019m here to meet Aiden Blake.\u201d I hoped mentioning his name would buy me enough time to find him before they rang the dinner bell.</p><p>She returned my license and with a nod of her head, motioned me inside. My feet stayed glued to the ground as I eyed the red door. Shrugging off my fear, I curled my fingers around the handle and stepped inside.</p><p>The lighting was minimal, except for the dance floor which glowed with what looked like black lights. Silhouettes of bodies broke through the darkness as my eyes adjusted. Bass beat against my body. The DJ stood on an upraised platform, his hand raised in the air while his head bobbed to the music.</p><p>One thing I noticed upon entering was the fact that the air vibrated with energy. As I watched the movements of the clubbers, I realized why. Thorn was full of vampires. Why did Aiden pick a place like this? It was like chumming the ocean for sharks and I was main course.</p> <p>Making my way further inside, I walked around the club trying to find Aiden. The vampires watched me. I knew they could smell I wasn\u2019t a vampire, but the looks they gave me resembled fear rather than hunger. Strange.</p><p>Dancers moved their bodies in perfect unison to the rhythm. Watching vampires dance was like watching a gracefully choreographed ballet. The precision of their movements was breathtaking, even when dancing to hip hop.</p><p>I paused next to the dance floor watching the beauty of the their moves when arms slipped around my waist. I didn\u2019t need to see his face to know it was Aiden, his energy sizzled around me like a security blanket.</p><p>With a quick movement, he spun me around, and I snickered at his outfit. Aiden\u2019s normal attire consisted of dress pants of some sort and a button down shirt, but not tonight. Tonight he was dressed in jeans and a white tank top that hugged his toned chest and stomach. His hair was slicked back, but a few black strands escaped and hung over his eyes.</p><p>He snaked a hand around my neck to tangle in my hair and directed me closer for a knee weakening kiss. His tongue teased mine deliberately, causing ripples of excitement to burst throughout my body.</p><p>When he ended the kiss, he took my hand and led me onto the dance floor. I followed behind him as we made our way through the congested crowd. Aiden raised a hand to the DJ and the current beat was replaced with Usher\u2019s There Goes My Baby. His hand wrapped around my waist and drew me toward him, a sexy glint in his blue eyes. Our bodies began to move in sync, our lower regions rubbing against each other as we lost ourselves in the music.</p><p>We rocked and swayed, hands on each other bodies, pure hunger evident in our eyes. Towards the end of the song, Aiden leaned in for another kiss while the surrounding couples gyrated against us. Their touches were like an erotic fire driving my desire over the top. The entire atmosphere changed from fun to sensual. Lava filled my veins spreading within me like one long, delightful caress as I watched the men and woman dance suggestively against each other.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d Aiden leaned in to whisper in my ear. I nodded and followed him through the throng of people. A sitting area was off to the right where couples cuddled and made out. Off to the left were privacy rooms, something almost every vampire club had so they could feed or screw in discretion. The thing about vampires was their libidos were almost as powerful as their inhuman strength. Aiden mentioned how drinking human blood was a sort of aphrodisiac, it heightened all of their senses.</p> <p>Aiden told the bartender our drink orders and then focused on my outfit, his eyes running up and down me. \u201cYou look breathtaking, my Gwen.\u201d His hand rested around my waist but trailed down to cup my ass. I should have been embarrassed about our little intimate dance and the show of PDA, but the club had a way of making you not give a shit about all the insecurities you\u2019d normally feel.</p><p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d I began as I allowed my eyes to roam over his casual clothes. \u201cLook like a sexy bad boy.\u201d A smile spread across my lips as his mouth lifted into a grin.</p><p>The bartender slid our drinks to us, and Aiden threw cash on the bar. Taking our drinks, we made our way over to a corner booth. The seats were covered in what looked like velvet. Black lights hid behind the molding, bathing us in the same eerie glow as the dance floor.</p><p>I settled in close to Aiden and lifted my glass to my lips. The mojito was crisp, the mint perfectly balanced with the rum. \u201cSo, this wasn\u2019t exactly the place I was expecting. Isn\u2019t it a little dangerous for a witch to be hanging out in a vampire club?\u201d I set my glass down and looked up at my vampire. His eyes were focused on something across the way, but at my question, he looked back at me.</p><p>\u201cThose sorts of vampires are not allowed in Thorn. Not all of us are bloodthirsty monsters, Gwen.\u201d I frowned at his tone but understood the emotion. I\u2019d been complaining about my safety and looking at the war from only the witch side. The truth was, innocent vampires were in just as much danger.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m sure most of the vampires here are more afraid of you than you are of them. Most are young and aren\u2019t looking for the kind of trouble that will end up getting them killed.\u201d Aiden lifted his glass filled with a dark red liquid and took a long drink.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said to draw his attention towards me. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything by my comment, it\u2019s just\u2014things are fragile right now.\u201d</p><p>His hand grasped mine as he leaned in to kiss my forehead. \u201cI know, my Gwen.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cI thought you deserved a night of fun. I can\u2019t imagine what the NAWC has been putting you through, so tonight, no talk of war or brew. Tonight it\u2019s you and me, a normal couple in a club enjoying each other\u2019s company.\u201d</p><p>I smiled wide. \u201cThat\u2019s the best idea I\u2019ve heard all month.\u201d</p><p>With a quick motion, Aiden lifted me onto his lap. My legs straddled either side of him while his hands roamed up the length of my body. The lighting in the club gave the illusion of privacy, but the vampires would be able to see what we were doing, and I didn\u2019t care. Various couples were in the process of the same thing.</p><p>Leaning down, I brought my lips to Aiden\u2019s. I freed my mind of any anxiety I had with PDA and just focused on him. His energy buzzed to life and wrapped around me, my flesh sizzled with want.</p><p>My dress inched further up my thighs as his hands traveled over my legs. With a frustrated moan, I eased his hands back down and fixed my dress. I guess not all inhibitions had been thrown out the window. I didn\u2019t mind straddling him and making out, but I wouldn\u2019t expose my ass to a crowd of at least two hundred.</p><p>Aiden chuckled at my shyness, but that didn\u2019t stop him from snaking his hands under the fabric of my dress to cup my ass. The music switched to another slow, sensual song. There was something about the slow beat of an R&amp;B song made me feel sexy. It was like the music guided my movements as the slow, sexy rhythm pumped through my body. From the feel of the hardness between Aiden\u2019s legs, he was enjoying the lap dance as much as I was. At the moment my mind was free. Not a speck of the NAWC, Ian, the war or Dorian occupied my thoughts. I was so enthralled with Aiden I didn\u2019t even worry about the club full of vampires. It was just him and me in the room.</p><p>Aiden scooted out of the booth, with me still on his lap, and made a beeline for the private rooms. When he set me down, we were in a ten by ten room with a couch against the wall. The room was pretty dark except for the ceiling which twinkled with fiber optic lights made to look like stars.</p><p>The lock clicked, and then Aiden was on me. My back hit the wall while his hand gripped my arms above my head. He trailed is nose up my neck, shivers danced across my skin. His lips paused at my ear. \u201cI crave you more than anything, my Gwen.\u201d</p><p>My breathing increased. My chest rose and fell with each labored breath. Aiden trailed a finger down my chest, pausing between my breasts. The anticipation of what he was going to do was like my own personal drug. The intensity of not knowing his next move was erotic and exciting.</p><p>His finger disappeared from my skin, and I frowned. He laughed, and my frown deepened. He could see me as clearly as if the lights were on but I couldn\u2019t see him. \u201cCould you please conjure candles, ice, a blanket and two strips of fabric?\u201d</p><p>My eyebrow arched. \u201cWhy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d he said playfully.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to wait and see. I wanted him to take me now. With an annoyed huff, I concentrated on my magic and conjured the items he listed. Items conjured were never permanent, they eventually would wither into nothingness\u2014nothing was free. I just hoped he\u2019d get around to using them before that happened. Granted those items lasted for at least a day, but I was feeling a bit impatient.</p><p>The flicking of the blanket being spread on the floor echoed in the small room. Without my vision everything seemed more heightened.</p><p>Aiden clasped my hand. \u201cLay on the floor.\u201d</p> <p>I did as I was told and stretched out on the blanket. He got to work at tying each one of my wrist with the strips of fabric to the legs of the sofa. After he was certain my arms weren\u2019t going anywhere, he got up. The ceiling offered little light, but I could make out him bending over and placing the candles around the room.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind lighting these?\u201d</p><p>Closing my eyes, I envisioned the wicks catching on fire. It took a moment, but the room was cast in the glow of firelight. Aiden walked back over to me and knelt between my legs. The look on his face was stunning. His features were a masterpiece of love, desire and respect, everything you\u2019d want to see in the face of your significant other. We stayed for a few moments just staring at each other.</p><p>Aiden snaked a hand around my neck and unbuttoned my dress. With gentle hands, he slowly peeled the black fabric down my body. I eyed the bucket of ice with unease. He leaned over, our lips meeting and parting. The kiss erupted a fire in my stomach. I tried to reach for him, forgetting my arms were bound.</p><p>He leaned back, his hands trailing over my breasts, down my stomach, and lifting my leg. His mouth got to work pressing kisses along my skin. A giggle escaped me\u2014my inner thighs were very ticklish. My laughter caught in my throat when Aiden paused at my center, his breath warm against the dark curls. Ignoring the one spot demanding attention, Aiden focused on covering my other leg in kisses. I groaned in frustration, making Aiden laugh. Living for over six hundred years had given him patience. I, on the other hand, was like a petulant child who wanted it now!</p> <p>\u201cHow about you untie me?\u201d I cooed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very much enjoying the look of you tied up.\u201d His tongue darted out and licked my skin.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I could just use magic to break free.\u201d I lifted my head to look at him.</p><p>\u201cBut you won\u2019t, you\u2019re too curious what I\u2019m going to do next.\u201d</p><p>My head dropped to the floor, and I blew a breath out. He was right, I was curious, but sexual torture had to be the worst/best kind of torture. My body was ready for action the moment we stepped onto the dance floor.</p><p>With slow, calculated movements, Aiden\u2019s hands grasped the bottom of his shirt and tugged it over his head. His chest and stomach were absolute perfection. My eyes devoured his sculpted pecs and traveled lower to his rippling six pack abs.</p> <p>Tearing a strip off his shirt, he tied it around my eyes. \u201cWithout your vision, your other senses will be stronger.\u201d I could just make out the shadow of him once the makeshift blindfold was firmly in place. The thought of what I must look like brought a giggle to my lips. Naked and tied to the legs of a sofa with a torn shirt covering my eyes\u2014priceless.</p><p>My breath caught in my throat when I felt Aiden\u2019s lips on my breasts. His tongue darted out and circled my excited nipple while his hand massaged the other. If he was trying to make me spontaneously combust, he was very close to succeeding.</p><p>Moans escaped my lips while my chest rose and fell in an excited pant. I couldn\u2019t use my hands to touch him, but that didn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t use my legs, maybe that\u2019d excite him enough he\u2019d grow inpatient as well.</p><p>Lifting my legs, I curled them around his waist and gyrated my hips against his erection. A deep grunt echoed through the room while I worked on teasing him into submission. With a hard thrust, Aiden grinded into my center. Sometime during the temptation he removed his jeans, and the thin cotton of his underwear was the only barrier between me and paradise.</p><p>\u201cAiden,\u201d I breathed, hoping calling his name would alert him to my need. My lips lifted into a smile when he released a deep breath. It seemed he was having trouble being patient as well\u2014good.</p><p>\u201cYou tricky minx. How dare you use my weakness for you against me?\u201d Aiden snorted and withdrew from my body. I bit my lip to keep from laughing. I\u2019d come so close.</p><p>\u201cJust for that,\u201d Aiden teased as a cold, wet chunk of ice was trailed down my body, beginning in between my breasts and traveling south. The sensation of the coldness on my hot flesh was a exhilarating. I was sure if I could see, steam would be rising from my skin.</p><p>He withdrew the ice from my body. I choked out a gasp when his mouth continued licking and delving my folds, the ice now in his mouth. My back arched, a moan dancing on my lips as his mouth worked at driving me over the edge. His fingers replaced his tongue, the friction warmed the coolness the ice cube left. I tugged against my restraints as he buried his long fingers within me and wiggled them.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d I moaned as desire built. Just as I was reaching orgasm, he withdrew his fingers. I grumbled in annoyance, finally understanding the term blue balls.</p><p>Two hard knocks sounded on the door. \u201cOccupied,\u201d Aiden called.</p><p>\u201cMr. La\u2019rue would like to speak with you and your companion,\u201d a woman\u2019s voice answered. Aiden closed his eyes and muttered something in Italian. \u201cTell him we\u2019ll be right there.\u201d Whoever this Mr. La\u2019rue was guys was, Aiden didn\u2019t seem happy to see him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make him wait,\u201d the woman warned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked. Aiden untied my blindfold and with a hard pull, ripped the material binding my wrists.</p><p>\u201cAaron La\u2019rue is here and has requested a meeting with us.\u201d His voice sounded almost nervous\u2014Aiden didn\u2019t get nervous easily.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d I sat up and wrapped my arms around my legs. I was more bummed my libido hadn\u2019t been sated than worried about meeting the mysterious interrupter.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on the council,\u201d Aiden paused. \u201cDid you ask Holly about the meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to discuss it. What\u2019s he doing in Washington; I thought the VC was housed in New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, but they\u2019re here to settle things with the witches.\u201d Aiden looked down at me, his eyes raking over my exposed skin. \u201cWhile you look ravishing, you may want to get dressed.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. I didn\u2019t want to get dressed. I wanted to continue where we\u2019d left off and the hell with keeping Mr. La\u2019rue waiting. Deciding I probably wouldn\u2019t get my way, I shimmied back into my dress. \u201cSo, I guess I\u2019ll talk to you later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming with me, Aaron wants to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t want to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGwen, please. He may have information about Ian.\u201d</p><p>That one little sentence changed my mind. Running my fingers through my hair and letting out a grumble, Aiden and I left the little room to find Aaron La\u2019rue.</p><p>12</p><p>Aaron La\u2019rue turned out to be a young boy with jet black hair and a dangerous glint in his brown eyes. He sat with his arms draped across the back of the velvet couch as two women snuggled against him. One of the women had long red hair and matching red bite marks on her neck. Her skin was pale and her eyes had a glazed over expression. The other woman was a dark skinned girl with long wavy black hair and the same dazed look.</p><p>\u201cPlease, sit,\u201d Aaron extended an arm, and a man pulled out a chair for me. Glancing at Aiden to make sure I should, he nodded and I sat on the edge of the chair. Aiden bowed towards the man-boy then took a seat next to me.</p><p>\u201cSo, this is Gwen Sparks?\u201d Aaron asked with a smile that sent chills dancing up my spine. I knew everything I needed to know about him from just being in his presence for ten minutes. He was dangerous.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Aiden replied with a stiff tone.</p><p>Aaron spoke in Italian, to keep me from understanding. Aiden replied in Italian, the words rolling off his tongue like butter. Aiden was from Florence and still had a slight accent, but the time I heard him speak his native tongue was when he was ticked.</p><p>Morte. My head snapped up when the word left Aaron\u2019s lips. I didn\u2019t know a lot of Italian, but I knew that word\u2014death.</p><p>\u201cEgli merita di morire,\u201d Aiden replied.</p><p>\u201cSi, si,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cSorry for our rudeness.\u201d His gaze traveled back to me. Lifting a cocktail glass full of red liquid, he took a slow drink, his eyes watching me over the rim.</p><p>\u201cGwen Sparks, Aiden tells me you wish for us to take care of your bond with Ian Despereaux. Is this true?\u201d He set the glass back on the table, the movement causing one of his groupies to shift uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cAre they okay?\u201d I asked, watching the two women. I didn\u2019t sense anything supernatural about them which meant they were human. A lot of vampires treated humans with acceptable etiquette, but there were those who didn\u2019t. I had a sneaking suspicion Aaron was one of latter.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, they are fine, just hypnotized.\u201d He looked down at the dark skinned girl and then back at me. \u201cI prefer my meetings to be private.\u201d</p><p>If I wasn\u2019t afraid to, I would have laughed. We were surrounded by a club full of vampires with exceptional hearing, a private conversation was impossible. \u201cSo, Ian Despereaux?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...Y-yes, I would like to break the bond.\u201d I frowned that I stumbled over my words. When you\u2019re near a predator, it\u2019s not smart to show weakness. Everything about Aaron Walker screamed predator, even though he looked like a teenager, he was probably the most dangerous person I had ever been in a room with.</p><p>What are you up to, little witch?</p><p>Speak of the devil. Leave. Me. Alone. I thought back to Ian.</p><p>Why would I want to do that when playing with you is so much fun?</p><p>\u201cMs. Sparks?\u201d Aaron asked.</p><p>I looked up at him through my eyelashes, embarrassed I had tuned out whatever he said. \u201cSorry, did you say something?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA penny for your thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014well, Ian is speaking to me right now, and It\u2019s a bit distracting.\u201d</p><p>Aiden\u2019s body went rigid and his hands curled around the arm of his chair, the wood cracked under the pressure.</p> <p>\u201cI see. That can be a bit frustrating. It took me awhile to get the hang of it myself,\u201d Aaron sympathized.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bonded?\u201d The question came out a little more skeptical than I intended, but Aaron didn\u2019t seem to take offence.</p><p>\u201cThe entire council is bonded to one another. It helps us communicate when we are far from each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can be bonded to more than one person?\u201d I sat up closer to the table, interested in learning more about the vampires.</p><p>\u201cYou can if you all share the same blood line. It seems Aiden hasn\u2019t taught you much about our kind,\u201d Aaron sent Aiden a pointed look. \u201cThe vampire council consists of the original six, all turned by Nufesum, our God you might say. We were chosen for our positions, not voted in like some councils,\u201d he finished. The last part of what he said was directed towards the witches. Every twenty years we elected new council members. \u201cWho\u2019s Nufesum?\u201d A waitress walked over and set a glass of something purple in front of me and walked away after Aaron nodded.</p> <p>\u201cPlease drink, and I\u2019ll tell you all about it,\u201d Aaron smiled as he leaned back. I eyed the purple concoction with uncertainty. But when Aaron remained silent, I knew he wouldn\u2019t speak until I drank whatever was in the glass. Picking up the drink, I brought it to my lips and allowed a small amount to fill my mouth. It tasted sweet and crisp. I took a larger drink. It prickled my tongue and sent waves of euphoria washing through my veins.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I mumbled. \u201cTell your story.\u201d My body was warm like being wrapped in an electric blanket, and my frustrated libido awakened in a frenzy. I rubbed my legs together as I tried to concentrate on Aaron. Aiden\u2019s eyes shot over to me, and my hand caressed his face. His skin was course under my fingertips as I trailed my hand across his five o\u2019clock shadow.</p><p>Aaron chuckled, bringing my focus back to him. \u201cYou like the drink?\u201d</p><p>I nodded in slow motion, everything lingered longer than it should. \u201cIt\u2019s delicious,\u201d I purred, my voice huskier than normal. I reached for the glass again and downed the last of its contents. Aaron raised his arm in the air and motioned for someone. The waitress appeared beside the table and another purple drink was set in front of me.</p><p>\u201cI think one is enough,\u201d Aiden said.</p><p>\u201cNonsense, let the girl enjoy her drink Aiden,\u201d Aaron said with a smile, but even I could hear the threat in his voice.</p> <p>Lifting the glass, I took another drink. An explosion of desire and heat surged through my body the moment the contents slid down my throat. My chest heaved as I breathed deep, my eyes glued to Aiden\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNufesum,\u201d Aaron began. \u201cIs a demonic vampire\u2014one of the originals. He\u2019s not much to look at, but he is powerful. When the vampires were created by the Devil, Nufesum was the commander in charge of all of the Dark One\u2019s children. But Nufesum couldn\u2019t stay on earth all the time, so he set out to build a council to watch over the children. I remember it as if it were yesterday. I was tending the farm when the sky blackened with winged creatures. I was nineteen then and frozen with fear as I watched the monsters descend upon me and my family. Nufesum ordered for me to call for my brothers and sisters and when we all stood in front of him, he hypnotized us so we would remain silent and obedient. One by one he bit my brothers and sisters, draining them of their blood and then refilling their veins with his. I still remember my siblings tear streaked faces and soiled trousers as the monster came for them. I was the last in the line and watched his show so I knew what I was in for.\u201d Aaron stopped when I giggled. My hands searched for the glass again, but Aiden snapped it off the table before I realized it was gone. I stared at the spot it had been and frowned.</p><p>\u201cNo more,\u201d Aiden said, more to Aaron than me.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get so uptight, my friend?\u201d Aaron questioned with a grin.</p><p>Even in my intoxicated state, I could tell the difference in the air around our table. It was suffocating compared to my relaxed and aroused body. Aiden and Aaron\u2019s energy swirled like an angry tornado within the small space and rippled across my skin.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in that dink,\u201d I busted out laughing. \u201cI mean drink, not dink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampire venom,\u201d Aaron spoke, but his focus was on Aiden. \u201cMy venom.\u201d The energy grew thicker, and I could almost feel Aiden and Aaron\u2019s energy fighting each other. Aaron\u2019s rubbed against me like a soft caress, whereas Aiden\u2019s energy whooshed in and tried to eradicate Aaron\u2019s power from me.</p><p>I never quite understood what vampire\u2019s energy was. Aiden once explained it was their influence. Humans could sense it. It caused their fight or flight switch to kick into overdrive, but they weren\u2019t affected by it unless a vampire caught their gaze. Witches, however, are sensitive to magic and auras. So when a vampire was using his influence, or vamp juju as I called it, it felt like tingling prickles along our skin.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not wise to fight me, Aiden,\u201d Aaron warned. \u201cGwen has asked for our help and everything has a price. You cannot pay her debt.\u201d</p><p>Aiden\u2019s energy withdrew, and a smile spread across Aaron\u2019s face. The warmth in my body amplified and my hands gripped the side of my chair to keep from slithering out of it.</p><p>\u201cGwen, Aiden has told you of your debt I assume?\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head as I clenched my teeth to keep from moaning. Vampire venom was what made their bite so desirable, or painful, depending on what the vamp was in to. Ian had shown me exactly how painful those types of bites could be. Luckily, Aaron preferred to inflict pleasure rather than torture. Or he could have been turning me on just to piss Aiden off. Vampires loved having pissing contests.</p><p>\u201cAnd what is your answer?\u201d Aaron asked, tilting his head back as he observed me over the brim of his nose. \u201cRemember once your word is given, it cannot be taken back.\u201d</p><p>The currency for my debt wasn\u2019t money, it was my blood. Aiden called it a blood gift, but I knew better, and I knew what kind of power a vampire could hold over you once your blood hit their tongues. Aiden drank from me once and the exchange of blood and venom left us hyper aware of each other\u2019s emotions. This time around it would be six vampires drinking from me, six different types of venom traveling through my veins. While the price seemed high, the reward was bigger. I would be rid of the bond with Ian, and I could kill him.</p><p>\u201cI accept the offer and willingly gift my blood to the VC,\u201d I told him breathless. Aaron\u2019s energy traveled up my legs, curling around my calves and ascending up my legs. The invisible caress was like warm hands charged with electricity that set every one of my nerve endings on fire.</p><p>My back arched against the chair as my head drooped and lips parted. A soft moan escaped from deep in my throat. Aiden snarled next to me, but I was lost in a sea of euphoria, unable to see the lighthouse that would guide me back to sanity. My neglected libido yearned for the sensation of Aaron\u2019s influence, or at least that\u2019s what my body said. In my mind, I knew Aaron was controlling the venom.</p><p>\u201cThere, you have your answer. Leave her alone,\u201d Aiden bit out.</p><p>The waves of sensual energy withdrew bit by bit, almost hesitate to leave. Feeling lightheaded, I inhaled a deep breath and released it slowly. My body was relaxed, and I was still turned on, but without Aaron pushing his influence, I could handle the emotions better. My eyes met Aaron\u2019s blackened eyes. His fangs peaked from under his lips and ever so slowly, they spread to reveal a satisfied smile. His tongue darted out and caressed his upper lip as our gazes locked onto each other. Like a flash of lightning, Aaron sunk those fangs into the girl next to him. Her wrist was brought up to his mouth as he drank greedily. His eyes never lost contact with me. Lust and desire swam through his eyes, a look much too mature on a face so young.</p><p>Aiden grabbed my hand and squeezed. I appreciated the gesture, but I couldn\u2019t look away from Aaron. I wasn\u2019t sure if he was using hypnosis on me, or if I just found him eerily fascinating. He was far more powerful than any vampire I\u2019d encountered. The girl\u2019s wrist thumped on the table when Aaron finished drinking. Trails of blood traveled down his chin, that his tongue darted out to catch. \u201cI look forward to tasting you, Gwen Sparks,\u201d he said as he swiped his thumb across his bottom lip.</p><p>A shudder of fear crept through me at the direct statement. \u201cWhen?\u201d I asked through trembling lips.</p><p>Don\u2019t do it, little witch</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how he did it, but Ian always knew what I was doing. Our bond worked both ways; I could sense him just as much as he could me, but I didn\u2019t know where he was or what he was doing at every second.</p><p>Scared? I thought.</p><p>It\u2019s a trap. The council doesn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass about a witch being bonded to a vampire. Think about it, little witch.</p><p>Ian was doing his best to intertwine doubt into my mind, and it was sorta working.</p><p>\u201cWhen you get your council to meet with us,\u201d Aaron said.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will. Breaking the bond with Ian is too important, is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to me, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can get my council to meet with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find a way, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Aaron smiled and then flourished his hand.</p><p>Aiden stood. \u201cCome on, Gwen.\u201d</p><p>With one last look at the elder vampire, I followed Aiden out of the club. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d The cold air bit at my exposed skin and caused goose bumps along my flesh.</p><p>\u201cHis way of dismissing us,\u201d Aiden said as we walked down the sidewalk to his SUV.</p><p>\u201cNot the hand thing, the drink thing.\u201d I could still feel the effects of Aaron\u2019s venom in my system, but it was waning and rational thoughts were slowly coming back.</p><p>Aiden\u2019s SUV beeped as he unlocked it. He held my door open, and I climbed inside. Once he was situated in the driver\u2019s seat he looked over and said, \u201cHis way of controlling you and showing me I couldn\u2019t do a damn thing about it. The council members are old and primitive in their ways of thinking. They enjoy controlling and playing with people.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd you think it\u2019d be a good idea to give them my blood?\u201d I interrupted.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t hurt you, Gwen. Their morals are questionable, but you will not be in any danger. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I thought for a moment and then voiced what I was really worried about. \u201cWhen Ian met me in my dream,\u201d I began in a quiet voice. \u201cHe bit me and it was normal at first, you know, pleasurable. But it turned very painful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe council does not inflict torturous bites on those who gift their blood,\u201d Aiden interjected, knowing what I was getting at. \u201cThose sorts of bites are reserved for punishments, and the only vampires who inflict them on their prey are those who get off on causing others pain.\u201d Aiden\u2019s fingers caressed my hand, but the gesture did little to comfort me. Allowing six ancient vampires to feed upon me was the stupidest thing I\u2019d ever agreed to. Vampires may not think much of biting someone, but to me it was an intimate situation I didn\u2019t want to share with anyone except Aiden. Of course, I couldn\u2019t share that with Aiden because my blood would restart his addiction to brew.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t refer to me as prey,\u201d I said with a small smile.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean anything by it,\u201d Aiden replied. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry our private night ended was ruined by politics. I\u2019ll be happy when this entire mess is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I thought for a moment. \u201cAre you and Aaron close? He called you a friend.\u201d</p><p>Aiden turned the key in the ignition and pulled away from the curb. His hands tightened on the steering wheel and silence filled the interior of the car as I waited for him to answer. His jaw tightened and his eyes were mere slits as he stared ahead.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s my sire,\u201d Aiden said in a hushed tone. My mouth dropped and my brows arched. I\u2019d known Aiden for two years and not once did I ask him how he became a vampire. Knowing his sire was an elder on the council, peaked my curiosity.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sire is an ancient? How did it happen?</p><p>\u201cIt was 1396 when the council came to Italy. I was a street vendor with my father. We sold breads my mother made and fruits we farmed. My family was poor. We didn\u2019t make enough to support the five of us. I hated my life. I hated my poverty and that others looked down on me for not being from a good name. Aaron La\u2019rue came upon me one night while I was closing up my father\u2019s stall and offered me a gift. He was dressed in expensive fashion, and I thought the gift would be money, that perhaps he felt sorry for such a poor boy,\u201d Aiden snorted in derision and glanced at me. \u201cI was wrong. I followed him back to his palace. I still remember what the inside looked like, gold leaf chandeliers, extravagant paintings hung on the walls and enough space to house twenty families. Aaron did not live there alone though, his brothers and sisters also called the palace home. His sister, Alana, was the most beautiful woman I\u2019d ever seen, and I quickly became infatuated with her. The La\u2019rue family invited me to the palace every night for dinners and dancing. I didn\u2019t know at the time they were trying to show me their lifestyle, and what it meant to be a La\u2019rue. I trusted them like my own family and even had a tryst with Alana,\u201d Aiden shifted, his eyes darting in my direction. \u201cI believed she\u2019d be my wife one day. After two weeks of enjoying their company, I was told what they are. All six of them flashed their fangs and blackened their eyes. \u2018This is the gift I wish to give you\u2019 Aaron told me. I was terrified, I thought they were demons, but I was also in love with Alana. \u2018We can be together forever, my dear, Alonzo\u2019 Alana told me, and I believed her.\u201d Aiden made a right turn, his hand white from grasping the steering wheel tight. Though our connection was waning, I could almost feel his anger filling the cab of the car.</p><p>\u201cAlonzo?\u201d I questioned.</p><p>\u201cI was born as Alonzo Moretti. I have changed it several times over the years, but once the transition from human to vampire was complete, I could never be Alonzo Moretti again. I felt I\u2019d disgraced my family name. The La\u2019rue\u2019s lifestyle was everything I envied and everything I\u2019d never have if I remained a vendor\u2019s son, so I agreed to be a vampire. Alana was not permitted to change me. Men were the only sires back then, so Aaron offered to be my sire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with a man, and I didn\u2019t even know his real name?\u201d It never occurred to me Aiden would have changed his identity over the years.</p> <p>\u201cYou never asked,\u201d Aiden said.</p><p>Guilt settled in the pit of my stomach. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have taken an interest in your life, but I thought it would be rude to question you about it, and honestly, I was okay with not knowing who you were then because I love who you are now.\u201d</p><p>A smile replaced the frown on Aiden face. \u201cThat is very good to hear, my Gwen. Because who I was then was not someone you would love today.\u201d</p><p>Aiden took a right turn, causing me to slide on the leather seats. I braced myself so I wouldn\u2019t end up in his lap\u2014not that it wouldn\u2019t be fun, but it wouldn\u2019t be safe while he was driving. \u201cSo, what happened with Alana?\u201d I asked once I straightened myself in my seat.</p><p>I knew Aiden was old, and I couldn\u2019t imagine what he witnessed in his lifetimes. I felt juvenile in comparison.</p><p>\u201cAlana and I carried on our relationship for a few years, devouring the cities around us. We left bodies in the street and a blood trail in our wake. Being with Alana was intoxicating and alluring to a new vampire. She showed me the spoils of my new world, and I didn\u2019t know any better. It wasn\u2019t until we came across a young girl no older than seven that I realized I didn\u2019t want to live as a monster. Alana never gave a second thought about killing, and when she drained the little girl, I saw her in a different light. The following night I lied and said I was going to bring some girls back to the palace. I ended up leaving Italy that night for Ireland. It was one of the stupidest things I\u2019d ever done.\u201d</p><p>Aiden\u2019s voice was somber and his eyes, although staring forward, were replaying his history rather than watching the road.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked in a small voice. I couldn\u2019t imagine what Aiden was remembering and wasn\u2019t sure if it was right for me to ask him to relive it just to satisfy my curiosity.</p> <p>\u201cAlana wasn\u2019t happy I deceived her, and Aaron wasn\u2019t happy I left without his permission. Sires hold power over their children, and when I left, it was like a slap in the face\u2014like I didn\u2019t appreciate the gift given to me. To teach me a lesson, they slaughtered my mother and father, turned my brother into a slave and turned my sister vampire. Aiden\u2019s voice grew deep as he tried to reign in his anger. \u201cI knew it wouldn\u2019t be long before they found me again, sires can always find their children. But when they appeared at my cottage in Ireland, I didn\u2019t expect to see my sister and brother. My sister, Francesca was only fifteen and innocent, but they remedied that. My brother, Marcello, was twenty-one with a wife and children. The La\u2019rue\u2019s took him from them and turned him into a walking blood bank. Just to teach me a lesson. \u2019They are not your family anymore, we are.\u2019 Aaron told me when I tried to save them. In the end, Francesca was beheaded, and Marcello was bled dry. Aaron and Alana told me they killed them for my own good, because they held too much power of me. After spending another fifty years with the La\u2019rue\u2019s, Aaron granted me my freedom, and Alana grew tired of me and moved on to another. I\u2019d never been happier in my life. I came to America and never looked back at the place I called home.\u201d</p><p>Aiden\u2019s story left me speechless. I couldn\u2019t imagine seeing my brother and sister used against me and then killed. His story made me think of my little sister, Rebekah. She was twenty now but just a child last time I\u2019d seen her. I sent birthday cards every year but I never heard anything from my family. In some ways, I replaced my missing sister with Penny, but I still longed to get know Rebekah someday.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Aiden. I\u2019m sorry they were cruel, and you had to witness such horrendous things. And I\u2019m sorry I never asked before. I appreciate that you told me.\u201d I slid my hand across the seat and grasped his free hand.</p><p>Aiden glanced over at me, his eyes almost teary, and then looked away. Reliving those memories must have been hard on him, and I felt almost guilty for even asking. As a vampire there was no escape from the awful memories that haunted them. Centuries and centuries of death and destruction was part of their lives and one I couldn\u2019t fathom having.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good you know now. The La\u2019rue\u2019s may seem friendly, but they\u2019re the ultimate predators. You\u2019ll not be in any harm while giving your blood because I\u2019ll be right by your side,\u201d Aiden paused. \u201cYou may want to invite another person who can act as a guard also. The La\u2019rue\u2019s won\u2019t take offence; in fact, they\u2019ll think you\u2019re smart for doing so. Do you have someone you can trust who would be able to help protect you?\u201d</p><p>I snorted. If anyone from Moon found out I was going to allow the VC to drink from me because I\u2019m bonded to another vampire, they\u2019d throw me in prison for treason. Okay, maybe not, but it wouldn\u2019t go over well. I liked Kye, but he was as loyal as a dog to Holly, so I couldn\u2019t trust him to keep my secret. Fiona wouldn\u2019t offer a lot of protection, and I didn\u2019t want to get her involved with the VC. I hadn\u2019t made a lot of friends in Moon. Maybe because most avoided me like I was the black plague. Dorian was the only one who was neutral in the whole situation, but I didn\u2019t know if I could trust him either. He was up to something with Holly, but I had no idea what. Could I trust him? Probably not. Did I have any other option? Nope.</p><p>\u201cI think I know someone,\u201d I told Aiden. He pulled the SUV a little ways away from the entrance of Moon so no one would see us together. It seemed silly, like we were two teenagers sneaking out together when our parents forbid it, but it was essential for the time being.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll feel better having two pairs of eyes watching the La\u2019rue\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head, and then stared at entrance of Moon. To humans it just looked like the tree limbs had grown in a sort of arch, but to supernaturals it shimmered like a heat mirage. Just beyond the opening I could see the cobblestone streets and lights of the town reflecting against the darkness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry tonight was ruined,\u201d Aiden said. \u201cI was looking forward to sexually torturing you.\u201d He chuckled. I loved his laugh, deep and masculine, it sent tingles to all the right places. Funny how something so average could send me into a frenzy. Or maybe my body was just hyper sensitive to lust tonight. It\u2019d been almost eight days since Aiden and I had been together.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ll make it up to me?\u201d I grinned.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had sex in an Escalade?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a first time for everything.\u201d I leaned in and met his lips, then found out exactly how roomy the backseat was.</p><p>13</p><p>I woke up with a hangover from hell the next morning. Not from the alcohol, I\u2019d only had three drinks; I deduced it was the after effects of the venom I\u2019d ingested. I massaged my forehead to ease the headache crushing my brain. If witches blood was a drug for vampires, then vampire venom was like ecstasy for non-vamps that left you with a nasty hangover.</p><p>Three loud knocks sounded at my door, the noise almost deafening. I cringed as the sound reverberated in my skull and pulled the covers over my head, hoping whoever was at my door would go away. No such luck.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d Dorian said as my door creaked open. He was forming a bad habit of waking me up in the morning, and I wasn\u2019t in the mood to deal with him today. My fortress of blankets did little to fool him. Dorian walked over to the bed and whipped the covers away.</p> <p>\u201cGo away,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWe have training, since you skipped last night,\u201d he paused. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>I peeked through one eye. \u201cToo many drinks last night. Now leave me alone.\u201d It was partially true; the venom had been in drinks. But I wasn\u2019t in the mood to deal with a lecture or be tattled on to Holly.</p><p>\u201cTough shit. If you would have trained last night, you wouldn\u2019t have to deal with it today,\u201d Dorian said, a little pissier than I expected.</p><p>\u201cSomeone shove a scythe up your ass?\u201d I laughed at my lame joke, but by the look on Dorian\u2019s face, he didn\u2019t find it as funny as I did.</p><p>\u201cYour people are in the middle of a war. You shouldn\u2019t be out drinking all night\u2014and with a vampire no less. You have obligations, Gwen.\u201d</p> <p>Sitting up in bed proved harder than normal, my head pounded, and I had to squint to focus on Dorian\u2019s angry face. This was ten times worse than any hangover I ever had. Those drinks must have been eighty percent venom.</p><p>Nothing like OD\u2019ing on vampire venom. I snorted at my own thought.</p><p>\u201cSomething funny?\u201d Dorian\u2019s bulbous arms crossed over his chest as he sneered. What was the hell was wrong with him?</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Dorian. You\u2019re bitchier than a woman during PMS today. What\u2019s your problem?\u201d My fingers did circles around my temples, but it didn\u2019t help ease the pain. Dorian\u2019s constant bitching didn\u2019t help either.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to be stood up, especially for a vampire,\u201d he admitted. My hands stilled, and I looked up. His eyes remained focused on mine, the irritation evident in the stormy gray.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were neutral? Since when do you hate vampires? Lemme guess, Holly fed you a big bowl of bullshit, and you ate it right up like a starving dog?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t dignify my response with an answer. Instead, he grabbed my arm and hauled me out of bed. Stumbling over my own feet, I tripped and landed face first into his hard chest. My head bounced off of his muscles and throbbing pain ricocheted through my skull.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I snapped. Dorian\u2019s aggressive behavior threw me for a loop. He\u2019d never displayed any sort of emotion other than nonchalance.</p> <p>\u201cAre you blind? Do you not see what\u2019s right in front of you?\u201d he yelled, but let go of my arm.</p><p>I watched him with fear and confusion. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I rubbed the spot where he grabbed and glared with as much anger as I felt. \u201cDon\u2019t ever do that again.\u201d</p><p>Dorian closed his eyes and took a couple deep breaths. \u201cSorry. Get dressed; we are training this morning. Holly has excused you from training with the witches today.\u201d He turned to leave my room, but when he opened the door, I used my magic to slam it shut. He wasn\u2019t getting off that easy.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell just happened? You can\u2019t assault me and then apologize and walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let my emotions control me, and I apologize,\u201d Dorian apologized again, but still didn\u2019t answer my question. I held out my hand to keep the door shut and walked closer. I wasn\u2019t sure what he was capable of, but I knew I was pretty powerful and would have a fighting chance against him should his emotions take control again. Whatever the hell that meant.</p><p>\u201cGwen, don\u2019t ask questions you aren\u2019t ready to hear the answers to. Just forget it happened and meet me in the foyer.\u201d</p><p>I considered his words. Both of us stared at each other, the question was who\u2019d blink first? If I didn\u2019t feel like I\u2019d been run through the ringer, I could have stood there all day. But the throbbing pounding against my skull gave me little patience. Deciding it was better to let it go than argue, I released the door, and Dorian walked out. I may have been feeling crappy and unwilling to fight for the answers at the moment, but I would find out what he meant.</p><p>It took me a little longer to get ready than normal. By the time I dressed and met Dorian downstairs, my head throbbed with each step. Dorian wouldn\u2019t look me in the eye which was strange, but I ignored it. I wasn\u2019t in the mood to guess what was bugging the Angel of Death.</p><p>Dorian motioned for me to follow him and I did. We walked in silence down a couple hallways and stopped in the medical room. I remained silent as he opened drawers and cabinets in search of something. Finding a vial of pink liquid, he held it out to me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCure for your hangover,\u201d he said.</p><p>I took the vial and uncapped it. Bringing it to my nose, I sniffed the contents. It smelled like ginger and sage.</p><p>\u201cSince when do you know anything about potions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked with witches a long time; I\u2019ve picked up a trick or two. Drink it, you\u2019ll feel better.\u201d</p><p>Eying the pink liquid in my hands, I brought the bottle to my lips and tossed it back. It tasted horrible, but that was to be expected with potions, they were generally made with a mixture of unsavory items. Items I was trying not to think of as I forced the liquid down my throat. My lips curled inwards to hold back from vomiting. Once the potion settled in my stomach, my entire body began to sweat. I dragged the back of my hand along my forehead to wipe off the excess moisture and fanned my t-shirt to create some sort of breeze.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you give me?\u201d My skin radiated heat as sweat gathered on my skin. When I was younger, I use to run long distance, but even that never made me sweat like this.</p><p>\u201cIt sweats the toxins out of your system. It may not be pretty, but it\u2019s effective,\u201d Dorian said.</p><p>I was to the point of wanting to strip off every stitch of clothing just so I could feel air against my skin. Audience be damned. \u201cThanks for letting me know my body would warm to a million degrees, jackoff.\u201d Some people complained about being cold and hated winter, I was the opposite. I hated being hot and loved winter. The temperature inside my body was stifling and uncomfortable, and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing I could do about it.</p><p>After twenty minutes of sweating what felt like gallons, I did begin to feel better. The heat receded and my headache vanished. My clothes were drenched, along with my hair, but the potion worked.</p><p>\u201cSo, was last night worth the discomfort of today?\u201d Dorian asked. The arrogance in his voice made me want to punch him.</p><p>\u201cYou betcha,\u201d I said with a smile, even though it was a half-truth. Most of last night was fun; I even enjoyed the venom tainted drink, until I realized what it was. I was happy to have the tricky stuff out of my system. I\u2019d been teased and pleased by Aiden, and that always made for a good night. Knowing I\u2019d given my verbal consent for the VC to drink from me was another story. One I\u2019d worry about later.</p><p>\u201cKye explained astral projecting to you?\u201d Dorian said, ignoring our previous words.</p><p>\u201cSort of. We practiced a couple times, but I\u2019m still not sure how it works,\u201d I told him. Being able to step out of our reality and into another dimension sounded cool\u2014it wasn\u2019t. It was scary as hell.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s your lesson for today,\u201d Dorian said. \u201cGo take a shower first, you smell like a dirty gym.\u201d Before I could defend my stinky-ness, Dorian walked away.</p><p>I closed my eyes and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no place like home. There\u2019s no place like home,\u201d as I tapped my heels together. When I opened my eyes, I was still in the medical room. \u201cIt was worth a shot,\u201d I told myself and then set off to shower.</p><p>Dorian found me, stuffing my face with cinnamon rolls the size of my hand, a half an hour later. While I was bathing, I hoped Holly would occupy him for the rest of the day, but like every other wish I\u2019d made since coming to Moon, it hadn\u2019t come true.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word when he walked into the kitchen and sat down in front of me. We eyed each other, me with aggravation and anger, and him with scorn and bemusement.</p><p>\u201cHow does such a small woman eat ten pounds of sugary dough?\u201d He finally spoke as I shoved piece after piece of roll into my mouth. I didn\u2019t care if I looked like a pig or that I should be embarrassed by how much I ate, I was hungry and in no mood to impress anyone.</p><p>\u201cHow does an Angel of Death, someone who\u2019s supposed to be neutral, have such a strong dislike for vampires?\u201d I mumbled around the food in my mouth. I was thinking about the events of this morning while I sat in the kitchen and the change in Dorian\u2019s attitude annoyed me to no end, not to mention he\u2019d physically assaulted me. I wasn\u2019t a wimp. I could handle a fight, but his grip had been strong and last night left me clumsy. If he pulled a little harder I could have gotten whiplash from bouncing my skull of his hard chest.</p><p>\u201cI apologized for this morning,\u201d Dorian said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need excuses or apologies, I need answers. Just last week you were all smooth nonchalance about the war and vampires, but this morning you haul my ass out of bed and criticize my activities,\u201d I frowned. \u201cAnd what was \u2019are you blind?\u2019 all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinish up, you have to practice.\u201d He got up and walked to the door. I was getting tired of having my questions ignored.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I yelled and threw one of the cinnamon rolls at his back. The roll stuck to his back for a few seconds before it plopped to the floor. If I wasn\u2019t so angry, I would have laughed. Dorian turned around and gave me an incredulous glare.</p> <p>\u201cNo thank you, I ate already,\u201d he said sarcastically and turned to leave again.</p><p>\u201cStop turning your back on me!\u201d Coming around the table, I marched up to him. I hated that he was so much taller than me, and I had to strain neck just to look at him. It was hard to be badass when you have to look up at your opponent.</p><p>\u201cI am sick and tired of all the hush-hush talk and secrets. I\u2019m tired of everyone having a plan for me and not letting me know what the hell it is. But most of all, I\u2019m sick and tired of your arrogance and orders. I am here because I have to be, not to follow you around and follow your every command.\u201d</p><p>By the time I finished my rant, I was so close to Dorian that a few inches was all that separated us. He stared down at me, his lips a thin line and the cloudiness in his eyes swirled like a storm was racing across the sky. I could tell a lot about someone\u2019s mood by looking into their eyes, but Dorian\u2019s were harder than hell to decipher. I noticed the fogginess of the gray swirled either quicker or slower, depending on his mood, but to put an emotion to the cloud movements was impossible.</p><p>His lips parted and twitched like he was thinking about saying something. I waited, ready to hear what ever smartass comment was on the tip of his tongue so I could throw it right back into his mouth. As far as I was concerned, I was done taking orders and walking around blind and into whatever trap Holly had set for me.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re here to learn your power and help your people. Have you forgotten so quickly that it was you who helped your police department find out who was killing witches? Or do you not care because you\u2019re fucking the enemy?\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped to the floor. The anger in his words slapped me across the face and left me speechless. Dorian was always outspoken and even, at times, rude, but the condescension in his tone came right out of left field.</p><p>\u201cAnd again I ask, why the sudden allegiance to the witches? Wasn\u2019t it you who said you didn\u2019t concern yourself with our trivial problems?\u201d</p><p>The air around us became thick and suffocating. Taking a few steps backwards, I sagged against the table and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cThings have changed since then,\u201d Dorian said.</p><p>I rolled my eyes at yet another question he\u2019d dodged. Trying to get a straight answer from him was like pulling teeth.</p> <p>\u201cLet me do you a favor and relive you of your duties. I\u2019ll start training with Kye again, and you can go be a dick to someone else.\u201d I shoved off of the table and strode past him with the intention of finding Kye. I knew my responsibilities and I did want to learn about my power, but I didn\u2019t need to hear lecture after lecture about dating a vampire. Whatever was bothering Dorian had turned him into a jackass. Well, more of a jackass.</p><p>\u201cKye doesn\u2019t have the time or the knowledge to train you. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re stuck with me,\u201d Dorian said over his shoulder. \u201cQuit acting like a sullen child, and let\u2019s get to work.\u201d</p><p>Training normally took place in a gym or dojo for most people. My training ground was a cemetery full of creepy Gothic tombstones and mausoleums. I had spent so much time there I could point out who was buried where and what year they died. Not information I cared to know.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is up with the graveyard? Is this the only place I can use my power?\u201d Dorian seemed more reserved around me now that we\u2019d had it out. He watched me with caution, even his actions seemed calculated. During our walk to the cemetery he kept at least three feet from me and neither one of us muttered a word. I would be lying if I said it didn\u2019t bother me. I liked Dorian before our relationship turned awkward.</p><p>\u201cNo, but you\u2019re an untrained spirit walker, and it\u2019s easier for you to connect with death when you\u2019re around the dead, hence the cemetery,\u201d Dorian answered, his voice almost bored.</p><p>At least I was training during the day instead of night. I was beginning to miss the sun and the warmth. We stopped walking at the four path intersection. Dorian rubbed his chin and took in the surroundings. \u201cWhat do you feel?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and tried to sense something. I could feel a bitter coldness lying just under the surface of the regular breeze. It was too icy to be the regular wind. I also felt despair, like the ground was soaked with it. I had come to associate that feeling with the realm of the dead. The spirits within it were either trapped or angry\u2014there wasn\u2019t anything happy about their afterlives.</p><p>\u201cDeath,\u201d I said coolly. It was getting easier and easier to pick up on the depressing signs.</p> <p>\u201cVery good,\u201d Dorian praised with a head nod. \u201cNow, astral projection isn\u2019t as easy as calling spirits. It takes concentration and focus. You could pop into the ghostly realm and never find your way out. Always know where the doors are, and never lose sight of rational thought. There are things in there that will try to tempt you away from the safe zones, and you\u2019d be lost forever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold up,\u201d I interjected. \u201cWhat do you mean I could be lost forever? And what are these things that would want to lure me away from the safe zones?\u201d Kye didn\u2019t mention anything when he\u2019d tricked me into astral projecting. Had I known the dangers I\u2019d face, I wouldn\u2019t have tried it.</p><p>\u201cSafe zones are the doorways that lead back to our reality. Some call them portals to another dimension. You always need to know where these doors are to return,\u201d Dorian paused. \u201cThere are angry spirits, poltergeist, who will try to harm you should you run into one and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what? What\u2019s worse than an evil spirit who wants to hurt me?\u201d I cleared the panic from my voice, but my heart continued to slam against my ribcage.</p><p>\u201cDemons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. People, human and supernatural, who practice black magic call them from the underworld, but they cannot step foot on earth, so they are trapped within the realm of the dead. At least until they find someone to inhabit. While they can\u2019t harm the spirits, they can harm you.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be freaking kidding me?\u201d I said in disbelief. Dealing with vampires who poached witches was one thing. Even summoning spirits from blood was out of my comfort zone. Coming on contact with a demon? Screw that!</p><p>\u201cChances are you won\u2019t ever see one, but I thought you should know they are in the realm. The first step to becoming a practiced spirit walker is knowledge. Always know the facts before you act, otherwise you\u2019ll be on a one way train to insanity.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my shoulders to loosen the muscles that clung to my bones like scared puppies. The more Dorian talked, the more my feet itched to run in the opposite direction. I\u2019d never been more homesick in my entire life. Flora didn\u2019t offer a lot, but it was home and a lot safer than Moon. I\u2019d give anything to return to my Podunk town and my simple life.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t use a doorway last time I astral projected,\u201d I said more to myself than to Dorian. Kye explained how to jump into the other dimension, but he didn\u2019t say anything about portals, poltergeist, or demons. He was either smart\u2014knowing I wouldn\u2019t jump realities if I knew, or he didn\u2019t care about my safety. Either way, it pissed me off.</p><p>\u201cThe mausoleum is a safe zone,\u201d Dorian replied.</p><p>I looked up. \u201cHow do you know where we practiced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKye told me what your progress was when I took over your training.\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head. \u201cSo, how do I know where safe zones are?\u201d</p><p>Dorian walked over to where I stood. His closeness set my senses on high alert. I didn\u2019t know why his mood had changed, but I wasn\u2019t going to be caught off guard again should he decide to lay his hands on me.</p><p>\u201cHi, my name is Dorian Hade, and I\u2019ll be your tour guide on this field trip to the realm of the dead,\u201d Dorian said as he held out his hand for me to shake. The side of his mouth quirked up in a grin, and his cloudy eyes swirled calmly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going with me?\u201d The relief in my voice was too obvious for my liking. Dorian wiggled his fingers, a sign he wouldn\u2019t speak until I shook his outstretched hand. I filled my lungs with air and blew it out through my mouth in frustration. My hand clasped his.</p><p>Once our skin made contact, the air grew thicker around us. I could feel the weight of it pushing against the entirety of my body. I watched as it took on a gray tint, molding against Dorian and me. My fingers clutched his hand tight as my eyes strained to see past the darkening air. Cold replaced the warmth of the day, causing a shiver to tremble through my bones. My teeth rattled against each other, my muscles constricting from the change in temperature. A slight breeze blew against my face, causing my eyes to water. I hung my head and closed my eyes to stop the singing sensation of the wind.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes, Gwen,\u201d Dorian said, but to me it sounded distant and distorted like a dream. I worked on controlling my breathing and calming my heartbeat before I worried about anything else. After a handful of deep breaths and I was satisfied I wouldn\u2019t have a heart attack, I peeked at my surrounding through one eye. The daylight had disappeared and been replaced with gloom. Lifting my head, I opened both eyes and realized I wasn\u2019t in Kansas anymore. Dorian and I were still in the graveyard, but not in our reality\u2014in the realm of the dead. Everything was washed in varying shades of gray and black. Shadows clung to everything and the warmth of the sun was replaced with the icy coldness of death.</p><p>Swiveling my head to look at Dorian, I realized I was still holding his hand. I pried my fingers loose and massaged my sore digits. Dorian didn\u2019t seem to care I\u2019d almost broken every bone in his hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I whispered as my eyes roamed over the space. Being in this dimension sent my red flags up now that I knew demons lie in wait. Dorian said I had to keep my wits about me; I didn\u2019t think that\u2019d be a problem. I was acutely aware of my surroundings and the shadows lurking within them.</p><p>\u201cI can jump realities as easily as taking a step. It would have taken too long for you to concentrate and jump, so I took you with me,\u201d Dorian said as he stepped closer to me. His gray eyes swiveled as he skimmed through the darkened landscape. The muscles in his shoulders tensed making my muscles reacted as well. Turning my back to him, I looked in the direction he stared. Soft moans and cries drifted on the air like a haunting melody.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I said in a hushed tone. Dorian shifted closer, his body so near I could feel the hardness of it against my back. My tense muscles reacted, but not in fear, it was more of a nervous excitement. The feeling could be chalked up to having a big strong man at my back while I was in a scary place\u2014something resembling security. At least I wouldn\u2019t allow my mind to categorize the feeling as anything else.</p> <p>As I tried not to analyze the way my body reacted to Dorian\u2019s, he stepped around me and placed his massive form between me and the direction of the moans. His shoulder length dark hair blew in the always present breeze. My eyes roamed the width of his broad shoulders and traveled lower where his waist tapered. When my eyes wanted to travel further south and appraise his behind, Dorian turned to face me. Snapping my eyes up, I met his gaze. The smirk on his face let me know I failed in masking my surreptitious appraisal of his body.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just ghosts,\u201d Dorian said.</p><p>Hearing the word ghosts no longer freaked me out. Bridget Downing was my first encounter with the spirit world and helping her was rewarding in its own way. Of course Ian was still free, so justice had not been served yet, but at least now we knew who was to blame.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t talked to anyone in the council about Ian, but I was sure they already knew. Murderous vampires didn\u2019t slip under their noses without them having inkling as to who was responsible. Again, I wondered if I should say something about my bond with Ian. I was at the point where I\u2019d been in Moon for so long I\u2019d be questioned and lectured as to why I didn\u2019t tell my council first thing after arriving, but maybe it would be worth it. They would no doubt bend my predicament to act in their favor, and I\u2019d get my ass chewed out, but perhaps it would help if they knew the one particular vampire behind all of this. As far as I knew, the NAWC was only dealing with the VC. The VC wasn\u2019t too interested in capturing Ian Despereaux, which made me second guess my safety during the gifting of my blood. I ran all of my problems around in my head, lending at least a moment of thought to each one, and then snorted in derision at my lame attempt to live a simple and peaceful life. Life should come with a manual because making decisions on my own only led me down the wrong path. That thought bothered me more than all of the others combined. I used to be smart, at least with my choices, but the circuits in my brain must have shorted out within the past month. I hated myself for falling for Ian\u2019s tricks. I hated I wanted to prove I could still be helpful to the FPD and had centered myself right in the middle of the brew debacle. But most of all, I hated that I didn\u2019t seem to know who I was anymore.</p><p>\u201cGwen,\u201d Dorian called.</p> <p>I blinked a few times and tucked my self-loathing back into the dark corners of my mind where hopefully they\u2019d stay locked up and leave me alone. Looking back and regretting the choices I\u2019ve made was like a mental right hook to the brain. I couldn\u2019t take back what I had done; all I could do was be smarter about future decisions.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I spaced out,\u201d I told Dorian. My eyes absorbed every one of his masculine features. His face was square with a strong jawline framed by his long brown hair. His nose had a perfect slope and just below were his full lips, parted as he took air into his lungs. The rise and fall of his broad chest caught my attention. I dragged my gaze downwards and trailed my eyes along the paths his muscles made under the tight t-shirt. Everything about him was beautiful, even his smoky eyes which freaked me out to begin with, were every bit as stunning as the rest of him. Masculine, confident and\u2014watching me watch him. My cheeks burned with my embarrassment.</p><p>He regarded me with a look I\u2019d seen a few other times, an expression I tried to ignore, but at the moment, I couldn\u2019t look away from. I was a woman who noticed attractive men, but I would never act on those feelings. I loved Aiden as sure as the night is long. But Dorian stirred something deep inside of me, and we connected on a level I hadn\u2019t with Aiden. It wasn\u2019t easy to ignore something that profound, especially when it was staring at me like I was the sexiest girl in the world.</p><p>Dorian took a step forward. His arms hung limp, but I could tell he was nervous about what was happening between us. The tightness in his jaw and triceps betrayed the cool confidence he was trying to portray. An inch of icy air separated us. I lifted my eyes to his, and we stared at each other. No words were needed; our body language spoke for us. Dorian brought his arm up and with the back of his hand caressed the side of my face with more gentleness than I imagined. My eyes closed against the feel of it. A shuffle of feet enticed my eyes open just in time to see Dorian bending forward and toward my eager lips. I shook my head, unable to tell him no with my voice. I wanted to taste his kiss, to feel his lips on mine, but my heart wouldn\u2019t allow my curiosity to betray me. Love trumps attraction, and attraction was all there was between us.</p><p>Dorian\u2019s gentle features turned hard, and he stepped away. \u201cWhat is it about him?\u201d he asked. He didn\u2019t need to say Aiden\u2019s name, I knew which him he was referring to. I was happy his back was to me, so I wouldn\u2019t have to look into his agitated eyes. I was ashamed I allowed that closeness to even happen. It led Dorian on, and I betrayed Aiden in the process.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about this. You\u2019re my teacher, and I\u2019m your student, let\u2019s just leave it at that. Please?\u201d I begged. My body had a tendency to rule while my brain took a backseat to my urges. Luckily, I allowed rational thought to smack my interest in Dorian to the curb. Our little intimate moment still caused damage that couldn\u2019t be undone, but it could have been so much worse. I may have led Dorian on, but in time he\u2019d appreciate that it didn\u2019t go further. If he kissed me, it wouldn\u2019t change anything other than another scoop of self-loathing from me. I didn\u2019t trust him enough to think anything could ever transpire between us. Sure, I was attracted to him, any girl would be, but that wasn\u2019t enough. I assumed the connection we felt was based on the fact that we both dealt with the dead.</p> <p>Dorian looked over his shoulder. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to ignore it forever.\u201d</p><p>We walked down the path in complete silence, the awkwardness between us back with a vengeance. Dorian returned to being distant and cold. The first couple \u201csafe zones\u201d were pointed out, and he explained how to decipher what qualified them as safe. A slight shimmer, like a heat mirage, lingered around the spots, barely noticeable in the thick fog that hung in the air. After that, Dorian just pointed the areas out.</p><p>I wanted to say something, anything, that would fix what happened between us, but no words seemed sufficient enough. I ran through the many excuses in my head, and they all came off lame and clich\u00e9. \u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u201d and \u201cI just want to be friends\u201d weren\u2019t going to cut it. Nothing I said would make one bit of difference. Dorian let his guard down and so did I. We both knew beyond a shadow of a doubt we were attracted to each other. And that cat could never be shoved back in the proverbial bag. So, I\u2019d have to settle for my lessons to be taught with sarcasm and resentment. With luck, I\u2019d be on my way back to Flora before too long, and Dorian would be back to escorting souls to wherever. We\u2019d go back to being strangers, which was for the best.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Dorian ordered.</p><p>Skidding to a halt, I looked up. He was staring at something just ahead. Following his gaze, I caught a glimpse as something dark stepped out from behind a tree. It didn\u2019t have any discernible facial features. The only noticeable things were its limbs.</p><p>\u201cIs that a ghost?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Dorian\u2019s fingers wound around my arm, his grip tightening the longer he stared at the black figure. \u201cDemon.\u201d</p><p>I stared wide eyed at the demon, scared and fascinated. I expected hooved feet, claws and horns, not an opaque shadow. The demon took jerky steps towards us, sending my fear over the edge and my heart slamming against my chest it moved closer and closer. Its head lurched from side to side as its feet stepped closer and closer. The air around us grew unbearably cold. A cloud of mist formed in front of me as I breathed. Dorian jerked me to the side and broke into a run with me tripping behind him to keep up. The demon let loose a deafening wail behind us, like nails on a chalkboard.</p> <p>Turning left, we ran down the open field, that would house downtown Moon, but in this realm the buildings didn\u2019t exist. I risked looking back to see how close the demon was and ended up tripping over a stump. My body crashed to the ground, my face smashing into the earth hard. Dorian yanked me up, and we continued to run. The demon was maybe eight feet behind us and gaining more ground by the second. It was surprisingly fast for how jerky and distorted its movements were.</p><p>Dorian grabbed me and shoved me into a tall oak tree. I had a split second to scream before I disappeared into darkness. The tree vanished along with the grassy field we were just running through. My eyes fought in vain to penetrate the opaqueness. Shadows upon shadows drenched the space in blackness, a bottomless pit of nothing. I turned in circles, but all I could see was the same impervious dark in every direction. Was the tree a safe zone? Is this what they looked like behind the shimmer? I didn\u2019t have the time or the right frame of mind to observe the tree before Dorian pushed me into it. Fear of the demon washed away any confusion in my mind. I didn\u2019t care where I was so long as the demon wasn\u2019t with me. Then a terrible thought trickled into my mind, and all of a sudden the thick blackness blanketing me didn\u2019t seem so harmless. The demon had also been a black figure, was he here with me? Watching me right now while I swiveled in circles? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDorian!\u201d I screamed into the emptiness. He had been right behind me, why didn\u2019t he step through the tree? Had he pushed me out of harm\u2019s way and placed himself in its path? Or did the demon catch him before he could escape? Standing in the abyss with thoughts of Dorian being killed by a demon was suffocating. My lungs constricted, and I gasped to catch any amount of air. I coughed and sobbed, panic seizing my body and turning it against me. Tears burned against my cheeks, and sweat broke out along my brow. Burying my fingers in my hair, I screamed at the top of my lungs. The feeling of abandonment pressed inward on my heart and squeezed like a vice grip. I dropped to my knees with a heavy thump, bracing my hands out in front of me; I took big mouthfuls of oxygen into my lungs and tried to calm my frightened body. I didn\u2019t know how long I stay crouched before I saw a shadow moving along the darkness, even though I knew that wasn\u2019t possible\u2014you need light for a shadow to manifest. But my eyes played tricks on my brain and teased my already shaken nerves.</p><p>After the shadow came footsteps. The thumping of hard soled shoes somewhere in front of me, headed in my direction. Falling back on my behind, I scooted further and further away from the approaching steps. Biting my lips to keep my sobs muffled, I strained my eyes to make sense of what was happening. A large dark figure broke against the darkness and stood not four feet from me. I curled inward, making myself as small as possible, hoping I would slip its notice.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d Dorian spoke with concern.</p> <p>Relief washed away my insecurities. I scrambled up and ran to him, hitting hard against his chest and throwing my arms around the thickness of his body. I\u2019d never been more relieved to see another person in my entire life. Dorian encased my body with his arms and held me while my sobs picked back up, my tears soaking his t-shirt. I felt small and fragile against his large body, but safe. His hand caressed my hair in long calming strokes and my sniffles lessened, awareness taking front and center in my mind. Attraction stirred deep within me at the close proximity of Dorian. My body fit perfectly against his. I withdrew from him when all I wanted to do was collapsed against him.</p><p>With shaky hands, I wiped my tear soaked cheeks and cleared my throat. \u201cWhere were you?\u201d My voice sounded like a small child who needed reassurance.</p><p>\u201cI was here, Gwen, the entire time. I stepped through the tree right after you, but in here it\u2019s a disorienting and easy to get lost.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been with me the entire time, and I hadn\u2019t even known. Calling the place disorienting was a major understatement. I was sure if humans could explore a black hole, this is what they\u2019d find, a big glob of nothingness.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d Wrapping my arms around myself, I fought the shakiness in my body and voice. I\u2019d seen many things in my life and felt real fear, but none of those past experiences measured up to what I\u2019d experienced tonight. The demon would be embedded in my mind for a long time. I had come so close to true evil and escaped. Future obstacles couldn\u2019t be as scary as that.</p> <p>\u201cThe in-between,\u201d Dorian answered.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t really answer my question. What is the in-between?\u201d</p><p>Dorian grabbed my hand and I jerked it away.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t coming onto you, Gwen, We need to find a way out and unless you want to get separated again...\u201d He let his unspoken words speak for themselves.</p><p>I already felt closer to him than was appropriate, holding his large hand would confuse those feelings more. But the thought of being lost in the \u201cin-between\u201d was scarier than the attraction I wanted to file in the denial part of my brain. Reaching my arm out, I fumbled for his hand but ended up caressing his leg in the process. A deep amused chuckle pierced through the darkness, and if Dorian could see my face, he\u2019d have found amusement in the unflattering shade of red my cheeks were turning.</p><p>\u201cIf you wanted to feel my body, all you had to do was ask,\u201d he teased and clutched my hand in his.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t see a damn thing in here,\u201d I remarked as I fought the urge to acknowledge just how nice his body felt beneath my palm.</p><p>As we walked, with what seemed like aimless steps, Dorian explained the in-between. \u201cThe in-between is what lies beyond the safe zones,\u201d he began. \u201cNeither Ghosts or demons can enter, unless called to our reality. The spirits you summoned from the vampire blood passed through the in-between to manifest in our reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cIt\u2019s the space between the two realms?</p><p>\u201cExactly. We are allowed to enter because we are connected to both worlds. But it acts as a path for summoned spirits and demons as well.\u201d</p><p>My nervousness settled a little, but as soon as Dorian said those words, my muscles tensed and my grip tightened on his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot be hurt in the in-between,\u201d Dorian explained, picking up on my change in mood. \u201cSummoned beings have a one track mind. Their only goal is to travel to whoever summoned them. We could pass a hundred demons right now and they wouldn\u2019t even acknowledge us.\u201d</p><p>I considered his words and for the most part I understood, they were like mindless zombies with one thing on their minds\u2014finding the one who summoned them. Still, it didn\u2019t ease my mind to know I could run smack dab into another demon.</p><p>\u201cI could go the rest of my life without seeing another demon and that\u2019d still be too soon.\u201d I stopped in my tracks. \u201cYou said we wouldn\u2019t see any,\u201d I accused like it was his fault one popped out and attacked us.</p> <p>\u201cI guess I jinxed us, but at least now you know what they look like.\u201d His reasoning left something to be desired.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long Dorian and I walked around in the darkness, but my legs cramped and a splitting headache was trying its damnest to shatter my skull. I was tired; the rush of adrenaline had long since vanished and left me drained. After what seemed like forever, Dorian stopped and pointed out what he categorized as a veil\u2014a thinning in the in-between. Either he was pulling my leg, or I was just too tired to see it. Stepping through the veil, Dorian and I were greeted with a purple smeared sky. The brightness, although muted by the late hour of the day, was blinding. I closed my eyes against the sudden change of light and took turns peeking out of each eye. The straining on my eyes caused my head to explode in pain. When I got my bearings and my eyesight back, I realized we were still in Moon.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said with disbelief. We entered the ghostly realm in the morning and had walked for who knows how long, we should have been halfway across the state by now. Yet, the peaks of the NAWC\u2019s castle protruded just over the trees and small stone buildings lined the cobblestone roads, the smell of food and wood smoke wafted on the breeze\u2014my stomach rumbled in response.</p><p>\u201cTime works a bit different in the realm of the dead,\u201d Dorian explained.</p><p>I grumbled, moody from being chased by a demon, walking for hours, and not eating for even longer. Not to mention the strange tension that tethered Dorian and I together and left me in a constant state of nervousness around him now.</p><p>\u201cWorst. Fieldtrip. Ever!\u201d I snapped and set off towards the castle where I planned to crawl into my warm bed and try and forget this day ever happened.</p><p>14</p><p>As awareness returned to me, I stretched my muscles against cool crisp bed sheets. Buttery gold light beams shone through the windows, lighting the space in a tranquil peacefulness I hadn\u2019t experienced since getting involved in the brew case with the FPD a month ago. My life turned into a dark dangerous place where spirits lurked and vampires hunted. A life where every new face was called into question and every choice second guessed. I hated this life, hated the instability of it all and the suspicions that shaded it.</p><p>The scent of jasmine wafted on the breeze carried in by an open window. The sheer ivory curtains danced against its gentle caress and the chirping of birds serenaded the morning. My body was rejuvenated and whole again, a feeling I hadn\u2019t expected to return since I was no longer just a shop owner or a simple witch from Flora. Darkness was intertwined in my soul and had led me down the path of summoning spirits and jumping into realities where demons prowled. Sunshine and summer breezes didn\u2019t fit in that world.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, beautiful,\u201d a male voice chimed and reminded me of tranquility and love. My body lifted into a sitting position and looked at Aiden. He stood beside the open window, his shirt flapping against the wind. His ebony hair was disheveled, his blue eyes brighter than I\u2019d ever seen them. A genuine smile lit his face, and I found myself smiling in response. He was beautiful, and he was mine. The thought was almost too much to bear.</p><p>He was the only thing that mattered, the only thing I saw in a world filled with distractions.</p><p>Streams of sunlight lit his face and chest as my eyes devoured him.</p><p>Wait, sunlight?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re standing in the sun,\u201d I whispered as I drank in the vision of him. Every one of his features came alive in its warm glow.</p><p>\u201cSo I am,\u201d Aiden said with amusement. Walking over to the bed, he threw back the covers and lay down. His arms encircled my waist, muscles stretching as he guided my body towards his. Facing each other, our lips inches apart, we stared at each other. The moment was perfect, one I never wanted to end. I could live the rest of my life in bed with Aiden and just stare at him while the wind blew and the birds sang just outside my window.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d Aiden said after a few moments.</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d I responded through my foggy mind of relaxation.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go to the council. Don\u2019t let them drink from you.\u201d</p><p>I had forgotten about that world, forgotten about my responsibilities and problems, and I didn\u2019t want to be reminded of it when everything inside my bedroom was wonderful and warm. What lay beyond my door was stressful, dangerous, and deadly, I didn\u2019t want to leave the comfort of my bed to acknowledge it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d I spoke against his lips. His power sizzled all around me, claiming me, caressing me, controlling me. My body was his and yearned for those large hands to touch it.</p><p>\u201cWe must, everything depends on it,\u201d Aiden replied, his jaw tightening as he tried to keep his voice calm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pushed through the fog and concentrated on his words, the seriousness in his eyes and the tightness of his muscles. \u201cYou wanted me to, it was your idea,\u201d I told him bewildered. I resented my problems for ruining this moment. Our bodies should have been entwining in the sheets as a layer of sweat collected against our skin, and the only words that should be spoken were moans, not about the council or death.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m allowed to change my mind, am I not?\u201d A smile spread across his lips.</p><p>\u201cBut what about Ian?\u201d</p> <p>Aiden stared into my eyes and was quiet for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ll handle him.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to believe he could track Ian down and kill him, but if that happened, he could be killed himself. Ian was older which meant he was stronger. Add to the fact Ian drank brew on a regular basis and had magical capabilities I still hadn\u2019t learned, made what Aiden proposed impossible. Ian was all around stronger and wiser than both of us, and the VC was the key to my salvation. I didn\u2019t care about the price I had to pay for freedom, it was small In the grand scheme of things.</p><p>Aiden\u2019s mouth met my willing lips. His power surged against my skin, igniting my already peaked desire. It was more powerful than before, like the pure essence of him had been supercharged. I gasped and panted as it continued to poke and prod at my flesh. My entire body was on fire and I needed him to quench it. In one swift move, Aiden ripped my tiny shorts and tank top off of my body and positioned himself between my legs. His eyes were black and burned with an intensity I hadn\u2019t seen before. Before I could question it, he buried himself within me, and I choked on my concerns. Something was wrong, I knew it, yet I couldn\u2019t decipher what it was. Aiden was being rough; his hands on my hips dug into my flesh as he directed me against his hardness, each time harder and faster than the last.</p><p>\u201cAiden, stop,\u201d I said between clenched teeth. When I looked up his face flickered like film. Blinking, I looked again and saw Ian Despereaux in his place. Yelping, I tried to snap my legs shut and kick against him, but he was stronger than me and held them open.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, little witch?\u201d His face was a mixture of confusion and coyness and back to looking like Aiden.</p> <p>\u201cStop!\u201d I screamed. If I had any doubts about my sanity, I didn\u2019t now\u2014only Ian called me little witch. \u201cIan stop!\u201d It all made sense now, the fact he was standing in the sun, my dreamy relaxed state, the intensity of his power, and the rough way he handled me, I had been snagged from my sleep and brought into another one of Ian\u2019s dream worlds. Ethan and Fiona\u2019s blocking spell didn\u2019t last or he found a way to break it, either way, I was in danger.</p><p>His hips stopped moving, but he didn\u2019t withdrawal from me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Gwen?\u201d Aiden\u2019s voice asked. He looked so much like Aiden, even his voice was the same, making me second guess myself.</p><p>\u201cGet away from me.\u201d The man\u2019s face changed in quick succession from Aiden\u2019s to Ian\u2019s. Watching the bizarre transformation was dizzying. Squeezing my eyes shut, I shot my hands out ready to blast whoever was in front of me with magic. My palms tingled as my power raced through my veins and settled within my hands ready to be directed. I opened my eyes and just as the bright light of magic left my fingertips, my sunny bedroom and the man disappeared. I blinked a few times and realized I was safe, but not alone.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d</p><p>Rubbing my eyes so I could focus, Holly stood in my doorway with a look of concern changing her face into something that looked trustworthy, but I wasn\u2019t fooled.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in my room?\u201d I pivoted my eyes around my room. I was still on edge, shaky and nervous from the dream, Holly\u2019s appearance didn\u2019t help. I didn\u2019t trust her one little bit.</p> <p>\u201cYou were screaming, the entire castle heard you. Have a bad dream?\u201d She flipped on my bedroom light and walked into the room. She was wearing a long navy dress with long sleeves and a V-neck that was adorned with white beads. Her auburn hair was braided down her back and her steely green eyes inspected me disapproval.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess I did,\u201d I told her. The dream felt so real. I glanced down at my clothes just to make sure I wasn\u2019t lying there naked. Sure enough, my pajamas were intact. When Ian visited me in my dreams before there were always signs of his being there, but this time nothing remained. My clothes weren\u2019t torn to shreds and my body hadn\u2019t been violated. I wasn\u2019t sure what happened and that scared me.</p><p>\u201cIs there something you want to tell me, Gwen?\u201d Holly stood next to my bed with her arms crossed. I thought about all the things I should tell her, being bonded to Ian, his dream visits, how he could speak to me through telepathy, and the plan to allow the VC to drink from me in order to break the bond. I wanted to confide in someone, to have another brain thinking of a way to fix the situation, but would Holly be helpful or condemn me for treason? I wouldn\u2019t put it past her to throw me into the dungeon thinking I formed the bond with Ian to be his spy. War did crazy things to people\u2019s minds, and Holly\u2019s was bloodthirsty. There were enough people gunning for my blood, could I afford to add one more to the list?</p><p>\u201cWhat have you heard of Ian Despereaux?\u201d I filled my voice with cool detachment. The NAWC had to know who he was, he was the one who\u2019d found a way to extract the power in witches blood and shared it with his people. Because of him, vampires killed witches and our two species were enemies. Because of him, my world had turned upside down and inside out.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d Holly responded. I didn\u2019t expect her to spill the beans on what the council knew. Now was the moment where I could release my secret once and for all, let the NAWC into my personal hell and let the chips fall where they may.</p><p>\u201cI have been keeping something from the council,\u201d I began while my gut filled with an angry sea of nerves and nausea. Maybe a small part of me, a part that didn\u2019t want to admit it, hoped the NAWC would know a way to break the bond, and I wouldn\u2019t have to gift my blood. Another part, a part that scared the hell out of me, was worried I may enjoy being bit. If a vampire wanted to grant you the gift of euphoria with the bite, he or she could. I\u2019d experienced a vampire bite a handful of times, but they were enough to curl my toes and develop a craving for it. I didn\u2019t think about that though, I filed it away in the denial section of my brain\u2014an area that was quickly becoming crowded.</p><p>\u201cI figured you have been,\u201d Holly remarked. \u201cGwen, we are your family. If you can\u2019t confide in us, then who can you? I know you don\u2019t agree with my methods, but it\u2019s my job to watch out for our people and as hard as it may be, you have to trust the council\u2019s decisions.\u201d</p><p>Just when I thought Holly couldn\u2019t wrap me around her little finger, there I was snug around her pinkie. She had a way with words. She made you want to believe every word she was saying. In truth, the witches were my family, but could I trust them? Doubtful. But I wanted to, needed to, have someone else on my side. I still had no clue what Ian Despereaux was planning; he was a master at games, and I was starting to feel like a pawn where someone else was moving me around the game board. The only question was, how long before someone took me out of the game? And who would that someone be?</p> <p>I watched her for a moment. \u201cI am bonded to Ian Despereaux.\u201d I figured however Holly decided to punish me would be worth it if she knew how to free me of Ian. I tried to be strong, but the stress of his voice in my head, the sexual dreams, learning my spirit walker powers, gifting my blood to the VC, and every other problem I was facing was a weight too heavy to bear alone.</p><p>Maybe a part of me, the dark part everyone has but never acknowledges, wanted Holly to put me out of my misery. My mother used to say, God never gives you more than you can handle, but it sure as hell felt like He\u2019d dished out an extra helping of drama for me. Could I handle it? Probably. If I made it through, would it drive me insane? I didn\u2019t doubt it. Was it worth it? That was a question I still wasn\u2019t sure of. Of course life was worth it, but my life wasn\u2019t your average run of the mill life. My life turned into a puzzle where none of the pieces fit. I didn\u2019t notice Holly\u2019s change in demeanor while I was having my internal conversation. When my eyes found hers, they were stone. Her entire body was rigid and unmoving as she stared dumbfounded at me. Whatever she assumed I was keeping from her, obviously this wasn\u2019t it.</p><p>\u201cHolly?\u201d I reached my hand out and set it on her arm. Flinching, she took a step back, her head shaking from side to side.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be,\u201d she said, her voice a mere whisper.</p><p>The shock on her face was enough to get me out of bed. I edged closer, unsure what to think. Holly was a confident woman, but right now she looked like a lost little girl. Her eyes were wide as they stared the floor. Her head shook like she was discounting an unspoken thought, and her entire body, which normally stood tall, sagged.</p><p>\u201cI found a way to break it.\u201d I kept my voice positive, hoping the tone would shake her out of the funk. Holly dragged her gaze from the floor and met mine. There was confusion, hurt, and anger in those glassy green eyes\u2014emotions I didn\u2019t understand. Anger was a given, I expected that, but where did the hurt and confusion come from? It wasn\u2019t unheard of that a vampire bonded with someone, even a witch, but that usually meant a relationship was established. In my case, the bond was made out of deceit. I had no clue why Ian wanted to bond himself to me, but whatever the reason, it was for his own personal gain in one way or another.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Holly mumbled.</p><p>I was silent for a moment as I considered how she would react to more bad news. \u201cAiden has talked the VC into breaking the bond, but they want a meeting with the NAWC. They have a solution to end the war.\u201d</p><p>Holly was quiet for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ll call them and set up a meeting.\u201d Without another word, she turned and left my room.</p><p>15</p><p>Two days passed after I told Holly about my bond with Ian. She stuck to her word and called the VC. I didn\u2019t question why she acted so funny or so willing to speak with the vampire council, I was just happy things were working out. The vampires were arriving tonight where they would lay out their plan for peace amongst our species. Holly ordered me to stay nearby just in case the VC decided to break my bond tonight. I doubted they would, they\u2019d most likely invite me to their headquarters so they could take their time drinking from me\u2014a thought I didn\u2019t want to spend too much time on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I headed outside. The sky was a mixture of night and day; light blue with streaks of oranges and pinks. The sun hovered behind the clouds making them glow with brilliance. Releasing a heavy breath, my body relaxed the tiniest bit at the notion my life may go back to normal. Not having Ian in my head or visiting my dreams was enough to make me giddy. Not to mention whatever his plan was for me, it wouldn\u2019t unfold like he thought.</p><p>I walked down the cobblestone road with my spirits high. Moon was designed to look like a small English town. I\u2019d never been to England, but from what I\u2019d seen in movies, it looked like it would fit right in.</p><p>Downtown Moon was a single street with businesses on either side. Each building was constructed out of brick or smooth river rock. The roofs were thatched and tall chimneys climbed along the sides and flooded the air with the smell of burning wood and cooking food\u2014a smell I loved. Worn wooden signs dangled and swayed above the businesses doors. I headed towards The Cooking Cauldron, one of four restaurants in the town.</p> <p>When I pushed through the door, my eyes immediately found Dorian\u2019s. He sat along the wall in a booth with a tall mug of frothy beer. He sat back, his hand on the beer, and watched me. The blonde sitting across from him didn\u2019t seem to notice he wasn\u2019t listening to a word she said. Lowering my gaze, I headed towards an empty booth by the window. Since our \u201cfieldtrip\u201d I hadn\u2019t seen him and wasn\u2019t sure how to be around him. The tension between us confused and scared me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll have, dear?\u201d the waitress asked, holding a pad and pen.</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019ll have a Corona, and I\u2019ll need a moment to decide on the food,\u201d I told her with a smile. I wasn\u2019t going to allow Dorian\u2019s presence to upset my good mood. I came here to enjoy some food and have a normal night, and that\u2019s what I was going to do.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d the waitress walked away.</p><p>As I scanned the menu, I could feel Dorian\u2019s eyes on my back. It was just my luck he turned up at the place I decided to go. I yearned for the day I could return to Flora and not have to worry about him or any of the other witches and their judgmental looks.</p> <p>\u201cSo, have you decided?\u201d The waitressed asked as she set my Corona in front of me. I hadn\u2019t been paying attention to the menu, so I picked the first item that caught my eye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the roasted chicken and vegetables,\u201d I told her.</p><p>When she walked away, I leaned back, took a sip of my beer and stared out the window. It\u2019d been a while since I could relax and get lost in my thoughts. I had been training nonstop since I arrived in Moon. My mind wandered to Fiona. I hadn\u2019t seen much of her since we\u2019d gotten here. She met Ethan and spent most of her time with him learning how to mix potions, which was okay, but I felt like she was avoiding me. Fiona and I met when we were sixteen, and at the time, we found something in each other which satisfied our needs for friendship. Now we were twenty-six, and I wasn\u2019t sure if we were friends simply because it was convenient or if our friendship was genuine. Fiona was there in my times of need, but she\u2019d also abandoned other times. People, like the seasons, change. Maybe Fiona and I were growing apart, and we just didn\u2019t want to acknowledge it. We were so different I wondered how we became friends in the first place. Or maybe our lives were just taking different paths away from each other. Either way our friendship was hanging on by a thread, and that was a sad thought.</p><p>I let my mind move on to happier thoughts, Aiden. Thinking of him always made me smile. If life would allow me to, I\u2019d stay wrapped in his arms and feel safe forever. If I was a live wire, then he was what grounded me. A lighthouse that guided me to safety when I was lost.</p><p>My cell phone rang, bringing me out of my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi, Gwen,\u201d Penny said. We hadn\u2019t spoken since the night I witnessed the car accident and saw Dorian for the first time.</p><p>\u201cHi, Penny. I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t called you back. How is the shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, business has been steady. I just wanted to let you know what my big idea was,\u201d she said, her voice nervous.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI set up a website where people can buy online. Right now you only reach residents of Flora. This way you can sell to everyone, even humans. Our entire inventory is linked to the website so we\u2019re not selling stuff that may not be in stock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an excellent idea! Remind me to give you a raise when I get back,\u201d I laughed. Broomsticks did enough business to keep the doors open, but that was about it. If Penny\u2019s online store worked, then that\u2019d be another aspect of my life I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about.</p><p>\u201cNo big deal, I had fun setting it up,\u201d she paused. \u201cHow\u2019s Moon?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t tell her what was happening. While she was mature and reliable, she was also young and didn\u2019t need to worry about a war that might not occur.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to come home. The NAWC is a pain.\u201d Penny knew witches were being bled dry for the sole purpose of vampires getting high and absorbing magic, but she didn\u2019t know exactly why the NAWC called Fiona and me to Moon. The council didn\u2019t include children in their affairs, and in their eyes Penny was still considered a child.</p><p>\u201cI bet. Well we miss you and hope you come home soon,\u201d Penny said with an upbeat tone.</p><p>\u201cThanks, I miss you guys too!\u201d</p><p>When I hung up the phone, the waitress set down my food. There wasn\u2019t a lot of time to sit down to a full meal since I arrived, so I planned on savoring this one. The food on the plate smelled like heaven and tasted better.</p><p>I watched as rain pelted the window and the sky darkened. The VC would be arriving soon, and hopefully, that meant my bond with Ian would be disappearing very soon too. The bell above the door chimed, bringing my attention away from my food. Dorian had an arm wrapped around the blonde\u2019s waist, and just before she left, he glanced in my direction. His sunglasses were perched on his nose, but that didn\u2019t distract from the look of turmoil contorting his facial features. His jaw was tight, and his brows drew together as if he was debating some internal question. I smiled and nodded towards the blonde. He didn\u2019t appreciate my praise; he shook his head and walked out. I couldn\u2019t help the connection that formed between Dorian and me, but I could ignore it and that\u2019s precisely what I planned to do. Whether he could or not was another story.</p><p>After dinner, I made my way around town. Moon wasn\u2019t very big but walking through it was just what I needed. The solitude and fresh air brought me out of the funk that had taken over my life. Rain spit from the sky leaving me damp and dewy, and I watched as lights illuminated windows and the tree branches swayed in the night air. Clouds crept along the darkened sky while the full moon backlit them in a silvery glow. The breeze had just the right amount of crispness and left me rejuvenated from its cool caress.</p><p>Everything is going to be okay. I thought to myself. I hadn\u2019t been this happy since arriving in this town. If it all went as planned, then the two councils would come to a understanding, and Fiona and I could be on the next plane back to Flora where I could see Aiden as often as I liked. Moon wasn\u2019t the most understanding town, the witches tended to think only their opinions mattered.</p><p>The price of my freedom crawled into my brain and squashed some of the happiness. Six vampires would drink from me. All at once? One at a time? Would I wither and moan in pleasure or cry out in pain? Did the VC get off on making it hurt or would they devour the feeling of controlling my body through euphoria and horniness? It was an intimate situation, one I never planned to share with anyone other than Aiden. The one time he bit me was a memory I wanted to keep solely between us. But the universe didn\u2019t grant that wish. Since then Ian tainted the memory by drinking from me and now the council would do the same. I hated it. I didn\u2019t think the VC would accept a simple thank you card instead of the gift of my blood. Vampires include blood in everything from bonds, gifts, vows and so on, one way or another, blood was always their desired payment. Aiden once said my blood was strong, stronger than any he ever had. What did that mean? Why was it so strong? Was it because I walked between both realities and the blood running through my veins was a mixture of life and death?</p><p>Complaining about it wouldn\u2019t help. The price was high, but the risk of staying bonded to Ian was higher. My mind wandered to the dream last night while my feet wandered towards the small park in the middle of town. Did Ian try to trick me into thinking he was Aiden so he could have sex with me or to convince me not to allow the VC to break the bond? What was his angle? Did I even care? Aside from random visits to my dreams and mind, Ian had been scarce. If he had a plan, what was taking him so long to execute it? Would he still come for me once the bond was broken? Ian stirred a plethora of questions, ones he could answer. I knew the only real solution to my problems would be his death. I fantasized about killing him multiple times, seeing the look of surprise and anguish on his beautiful face as I drove a stake through his heart. Even now the thought made me smile.</p><p>I stepped around a bench and sat. A large pond with a small waterfall was in the middle of the circled park and large oak trees stood guard around the perimeter while wrought iron lampposts lent a warm glow. Wisteria, in full bloom, climbed the wooden pergola that the benches were nestled in. I enjoyed the illusion of privacy they offered. Inhaling the floral scent all around me, I closed my eyes and released the breath slowly, a sense of peace overcoming me. But it was short lived as my eyes snapped open at the sound of approaching footsteps.</p><p>Kye gave me a sheepish smile in apology. \u201cHolly would like to see you.\u201d</p><p>I grumbled and said, \u201cWhy are you so loyal to her? I mean I understand she\u2019s a member of our council, but you\u2019re overly loyal, why?\u201d The witches showed the council respect, but they didn\u2019t wait on the sidelines to do their bidding like he did. I smiled. \u201cAre you two in a relationship?\u201d</p><p>Kye walked over and sat down while he stared straight ahead. His spiky brown hair was limp from the drizzle and his soft brown eyes were hard. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a relationship. As far as I know, Holly has only ever loved one man and hasn\u2019t been with anyone since.\u201d Kye paused, his eyes shifting towards me. \u201cWe have an arrangement.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Like everything else Kye told me, his answer was vague. \u201cWhat kind of arrangement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kind that is none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh but it\u2019s okay for the entire population of Moon to know my business?\u201d I snapped and rose from the bench. The air was cooler as the rain picked up.</p> <p>\u201cYou have enough problems. Do you really want to add one more?\u201d Kye tilted his head, a small smile on his lips.</p><p>I watched him for a few seconds and wondered who he was. I knew he was a warlock who was Holly\u2019s go to man, but who was he? What was his life like, where was he from, and what kind of arrangement could he have that would be worth putting up with Holly? When I met people it wasn\u2019t enough just to know the basics about them, my curiosity wanted to get to the root of what made them who they are. It was the only way I felt I could trust someone or at least anticipate their moves.</p><p>\u201cDorian says you\u2019re a quick learner.\u201d Kye changed the subject.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI guess. I can sense death and summoned the ghosts Holly requested, but I\u2019m still learning how to jump between realities and to recognize the shimmers, or safe spots as Dorian calls them.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019d been a couple days since I\u2019d trained or even talked to Dorian. I suspected he was avoiding me because of our connection. The Angel of Death didn\u2019t seem like the type to be in a relationship or buy a girl flowers. Could he even have sex? Sure he looked like a gorgeous human male, but was that just a glamour? Dorian could change his appearance like he changed his socks. When I thought about Dorian my curiosity jumped up and down in anticipation to learn about him. Not knowing what someone is capable of is dangerous. Dorian had shown a moment of anger when he grabbed me from bed, but the emotion fled as fast as it came.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty quick. Usually it takes a few months for spirit walkers to learn their abilities,\u201d Kye said.</p><p>\u201cNo biggie, I\u2019m learning them to make Holly happy. Once I\u2019m back in Flora, I\u2019ll return to being just another witch who owns a magic shop.\u201d I meant what I said. I didn\u2019t want anything to do with calling spirits from the realm of the dead or running into demons. I even had doubts about helping the Flora Police Department should they ever request my help again. The Bridget Downing case snowballed and left me with nothing but trouble. As much as I wanted a normal life, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have one again. Spirit walkers were few and far between and finding one that wasn\u2019t insane was more difficult. Would I eventually end up like Kye\u2019s sister, just a fragment of my former self?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Irene said,\u201d Kye mumbled.</p><p>I half turned to look at him, not sure what he meant. He was leaning his elbows on his knees and raised his head to look at me.</p><p>\u201cIrene was scared at first, when she learned what she was, but the curiosity pulled her in and before long she couldn\u2019t get enough of jumping between realities.\u201d</p><p>I paused for a moment. \u201cWhy is she trapped? Why can\u2019t she just slip into a shimmer and come back?\u201d Not that a woman like her should be traipsing around town, but a nice mental institution would do her a world of good. It sure beat being stuck in the realm of death with demons.</p> <p>\u201cShe can\u2019t. Her magic has been stripped and even if it hadn\u2019t, her mind is gone. She has no clue who I am or who she was. \u201d Kye\u2019s voice was unsteady. He coughed to cover up his unease, \u201cWe should get back; Holly doesn\u2019t like to be kept waiting.\u201d</p><p>I pushed through the large double doors that led to a parlor, my entire body soaked and dripping water on the antique Persian rug. Eleven heads turned in my direction, and I froze. All six of the VC members were in attendance as was Aiden, Dorian, and three of the NAWC members. Aiden\u2019s lips twitched in an inconspicuous smile, but straightened out as fast as it came. Dorian looked away as soon as he saw me, and the six VC members stared at me like I was dinner\u2014or at least a tasty appetizer. Some of their eyes focused on my throat while others raked their gazes up and down my body.</p><p>\u201cSorry to interrupt, Kye said you wanted to see me?\u201d Looking away from the unsettling looks of the VC, I concentrated on Holly\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYes, please sit down, Ms. Sparks,\u201d Holly gestured towards an open seat. My shoes squished with each step until I sat down. The energy was overpowering and suffocating. I gripped the arms of my chair as I tried not to gasp. Vampires were capable of projecting an invisible energy that felt like prickles along my skin. Some say they use it to attract their prey, it snags our minds and peaks our interest. Aiden\u2019s often felt like a soft caress against my skin, but the VC\u2019s power was amped up like a horde of hungry lions. Glancing at the NAWC, they didn\u2019t seem to be affected by the VC\u2019s power. I dug my nails into the thick fabric of the chair to keep from arching my back and moaning.</p><p>\u201cI believe you are causing Gwen unease,\u201d Patrick said with a laugh.</p><p>Shit, they could tell? Had I moaned or spread my legs unladylike?</p><p>\u201cOur apologies, we find ourselves intrigued by Ms. Sparks,\u201d a woman with long honey locks said as she trailed a cherry red fingernail across her lips. I wondered if this woman was Alana, Aiden\u2019s ex who also happened to murder his family.</p><p>The weight of their power receded, and I could breathe again. I kept my gaze down as I steadied my heartbeat and allowed the waves of desire to fade. I hated vampires had this power over us, although my council didn\u2019t seem to be affected by it. Perhaps they bewitched themselves into being immune.</p> <p>\u201cGwen, the VC has enlightened us of your deal,\u201d Holly began. She did a good job of controlling the anger in her voice, but the tightness in her lips and hands gave her away\u2014she was pissed. Here she was trying to stop vampires from drinking from us, and I offered my neck up like a happy meal. Patrick, Holly, and James stared bullets at me as they waited confirmation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way,\u201d I started. \u201cAs far as I know, no one can break a vampire bond without a death sentence from either the VC or the bonded vampire.\u201d I looked up at Aiden, but he kept his gaze straight ahead. That was weird. Maybe he didn\u2019t want to call attention to his feelings in front of the VC. Maybe Alana still carried a torch and would rip my head off just to spite Aiden. Whatever the reason, it made me uneasy.</p><p>Holly\u2019s laugh drew my focus away from Aiden and towards her. \u201cSo you confide in vampires instead of your own? Did you not think we could protect you better or that you could trust us more than the bloodsuckers?\u201d Her voice grew louder and louder, and when she was done, the energy in the room pressed down on me again. The so called bloodsuckers apparently didn\u2019t appreciate Holly\u2019s nickname. A quiet rumble echoed from Aaron\u2019s throat, and the whites in his eyes turned black.</p><p>\u201cWe are royalty, and you will treat us as such, We came to you to settle this matter, not listen to your petty insults,\u201d Aaron bit out. He may have looked like a seventeen year old boy, but there was nothing innocent or fragile about him. If he wanted to, he could rip Holly\u2019s throat out before anyone would even notice he moved.</p><p>\u201cYou are royalty to your people, not mine,\u201d Holly snapped back. A slight glow radiated from her palms as her magic rushed to her hands. Vampires eyes turned black when they are mad, but a witch has magic rush to his or her hands ready to defend ourselves if need be. The room filled with glowing palms and black eyes, and the air grew heavy as both sides adrenaline picked up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan?\u201d I asked the VC to help get back on topic; we didn\u2019t need a mini war breaking out in the parlor.</p><p>The blonde woman shifted her head towards me, a slow devious smile curling her cherry red lips up. \u201cWe plan to use you as bait to capture Ian Despereaux.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I shrieked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s absurd,\u201d Patrick added.</p><p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d Dorian growled.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should hear them out.\u201d All eyes turned towards Aiden. My mouth hung open, and my heart stopped beating for a second. He thought it was a good idea? Dorian snorted and arched his eyebrows at me, a look that said \u201cI told you so,\u201d but I refused to believe Aiden was malicious or bloodthirsty as Dorian thought.</p><p>\u201cMy Gwen,\u201d Aiden walked around the antique sofa and knelt beside my chair. \u201cIan is taken with you. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s carnal or if it\u2019s just for your strong blood, but you may be the only way to reach him. You\u2019ll have backup, I promise I won\u2019t let him hurt you.\u201d Aiden rose and stood behind my chair.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are the VC, why can\u2019t you capture him?\u201d I shot towards Aaron.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know where he is. You are bonded to him, therefore you can contact him anytime you want, even sense when he\u2019s close. You are our best bet to finding him.\u201d</p><p>The last time I was in Flora, Micah told me the VC killed those involved in the brew distribution. At the time, I thought they were just silencing the ones who\u2019d been caught, but now I wasn\u2019t so sure. Maybe they wanted peace between our races, or maybe their smokescreen was fooling me. In this game there wasn\u2019t anyone who could be trusted until proven otherwise. It seemed everyone had their own agenda, and because my luck was shit, I was included in those plans. For Holly, I was the spirit walker who could control the spirits of our enemies\u2019 victims. For the VC, I was the one who\u2019d wiggle on the hook to catch the crafty Ian Despereaux. And for Dorian, well I was still in the dark about what role he played.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d I started and rose from the chair where I walked with confidence over to the large stone fireplace. \u201cI\u2019m not the only spirit walker in the world. Why do you all act like I\u2019m your new favorite toy? I don\u2019t have any other abilities than any other spirit walker would have. Why don\u2019t you hassle them and let me get back to my life in Flora?\u201d I\u2019d gladly push the problems I was facing onto someone else if that meant I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with Holly and the VC anymore. Of course, I\u2019d feel guilty as hell for their new spirit walker.</p><p>\u201cBut you are different,\u201d the blonde said, rising from the couch to walk over to me. Her body was thin and lithe like a panther, but her eyes were dangerous and deadly like a shark. The beads on the purple flapper dress she wore swished as she walked closer, and with a graceful hand, she tossed her long blonde hair over her shoulder. She was beautiful. The kind of beautiful that made me wonder what in the hell Aiden saw in me. I was pretty, but standing next to her, I looked like an awkward loser. The fact my clothes and hair were soaked didn\u2019t help my appearance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re Alana, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I questioned when she stood in front of me. I hated that Aiden\u2019s hands had, at one time, been on her body and that she held power over him.</p><p>\u201cI see our Aiden has been talking about me.\u201d She laughed and turned to face Aiden. \u201cAll good things, I hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just mentioned you were Aaron\u2019s sister,\u201d I told her and smiled when annoyance crept onto her face.</p> <p>\u201cYes, well I was a little bit more than that back then. Wasn\u2019t I, amante?\u201d Alana sent a saucy smile towards Aiden, and I fisted my hands so tightly my nails dug into my skin. I didn\u2019t know a lot of Italian, except for the few words Aiden taught me, but I knew what amante meant\u2014lover. Alana turned her smile towards me and winked for good measure. I wanted to rip her pretty blonde hair out, but I decided to play it cool, if she saw how much she got to me, she\u2019d win, and I wasn\u2019t about to let that happen.</p><p>\u201cHe is a great amante, isn\u2019t he? You know, just the other night he worked me so hard I thought my heart would burst.\u201d</p><p>Aiden coughed while Dorian shifted uncomfortably, but I didn\u2019t care about them, I cared about the look of fury on Alana\u2019s face. I smiled and turned away from her.</p><p>\u201cIf you two are done staking your claim on Aiden\u2019s sexual talents, we have business to discuss,\u201d Aaron said bored.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I glanced at the man in question. Aiden smiled and shook his head. I shrugged and winked.</p> <p>\u201cIf this was just a matter of having a spirit walker on our side, we\u2019d be happy to search the globe for another one,\u201d Holly said. \u201cFrankly, you\u2019ve been nothing but trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d I questioned. \u201cI\u2019ve done everything you\u2019ve asked without explanation. I put my entire life on hold to help you out, not that I had a choice.\u201d I was done playing the silent subject and done with playing the victim. Both councils needed me, which meant I had power.</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019ve learned your powers, but I suspect that had something to do with the teacher. But had you told us you were bonded to Ian Despereaux in the first place, you wouldn\u2019t have had to train. You\u2019re nothing but a liability now. Ian probably knows our plans, and therefore, they won\u2019t work. You\u2019ve wasted weeks of training. And while we\u2019re on the subject of your devoted commitment, did you not sneak off to see him?\u201d Holly pointed a finger at Aiden.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the enemy. The enemy is Ian and his followers, those who kill witches for their blood. As far as I know, Aiden isn\u2019t in that category.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe key words being \u2018as far as you know\u2019. He\u2019s a vampire, and he\u2019s drank from you for the sole purpose of his brew addiction, did he not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen he\u2019s the enemy!\u201d Holly shouted. \u201cThey\u2019re all monsters who would just as soon drain you as look at you. Your ignorance is going to get you killed, Gwen.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps she was right, my life had become more dangerous since I invited vampires into it, but if that meant I\u2019d die beside Aiden, then I wouldn\u2019t regret my decisions. I did what I thought was right, and whether or not Holly or anyone else agreed was moot. I couldn\u2019t live my life dictated by others or around what people may think. I was dating a vampire, but more importantly, I was in love with a vampire. Holly\u2019s prejudice against him wouldn\u2019t sway me.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Aaron roared. \u201cI swear you humans are nothing but petulant children who whine and complain. We came here to discuss peace. How are we supposed to do that when you don\u2019t even have peace in your kingdom?\u201d</p><p>Some supernaturals took offence to being called human, but witches were as close to them as any other. I didn\u2019t mind being referred to as a human, my family was human. It made me feel like I was still connected to Rebekah, my sister, in some way\u2014like we were the same.</p><p>\u201cSince you can\u2019t handle this situation, I will,\u201d Aaron snapped at Holly.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking,\u201d I said to Aaron, \u201cHow is capturing Ian Despereaux going to end the addiction to brew? The secret of our blood is out, and whether he\u2019s alive or not, the vampires won\u2019t just give up on draining witches.\u201d</p><p>Aaron circled the room, his hands in his trouser pockets. It was strange that someone who looked so young had so much power. I couldn\u2019t imagine being stuck in a teenager\u2019s body for eternity. The only part of him that lent any sort of clue about his age was his eyes. They were more mature than his young face from the things he witnessed over the years. I still wasn\u2019t sure how old he was.</p><p>\u201cWe have ten vampires held prisoner we believe are coconspirators. Ian can\u2019t distribute the blood by himself. Our plan is to allow your council to kill them, and my people will see your strength and willingness to fight back. We have sent out a message that any vampire caught drinking witches\u2019 blood will be sentenced to death. It may take a while for the message to sink in, but if there\u2019s one thing a vampire values more than a good blood, it\u2019s their life. Most have become a vampire for the pure reason of having eternal youth; they won\u2019t want to risk losing that for a taste of brew.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the catch?\u201d Holly interrupted.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I know you aren\u2019t volunteering to help us out of the kindness of your heart.\u201d</p><p>Aaron tilted his head. A mischievous smile crawled onto his lips. \u201cEverything has a price, but the main reason is because I don\u2019t want our two species at war for forever, and that\u2019s how long it\u2019d be. Do you think if you didn\u2019t have our support, the vampires would cease their killings? We rule the vampires, and they know our threats are far more dangerous than yours.</p><p>If I had a guess, I\u2019d say their price included blood. Vampires had lifetimes to accumulate money. Their greed rested in the red liquid that flowed through their victims\u2019 veins. Even though blood banks were set up all across the country to accommodate the vampires thirst and keep the humans safe, they still enjoyed drinking right from the source. Aiden had a small supply of bagged blood at his home, but as far as I knew, he didn\u2019t drink it. He would find willing donors and sate his hunger that way. The fact that the women he fed on felt desire and lust for him was something I tried to put out of my mind. The other option was for him to cause his donors pain, and that wouldn\u2019t be okay with me. Knowing your boyfriend was out stroking other women\u2019s libidos with his venom was just par for the course when dating a vampire.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want to know,\u201d I spoke up. \u201cIs how is this news about the effects of witches blood just now being revealed? As of a month ago, I didn\u2019t even know our blood could do this. How has the secret been kept all this time? And what changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a question your NAWC would have to answer. I\u2019ve drunk from witches in my past and never felt the effects,\u201d Aaron answered. \u201cIf I had to guess, I\u2019d say you have a traitor amongst yourselves.\u201d</p><p>The members of the NAWC all shifted, their eyes darting to one another, which made me more curious as to what they were hiding. There was something they knew that they didn\u2019t want their loyal subjects finding out.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d I questioned my council members. Was this what Kye and Dorian knew and kept from me. Was a deal offered to Kye for his silence? I still didn\u2019t know how Dorian fit into the scenario. He isn\u2019t a witch or bound to serve them, so what deal did he have with Holly?</p><p>Holly stood, crossed her arms, and walked off to the side. \u201cOur Goddess intertwined a spell into our blood so the secret wouldn\u2019t be revealed to those who sought our blood,\u201d she spoke low like she was remembering some ancient text she\u2019d once read. \u201cThe spell bewitched any vampire who tasted our blood to forget the taste of it. For centuries we have been taught to not allow the vampires to feed from us as a cautionary measure should the spell not work. It was a way to preserve our species and our magic. The Goddess\u2019 gift lay in our veins, a gift that was not meant to be shared with others.\u201d Holly glanced up with a faraway look in her eyes. An emotion I couldn\u2019t quite pin down colored her face\u2014regret, remorse, grief? \u201cI suspect whoever shared their blood with a vampire found a way around the spell. For what reason, I don\u2019t know. The council has been searching for the culprit, but as far as we know, you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s involved with a vampire, Gwen.\u201d</p><p>All eyes shifted towards me, each person watched with curiosity, hatred, or amusement. The amusement came from the vampires of course; my council didn\u2019t find anything amusing about the accusation.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d I said with disbelief. \u201cAiden didn\u2019t drink from me until after the secret was already out. I didn\u2019t even know about it so how could I be the one responsible?\u201d I paused to think for a moment. \u201cBesides, if I didn\u2019t know then that means the others don\u2019t know either. I suspect the council didn\u2019t tell us because the fewer people who know, the better chance the secret has of being kept. If you guys want to point fingers, then allow me to point mine at one of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you think we\u2019d put our people in danger!\u201d Holly snapped. \u201cPlus you\u2019re bonded to the vampire responsible. You can\u2019t tell me you\u2019re so na\u00efve you didn\u2019t know sharing blood with a vampire would create a bond?\u201d</p><p>The tingle of my magic revving up stirred under my skin. I fisted my hands to hold it at bay. \u201cI allowed Ian to drink from me to save Fiona\u2019s life! I didn\u2019t know she wasn\u2019t really dead, and when Ian fed me his blood, I was unconscious!\u201d I was so pissed I was about to storm out of the castle and head back to Flora, damn the consequences.</p><p>\u201cI swear the two of you are like immature teenagers. All of this bickering back and forth with blame isn\u2019t going to help anyone,\u201d Aaron snarled, then looked at his sister. \u201cAnd they wonder why their species is in danger.\u201d They both laughed.</p><p>Everyone was silent for a moment as we all reined in our anger. Now was not the time point fingers, we needed to hash out the plans and put an end to all of it. Holly sat back down and whispered with Patrick and James. Aiden walked over to me and wrapped his arms around my body. Closing my eyes, I inhaled his spicy clean scent. Just having him beside me helped tame my anger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I opened my eyes, I caught Dorian\u2019s watching me and Aiden.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let them get to you, my Gwen,\u201d Aiden whispered into my ear.</p><p>\u201cEasier said than done,\u201d I mumbled.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, so the plan is for you, Gwen, to contact Ian and try to set up a meeting. It\u2019ll have to be somewhere that won\u2019t make him suspicious,\u201d Aaron started.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to contact him. He penetrates my mind, but I haven\u2019t tried to send him a message first,\u201d I told them. \u201cPlus, he can manipulate my dreams and physically harm me. Fiona and Ethan tried casting a spell to protect me, but it only lasted a couple days before he found a way around it. He\u2019s very proficient in magic.\u201d The last thing I needed was for Ian to catch onto our plan and try to kill me through my dreams.</p><p>\u201cFiona and Ethan knew about your bond with Ian?\u201d Holly questioned, her tone angry and bewildered. \u201cAm I the only one who didn\u2019t know?\u201d I didn\u2019t answer her. I decided the question was more rhetorical than anything. Plus, I didn\u2019t want to be referred to as an immature child again by Aaron should Holly and I get into another arguing match. I wanted to set up a plan as much as he did. The sooner the better, although I was the bait for the lunatic vampire we were trying to capture.</p><p>\u201cThe bond works both ways, Gwen. Just because you haven\u2019t tried doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t. All you have to do is focus on Ian and think something. The thought will find him.\u201d</p><p>Peachy. I hated that the thing that separated my thoughts from getting to him was concentration. Could he hear my random thoughts? Did he spend his time intruding my mind just to learn my inner feelings? Being linked to someone like him made my skin crawl. Every time I heard his name, I thought about Bridget, the girl he\u2019d murdered who\u2019d haunted me until I found out the truth. I also remembered Amy Harper, the first body the FPD found and how young she was when Ian or his goons killed her. The word Ian was a foul and dirty word in my mind that was associated with ugliness. I didn\u2019t care what his motivations were or his plans for me; the only thing I cared about was killing him, ridding the world of a heartless monster. With his death lives would be saved and mine could go back to normal. All of a sudden playing the bait didn\u2019t seem so bad. I would have my chance to run a stake through his heart and have a first row seat to his demise. The VC had their plans, and I had mine. I would go along with whatever they cooked up, and when Ian met me, I would be prepared to kill him whether the VC wanted me to or not. It was the only way I could be sure our bond was broken for good without having to gift my blood to the VC. The more I learned about the vampire council, the more I didn\u2019t want their mouths on my body.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Flora?\u201d Aiden asked.</p><p>I tucked my secret plan into the back of my mind and focused on the conversation.</p><p>\u201cGwen could return to Flora and ask Ian to meet her. She can pretend her training with the NAWC is done, and the war ended before it started. Gwen can use the ruse that she wants to meet him about breaking their bond. Ian will never suspect the VC will be there waiting for him. The best way to capture a man like him is when he\u2019s off guard.\u201d</p><p>Just at the mention of returning to Flora was enough to make me smile.</p><p>\u201cShould we be discussing this in front of Gwen?\u201d Patrick questioned. \u201cIf she knows the plan, can\u2019t Ian just pluck it from her mind?\u201d</p><p>It was a good question. Now that I knew just how connected we were, I wasn\u2019t sure of how much privacy I had\u2014even in my own brain. I thought Ian could project thoughts at me and intrude in my dreams from the magic he learned, but Aaron made it sound like we shared a mind, and all either one of us had to door was open the door. Not very comforting. If they wanted me to leave, I would. I wanted their plan to work out more than anyone because if it didn\u2019t, then mine wouldn\u2019t either.</p> <p>\u201cAs long as she doesn\u2019t focus on the details all the time, we should be safe. A bond doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the pair can read each other\u2019s minds. But Ian can pick up on Gwen\u2019s moods should she act nervous or suspicious around him.\u201d Aaron spoke with an air of superiority.</p><p>\u201cYou guys come up with a plan you can all agree on, I need some air.\u201d Stepping out of the room, I made my way out of the castle. The rain had slowed and was now just a light drizzle. The coolness of the breeze and rain felt amazing against my heated skin. Taking a deep breath, I filled my lungs with clean air. The room was stifling and suffocating as the councils debated. Being outside was a lot more relaxing. I could feel my muscles loosen, and my magic recede as I calmed down.</p><p>I sat on the stone steps in front of the castle and thought about everything. I learned a lot about myself, and my abilities in a short period of time. Dorian was a new and interesting person who\u2019d stepped into my life. I still had plans to find out more about him, but they\u2019d have to wait. I thought about Fiona and how our friendship was veering down different roads. I thought about Aura, and how I\u2019d never feel that safety in our connection again. I wondered where she was and if she was happy. I thought about Aiden and how we could be riding in a gondola right now if I would have just run away with him. Of course that decision would have just opened up new problems, none of which would have solved my current ones. And I thought about Ian. What was his deal? Is he just your average everyday bad guy or was there a method to his madness? I snorted. Yeah, he\u2019s a psychopath. They always have a well thought out plan. My sarcasm didn\u2019t ease my mind. There was something about Ian I wasn\u2019t catching onto. He\u2019d said things that triggered my curiosity, things that had meaning I wasn\u2019t seeing. I couldn\u2019t remember his exact words, but he said something along the lines of \u201cyou\u2019ll be more than she ever was\u201d. What the hell did that mean, and who was she? He mentioned how he was concerned for my wellbeing, but was that because I was a commodity he didn\u2019t want to lose, or was it because somewhere, through the ugly layers, he had feelings for me? If that was the case, which I severely doubted, why would he have feelings for me? We didn\u2019t know each other, not really, and our meetings were less than cordial.</p><p>The soft click of the door shutting made me look over my shoulder. Aiden stepped down the stairs and sat beside me. His arm wrapped around my back, and I leaned my head on his shoulder. Sometimes a girl just needed a hug. Wrapping his other arm around my front, he clasped his hands together, and we sat in silence for a few moments.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about Ian?\u201d I kept my voice low.</p><p>\u201cJust what you know, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you might be able to enlighten me on who he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know who he is. He\u2019s a murderous prick who kills anyone who stands in his way.\u201d</p> <p>That was a given, but I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling there was something else motivating his rampage. How had Ian deciphered the secret of our blood?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this about, my Gwen?\u201d Aiden placed his finger under my chin and tilted my head up.</p><p>\u201cSomething just doesn\u2019t add up. I think he has a plan for me, something he\u2019s tried before.\u201d I paused. \u201cI know that sounds bizarre and cryptic, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve gathered from our conversations.\u201d</p><p>Aiden\u2019s body tensed against mine. \u201cWhat has he said?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing. Has the councils come to an agreement?\u201d I didn\u2019t want Aiden to worry over my inner thoughts. I still thought something was going on with Ian, but it also might have been my mind running wild. No point in dragging Aiden into my chaos.</p><p>\u201cWe can talk about it if you want,\u201d Aiden said.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the council will send you back to Flora.\u201d</p><p>That was a relief. My plan wouldn\u2019t work if I stayed in Moon.</p><p>The door creaked again and Aiden and I to turned. Dorian stood on the top step, his gray eyes covered with sunglasses, and his face serious.</p><p>\u201cMay I speak with Gwen for a moment,\u201d he asked Aiden. Aiden looked between me and Dorian and gave me a quick kiss before standing.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, and then looked down at me. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be long before the councils let you know the plans.\u201d Aiden and Dorian sized each other up as they passed one another. It was just a matter of time before the ruler and dicks came out. Men!</p><p>16</p><p>\u201cYour vampire doesn\u2019t look like he likes competition,\u201d Dorian snorted.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any competition,\u201d I retorted.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh, keep telling yourself that.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. Dorian nodded with his head to follow him. We walked down the lane in silence, sparing quick glances at one another. He claimed he didn\u2019t want to discuss things in front of the castle.</p><p>We stopped just outside town. The buildings were silhouettes against the dark sky, their chimneys sending puffs of white smoke into the night. The rain slowed to a mere drizzle, sprinkling my face with its cool droplets. Dorian stuck his hand in his pocket and pulled out a white crumpled piece of paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found this in Holly\u2019s office.\u201d Dorian handed me the paper.</p><p>I straightened it out as best I could and realized it was an email printed from Holly\u2019s computer. My eyes scanned the top; it was between Holly and Ian Despereaux. I looked up at Dorian, my eyes to wide and my jaw hanging open. \u201cThey\u2019ve been in contact with him the entire time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems,\u201d Dorian mumbled and leaned against the trunk of a large oak tree, crossing his arms in front of him.</p><p>I\u2019m writing to alert you if you do not cease your killings of the witches, a war will be upon your people. How do you expect to gain a following when you\u2019re responsible for the vampires\u2019 destruction? Be smart and turn yourself in.</p><p>The first message was sent from Holly. Swallowing around the lump in my throat, I read Ian\u2019s response.</p><p>What a formal email. Should I feel flattered or hurt? Do not pretend to send threats when I hold a very dangerous secret of yours, Holly. Is capturing me worth the price of your head? How do you expect to gain followers when you\u2019re responsible for the witches\u2019 demise? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a trembling hand, I rubbed my forehead trying to make the pieces fall into place.</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean Holly is the one who told Ian about our blood?\u201d I asked Dorian.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s what it sounds like.\u201d Dorian pushed off of the tree and walked over to me. Taking the paper from my hands, he scanned the text. \u201cWhy would she leave this out for anyone to find it?\u201d he asked, shaking his head in disbelief.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t make sense. Why would Holly share a secret with a person like Ian? And if it were true, Dorian was right, she wouldn\u2019t leave it just lying around to be found.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Ian was lying, he\u2019s not trustworthy.\u201d As much as I didn\u2019t like Holly, I didn\u2019t think she was in cahoots with Ian. \u201cWhy\u2019d you show me this? I thought you and Holly had some sort of arrangement.\u201d</p><p>Dorian folded the paper and shoved it in his pocket. \u201cWhat gave you that impression?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you talking to her about me.\u201d</p><p>Dorian\u2019s face relaxed as a smile curled his lips. \u201cYou were eavesdropping? What did you hear?\u201d He took a couple steps forward, his head tilted to the side as he waited for my response. I didn\u2019t like how close he was. My body tensed, and I fisted my hands at my side. I swallowed a few times to ease the dryness that settled in my mouth before I spoke.</p> <p>\u201cShe asked if I was asking any questions, and you said the only ones I asked were about my powers. What questions was she afraid I\u2019d ask, Dorian?\u201d I paused as I observed his face to see if his body language changed. He remained aloof and amused. \u201cWhy are you here? You said you\u2019re neutral, so why help the witches?\u201d</p><p>Dorian stepped closer, edging me backwards until my back hit the trunk of a tree. He rested his arm against the bark and pinned me in my place. Although his eyes were obscured with sunglasses, I could feel them roam up and down the length of my body. A smirk dimpled his cheeks. He leaned in closer so only a few inches separated our faces.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t agree to train the new spirit walker until I saw you on the side of the road. I knew what you were and you were the one Holly wanted trained. I came for you, Gwen,\u201d Dorian kept his voice low and soft, but that didn\u2019t stop chills from dancing up my spine and goose bumps erupting along my skin. He knew what I was the night I witnessed the car accident? He agreed to help Holly only to get close to me?</p><p>\u201cDorian, I can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you don\u2019t feel anything when I\u2019m close. Tell me you don\u2019t search a room for me every time you enter. Tell me your heart isn\u2019t racing right now, that you don\u2019t want me to kiss you, and I\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d He leaned closer, and my heart responded with a hard thud. I did feel things when he was close, but that didn\u2019t change the fact that I loved Aiden. Attraction wasn\u2019t enough to put my relationship in jeopardy. I watched his full lips so close to mine and wondered how they\u2019d taste. What kissing the Angel of Death would be like?</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t, can you?\u201d Dorian teased.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have feelings for you, Dorian,\u201d I told him with as much conviction as I could scrape up. Admitting I did feel a connection would only hurt him in the end. Nothing would ever or could ever transpire between us, at least not the way he wanted it.</p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d he whispered before his mouth found mine. His lips were cool, but caused heat to spread through my body.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I used both hands to shove him as far away as I could. Dorian was a big guy, not easy to move, but he stumbled back a couple steps.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll never be like that between us. I\u2019m thankful for everything you\u2019ve taught me, but I love Aiden. I\u2019m sorry if I led you on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop, I don\u2019t need your pity. If you choose to lie to yourself, so be it, but he\u2019ll never understand you the way I do, Gwen.\u201d Dorian turned to walk away. My fingertips trailed my swollen lips as I struggled to regain my breath. The kiss, although short, was something bizarre and amazing. It was like fire and ice colliding, leaving pure steam rushing though my veins.</p><p>\u201cDorian, wait!\u201d</p><p>He half turned and looked over his shoulder. Taking a few steps forward, I stared for a few moments.</p><p>\u201cI need to know if you and Holly have a plan for me. I have no clue who I can trust. Can I trust you?\u201d It was a stupid question, I knew that. He could lie and feed me a line of bull just to gain my confidence, but I hoped I\u2019d be able to judge by his body language. I liked Dorian, more than I should, and after I was done in Moon, I hoped to see him again. I wanted us to be friends. There was still a lot to learn, and he was the only one who could teach me what I needed to know.</p> <p>\u201cI cannot speak for Holly, but I do not know of any plan that involves you, nor do I have one myself. The only thing Holly told me to do was train you. She has been just as vague with me as she has with you.\u201d His voice was surly. He turned to walk back up the road again. His explanation was vague at best. Not enough for me to fully trust him, but it also wasn\u2019t enough to avoid him.</p><p>\u201cDorian,\u201d I called out again as I followed him. I knew he wasn\u2019t in any mood to help me, but if I wanted my plan to work, I needed his help.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He spun around and faced me straight on causing me to take a step back.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t be mad. You\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve met who could teach me about myself. Can\u2019t we be friends?\u201d I hoped my voice and eyes conveyed my sincerity. There was nothing worse than seeing pity in someone\u2019s eyes, especially someone you liked. Dorian didn\u2019t need me to feel sorry for him or walk on eggshells around him.</p><p>Dorian snorted. \u201cFriends? I don\u2019t have friends, Gwen. I have acquaintances, enemies, and one night stands.\u201d</p><p>I was sure if I could see his eyes, the cloudy abyss would be dark, angry rolling clouds. His voice was as harsh as his words. I guessed the Angel of Death didn\u2019t get rejected too often.</p><p>\u201cWhich one were you going to file me under?\u201d I snapped and crossed my arms. \u201cWhy does it have to be all or nothing with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of paying attention to something if you can\u2019t have all of it?\u201d Without another word, Dorian turned and walked back to the castle.</p><p>17</p><p>\u201cGwen, hurry up!\u201d Holly snapped from my doorway. The councils agreed to send me back to Flora where I would try to trick Ian into meeting me. My stomach cramped and nerves tightened my entire body into an anxious mess.</p><p>\u201cAlmost done,\u201d I told her as I shoved my clothes into my suitcase. Aura, or rather my new black cat, wasn\u2019t happy being jostled into her pet carrier. Seeing the feline was a reminder I\u2019d lost the real Aura. When my hand brushed her fur, I no longer felt the prickly sensation of our magic meshing. Slipping the pet carrier onto my shoulder and the thoughts of loss out of my mind, I lifted my suitcase off of the bed and turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cHolly, did you imprison Aura in the cat\u2019s body?\u201d Holly followed me down the staircase and was quiet for a few moments.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost her; she just lifted out of the cat\u2019s body. She told me she was grateful to be free from her prison. You\u2019re the one who gave her to me.\u201d I accused. Knowing my life could end as soon as tonight, I didn\u2019t feel the need to watch my manners. I wanted to know what the hell Aura had done to be entombed in a cat\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cYou freed her?\u201d Holly screeched.</p><p>\u201cYes. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d I laced my words with magic so Holly had to tell me the truth. It didn\u2019t work well on other witches, but Holly didn\u2019t seem to notice. Her eyes glazed over as her lips moved.</p><p>\u201cShe is my sister, was my sister. She died a long time ago and vowed to haunt me for the rest of eternity for stealing her position on the council. I\u2014\u201d Holly blinked, her eyes returning to normal. She looked at me anger ablaze in her eyes as she sneered. \u201cUsing a spell on a council member is a grave offence, Gwen. If we didn\u2019t have more important plans, you\u2019d be dragged to the dungeon!\u201d</p><p>Holly shouldered past me, almost toppling me down the stairs. Bracing my hands on the stone railing, I steadied myself. I was happy to get answers about Aura, but I wished I would have used the truth spell to figure out what Holly planned for me. Now that she was aware I\u2019d cross a very dangerous line to gain answers, there was no way I could pull it off again.</p><p>The entire plane ride home I thought about everything I\u2019d learned and what I was expected to do. While training I wasn\u2019t exactly vigilant. My mood was sour my entire stay at Moon, and now that my lessons were going to be tested, I was freaking out. Whereas I spent my adult life avoiding magic as much as possible, Ian knew as much magic as any well practiced witch. Lifting my head, I scanned the inside of the plane. All but two of the NAWC members were present and Dorian, who sat alone at the back of the plane. The VC and Aiden would wait until tomorrow to travel to Flora, one of the downfalls of being a vampire. The sun was peeking over the fluffy clouds, coloring them in brilliant oranges and pinks. The sky was beautiful and chipper, such a contradiction to the mood on the plane. The tension of the upcoming confrontation had everyone on edge. They fidgeted in their seats, their eyes darting out the windows and then back inside the plane.</p><p>Patrick studied a map of Flora while Holly watched him. Her knee bounced up and down, and her eyes flashed between him and the small window. What she was so nervous about? I was the one playing the bait.</p><p>Ignoring the council, I studied the beauty outside the plane.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d Dorian tapped my arm. Blinking a few times to escape my thoughts, I stared at him.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know I\u2019ll be right beside you while you\u2019re dealing with Ian.\u201d Dorian sat down next to me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019ll give our plan away?\u201d I asked perturbed. Dorian was a mystery. One minute he was trying to get close, and, the next he could be a complete ass.</p><p>\u201cNot if I\u2019m invisible,\u201d he shrugged.</p><p>I shifted so I could see him better. \u201cYou can go invisible?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dorian leaned on the armrest and smirked. \u201cI\u2019ve got tricks you\u2019ve never seen.\u201d He waggled his eyebrows.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cOkay, Dr. Jekyll, when is Mr. Hyde coming out to play?\u201d I laughed at the confusion in his features. \u201cI thought you were pissed at me? You don\u2019t have friends, remember? So what the hell are you doing talking to me when I\u2019ve made it perfectly clear that\u2019s all we\u2019ll ever be?\u201d I liked Dorian, but I wouldn\u2019t play his mind games.</p><p>\u201cHow about we keep you alive through this, then we\u2019ll talk about a friendship,\u201d Dorian said.</p> <p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>The plane touched down twenty minutes later. The council set off to find a hotel while Dorian and I drove back to my apartment. It was Holly\u2019s idea that Dorian stay with me so we could practice contacting Ian and go over strategies. I wondered how Aiden would feel about Dorian staying with me, but I didn\u2019t really have a choice. Turning my key, I opened the front door and inhaled the familiar scent of home. It was a far cry from the digs at the castle, but it was more my style. The kitchen was small and blue with boring white appliances. The floor was yellowing linoleum that was only popular in the seventies. A hallway led to mine and Fiona\u2019s bedrooms and a tiny bathroom. The entire place was maybe nine hundred square feet, but it was home.</p><p>\u201cSo, this is it.\u201d I gestured to Dorian as I let my cat out of her carrier. She was hesitant to step foot into the space, but after some coaxing, she scurried into the living room. I\u2019d have to come up with another name for her\u2014calling her Aura just didn\u2019t seem right.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice,\u201d Dorian commented, his voice an octave higher than normal.</p><p>Turning to face him, I smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a piece of shit, but thanks for sparing my feelings,\u201d I laughed.</p> <p>\u201cIt really is. I\u2019ve been in prison cells bigger than this. Isn\u2019t your vampire taking care of you?\u201d</p><p>I scoffed, shrugged out of my jacket and headed to the fridge. \u201cI\u2019m sure he would if I asked, but I\u2019m not that type of girl. I earn my own things.\u201d Grabbing two beers, I handed one to Dorian.</p><p>\u201cKudos to you, there isn\u2019t a lot of independent women out there.\u201d He took a swig of his beer and wiped his mouth, his eyes growing hungrier the longer he stared at me.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the plan?\u201d After a four hour plane ride all I wanted to do was curl up in bed and sleep, but we needed to devise a strategy to entice Ian to meet me tonight\u2014if he was even in the country. I didn\u2019t want to think of having to wait for him to travel, the anticipation would drive me insane.</p><p>\u201cI suppose we\u2019ll work on strengthening your powers, and Aaron will meet with you tonight to teach you how to contact Ian.</p><p>Nodding, I took a drink of my beer, but it was sour in my empty stomach. The last time I ate felt like eons ago. My stomach grumbled in unison with my thoughts and Dorian smiled.</p> <p>\u201cHave any food in this shithole?\u201d</p><p>Normally, I was embarrassed of my tiny apartment, but Dorian\u2019s jokes about it eased my discomfort. I may own a store, but selling potions and enchanted items in a town full of magical folks didn\u2019t bring in a lot of dough. Sure Broomsticks made enough to pay the bills and put food on the table, but that was the extent of my income. Maybe Penny\u2019s idea for selling my goods online to boost sales would work, and I\u2019d be able to afford name brand food.</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I mumbled as I rummaged through the cabinets. \u201cWe have vegetable soup, canned corn, green beans, and bread.\u201d I blushed. Fiona and I kept our place well stocked, but since we knew we\u2019d be in Moon, we hadn\u2019t been grocery shopping.</p><p>\u201cI see you have a collection of takeout menus.\u201d Dorian nodded to the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we sorta keep the restaurants in Flora in business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a shower, slip into something comfortable, and I\u2019ll order pizza.\u201d</p><p>I eyed the hallway; a sudden craving for just that and my favorite Hello Kitty pajama pants seemed like the best thing in the world. But leaving Dorian alone while I was naked in the bathroom seemed wrong.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Dorian said as waved his hand towards the hallway.</p> <p>Putting the fact he was treating me like a child aside, I smiled and headed towards the bathroom.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, I found Dorian lounged on the sofa with a paper plate full of pepperoni pizza. My stomach complained as the aroma teased my nostrils. The TV was tuned into Abbot and Costello\u2019s Meet Frankenstein.</p><p>\u201cSo this is what the Angel of Death watches, movies from the forties?\u201d I slid a piece of pizza onto my plate and sat in the large overstuffed chair, curling my legs under me. The whole scene of eating pizza, watching Abbot and Costello, and having Dorian on my couch was surprisingly comfortable. There was something about him that put me at ease.</p><p>\u201cThis movie is hilarious. Have you seen it?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed the hefty bite I\u2019d just taken. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorites, but I didn\u2019t think someone like you would like something like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone like me?\u201d Dorian asked. His sunglasses rested atop his head, so I had a clear view of his cloudy eyes. They were light gray today and calm, something I hadn\u2019t seen since meeting him.</p><p>\u201cThe whole bad boy persona doesn\u2019t scream comedy fan.\u201d I took another bite of pizza.</p><p>Dorian gave a genuine laugh. \u201cBad boy? Is that what you think of me?\u201d</p><p>Holding up a hand, I ticked off the things that qualified him for the title. \u201cLeather coat, motorcycle, long hair, hangs out in dive bars, and one night stands, tell me how those don\u2019t qualify you as a bad boy?\u201d</p><p>Dorian nodded while his smiled widened. \u201cI guess I can\u2019t argue with the facts, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I thought for a moment. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a job to do? Like shouldn\u2019t you be out ferrying souls to the hereafter? That\u2019s what reapers do, right?\u201d It occurred to me Dorian wasn\u2019t just a teacher to incompetent witches. Who did an Angel of Death take his orders from?</p><p>\u201cI took a leave of absence. There are other reapers to pick up my slack,\u201d Dorian explained.</p><p>I nodded and took another bite. When all of this mess was done, I\u2019d have to grill Dorian about his job and boss. It couldn\u2019t be a fun job going around plucking souls from bodies and trying to lead them to the ghostly realm, or wherever they went. Even though Dorian explained all spirits went to the dimension of the dead, I didn\u2019t understand it. The few times I\u2019d been to the there wasn\u2019t a huge population of spirits running amok. Where were they?</p><p>\u201cYou ready to start training again?\u201d Dorian asked.</p><p>\u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d I laughed. \u201cHey, what\u2019s going to happen with the spirits I summoned from the vampire blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepending on how this all turns out, they\u2019ll be released. You wanna try and call them?\u201d</p><p>I set my plate on the coffee table. \u201cWhy?\u201d Having a horde of restless spirits in my tiny apartment didn\u2019t seem like a good idea.</p><p>\u201cSo you can practice connecting with the dead,\u201d Dorian said in a \u201cduh\u201d voice.</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t my powers have come from Midas? Now that would be a kickass talent.\u201d Shifting in the chair so I was sitting Indian style, I rested my head in my propped up hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be cool for a while, until you turned your vampire into a solid gold statue. Everything that glitters isn\u2019t gold, Gwen.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cThanks for the advice, Yoda.\u201d</p><p>Dorian ignored my sarcasm and moved the coffee table out of the way so he could sit on the floor. He held out his hand for me to join him. When I was sitting in front of him, he held out his hands, palm side up. I eyed his outstretched hands for a moment before clasping them.</p><p>\u201cOkay, close your eyes and focus on the underlying feeling of death you\u2019re connected to,\u201d Dorian instructed.</p><p>I was coming to terms with being a full-fledged spirit walker, but phrases like \u201cthe death you\u2019re connect to\u201d didn\u2019t make me jump up and down with excitement. Who wants their superpower to be controlling spirits or jumping into a dimension that\u2019s washed in gray, cold, and has demons hiding in the shadows? Not me, that was for damn sure, but there wasn\u2019t much I could do about it. Complaining wouldn\u2019t change a thing. I closed my eyes and concentrated on the gloomy darkness hovering all around me. It was getting easier and easier to recognize. Goose bumps pebbled my skin as a chill crawled through my body; I shuddered from the feel of it.</p><p>\u201cNow send the command for the spirits to return to you,\u201d Dorian kept his voice low.</p><p>\u201cOh, restless spirits, I command you to return to me,\u201d I said, using my best s\u00e9ance voice. Squinting through one eye, I peered at Dorian and smiled. The whole thing seemed so hokey.</p><p>Icy tendrils traveled from Dorian\u2019s hands to mine and the lamps flickered. My eyelids popped open and searched the small space. Wisps of fog-like bodies formed all around my tiny living room. Soon more than ten ghosts stood stoic and unmoving around us.</p><p>The air grew colder, my breath forming a white mist as my breathing picked up. Even the feeling of the room changed to gloomy and depressing.</p><p>\u201cOrder one to do something,\u201d Dorian said.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the ghost he pointed to. It was a woman. Her features were undistinguishable, the ghosts looked like nothing more than gray silhouettes, but the body type gave away her sex.</p><p>\u201cCan they speak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Dorian said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked the spirit.</p><p>\u201cMelody,\u201d it answered in a slow and steady tone. Its voice echoed in my eardrums. She sounded so sad and lost.</p><p>\u201cMelody, could you please push that frame over?\u201d I kept my voice calm and even smiled for good measure. The silver picture frame on my bookcase flipped over with a loud clang. \u201cThank you, Melody.\u201d</p><p>Dorian snorted. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be polite, they\u2019re under your control.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow would you feel if you were dead and someone had control over you?\u201d I shook my head with irritation. \u201cJust because their dead doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t deserve my respect.\u201d</p><p>The ghosts wavered like a gloomy optical illusion as they hovered all around the room.</p><p>\u201cOrder another one,\u201d Dorian said, ignoring my previous comment.</p> <p>I bit my lip while my eyes traveled over the translucent bodies. I stopped on another female. Her head was hung and her hands clasped in front of her.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d I said as I got up from the floor and walked with caution towards her. The woman lifted her head slow. The area where her eyes would be was nothing but round circles. I fought to keep eye contact with something so freaky. I didn\u2019t want to appear weak around the spirits who may or may not resent me for summoning them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked to the spirit.</p><p>\u201cRosella.\u201d Her voice was soft and came out as a whisper.</p><p>\u201cAsk her who killed her,\u201d Dorian said behind me.</p> <p>Looking back at Rosella, I asked, \u201cWho killed you?\u201d</p><p>The vials of vampire blood were supposedly from the vampires who were dangerous, so I didn\u2019t expect her answer to mean anything to me. They were ones who killed my kind for the simple fact of harvesting our blood. I didn\u2019t know why Dorian wanted me to ask the question.</p><p>\u201cAlonzo Moretti,\u201d Rosella answered.</p><p>My body froze, along with the blood in my veins. Out of all the names she could have said I did not expect her to say Aiden\u2019s given name. I wasn\u2019t stupid, I knew Aiden killed before, but to see his victim standing in my living room so sad and alone was a whole other ballpark\u2014one that put things into perspective. The Aiden I knew wasn\u2019t a murderous monster. The Aiden, or Alonzo, Rosella met was.</p><p>I stared wide eyed at Rosella as I imagined Aiden sinking his fangs into her neck and ending her life long before it should have ended. I imagined what her family must have gone through losing her, and more disturbing, I wondered if she was just a woman on the street he\u2019d attacked, or if he wooed her with his charm, gained her trust, and then killed her. Either way it didn\u2019t matter, she was dead and my boyfriend was the reason why. Staring at her felt like an omen. Would I end up like her someday? Would Aiden not be able to suppress his hunger for my blood and drain me? This was a crack in the otherwise happy world I\u2019d painted around Aiden. The big question was, would the crack cause it to come shattering down around me?</p><p>\u201cYou knew, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I whirled around and faced Dorian. I turned all of the emotions I was feeling into anger and focused it on Dorian. \u201cDid you think I didn\u2019t know he\u2019s killed before or was this some sick joke, some macabre way to knock sense into me? What did you and Holly think? If I saw her, I\u2019d come to my senses and leave him?\u201d I waited for Dorian to answer, but when he didn\u2019t speak right away my anger grew. \u201cTell me!\u201d I yelled.</p> <p>Dorian stood and walked over to me, reaching out towards me but when I flinched, he dropped his arms. \u201cThis was Holly\u2019s doing. When you summoned the spirits, I did not know who killed them. But when the spirits appeared tonight and after meeting Aiden, I made the connection. I\u2019m sure this was Holly\u2019s way of making you see the type of person you\u2019re dating. Or she thought it would be funny for you to sic Rosella on Aiden. I\u2019m sorry it upset you, but I thought you should know should we end up using the spirits against the vampires,\u201d Dorian paused for a few moments. \u201cI did it because I didn\u2019t want you caught off guard. I\u2019m sorry it upset you, but you\u2019re not angry with me\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not?\u201d I interrupted.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re mad because you\u2019re a good person, Gwen. And seeing one of the women you\u2019re boyfriend killed makes you feel guilty for being with him. You\u2019re mad at yourself. If it makes you feel better, he killed her a long time ago. It probably happened when he just turned. New vampires are slaves to their bloodlust.\u201d</p><p>We regarded each other in silence for what seemed like an eternity. My eyes welled with tears as I thought about all of the people Aiden might have killed over the years. I spent my life using my gift to catch killers, and now I was dating one. Aiden may not be that person anymore, but the thought did nothing to erase the fact he used to be.</p><p>Ignoring Dorian, I turned to the spirits and said, \u201cLeave.\u201d</p><p>One by one the apparitions disappeared. Without another look at Dorian, I stormed off and slammed my bedroom door where I fell onto my bed and cried. It may have been the stress of the past few weeks, or the fact Aiden\u2019s ugly past had been shoved in my face, but once the tears began I couldn\u2019t turn them off. I cried until sleep claimed me.</p><p>18</p><p>My heart clung to Aiden\u2019s good side. The side that made me smile and sent a jolt of desire through my body. The way his eyes lit up when he looked at me and the look he got when he defended me. My heart grasped at the good parts of him like a life preserver while my mind analyzed if I could ever overlook the fact he\u2019d killed innocents. Knowing something was not the same as seeing it. Was this enough to break up with Aiden? No. But would I look at him the same way? I hoped so. I wasn\u2019t ready for my world to come crashing down, and if it did, I didn\u2019t expect it to be at Aiden\u2019s hands. We\u2019d dated for a month, but. We started in friendship that grew into something more substantial, and now that we were together, I couldn\u2019t imagine being apart. Of course that was just my heart talking. My mind had the tendency to overthink things, to run them into the ground until I understood. There was no understanding this scenario. It happened a long time ago, before I was even born, but it still gnawed at my brain like a hungry zombie.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know how long I stayed in bed staring at the ceiling after I woke up. Glancing at my alarm clock, it was just after five. The sun would be setting, and the vampires would be here before long. I needed to collect my thoughts and tuck them away until I could speak with Aiden. How do you tell your boyfriend you chatted with a woman he killed? Perhaps this was the reason why I never asked Aiden about his past. Deep down I knew what I\u2019d find, and a part of me was afraid of how I\u2019d handle it.</p><p>I felt stupid because I was upset over something that occurred so long ago and it was a little late in our relationship to even question it. Vampires kill people, plain and simple. Some do it for sport while others allow their thirst to override their willpower. But what bothered me the most was the fact I felt guilty for being with Aiden after meeting Rosella. Dorian had been right. When I saw Rosella, her death and sadness soaked into me, causing my guilt to overflow. Meeting her and finding out Aiden was her killer made me feel like I was an insensitive person.</p><p>Two soft knocks on my door pulled me up into a sitting position. Aiden walked in, his black hair disheveled and white snowflakes on his wool coat. Unlike Moon, Flora\u2019s weather wasn\u2019t altered. I loved the snow, but the circumstances suppressed any excitement I might have had from the sight of it. Aiden watched me warily, his eyes searching my face for something unspoken.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said coolly.</p><p>He sat on the edge of my bed, placing his hands on either side of my face and his lips massaged mine, almost feverishly. The normal desire I felt when he kissed me didn\u2019t overwhelm my body. My mind was too confused to enjoy his kiss.</p><p>\u201cI had to taste you one last time,\u201d he whispered against my lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I sat back so I could look into his eyes.</p><p>Aiden grabbed my hand, his thumb rubbing circles on my skin. His blue eyes regarded me while his lips hesitated to speak. \u201cDorian told me what happened and how upset you were. I\u2019m sorry you found out like this\u2014.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly ground breaking news, Aiden,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cIt did upset me to meet one of your victims. I could feel her emotions like they were my own. She was so sad, but I\u2019m not na\u00efve. I know you\u2019ve killed. I just never thought about it before.\u201d I studied him for a few moments. \u201cYou and I are okay. It was disconcerting, but we\u2019re good.\u201d I knew as soon as the words left my mouth that they were true. The interaction with Rosella had been upsetting but it wasn\u2019t enough to ruin what Aiden and I had.</p><p>Seeing the worry on Aiden\u2019s face eased my tension and eased my mind. He wasn\u2019t that man anymore, the kind who went around killing innocent women. His eyes were so full of sorrow it almost broke my heart to look at him. Aiden wasn\u2019t the mushy type who cried, but his eyes were glossy with what looked like unshed tears. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I squeezed his arm.</p><p>\u201cLiving over six hundred years, I\u2019ve seen and done horrible things. Humans have the pleasure of dying and paying for their sins. Vampires live with them for centuries, sometimes millennia. I\u2019ve learned to block those things out; otherwise they would drive me insane, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s bothering me. The way you looked at me, like I was a monster, is more than I can bear.\u201d Aiden\u2019s lips twitched as he thought about something. His eyes regarded me with something that resembled nervousness. \u201cThat and the fact I\u2019ve been keeping something from you for the past month, something that will change the way you think of me.\u201d</p><p>I searched his face for the answer, but all I saw was regret and shame. My breath caught in my throat, my hands trembled, and my heart stopped as I waited for him to put me out of my misery.</p><p>\u201cW-what is it?\u201d My words stumbled over the lump in my throat while I fisted my sheets until my knuckles turned white.</p><p>\u201cSomething happened a month ago, and I can\u2019t keep it from you any longer. It\u2019s not easy, but I won\u2019t make excuses for what I\u2019ve done\u2014\u201c.</p><p>Aaron Larue stepped through my door, interrupting Aiden\u2019s confession. \u201cIs our lesson going to be in bed then?\u201d he asked with a flirtatious smile.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t in the mood to deal with a horny vampire who looked like he should be in high school. I also wasn\u2019t in the mood to deal with Ian Despereaux, the NAWC, the VC or the plan. Aiden\u2019s words were just another crack in the pretty picture I let my heart believe in. How many more fissures could it take before it all came smashing down around me? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out in just a moment. Aiden was just about to tell me something.\u201d I kept my eyes glued to Aiden and was surprised Aaron didn\u2019t demand my full attention. He left my room and the spotlight was back on Aiden.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d I said through clenched teeth. I\u2019d spent the past three weeks trying to learn what Holly, Kye and Dorian were keeping from me. Now even Aiden had secrets.</p><p>\u201cIt was the time I was with Louis,\u201d Aiden began and my heart sunk. \u201cHe fed me witches blood, and I drank it so he wouldn\u2019t grow suspicious. I did it to help you with the case\u2014I didn\u2019t expect it to take ahold of my willpower so sudden. The addiction was powerful. It was like something I never experienced before. It\u2019s like your lungs needing air or your body needing water\u2014absolute. After a single glass, I craved it like nothing else.\u201d</p> <p>My heart thudded against my ribcage, each time harder than the last as I listened to his words. Somewhere in my mind I knew what he was going to say, but my heart demanded I was wrong.</p><p>\u201cLouis had a supply of low level witches on hand for those who liked to feed from the source. The witches were there on their own accord, most were black magic witches. One night, Louis invited over his crew and as a gift he gave each of us a witch of our own. We were told we could do whatever we wanted with them. My addiction was so strong that the thing I wanted to do was feed from her.\u201d Aiden ran a hand through his hair, his eyes flicking towards me as he searched my face for my reaction. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I did until there wasn\u2019t a drop left,\u201d Aiden looked at me.</p><p>I stared back unmoving, except for the thud of my heart echoing in my eardrums.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you this because I love you, my Gwen. I don\u2019t want you to be caught off guard or find out some other way. I was afraid to tell you, but I realize in order to keep you and earn your love, I have to be honest with you. This\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed a witch, drained her, while I was trying to stop Ian from doing the exact same thing? For the past month you\u2019ve lied to me, acted like everything was normal. You watched me help the FPD and get summoned to Moon to aid in a war for this exact reason. You never said anything.\u201d I jumped up from the bed and paced my small bedroom. \u201cWhat about the night I broke your addiction? You couldn\u2019t have mentioned you killed a witch then? My world has revolved around this mess for the past month and all along you were a part of it?\u201d I crossed my arms to keep the view of my trembling hands hidden. As I watched Aiden it was like staring at a complete stranger. Had I fantasized his good qualities all along?</p> <p>If Holly was witness to our argument, she\u2019d be proud. My loyalty to my kind was called into question many times over the past month, but love aside; it wasn\u2019t okay a witch died at the hands of my boyfriend, even a dirty witch as they are called. I didn\u2019t care that the woman he\u2019d drained was involved in black magic, she was a witch the same as me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t tell you. You\u2019ve been so stressed over all of this I didn\u2019t want to upset you more. It was a low point in my life, one I wish I could take back,\u201d Aiden grimaced.</p><p>\u201cWell you can\u2019t,\u201d I hissed. \u201cJust leave, please. I can\u2019t deal with this right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d Aiden walked closer. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have another murderer to capture. We\u2019ll talk about this later.\u201d I stomped out of my bedroom and came to a stop when eight heads turned to observe me. The VC stood with their arms crossed, like my poorness might rub off on them. The NAWC members sat at my kitchen table with smug \u201cI told you so\u201d looks on their faces. With only twenty feet separating my bedroom and kitchen, I was sure they heard my entire argument with Aiden. Risking a glance at Dorian, I was surprised his face didn\u2019t hold an ounce of arrogance. Instead, he looked sorry for me which was almost worse.</p><p>\u201cParty\u2019s over, what\u2019s the plan?\u201d I said, holding up my hands. If I had to name one good thing out my fight with Aiden, it was that I was full of anger and ready to direct it at Ian Despereaux. I wanted a fight, an outlet for my rage. That\u2019s what you get for dating a vampire, I thought. My love life wasn\u2019t like the fairytales my mother use to read to me. There wasn\u2019t a prince riding in on his white horse to save me, nor was there the kind of love that was all sunshine and rainbows. Real love was chock-full of problems, and sometimes the prince turned out to be a vampire who killed your kind.</p> <p>\u201cAaron will help you get in contact with Ian. Patrick will assign the stakeout points and the vampires have called in their own reinforcements. I guess they don\u2019t trust us,\u201d Holly snorted like it was the silliest thing.</p><p>\u201cThe extra vampires are here to help us with Ian. I\u2019ve learned he\u2019s been dabbling in magic for a while now. Plus, he\u2019s old enough that his strength and speed paired with magic will make him a difficult target to catch\u2014even for us.\u201d</p><p>Aaron\u2019s admittance that he\u2019d have trouble with Ian was refreshing. A lot of leaders wouldn\u2019t admit such a weakness openly. Holly rolled her eyes, leaned into Patrick and whispered something. Aaron ignored her and walked up to me.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in here so you can concentrate.\u201d He slid an arm around my back and guided me into the living room. With one look from Aaron, the people occupying the couches hightailed it out of the room.</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019ve never tried to contact Ian, correct?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fairly simple. You two have shared blood, and there\u2019s always power in blood. All you have to do is concentrate on him and think something. He should pick up on the thought right away, but make sure you don\u2019t think about the plan to capture him. We don\u2019t want to tip him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Inhaling deeply, I released it at a slow and steady pace as I pictured Ian. \u201cWhat am I supposed to tell him?</p> <p>Aaron thought for a moment. Movement to the right caught my gaze. Alana stood next to Aiden in the kitchen, a fake smile plastered across her cherry red lips as she laughed at something he said. Aiden\u2019s arms were crossed over his chest and although his body seemed tense, a grin dimpled his cheeks. Why the hell were they so chummy?</p><p>\u201cTell him you want to meet with him in Flora to talk about an idea you have. Pretend like you\u2019ve given up on breaking the bond and want to embrace it. There is power in being bonded to a power vampire, Gwen. It could offer you protection from any threats. If anyone was to harm you they\u2019d have to deal with a vampire. And Ian isn\u2019t just any vampire, he\u2019s old enough to be considered a threat and able to produce magic, no one would want him as an enemy.\u201d Aaron quirked his eyebrow in question.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not interested in having Ian as my bodyguard or being bonded to him,\u201d I told him. \u201cI want to be rid of him as much as the VC does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cMake sure you keep your thoughts genuine. Any nervousness and Ian will know something is up.\u201d</p><p>Well that was easier said than done. How was I supposed to keep my thoughts devoid of any emotion? I nodded at Aaron. I closed my eyes so I wouldn\u2019t be distracted. Ian\u2019s face appeared as I concentrated on him.</p><p>Ian? I need to talk to you. I sent the thought out into the universe and hoped Ian would hear it. When he didn\u2019t respond, I thought about our last encounter and focused on the details. His blonde hair was cut close to his head. His blue eyes were mischievous and full of malice. He wasn\u2019t tall, but he wasn\u2019t short either. He had the build of a runner\u2014thin and lean. I remembered the way his accent sounded and the fear in me whenever he was close.</p><p>You rang?\u201d Ian\u2019s voice sounded in my head. My visual concentration worked.</p><p>I want to meet with you.</p><p>Hmm, I\u2019ve been waiting to hear those words, little witch. His voice grew huskier. I tried not to feel repulsed.</p><p>Well, I guess tonight is your lucky night. Meet me in Flora? I made my voice flirtatious and hoped he didn\u2019t see through it.</p><p>Why the change of heart?</p><p>I squashed the panic at his suspicion down as hard as I could. You were right about Aiden. He can\u2019t break the bond without killing himself and he won\u2019t do that. I\u2019ve decided to embrace it rather than fight it. I laced the words in my head with real anger, so Ian would think I was contacting him out of spite for Aiden.</p><p>So, your knights shining armor turned out to be tarnished? I\u2019m not surprised. He told you about the plan, didn\u2019t he? It was my idea, but he agreed you\u2019ll be stronger than she is. You\u2019ll be our savior, little witch.</p><p>I was momentarily speechless, even my mind was blank. My eyes popped open and searched for Aiden. He was still in the kitchen, leaning against the counter and staring back at me. When he saw my expression he stepped forward, but I shook my head. I didn\u2019t know what to say to him or what Ian was talking about. Had Aiden been in contact with him? Who was the \u201cshe\u201d Ian kept talking about, and what did they plan on me doing that would exceed her abilities? I couldn\u2019t trust anyone, not even Aiden. It was almost more than I could stand. My mind reeled with horrible thoughts while my chest compressed like a vice grip had a hold of my lungs. Dropping my head, I sucked in large amounts of air, but it was no use; I was having a panic attack.</p><p>\u201cAre you alright, Gwen?\u201d Aaron placed a hand on my back, and I flinched.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d Aiden asked as he came into the room.</p><p>He hasn\u2019t told you. Ian snorted. That\u2019s not a surprise either, Aiden likes his secrets.</p><p>Shut up!\u201d I couldn\u2019t deal with Ian\u2019s smug remarks or lies. They had to be lies. Once again my heart and brain were at war with each other. The fact Aiden just finished telling me he\u2019d killed a witch and kept it from me was not a point in his favor.</p><p>Don\u2019t shoot the messenger. I\u2019m sorry I was the one to burst your bubble, but don\u2019t you think you deserve to know the truth no matter if it hurts?</p><p>What is the truth, Ian? All you\u2019ve told me is I\u2019m part of some plan that you and Aiden cooked up. What\u2019s the plan? And who is the other woman? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGwen?\u201d Aiden placed his hand under my chin and tried to lift my head. I couldn\u2019t stand for him to touch me. Jumping up, I paced the room with my hands fisted at my side. My magic revved up and looked for a place to be directed. If Aiden wasn\u2019t careful, it\u2019d be him I\u2019d shoot.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Ian say?\u201d If I needed to know the truth in Ian\u2019s words, then the answer was in the way Aiden asked me that question. His voice was nervous and his eyes were wide with worry. He was afraid I learned the secret, not angry about Ian upsetting me. The answer I needed now was what plan had they cooked up.</p> <p>19</p><p>Ian agreed to meet with me at 1:00a.m. I kept my distance from everyone for the rest of the night. My apartment was crowded. I needed room to breathe and think, so I went to Willow Park. Ian didn\u2019t tell me what the plan was telepathically because he wanted to tell me face to face. It didn\u2019t matter how he told me so long as I found out. I had the sneaking suspicion Aiden already thought I knew. His eyes darted around the room like he was waiting for an attack, and when he\u2019d look at me, his eyes showcased worry.</p><p>The setting of the park was so peaceful. Tiny white flurries danced through the midnight air like a winter wonderland ballet. I tried to focus on the beauty, but the ugliness inside my head ruined the tranquility. I should have drew Aiden aside and asked him to explain, but what if I didn\u2019t like what he had to say? Scratch that\u2014I knew I wouldn\u2019t like what he had to say. A girl could only take so many disappointments in one day. I was warned about the possibilities that my spirit walker abilities could drive me insane, but so far Aiden was the closest to putting me in a room with padded walls. Love was complicated and tricky. Love with a vampire was dangerous and thrilling. Up until now our relationship had been thrilling. I still didn\u2019t think Aiden was a danger to me, but he was a danger to my heart. Maybe I needed to give up on men altogether. Fiona gave me a hot pink vibrator, Romeo, for my last birthday, since my love life was pathetic. Maybe I\u2019d start a relationship with Romeo, so I would have to worry about jerks lying to me.</p><p>\u201cWant some company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d</p> <p>Dorian ignored me and sat down on the bench. He stuffed his hands in his leather coat, and stared at the darkened forest.</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I drew my focus back to the playful flurries. We sat in silence for a while before Dorian spoke.</p><p>\u201cYou want to talk about it?\u201d His voice was low and filled with genuine interest.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I knew he was interested in me, even if that interest was just for a one night stand. But guys like that can\u2019t offer helpful advice when it comes to relationship troubles.</p><p>Dorian didn\u2019t press, he stayed quiet until I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. I needed to bitch to someone and since Fiona wasn\u2019t here, Dorian would have to do. \u201cAre all men lying pricks?\u201d</p><p>Dorian swiveled his head to look at me, a grin lifting one side of his mouth up.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. Every man I\u2019ve had the displeasure of meeting has screwed me over. Maybe I should switch teams,\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cBefore you start chasing the ladies, I think I deserve a chance,\u201d Dorian smiled and cocked a brow.</p><p>I shook my head, can\u2019t talk to an interested man about your love life. One way or another it always turns to them being able to please you the way the other losers couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d I scoffed. Just like a man to step up to the plate while you were striking out with another.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Mr. Wonderful do that has you in such a hissy fit?\u201d Dorian snorted.</p><p>\u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business, but I don\u2019t actually know. Ian didn\u2019t tell me the details.\u201d I wasn\u2019t going to tell him about the witch Aiden killed. I didn\u2019t need the lecture. A breeze slapped against my numbed face causing my eyes to water. I wasn\u2019t sure how long I\u2019d been sitting out in the cold.</p><p>\u201cYou just took Ian at his word, without consulting with Aiden? From what I hear, Ian Despereaux isn\u2019t trustworthy, yet you believed whatever he told you without questioning it? Doesn\u2019t seem too smart if you want my opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I said through my trembling teeth. I knew there were two sides to every story, and the side I was hearing was from a man I planned to kill, but I already learned one of Aiden\u2019s secrets tonight, I wasn\u2019t ready to hear anymore.</p> <p>The hour between now and when Ian showed up was supposed to calm me down so I could have clarity and focus. So far, all I managed to do was rile myself up even more. I hoped when the time came to kill Ian, the extra boost of anger I\u2019d dredge up from overthinking would aid me in a victory. One way or another, I\u2019d kill Ian tonight, even if he took me down with him.</p><p>The vampires and witches hid amongst the trees ready to ambush the final culprit in the brew distribution. My eyes scanned the edge of the forest. My hour was up, and Ian would be showing up any minute. All of the lessons Dorian and Kye taught me flowed through my mind as I shuffled through which one would come in handy. My magic tingled just under my skin, ready for anything. Ian was the last person on the earth I wanted to see again but I was anxious to end this. I couldn\u2019t help but fidget as I waited for him to pop up. This time was going to be different. This time I wouldn\u2019t be restricted by the dreaming world. This time I would fight back. Would I even be a threat to Ian? I sure as hell hoped so.</p><p>My head swiveled to the left and right as I scanned the desolate park. The residents of Flora were tucked into their beds safe and warm, not knowing a battle was about to break out at Willow Creek Park. Aiden rounded up some of his vampires to aid in the capture, and Holly ordered the witches living in the surrounding cities to fight. The VC hoped to capture Ian without a fight, but I knew it wouldn\u2019t be that simple. Nothing pertaining to Ian ever was. He wouldn\u2019t just show up empty handed. The crunching of snow under footsteps brought me out of my thoughts. Looking over my shoulder, my eyes met with Ian\u2019s. He was wearing jeans and a long wool dress coat. A smile curled his lips while his eyes moved to observe the surroundings. I wondered if his magic alerted him to the heaps of vampires and witches waiting in the shadows. When he walked over to where I sat on the park bench, I figured he didn\u2019t know this was a set up\u2014yet.</p><p>\u201cLittle witch, you look breathtaking with snowflakes in your hair and pink coloring your cheeks.\u201d He lifted his hand to my face and caressed my cheek. I was proud I didn\u2019t flinch at our contact. I remained silent and calm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you wanted to meet here,\u201d Ian said as he draped an arm on the back of the bench. Willow Creek Park was where Amy Harper, one of Ian\u2019s victims, was found. Before he tainted the beautiful park with the murder, I enjoyed coming here.</p><p>\u201cBefore I throw my morals out the window, I want to know what you and Aiden have planned for me,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Ian looked over at me. \u201cDoes it matter? Your life isn\u2019t much to speak of. Your best friend has moved on, your business is failing, your boyfriend has been lying, and your own kind think you\u2019re no better than a low-life, dirty witch. What do you have to lose?\u201d</p><p>He was trying to smash my self-esteem into dust, so he\u2019d have control over me. His words did touch some sensitive areas. My life had taken a wrong turn somewhere, but then again, so did most peoples\u2019 at one point or another. It wasn\u2019t important that I fell, it only mattered that I got back up. My kind may have thought I was scum for dating and feeding a vampire\u2014so what. Aiden may have lied for the past month, but all of it hadn\u2019t been bad. And my shop, well that was just the risk you take when you start your own business. All of my problems were trivial in the grand scheme of things.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not broken yet,\u201d I told Ian with more confidence than I felt. \u201cI will be by your side, embrace the bond, but I want the details. I think I deserve that much.\u201d</p><p>Ian considered me for a few moments, his electric blue eyes shining like orbs in the darkness. \u201cYou do indeed. Can you imagine being turned into something so frightening even your family thinks you\u2019re a demon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d I stammered unintelligently. His statement caught me off guard, but if my mouth wasn\u2019t confused, I would have told him I knew exactly what that felt like. When I received my powers my parents thought I was evil, I had lived with that feeling for a long time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating, isn\u2019t it? Not having control over your instincts or emotions,\u201d Ian continued. \u201cWhen my sire turned me into vampire, I was studying to become a priest. We\u2019d heard of the bloodthirsty demons that haunted the night and left the streets stained in red. I never imagined I\u2019d become one. But when Pernis La\u2019rue found me, he thought it would be comical to change me rather than kill me. Perhaps, he thought being changed into something so vulgar would challenge my beliefs enough to drive me insane.\u201d Ian sneered as he thought about his past. \u201cIf that was his goal, then he succeeded. I spent my first ten years as vampire hating myself. I refused to eat, which you know will drive a vampire insane. I tried to walk into a church, but the religious meaning no longer held my interest. Instead, all I focused on was the blissful rhythmic flow of blood rushing through the occupants\u2019 veins. I killed all of them that night: six adults and four children. Anger consumed me, I was sure the God I devoted my life to had let me down.\u201d Ian bent over and rested his elbows on his knees. \u201cDo you know what it\u2019s like to have your beliefs yanked out from underneath you? To become the very thing you feared the most? Times were very different then. You would\u2019ve been burned or hanged just for knowing magic, and now the humans embrace us, even if it is from a distance. It\u2019s funny how time changes their perceptions, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I stared wide-eyed, mouth hanging open. Who would have thought there was a time when Ian Despereaux was scared and weak, let alone a seminarian.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re probably wondering where I\u2019m going with this.\u201d Ian said with a grin.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cRevenge, little witch. I\u2019ve been searching for the perfect way to achieve it, and you\u2019re the answer. I had someone lined up, but when I realized a spirit walker would produce the results I needed, I let her go. You may be surprised to learn that\u2014\u201c </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ian didn\u2019t get a chance to finish his sentence. The wind gained speed, turning into a wild vortex that encased us. Snow and debris flew inches away from my face. Out of instinct, my hands went up to block my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Ian snarled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I yelled to be heard over the roaring wind. I didn\u2019t think the weather change was part of the ambush plan.</p> <p>Squinting, I could tell the park was disappearing. It washed away like it was nothing more than a glamour. Ian grabbed ahold of me, his arm going around my stomach as he held me tight to his chest.</p><p>\u201cStop or I\u2019ll rip your throat out!\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing it,\u201d I shouted.</p><p>The vortex slowed, making the new scenery more visible. Trees replaced the open space, my eyes roamed right and then left. We were transported into the middle of a forest I didn\u2019t recognize as part of Flora. When the air dissipated and Ian and I were free, he didn\u2019t loosen his grasp on me. His body shifted from side to side as he guarded himself against an unseen threat. I stumbled over my feet as he moved with me in his arms. I expected the cavalry to jump out of the tree line and attack, maybe this was a part of the plan, but when Holly appeared before us, a wicked smile curling her lips, I knew it wasn\u2019t that simple.</p><p>\u201cHello, Ian,\u201d she said with vehemence.</p> <p>Confused, I stared at her. She addressed Ian like she knew him\u2014well.</p><p>\u201cThis is your doing then?\u201d Ian snorted.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I questioned.</p><p>Ian let go of my waist, but kept a hold of my arm. He and Holly stared at each other, energy building in the air until the electricity sparked against my skin. The hairs on my arms stood on end.</p><p>\u201cDid you think I\u2019d just let you throw me away like a piece of trash?\u201d Holly said in a calculating, calm tone. Whatever was going on, her pride was evident in her smile and the gleam of her eye.</p><p>\u201cYour dear High Priestess was the one who was picked for my plan. When she told me of you, however, I knew she wouldn\u2019t make the cut. Imagine my surprise that a spirit walker lived, unaware of her power. As you may know, spirit walkers are a coveted commodity. How you managed to stay free all these years, I\u2019ll never know,\u201d Ian spoke to me, but kept his gaze on Holly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d I asked Ian. \u201cYou were scheming with Ian this entire time?\u201d I directed the question at Holly. All of her actions, the war, her thinly veiled hatred of me, the reaction to my bond with Ian, it all made sense now. Kye told me she\u2019d loved one man, was that man Ian Despereaux?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think so highly of your spirit walker,\u201d Holly laughed. \u201cDid you know there was an army of witches and vampires in the forest ready to kill you? Gwen set the whole thing up, yet you pick her over me?\u201d</p><p>I gaped at Holly. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d be stupid not to have backup,\u201d Ian interjected. \u201cI knew they were there, but you were a surprise. I presume you cloaked yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t have you anticipating my plan,\u201d Holly said, almost flirtatiously.</p><p>\u201cHold the fuck up!\u201d I threw my arms in the air. Ian released his grip on me, and I walked a few feet between the two of them. \u201cWill someone please tell me what in the hell is going on? And don\u2019t speak cryptically about \u2019the plan\u2018.\u201d I bent my fingers and mimicked air quotes.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see in her? She\u2019s a dimwitted twit,\u201d Holly added.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Ian agreed. \u201cBut she\u2019s nice to look at, and she tastes marvelous.\u201d</p> <p>I shot Ian a disgusted look.</p><p>\u201cThe plan is this, little witch.\u201d Ian ignored my murderous glare. \u201cI told you how I became a vampire, and I\u2019ve been searching for revenge ever since. As a spirit walker you are connected to this reality and the dimension of the dead. As you know, vampires were created from demons, and since demons live within the realm of the dead, you are thereby connected to vampires\u2014at least enough for my plan to work. You will be the first of its kind, little witch, a mixture of vampirism, witch, and spirit walker, a hybrid.\u201d Ian looked almost giddy at the prospect of his ridiculous idea.</p><p>I watched him for a few minutes, processing everything he\u2019d said before I started laughing. \u201cYou\u2019ve had over eight hundred years to plan your revenge, and that\u2019s what you came up with? Everyone knows witches can\u2019t absorb the vampire virus, and even if they could, how would that help you extract your revenge?\u201d I was smiling ear to ear pointing out the flaws in his idea.</p><p>Ian\u2019s hand wrapped around my throat before I even realized he moved. My smile fell off my lips as I coughed and gasped to catch oxygen.</p><p>\u201cHolly is right. You\u2019re a daft little bitch.\u201d</p><p>I clawed at Ian\u2019s hands and kicked against air as he lifted me off of the ground. I was sure if he squeezed any harder my larynx would be crushed. Spots dotted my vision as darkness crept along the edges. Just when I was sure I\u2019d pass out, he dropped me. I crumpled to the ground, my throat burning and already swollen.</p><p>\u201cSilly man doesn\u2019t like to be laughed at,\u201d Holly advised. Her tone was more amused than concerned.</p><p>\u201cHolly thought the same thing, that witches couldn\u2019t be turned into a vampire hybrid,\u201d Ian picked up his story like he didn\u2019t just lose his cool and almost kill me. \u201cIt was her plan to unleash the secret of the witches blood in hopes that once vampires obtained magic, we\u2019d be connected enough to transfer the virus.\u201d Ian clasped his hands behind his back and paced the area in front of me. I kept my head down but watched his shoes move back and forth. I looked in Holly\u2019s direction, astounded to hear she was the one who\u2019d shared the secret of the witches\u2019 blood. From what I\u2019d heard around Moon, it took a very dark spell to break the protection the Goddess set in motion to protect us from the vampires. How she found a way around that was beyond me.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t work, of course,\u201d Ian continued. \u201cIt almost killed your High Priestess. Her body rejected my blood, but it wasn\u2019t all a waste. A new drug was uncovered. You have no idea how boring it gets to drink the same thing over and over. Brew, I came up with the name, is more powerful than I ever imagined, and magic is exhilarating. I feel alive with it coursing through my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will work. I just need to take small doses at a time, build up a tolerance,\u201d Holly interjected, stepping forward. Her auburn hair framed her alabaster face. Wide green eyes almost pleaded for Ian to agree with her. If I had any doubts before, I didn\u2019t now. Holly was in love with him.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been involved with Ian?\u201d I asked, my voice raspy.</p><p>\u201cTen years,\u201d Holly answered, her voice distant as she thought about some reserved memory. \u201cWe loved each other, at least until the plan ruined it. Ian became obsessed with the idea of creating a hybrid.\u201d</p><p>Ian must have discarded Holly when he figured out she wasn\u2019t able to change, and Holly struck back by gathering her followers and declaring a war. It was nothing more than a lover\u2019s quarrel. They made the perfect couple; Holly was just as heartless as Ian.</p><p>\u201cThe council will kill you for your betrayal,\u201d I growled. Multiple witches and warlocks had already been killed. Those lives were on Holly\u2019s hands. She was responsible for everything, the witches\u2019 deaths and the addiction.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll never find out because you, my dear, will be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to touch her,\u201d Ian warned and stepped in front of me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you too if I have to,\u201d Holly said.</p><p>They stood ten feet apart, both ready for the other to make the first move. Holly\u2019s hands blazed a brilliant blue as she geared up to strike Ian.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I said as I picked myself up from the ground. Holly and Ian glanced at me. \u201cWhat part did Aiden play in this plan? Or were you lying?\u201d I asked Ian.</p><p>Holly snorted and motioned with her head to a tree a few feet away. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask him yourself?\u201d</p><p>My eyes followed the movement. Aiden was pressed against the base of a tree, held by invisible restraints. Holly twirled her hand in a circular gesture and Aiden gasped.</p><p>\u201cTell her,\u201d Holly snarled.</p><p>\u201cGwen, this isn\u2019t how I wanted you to find out,\u201d Aiden replied, his words like a hammer to the fragile hope I still held onto. Piece by piece I saw the walls of our relationship come tumbling down. No longer was I looking at the man I loved, but a stranger. My heart couldn\u2019t fathom his confirmation that Ian hadn\u2019t been lying.</p><p>\u201cYou were a part of this the entire time?\u201d I breathed, almost unable to form the words on my quivering lips.</p><p>\u201cIan came to me when I was helping with the brew case and told me about his plan. I was against it at first, but then I thought about the possibilities. You and I could be together forever, my Gwen. If you could turn vampire, we\u2019d never have to say goodbye,\u201d Aiden said, his eyes begging me to understand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a witch, we live for at least three-hundred years,\u201d I said incredulously.</p><p>\u201cOh please,\u201d Holly laughed. \u201cQuit lying to the poor girl. Ian isn\u2019t the only one with the taste of revenge in his heart. Isn\u2019t it true the La\u2019rue\u2019s did some damage to you as well? If I\u2019m not mistaken, they turned you and killed your family? Sounds like a reason for wanting a hybrid if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>My eyes welled with tears. My heart slammed against my chest. I stared motionless at Aiden. My entire body felt broken at the revelation.</p><p>\u201cSo your plan was to fuck me, gain my trust and talk me into becoming a hybrid?\u201d My voice grew with each word, turning into a scream that seared my swollen throat. I wanted to rip his head off, tear out his heart and stomp on it. I wanted to destroy him.</p><p>\u201cVampires, they\u2019re leeches that\u2019ll drain everything out of you,\u201d Holly remarked.</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I roared.</p><p>\u201cGwen, it wasn\u2019t like that. I was still just considering the idea. I\u2019d never allow harm to come to you. You must know that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat a piece of work,\u201d Holly snickered.</p><p>I was beyond angry, I was pissed. Turning towards my council leader, I flung my hand out and cast a stream of magic at her. Holly, caught off guard, shot into the air and landed with a hard thump. \u201cI said, Shut. The. Fuck. Up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe may be daft sometimes, but she\u2019s got spunk,\u201d Ian said with a laugh.</p> <p>I tried to throw him on his ass, but he anticipated the move and blocked the orb I cast towards him. The next thing I knew, all hell broke loose.</p><p>Holly regained her footing, the ire in her eyes directed at me. I strengthened my spirit walker powers during my time in Moon, but my witchy ones weren\u2019t even a portion of Holly\u2019s. Circling her hands around each other, her magic grew into a large orb. Flinging her hands outwards, the orb sailed across the distance and slammed into my chest like a freight train. I was propelled through the air, my body doing 360s from the impact. When I hit the ground, I was sure I was dead. Every bone in my body felt broken. Blood seeped over my eye, causing a red haze to tint my view. I tried to push my arms against the ground to stand, but they didn\u2019t want to move.</p><p>I lay on the ground sure that Holly\u2019s next strike would end my life. Twigs snapped as footsteps sounded behind me. Cold fingers pressed against my jugular.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive, you\u2019re lucky,\u201d Ian growled.</p><p>A fight erupted as Holly and Ian attacked each other. A fleeting thought about what a strange couple they were fluttered through my mind when I heard Dorian\u2019s voice. My face was pressed against the ground and my body refused to move, I couldn\u2019t search for where he hid.</p> <p>\u201cGwen, you have the power to defeat them,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d I croaked. I hated how weak I sounded and even more so that I was asking to be saved.</p><p>Holly screamed from something Ian did, and the surrounding area lit up like the fourth of July as she attacked him with her power. Out of my peripheral vision I could make out their shapes against the bright light, but I couldn\u2019t tell who was winning. If Holly won, she\u2019d finish me off next. If Ian won, I\u2019d die when he tried to change me. I still didn\u2019t understand why he thought I could accept the vampire virus, but I tried not to understand crazy people as a rule.</p><p>\u201cConcentrate,\u201d Dorian said. His voice sounded hollow like it emanated out of thin air. My head was cluttered with a horde of dizzy butterflies and my vision went in and out of focus as I tried to fight the darkness.</p><p>\u201cDorian?\u201d I whispered right before the icy fingertips of death took me.</p><p>20</p> <p>I\u2019ve heard people say your entire life flashes before your eyes when you die. The images that flashed through my subconscious were some of the happiest times of my life. Like slides in a projector, I revisited those times that meant the most. The first memory was when I was five years old. The sun was high in the sky and the grass was thick and green. Buttery beams cascaded my backyard in warmth. My father was on all fours, pretending to be a bear as he chased me. My pigtails bobbed up and down as I squealed and ran from him. With his large arms, he swooped me up and tickled my belly. I was safe in his embrace\u2014loved.</p><p>The memory faded and another replaced it. My sister, Rebekah, and I were snuggled in my bed as my mother sat on the edge reading us fairy tales. Our eyes were wide as we absorbed the story, and my mother\u2019s voice was full of emotion as she spoke of the evil witch who bewitched Snow White and the loving prince who could awaken her with just a kiss. When she finished the tale, a smile spread across her lips. I remember thinking how beautiful she was and hoped that I would be just as beautiful one day.</p><p>The memory shifted to the day I arrived in Moon, feeling lost and alone. A blond girl named Fiona popped out of the woods and befriended me. She accepted me just when my world had thrown me away. Various images of our time together flitted through my mind: the day we accidently set fire to the castle\u2019s drapes in the ballroom, the year Fiona worked a love spell that backfired and made her love everyone she met, and all of the times she filled my heart with laughter.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t tormented with regret or heartache. I didn\u2019t weep for the things I never got to do or remember those who\u2019d wronged me. In the end, it was happiness and love that occupied my mind.</p><p>Awareness washed over me. Death\u2019s frigid grasp still clung to me, and I wondered which reaper would claim my soul. My eyelids fluttered as I tried to regain consciousness. I could feel the grittiness of the dirt embedded against my skin and hear snarls and grunts somewhere in the distance. Confusion overwhelmed my mind as I tried to make sense of it all.</p><p>\u201cGet up, Gwen,\u201d the familiar voice demanded.</p><p>My eyelids felt heavy as I tried to pry them open. I managed to see my surroundings through slits. I was still in the forest, maybe I\u2019d never left. The wind whipped against my face but my body felt numb, oblivious to the cold elements.</p><p>\u201cEmbrace death, Gwen,\u201d the angry, masculine voice ordered. Concentrating on the voice, my memory weaved itself back together. I knew that voice; I heard it for the past three weeks and even argued with it on more than one occasion.</p> <p>\u201cDorian?\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure if I said his name or thought it.</p><p>\u201cGet your ass up and fight,\u201d Dorian responded with urgency.</p><p>His words floated through my mind, and I worked to make sense of them. \u201cI think I\u2019m dying,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dying, I won\u2019t allow it. Use what I taught you and get up!\u201d Dorian\u2019s voice grew angrier, the frigid grasp tightening.</p><p>Without questioning his command, I tried to push myself up, arms quivering under the pressure before they collapse back down. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>But I had to move. If I stayed crumpled on the ground Holly would send another supercharged orb to finish me off. My mind was mending, but my body refused to follow suit. How in the hell did Dorian expect me to get up? Whatever kind of magic Holly shot me with rendered me helpless. Panic seeped in along the edges of my awareness and overtook the tranquility of the visions.</p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you to embrace death, woman? Use your powers to your advantage and get up already. You know what to do, find the calm and concentrate.\u201d</p><p>Find the calm and concentrate. I grabbed onto those words and replayed them as I slowed my breathing and eased my frantic heartbeat. Dorian taught me how to sense death on people, and I was surrounded by three individuals who had blood on their hands. I could almost smell it, like rotten fruit and flesh mixed together\u2014pungent and rancid.</p><p>Strangely, the smell didn\u2019t make me sick. Instead, it drew me in and captured my inner spirit walker; it called to it like a long lost friend. My body became a peaceful abyss as I clung to the death and used it as a life preserver. No longer did I feel weighted down by broken bones and bruises. I was weightless and free of my prison. Sitting up, I pressed my hands against the ground and stood.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Dorian encouraged me.</p><p>The fuzziness was replaced with clarity. Holly and Ian lunged at each other ten feet away. Trails of blood streaked Holly\u2019s face and red blotches stained Ian\u2019s shirt. Holly\u2019s hand glowed with magic even in this washed out world of gray. Looking over my shoulder, I saw my wrecked body still curled on the ground.</p><p>Whatda know, Kye\u2019s lesson about astral projecting actually came in handy.</p><p>My eyes wandered over the clearing and stopped when they found Aiden. He was still bound to the tree, his gaze glued to my still body. Looking at him hurt my heart. I hated the way his black hair hung loosely over his piercing blue eyes and the way his lips reminded me of how his kisses taste. I hated the way his entire body caused wild fires in my mind as the times we\u2019d spent between the sheets came back to me. I hated that he had the nerve to look worried as he watched my lifeless body. But most of all, I hated that I didn\u2019t hate him for what he\u2019d done. Maybe Holly and Ian were right, I was a stupid bitch.</p><p>\u201cGwen, focus,\u201d Dorian chided from somewhere behind me. Ignoring Aiden, I searched for Dorian. Standing under a large Maple tree, Dorian watched me with pride and amusement. Nodding his head in Holly and Ian\u2019s direction, he said, \u201cShow them just how badass spirit walkers are.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and turned my attention towards the fighting couple. Something had changed in me, perhaps it was the acceptance of what I was, but I didn\u2019t feel the least bit intimidated or scared to use my powers. With confident steps I approached Holly and Ian. My anger boiled to the surface as they assaulted each other. Both were bad, and both deserved to die\u2014and I was the only one who could do it.</p><p>I didn\u2019t love the thought of killing anyone, but I would do what I had to do to protect my people and myself. A smile spread across my lips as I thought about how easier my life would be without them in it. Holly would no longer control me, and I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with Ian\u2019s ridiculous plan. Maybe in this instance it wouldn\u2019t be so bad.</p><p>I only had one shot and screwing up wasn\u2019t an option. Killing them was going to be tricky. While she couldn\u2019t see me, I was absolutely sure she\u2019d be able to sense me once she wasn\u2019t occupied with Ian. Ian could vanish into the night at any sign something wasn\u2019t going according to his plans. All either of them would have to do is kill my vulnerable body, and I was a goner. \u201cI could use some help,\u201d I said over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou have to do it on your own,\u201d Dorian advised.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d My brow furrowed as I tried to see his logic.</p><p>\u201cThis is your chance to become one with the side of yourself you\u2019ve been repressing,\u201d Dorian said as he appeared by my side. \u201cThink of it as our final lesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I would\u2019ve known it would come down to life and death, I would\u2019ve paid more attention.\u201d My voice trembled, but I swallowed over the nervousness that crawled up my throat.</p><p>\u201cEvery day is a battle between life and death. The sooner you learn that, the better chance you have of surviving. Now quit stalling, and clean up the trash.\u201d</p><p>It was just like Dorian to spout something profound right before I was about to kill two people. \u201cHere goes,\u201d I said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t know how to do a lot, but what I did know, I planned to use to my advantage. An army of angry spirits was at my beck and call. My mind cleared as I concentrated on their presence lingering nearby. When I opened my eyes, multiple gray bodies formed around me. There were forty translucent figures in total, with their dark gazes pinned to me.</p><p>\u201cRestrain them,\u201d I ordered, pointing my finger at Holly and Ian. The spirits didn\u2019t waste time. Rushing towards them like the wind, Holly and Ian were thrown to the ground by invisible attackers they couldn\u2019t fend off.</p><p>Walking closer to Ian, I bent on one knee next to him. \u201cThis little game you\u2019ve been playing is over. You lose.\u201d I conjured a stake made out of silver and smiled when his sarcastic facial expression turned to fear. Kye was able to hear me when I was out of my body, I was sure Ian could too.</p> <p>\u201cGwen, don\u2019t do it. I\u2019m trying to help you.\u201d Ian\u2019s eyes searched to find me. He thrashed on the ground, but the spirits did their job and held him down.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cBy turning me into a hybrid? How does that help me?\u201d</p><p>I could see relief in his blue eyes, like he thought he could talk his way out of dying, but there would be no reprieve for him. I had the stake poised an inch above his chest and was just trying to squeeze a little more information out of him before I sent his ashes dancing in the wind.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be more powerful than your council and mine. You won\u2019t have to answer to anyone. Your life will be yours to live without the restrictions. Killing the La\u2019rues is the only payment I ask for.\u201d His tone said I was a fool if I didn\u2019t accept, but power never interested me. If he had said I could live in peace and quiet for the rest of my life, I may have taken a moment to think about it.</p><p>\u201cWhen is everyone going to get it through their thick skulls that I don\u2019t want power? I don\u2019t want to be coveted or used as a weapon. I just want to be left alone!\u201d</p> <p>My hand tightened around the stake until my knuckles turned white. Ian wasn\u2019t going to tell me anything useful. I pumped myself up to drive the stake through his chest, when a white light exploded in front of my face and sent me and the spirits flying backwards.</p><p>Ian regained his footing and took off in a blur. Without thinking, I took off after him. I couldn\u2019t see where he went, but I could sense him through the bond. He was nervous and angry, the feelings washed through me as if they were my own. Following the direction the emotions came from, I caught sight of him as he fled down a sidewalk. Before I could catch up, he turned and I lost him again.</p><p>My footsteps were light, like I was floating. Hell maybe I was. I didn\u2019t know all the tricks that came with an out of body experience. Continuing to follow Ian\u2019s emotions, I ran and ran, not needing to catch my breath.</p><p>Give it up, little witch you can\u2019t kill me. Ian\u2019s voice popped into my head. The intrusion was shocking, but not enough to falter my steps.</p><p>Then why are you running? I taunted and added a chuckle for good measure. The only thing bigger than Ian\u2019s death count was his ego. I waited for his response, but only my own thoughts played in my mind. My eyes flicked back and forth as I ran. I kept a firm grip on the silver stake. Ian couldn\u2019t ambush me because he couldn\u2019t see me, but whatever magic he used to break free of the ghosts worked on me too. I wasn\u2019t sure if the magic would kill me, but I wasn\u2019t going to risk it.</p><p>A dog barked in the distance, the same area I felt a pull to Ian. \u201cGotcha!\u201d I said to myself and took off in the direction.</p> <p>My feet halted when I came to the end of a dark alley between two buildings. The scent of urine and garbage harassed my nostrils. A large dumpster sat along the brick wall, and a fire escape crawled up the exterior of the building. Looking up, I searched the shadows for any sign of Ian. Nothing. Closing my eyes, I tried to feel him. The feeling of amusement washed through me right before I was shoved from behind.</p><p>I whirled around. Ian stood stock still with his arms at his sides, head down and eyes closed. \u201cYour little disappearing act has a flaw, little witch,\u201d Ian said.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? What\u2019s that?\u201d I took a couple steps backwards, ready for whatever Ian planned to throw at me.</p><p>\u201cI may not be able to see you, but I can sense you.\u201d</p><p>I chided myself for being so stupid. Of course if I could sense him, he could sense me. My mind was too busy thinking about burying my stake in his heart than taking safety precautions.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see how flawless my plan is?\u201d Ian lifted his head and looked in my direction. I took a step to the right to escape his gaze. His eyes didn\u2019t follow the movement. \u201cCan\u2019t you see I want to make you something so unique? Others will worship you, little witch\u201d</p><p>I thought for a moment. \u201cHow would I be any different than you? You\u2019re a vampire who performs magic. Why do you need to create a hybrid?\u201d</p><p>Ian tilted his head. His eyes trailed in my direction, and I moved away from the spot again. If he was going to blast me with magic, I sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to be an easy target.</p> <p>\u201cI need to refill my supply of magic. The more powerful I become, the more I need. It doesn\u2019t last long. But with you, you have magic and spirit walker in you, a deadly combination. I\u2019m a fraud; you\u2019d be the real deal.\u201d</p><p>With soft steps I inched closer to where Ian stood making sure I kept my emotions in check so not to tip him off. I tightened my grip on the stake and took a couple seconds to enjoy the moment. A month of murder and mayhem was about to end tonight. As I raised my arm, the hunger for Ian\u2019s death gnawed at my heart. \u201cNot interested,\u201d I said as I threw my arm forward and plunged the stake into Ian\u2019s chest. A sadistic smile crawled onto his lips, and he stared ahead, a gleam of amusement flashing through his eyes. I shoved the stake deeper hoping I hadn\u2019t missed his heart.</p><p>Ian fell to his knees, dropped his head and stared at the stake protruding from his chest. Flakes of skin broke away from his body and drifted away in the breeze. I\u2019d never seen a vampire die. It was eerie and fantastic. I actually killed Ian Despereaux. I wanted to jump for joy and sing Hallelujah. Cracks ran through Ian\u2019s skin as pieces of flesh continued to break off and disappear. He stared straight ahead emotionless as his body disintegrated.</p><p>I devoured the happiness that snaked its way through my entire being. I didn\u2019t think too hard on the many reasons why that was disturbing, and let myself have the moment. Watching a body crumble and wither before my eyes was grotesque, but when that someone was Ian Despereaux, it seemed right to smile rather than cringe.</p><p>It took ten minutes for his entire body to flake away and I watched, unblinking, until the end. When the last piece of him fell to the dirt covered concrete a shot of searing pain ricocheted through my body. I stumbled and grasped at my heart, sure it was burning through my ribcage.</p><p>\u201cGwen?\u201d Dorian\u2019s voice came over the high pitched buzzing in my eardrums.</p><p>\u201cJust breathe,\u201d Dorian instructed.</p><p>My jaw dropped as I sucked in the cool night air. Dorian bent over what ashes were left of Ian and made gestures with his hands. The ashes lifted into the air, hovered a moment, and then drifted away. Once they disappeared from the scene of the crime, the pain vanished along with them.</p><p>\u201cW-what was that?\u201d I stammered, catching my breath.</p><p>\u201cThe bond breaking,\u201d Dorian stepped closer, his eyes appraising me. \u201cIf the bond doesn\u2019t have something to connect to, it dies right along with its counterpart. Pretty painful?\u201d</p><p>My head bobbed. \u201cIt felt like my bones were on fire and my heart was going to rip through my chest. How is that possible when I\u2019m not even in my body?\u201d</p><p>Dorian motioned for me to follow him out of the alley. \u201cWhen a bond is formed, it\u2019s formed with the soul, not the body. Long ago bonds were shared between lovers, hence the phrase \u2019soul mates\u2018. Over time the phrase was redefined to mean something a lot less supernatural and a lot cheesier. Humans are always looking for the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.\u201d</p><p>I wondered how many other human terms were stolen from the supernatural.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about killing him numerous times, but now that he\u2019s dead, I\u2019m not sure how to process it. I keep waiting for him to pop up for one last scare. How many times did they kill Jason in the movies, yet he still kept coming back for more. I\u2019m not sure I believe he\u2019s really out of my life for good, ya know?\u201d</p><p>Dorian laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s gone for good, Gwen. I sent his soul to the hereafter and his body is scattered across the state. There\u2019s no coming back,\u201d he paused. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of you. I didn\u2019t think you had it in ya to finish him off.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t take offense from his admittance because I wasn\u2019t sure I could either. I didn\u2019t even hesitate to bury the stake in his heart and that worried me. Brushing off my unease, I smiled at Dorian. \u201cI had a good teacher.\u201d</p><p>21</p><p>If I thought my problems were over once Ian was dust in the wind, I was mistaken. Dorian and I made our way back to my body to find Holly and the council standing in a circle around it.</p><p>\u201cOnce I realized Gwen was in cahoots with Ian Despereaux, I cast a paralyzing spell,\u201d Holly explained to the members of the NAWC. That was a lie; whatever spell she threw at me had been something a lot more deadly. The members were too busy observing my body and chatting with each other to notice the tightness of Holly\u2019s lips or the slight twitch of eye.</p><p>\u201cYou did well. I can\u2019t believe Ms. Sparks fooled us,\u201d Charles said. The council members joined hands, forming a circle around my still body, and began to chant.</p><p>\u201cDorian, you have\u2014\u201c I turned to face him, but he wasn\u2019t beside me anymore.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Dorian said. The council members paused in the middle of their chant and turned towards him. He stepped through the crowd surrounding my body, his eyes locked on Holly.</p><p>\u201cI believe the one who fooled you is standing right there,\u201d he nodded in Holly\u2019s direction. \u201cI was witness to the entire thing. Holly and\u2014\u201c </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow dare you!\u201d Holly snapped, feigning innocence.</p><p>\u201cI saw it too.\u201d Aiden stepped out from the trees with a group of his vampires in tow. Everyone tensed, their eyes travelling back and forth. Holly took a couple steps backwards as her gaze traveled over the many faces.</p><p>\u201cHolly, what are they talking about?\u201d Charles questioned, without enough suspicion. If Holly were able to talk her way out of this mess, my future would be short.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re all in it together,\u201d Holly argued. \u201cThey want you to think I\u2019m the one responsible.\u201d</p><p>Anger stewed inside of me. Stalking over to her, I tried to punch the lying bitch. But my hand went through her face. Holly\u2019s features furrowed as she looked at the space in front of her, not seeing me. My focus was waning. It took a lot of concentration to make physical contact, and I was already starting to feel weak from killing Ian.</p><p>\u201cResponsible for what?\u201d Patrick questioned.</p><p>Obviously, the council had just arrived on the scene. They didn\u2019t seem sure about what happened. A smile crept onto my face as I watched Holly wiggle under their penetrating stares.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure on all of the details but from what I gathered; Gwen has been dabbling in black magic. She transported us here so she and Ian could kill me.\u201d Holly scowled. \u201cWhy am I being questioned? Seize her and take her back to Moon.\u201d</p> <p>Charles walked over to Holly and placed a hand on her shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to understand what happened. No one is accusing you of anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGwen was not involved with Ian Despereaux,\u201d Aiden spoke up. \u201cIf you wish to condemn her without a fair trial, than the war you\u2019ve been itching for will happened.\u201d</p><p>The group of vampires surrounding Aiden stepped forward, fangs down and eyes blackened. One word from him and they\u2019d attack.</p><p>Dorian stood guard over my body while everyone waited for the other to strike first. It was frustrating not being able to speak for myself, but I was happy to have these two men to speak on my behalf. Whether or not their chivalry could save my life was the big question.</p><p>\u201cIf what you say is true, I think a trial would be the best way to settle this matter. We do not wish to fight if we don\u2019t have to,\u201d Charles stated. Charles seemed like the more level headed of the group, the others looked more than willing to fight.</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous!\u201d Holly stomped her foot. \u201cShe tried to kill me, and last time I checked, it was a death sentence to harm a council member.\u201d</p> <p>Charles smiled sympathetically, \u201cI\u2019m having trouble understanding exactly what happened. We cannot sentence Gwen to death until all the facts are clear. Does everyone agree?\u201d He turned to the remaining members.</p><p>Time slowed as I waited for the verdict. Their stillness made my nerves twist as I held my breath. One head slowly nodded followed by several more agreeing nods, joyful relief soared through my soul.</p><p>\u201cGwen Sparks will go to trial,\u201d Charles stated.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Three days passed after that horrible night. The NAWC members returned to Moon, but not before placing a tracking spell on me\u2014should I feel the need to flee. The trial was scheduled for two weeks from now. Although I should have been nervous and afraid, I knew I was innocent. The only emotion I felt was impatience. I didn\u2019t like that Holly had two weeks to plan a counter attack. Knowing her, she\u2019d find a way to kill me before I had a chance to tell the council what really happened. Charles surprised me by stepping up and defending my right to share my side of the story. During my entire stay in Moon, he\u2019d been passive. I was happy in the end he found his voice and spoke up for me.</p><p>Two soft knocks on my front door pulled me from my thoughts. I placed the coffee carafe I\u2019d been filling down and opened the door. Aiden stood on the other side of the threshold, his hands stuffed in his pockets and uncertainty on his face.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I regarded him for a few moments, still not sure whether or not I should trust him. I spent the past three days going over every little detail of our relationship. Those three long days had been filled with tear stained cheeks and a piles of snotty tissues.</p> <p>\u201cCome in,\u201d I told him as I walked back to the coffee pot. I wanted to forget his involvement with Ian\u2019s plan, but the sensible part of my brain wouldn\u2019t allow me to. I needed answers to help me understand.</p><p>Aiden pulled out a chair and sat at my kitchen table. I kept my hands busy, filling the coffee tank with water, the filter with grounds and washing down the counter. I could feel Aiden\u2019s stare penetrating my body as I avoided making eye contact with him.</p><p>\u201cGwen, please sit down,\u201d Aiden said.</p><p>Closing my eyes, I took a moment to suck in a deep breath. I walked to the table and sat, my muscles tense. Somehow I found the courage to make eye contact without my eyes welling with tears\u2014small victories. I kept my arms crossed so Aiden couldn\u2019t reach for me. \u201cOkay, what do you have to say?\u201d I asked in my best faux confidence tone. I knew Aiden wasn\u2019t fooled, the swelling of my eyes was evidence enough I\u2019d been crying recently.</p><p>\u201cI was greedy, Gwen. When I heard about the plan, that you could possibly accept the vampire virus, all I thought about was spending eternity with you. I didn\u2019t share Ian\u2019s interest in the plan, I promise.\u201d He tilted his head, his blue eyes watching me with remorse. I reminded myself not to get lost in those aqua pools. It was too easy to lose myself in his beauty rather than pay attention to the person underneath.</p><p>\u201cYou can understand how that\u2019s hard for me to believe, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll give me the opportunity to redeem myself,\u201d Aiden\u2019s lips curved in a sad smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lied to me twice, Aiden,\u201d I began and then paused when my voice began to tremble. \u201cI need time to think about things, to get my head in order. As much as I\u2019d love to believe you, to believe this is some sort of nightmare that I\u2019ll wake up from, I can\u2019t. Things have changed.\u201d My vision blurred as tears filled my eyes. \u201cPlease just give me some space for a while.\u201d</p><p>Aiden nodded, his lips tightening. \u201cI\u2019ll give you whatever you want, my Gwen,\u201d he said as he stood and placed a kiss on top of my head. \u201cBut I\u2019m not giving up. You\u2019re worth fighting for.\u201d Without another word, I watched Aiden leave.</p><p>Another day passed before another unexpected visitor showed up. The apartment felt empty and sad lately. Fiona stayed in Moon to be with Ethan and study spell casting, so the bubbliness she supplied was missing.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said to Dorian as I opened the door.</p><p>\u201cHungry?\u201d He held up a pizza box and stepped past me into the kitchen. Shutting the door behind him, I scowled at the back of his head. I didn\u2019t need Dorian further complicating my life. My brain was trying to sort through the drama with Aiden, it didn\u2019t have the power to analyze my feelings for the Angel of Death too.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I said as I followed him into the living room.</p><p>\u201cMind if I eat? I\u2019m starving.\u201d Dorian sat on the couch, grabbing a piece of pizza and the remote.</p><p>\u201cMake yourself at home,\u201d I said sarcastically. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>The channel settled on Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein. Dorian laughed at something silly Abbot had done. I didn\u2019t want to scrutinize the fact he chose one of my favorite movies, but not a lot of people watched movies from the forties.</p><p>\u201cI heard Fiona stayed in Moon,\u201d Dorian said, bringing his gaze to me.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you have a room free. I need a place to stay for a while.\u201d His eyes roamed over my apartment. \u201cIt\u2019s a little small, but it\u2019ll do for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold up,\u201d I said as I sat down in my favorite overstuffed chair. \u201cYou\u2019re not staying here.\u201d There was no way I could sort through my dramatic life with Dorian on the sidelines. Not to mention the connection that strung us together by some invisible tether I had yet to understand.</p><p>\u201cLook at it this way, I\u2019ll continue to teach you, and my payment will be room and board. Holly isn\u2019t going to allow you to rat her out to the council. You need me.\u201d</p><p>I grumbled and thought about turning him away. I knew my life was in danger and any night one of Holly\u2019s henchmen could show up to silence me forever.</p><p>\u201cFine, but we\u2019re just roommates. Nothing sexual will be taking place between us, got it?\u201d I gave him a pointed look.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he grinned. </p> </body></html>"]
