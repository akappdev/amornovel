But he wanted his trip to Nevada to be as discreet as it was brief, so ignoring the protests of his companion, he\u2019d chosen to spend the day waiting for his meeting with the local clan chief in the forgotten caves.</p><p>And, if he were honest with himself, it was a relief not to be stuck with the formal ceremony his position demanded. He was a fierce predator, not a damned politician, and the need to play nice gave him a rash.</p><p>Besides, it was always a pleasure to yank Viper\u2019s chain.</p> <p>Styx made a brief survey of the empty desert that surrounded them, absently knocking the dust from his leather pants, which were tucked in to a pair of heavy boots. A black T-shirt was stretched over his massive chest with a tiny amulet threaded on a leather strip wrapped around his thick neck. That was his only jewelry besides the polished turquoise stones that were threaded through the dark, braided hair that hung to the back of his knees.</p><p>His dark eyes glowed with a golden light of power in the thickening dusk as he at last turned toward his companion, barely hiding his smile. Unlike him, Viper, the clan chief of Chicago, had no love for \u201croughing it.\u201d</p><p>Dressed in a black velvet coat that reached his knees with a frilled white satin shirt and black slacks, he looked like he was on his way to the nearest ballroom. An impression only emphasized by his long hair the pale silver of moonlight, which was left free to flow down his back, and his eyes the startling darkness of midnight.</p><p>Styx was raw, savage power.</p><p>Viper was an exquisite fallen angel who was no less lethal.</p><p>With a pointed glance toward the Las Vegas skyline that glowed like a distant jewel, Viper met Styx\u2019s gaze with a sour grimace. \u201cThe next time you want me to join you on a road trip, Styx, feel free to lose my number.\u201d</p><p>Styx arched a dark brow. \u201cI thought everyone loved Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich was why I agreed to this little excursion.\u201d Viper tugged at his lace cuffs, managing to look immaculate despite his hours in the dusty cavern. \u201cYou failed to mention I was going to be staying in a damned mine instead of the penthouse suite at the Bellagio.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve stayed in worse places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse?\u201d Viper pointed toward the rotting boards that did a half-ass job of covering the entrance to the tunnel. \u201cIt was filthy, it smelled of bat shit, and the temperature was a few degrees less than the surface of the sun. I\u2019ve visited hell dimensions that I enjoyed more than that godforsaken inferno.\u201d</p><p>Styx snorted. The two vampires had been friends for centuries, a remarkable feat considering they were both alphas. But over the past months their bonds had grown even closer as they\u2019d been forced to confront the increasingly dangerous world.</p><p>The Dark Lord\u2014or Dark Prince or master or a hundred other names he\u2019d been called over the centuries\u2014had been effectively banished from this dimension long ago and kept in his prison by the Phoenix, a powerful spirit who was being protected by the vampires. But he refused to take his imprisonment gracefully.</p><p>Over the past months he\u2019d become increasingly relentless in his pursuit of smashing through the veils that separated the worlds, not only allowing his return, but giving a free pass to every creature that inhabited the numerous hells.</p><p>Only a few days ago the bastard had nearly succeeded.</p><p>Using one of the twin babies he\u2019d created to use as a vessel for his grand resurrection, he\u2019d transformed from a formless mist into a young, humanlike female. It\u2019d been creepy as hell to see the ultimate of all evil looking like a pretty cheerleader.</p><p>Thankfully, Jaelyn had managed to drain the Dark Lord before he could pass through the Veil, but Styx knew it was only a temporary reprieve.</p><p>Until the Dark Lord was destroyed, there would be no peace.</p><p>Which was why he was standing in the middle of the desert with a pissed-off Viper instead of waking in the arms of his beautiful mate.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re becoming as soft as a dew fairy in your old age,\u201d he mocked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t become clan chief to rut in the dirt like some animal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPathetic.\u201d</p><p>Viper glanced toward the distant glow of lights. \u201cAre you at least going to tell me why we couldn\u2019t stay in one of the hundreds of hotels just a few miles away?\u201d</p><p>Styx turned to scan the seemingly empty landscape. Not that it was truly empty. At his feet a lizard crawled over a rock oblivious to the owl hunting in silence overhead, or the snake that was coiled only a few feet away. More distantly a coyote was on the trail of a jackrabbit.</p><p>The typical sights and sounds of the desert. His only interest, however, was making sure there were no nasty surprises hidden in the shadows.</p><p>\u201cI prefer not to attract unwanted attention to our presence in Nevada,\u201d he explained. \u201cSomething that would be impossible with you in a casino.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I want is a warm shower, fresh clothes, and a ticket to the Donnie and Marie show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have stupid tattooed on my forehead?\u201d Styx turned to stab his friend with a knowing gaze. \u201cThe last time you were in Vegas you nearly bankrupted the Flamingo and ended up banned from returning to the city by the clan chief.\u201d</p><p>A reminiscent smile tugged at Viper\u2019s lips. \u201cCan I help it if I had a streak of luck at the craps table? Or that Roke is a humorless prig?\u201d</p><p>The distant hum of a motorcycle sliced through the thick night air. \u201cSpeaking of Roke,\u201d Styx murmured.</p><p>Viper muttered a curse as he moved to stand at Styx\u2019s side. \u201cThat\u2019s who we\u2019re meeting with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Styx narrowed his gaze. \u201cDo you promise to behave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I promise I won\u2019t kill him unless he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cViper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Viper folded his arms over his chest. \u201cThis had better be important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould I have left Darcy if it weren\u2019t?\u201d he demanded, the mere mention of his mate sending a tiny pang of longing through his heart. Over the past months the beautiful female Were had become his very reason for living.</p><p>With a throaty roar of power, Roke brought his turbine to a halt and, sliding off the elegant machine, he crossed to stand before them.</p><p>Dressed in black jeans, a leather jacket, and moccasin boots that reached his knees, he was not as tall as Styx, although they shared the same bronzed skin and dark hair that brushed his broad shoulders. His features were lean with the high cheekbones of his Native American bloodlines and a proud nose. His brow was wide and his lips generously full. But it was his eyes that captured and held attention.</p><p>Silver in color, they were so pale they appeared almost white, the shocking paleness emphasized by the rim of pure black that circled them. They were eyes that seemed to pierce through a person to lay bare their very soul.</p><p>Not always the most comfortable sensation.</p><p>Especially for those who didn\u2019t particularly want their soul laid bare.</p><p>Which was . . . yeah, pretty much everyone.</p><p>\u201cStyx.\u201d Offering a low bow, Roke\u2019s movements were liquid smooth as he slowly straightened and with stunning swiftness hurled a dagger to stick in the ground not an inch from Viper\u2019s expensive leather shoes. \u201cViper.\u201d</p><p>Viper growled, giving a wave of his hand to dislodge the dirt around Roke\u2019s feet. All vampires could manipulate the soil, a necessary skill to protect them from the sun or to hide the corpses of their prey, but Viper was particularly skilled, and in less than a blink of an eye, Roke was buried up to his waist.</p><p>\u201cAre you two done playing?\u201d Styx demanded, his icy power biting through the air.</p><p>The clan chief of Nevada climbed out of the sandpit and dusted off his jeans, his expression as inscrutable as ever. \u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>Viper made a sound of impatience. \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d</p><p>Styx nodded toward their companion. \u201cRoke has something he believes we should see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis collection of blow-up dolls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist. Enough.\u201d Styx bared his massive fangs in warning. He didn\u2019t know what the hell had gone down between the two clan chiefs in the past and right now he couldn\u2019t care less. He didn\u2019t have time for their bullshit. \u201cRoke, show me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>In utter silence the three vampires ghosted through the darkness, moving with a speed that made them all but invisible.</p><p>They were nearing a line of rugged hills when Viper made a sound of impatience. \u201cAs much as I adore running through the barren desert, do we have an eventual destination?\u201d he muttered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On cue, Roke came to a sharp halt, pointing toward the desert floor just in front of them. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>Viper rolled his eyes. \u201cMan of few words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreferable to one who doesn\u2019t know when to shut it,\u201d Roke countered.</p> <p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Styx said dryly, shifting so he could study the ground where Roke was pointing. It took a long moment to recognize that the lines etched into the dry dirt were more than just the scribblings from some human. \u201cOh . . . shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Viper tilted back his head as he caught the lingering scent. \u201cI smell pureblooded Were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassandra,\u201d Styx said, easily recognizing the scent of his mate\u2019s twin sister, who had recently been revealed as a powerful prophet.</p><p>\u201cAnd Caine,\u201d Viper added. \u201cWhy would they be in the middle of the Mojave Desert?\u201d</p><p>Now that was a hell of a question.</p> <p>The pair of pureblooded Weres had been missing for weeks, despite Styx\u2019s best efforts to locate them. An unbelievable feat considering he possessed the best trackers in the world. Of course, if the rumors were true, then the two Weres were already beyond his reach.</p><p>Which made any clue as to how she\u2019d been captured or how to retrieve her from her current prison priceless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more concerned with what they left behind,\u201d he admitted, prowling around the edges of the strange symbols.</p><p>Viper frowned. \u201cAn etching?\u201d</p><p>Styx shook his head. \u201cIt looks more like a hieroglyph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA prophecy,\u201d Roke said with a quiet confidence.</p> <p>Styx turned to study the clan chief with a searching gaze. \u201cCan you decipher it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s a warning.\u201d</p><p>Viper frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re a seer?\u201d</p><p>Roke shook his head, his gaze trained on the lines etched into the ground. \u201cThere\u2019s only one prophet. But I was sired by a wisewoman who taught me to read the signs left by our forefathers.\u201d</p><p>Of course. Styx abruptly understood precisely why he was standing in the middle of a desert. \u201cSo now we know why Cassandra chose to travel to Nevada,\u201d he said wryly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Viper demanded.</p><p>He pointed toward Roke. \u201cBecause it was the one place to make certain her message would be understood.\u201d</p><p>Viper snorted. \u201cShe could have sent a text and saved us a trip.\u201d</p> <p>Styx\u2019s attention never wavered from the silent Roke. It was impossible to judge how the vampire felt about being pulled into the battle against the Dark Lord.</p><p>But then, he no doubt realized that it wasn\u2019t a choice. Styx wasn\u2019t the head of a damned democracy. He led his people by cunning and brute force when necessary.</p><p>\u201cHow did you discover this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cur stumbled across it two nights ago,\u201d Roke promptly answered. \u201cThere are no Were packs in the area so he came to me with the information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many others did he tell?\u201d</p><p>Roke instantly understood Styx\u2019s concern. \u201cNone, but it\u2019s been here at least two, maybe even three weeks.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know how many others have seen it.\u201d</p><p>A pity, but there was nothing to be done, Styx silently conceded. \u201cCould anyone else interpret it?\u201d</p><p>Roke paused before giving a shake of his head. \u201cDoubtful.\u201d</p><p>Viper crouched down, studying the desert floor with a frown. \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d</p><p>Roke moved forward, careful not to disturb the marks as he pointed toward the strange etching closest to them. \u201cThis is the symbol for the Alpha and the Omega.\u201d</p><p>Styx froze at the familiar words.</p><p>\u201cThe children,\u201d he murmured, speaking of the twin babies that had been found by the half-Jinn mongrel, Laylah. She hadn\u2019t known that they were the babies mentioned in the prophecies. Or that they\u2019d been created by the Dark Lord so he could use them as vessels for his eventual resurrection. \u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>Roke traced the symbol in the air. \u201cHere they are joined.\u201d</p><p>Styx nodded. When Laylah had found the children they\u2019d been wrapped in the same stasis spell and she\u2019d assumed there was only one child.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then they were separated.\u201d Roke pointed toward the second etching. \u201cThe Omega is lost to the mists.\u201d</p><p>Viper muttered a low curse. Styx didn\u2019t blame him.</p><p>They\u2019d struggled to protect the children, but while Laylah and Tane had managed to rescue the boy child and named him Maluhia, the girl child had been taken through the barriers between dimensions and used by the Dark Lord in his attempt to return to this world.</p><p>Styx shifted his attention to the last symbol. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe children reunited.\u201d</p><p>Hissing in disbelief, Styx turned to meet Roke\u2019s steady gaze, the pale silver eyes even more eerie than usual. \u201cReunited?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018The Alpha and Omega shall be torn asunder and through the Mists reunited,\u2019\u201d the clan chief of Nevada murmured, quoting the Sylvermyst prophecy.</p><p>\u201cMaluhia,\u201d Viper breathed, his expression grim. \u201cCassandra was warning us that the baby is in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Styx shoved his hand in his pocket to yank out his cell phone, his sense of furious urgency frustrated by the realization there was no service. He needed to get back to civilization. Now. Grasping the startled Roke by the upper arm, he headed back across the desert at a blinding speed. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with us.\u201d</p><p>Three weeks earlier</p><p>Las Vegas</p><p>The Forum Shops in Caesars Palace were a wonderland for any female, let alone one who had spent the past thirty years secluded from the world.</p><p>Beneath the ceilings that were painted to resemble a blue sky, the elegant stores wound their way past fountains that were intended to transport shoppers back to Roman days. Glass display cases were filled with the sort of temptations designed to make a woman drool.</p><p>With a wry smile, Caine stepped behind his dazzled companion to wrap his arms around her waist, tugging her back flat against his chest. He could only wish Cassie would look at him with that same wistful longing, he ruefully acknowledged.</p><p>Or perhaps not, he swiftly corrected as his body hardened with a familiar, brutal need.</p><p>Since discovering Cassie being held prisoner in the cave of a demon lord weeks ago, Caine had done his best to play the role of knight in shining armor.</p><p>Although possessing the natural strength of a pureblooded Were, Cassie had not only been altered in the womb not to shift, but she was as innocent as a babe and twice as vulnerable.</p><p>Add in the fact she was the first true prophet born in centuries, and currently being hunted by every demon loyal to the Dark Lord, and she was a disaster waiting to happen.</p><p>She desperately needed a protector.</p><p>And since Caine, once a mere cur, had died and been resurrected as a pureblooded Were in her arms, he\u2019d assumed that protecting Cassie was the reason the fates had returned him to this world instead of leaving him to rot in his well-deserved hell.</p><p>Unfortunately, his miraculous return to life hadn\u2019t included a sainthood and he remained a fully functioning male with all the usual weaknesses.</p><p>Including a rampaging lust toward the tiny female currently wrapped in his arms.</p><p>As always completely impervious to his torment, Cassie breathed a soft sigh of wonder. \u201cOh . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d Bending down, he spoke directly in her ear. \u201cCassie, listen to me.\u201d</p><p>She tilted back her head to meet his narrowed gaze and Caine briefly forgot how to breathe.</p><p>Holy shit, but she was beautiful.</p><p>Her hair was pale, closer to silver than blond, and pulled into a ponytail that fell to her waist. Her skin was a perfect alabaster, smooth and silken. Her eyes were an astonishing green, the color of spring grass and flecked with gold.</p><p>Her face was heart-shaped with delicate features that gave her an air of fragility that was only emphasized by her slender body. Of course, beneath her jeans and casual sweatshirt, she possessed the lean muscles of all pureblooded Weres.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she prompted when he continued to gawk at her in mindless appreciation.</p><p>He sucked in a deep breath, savoring the warm scent of lavender that clung to her skin. \u201cYou promised me that you would blend.\u201d</p><p>She wiggled from his grasp and darted toward the nearest store to press her face against the window. \u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>Caine rolled his eyes. \u201cI knew this was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so many,\u201d she murmured as he moved to stand beside her. \u201cHow do you choose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go into a store, pick out a few of your favorite clothes and try them on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for him to finish, Cassie was darting through the open doorway. Caine was swiftly on her heels, but with immaculate timing a buxom nymph with dark hair and brown eyes pretended to stumble and landed against his chest.</p><p>Instinctively, his hands reached to grasp her shoulders, his sapphire blue eyes narrowed with irritation.</p><p>Once upon a time he had appreciated beautiful females tossing themselves into his arms. Even though he\u2019d been a mere cur, his short blond hair that fell across his brow and tanned, surfer good looks ensured he had more than his fair share of babes. And it didn\u2019t hurt that his body was chiseled muscles beneath the low riding jeans and muscle shirt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And oh yeah, he\u2019d made an obscene fortune cranking out prescription drugs from his private lab.</p><p>Now it took every ounce of willpower to politely set aside the damned nymph and not toss her into the line of sleek metallic mannequins showing off the latest designer swimwear.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t we meet in . . .\u201d she began, but Caine wasn\u2019t listening as he swept past her and headed straight toward the tiny blonde who was fingering a pretty white sundress with black polka dots.</p> <p>\u201cCassie.\u201d</p><p>He had barely reached her side when her hands grasped the bottom of her sweatshirt and began pulling it over her head.</p><p>\u201cI want to try it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d He grabbed her hands, yanking the sweatshirt back into place. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>She frowned in confusion. \u201cBut you said\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I know what I said,\u201d he muttered. When was he going to learn she took every word quite literally?</p><p>\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d He brushed a finger over her pale cheek. Christ, she was so unbearably innocent. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you show me what you like and I\u2019ll pick out the right size?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do that just by looking?\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted in a dry smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA well-practiced gift?\u201d</p> <p>He stilled, regarding her in surprise. Despite the fact they\u2019d been constant companions over the past weeks, Cassie rarely seemed aware of his presence, let alone the fact that he was a red-blooded male.</p><p>Not that he took it personally. She was plagued by her visions of the future and too often impervious to the world around her.</p><p>\u201cAre you truly interested?\u201d he husked.</p><p>She flashed him a dimpled smile. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed a growl, his body once again hard and aching. She was going to have a raving lunatic on her hands before this was over.</p><p>\u201cBetter than nothing.\u201d He motioned toward the hovering saleslady, indicating he wanted one of the sundresses, before steering Cassie toward the khaki shorts and pretty summer tops. \u201cNow, let\u2019s choose a few sensible outfits before we move on.\u201d</p><p>Within an hour they had a reasonable pile of clothes for both of them and a bill that would make most men shudder in horror.</p><p>Caine, however, didn\u2019t so much as flinch as he gathered the packages and headed out of the store. They had left Missouri with nothing more than the clothes on their backs after Cassie had offered her warning to Laylah. Tonight he intended to enjoy a hot shower, clean clothes, good food, and a soft bed. In that order.</p> <p>In silence they wandered down the wide passageway, occasionally halting for Cassie to peer into the windows. For the moment, Caine was content to allow her to behave as a normal female. It was all too rare that she was able to put aside the burden of her visions.</p><p>And as long as he didn\u2019t detect any danger lurking . . .</p><p>His brain closed down as his searching gaze was snared by the sight of lace and ribbons and feminine temptation spread in front of a shop window.</p><p>Instinct alone had him herding Cassie through the door and into the hushed atmosphere of the exclusive store.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWe did your shopping, now it\u2019s my turn,\u201d he informed her, moving toward a table that held a pile of satin teddies with matching thongs.</p><p>Oh . . . hell.</p><p>Cassie halted at his side, her expression puzzled. \u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Dropping his packages, Caine reached for a scarlet teddy, holding up the fragile garment for her inspection. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTiny.\u201d There was a faint hint of dimples. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will fit you.\u201d</p><p>Heat blasted through him at the vivid image of Cassie wearing the lacy lingerie and spread across his bed, that same almost-smile teasing at her lips.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take one of each color,\u201d he croaked toward the saleswoman.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not very practical,\u201d Cassie protested.</p><p>\u201cPractical is the last thing you should be when you\u2019re wearing fine lingerie.\u201d</p><p>Expecting an argument, Caine was caught off guard when she reached to gently stroke a finger over the shimmering fabric.</p><p>\u201cI suppose they will be comfortable to sleep in.\u201d</p><p>Sleep?</p><p>Caine\u2019s fantasy abruptly altered to reality\u2014a reality in which Cassie slept like a baby in one bed while he tossed and turned in another.</p><p>Did he really need to add in a skimpy bit of lace to add to his torture?</p><p>\u201cFor one of us,\u201d he wryly admitted.</p><p>Predictably, she didn\u2019t have a clue why he was suddenly questioning his own sanity. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He headed toward the discreet sales desk at the back of the store, pulling his wallet from his pocket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Cassie wandered through the casino, watching the humans as they stood mesmerized by the flashing lights and spinning wheels of the slot machines. The air was filled with their tangled emotions\u2014the hope, the greed, the rare jolt of joy, and the far more common desperation.</p><p>She was fascinated, even as she was saddened by their frantic attempts to grasp . . . something.</p><p>Money? Sex? Happiness?</p><p>Without thought, she reached to grab Caine\u2019s hand, needing the steady sense of security he offered. He squeezed her fingers, tugging her closer to his hard body as a group of drunken revelers stumbled past.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I enjoy civilization, are you going to tell me what we\u2019re doing here?\u201d he murmured, the scent of soap and shampoo from his recent shower doing nothing to disguise the warm, wicked tang of his wolf.</p><p>For reasons that Cassie didn\u2019t understand, a rash of excitement prickled over her skin, making her want to strip off her new sundress and rub against the male at her side.</p><p>Of course she didn\u2019t give in to the impulse.</p><p>She was slowly learning that there were all sorts of stupid rules and regulations that had to be followed when surrounded by mortals. And taking off her clothing seemed to be at the top of the list.</p><p>Instead she turned her thoughts to his question, heaving a faint sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when I know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBrilliantly vague.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I have to like it,\u201d he muttered with a grimace.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She came to an abrupt halt, turning to meet his rueful expression. Despite the chronic distractions that clouded her mind, she knew that she didn\u2019t always appreciate this man as she should.</p><p>Who else would have saved her from a fate worse than death, and then stayed at her side as she had led him from one random place to another, compelled by the visions that consumed her to the point of oblivion?</p><p>No one, that was who, a voice whispered in the back of her mind. No one but Caine.</p><p>With a frown of concern, Caine reached to cup her cheek in his hand, his warm touch her only anchor to this world. \u201cCassie?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said abruptly, her gaze skimming over his lean, finely chiseled features. He truly was a beautiful male with his pale hair shimmering like gold beneath the bright lights and his eyes as brilliant as sapphires. It was no wonder she could smell the desire coming from the numerous women staring at him with hungry eyes. \u201cI haven\u2019t been fair to you.\u201d</p><p>His thumb pressed against her lips as he gave a shake of his head. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She grasped his wrist, tugging his hand from her face. She had to speak now. Who knew how long her brief clarity would last?</p><p>\u201cI become . . . lost in my visions and I have never truly stopped to consider what you\u2019ve sacrificed to keep me safe.\u201d Her fingers absently caressed the skin of his inner wrist, feeling the leap of his pulse at her soft touch. \u201cWithout you . . .\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened with a heat that Cassie felt to the tips of her toes.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t necessary,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Distantly she could hear the clanging noise of the machines and the deafening buzz of a hundred conversations, but in this moment she was aware of nothing beyond the man standing in front of her and the steady sapphire gaze that a woman could drown in.</p><p>\u201cNo, let me say this,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>His lips tightened, but he was smarter than the average Were. He knew better than to try and halt a determined female. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor as long as I can remember I\u2019ve been a prisoner.\u201d She shivered, battling back the grim memory of the past thirty years. \u201cI was not only held hostage by the demon lord, but also my knowledge that I could never survive on my own.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother to protest. They both knew that she wouldn\u2019t last a day without him. \u201cThat\u2019s something you\u2019re never going to have to worry about,\u201d he gruffly promised.</p><p>She stepped closer, the sizzling power of his wolf calling to her most primitive instincts. Although she couldn\u2019t shift, her beast still crawled beneath her skin, relishing the delectable male who had earned her trust. Something she would never have believed possible just a few weeks ago.</p><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you I would still be in that cave.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me into a hero, Cassie.\u201d He scowled. \u201cWe both know I started out as the villain of the piece.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched. She might not be worldly, but she knew that Caine was far more comfortable with his bad-boy image. And from what he\u2019d confessed, he deserved the reputation.</p><p>But as far as she was concerned, he\u2019d always be her champion.</p> <p>\u201cIf you were a villain, then you wouldn\u2019t be here with me,\u201d she pointed out softly.</p><p>He snorted, running a searing gaze down her slender curves shown to advantage by the dress. \u201cHave you looked in the mirror?\u201d he demanded. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a red-blooded male who wouldn\u2019t kill to share a hotel room with you.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his ridiculous words, tilting her head to study him with a curious gaze. \u201cWhy do you stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just told you.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers tightened on his wrist, annoyed by his flippant tone. \u201cI\u2019m unfamiliar with the world, but I\u2019m not stupid, Caine.\u201d</p> <p>He arched a golden brow. \u201cI never thought you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen how the females watch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Something dark and predatory flashed through his eyes. \u201cAnd how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>She glanced toward the gaggle of women who pretended to watch the roulette table while they were sneaking looks of longing in Caine\u2019s direction. For no reason at all, she felt the sudden urge to bare her teeth at them. Or maybe she would yank out a few handfuls of their overbleached hair.</p><p>\u201cThey would be eager to share their bodies with you,\u201d she said, an edge in her voice she\u2019d never heard before. \u201cIf all you desired was sex, then you could find a much easier, not to mention a far more experienced, bed partner.\u201d</p><p>A slow, wicked smile curved his lips as he abruptly wrapped an arm around her waist and hauled her tight against his body. \u201cThere\u2019s sex and then there\u2019s what is going to happen between us.\u201d</p> <p>She trembled, a pleasurable heat exploding in the pit of her stomach. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d she husked.</p><p>His gaze dipped to her lips, the scent of his wolf filling the air. \u201cMagic.\u201d</p><p>Entranced by the sensations flowing through her, Cassie tilted back her head to study his beautiful face. \u201cYou haven\u2019t told me why you stay.\u201d</p><p>For a long moment she thought he might refuse to answer. Then, threading his fingers in her hair, he heaved a faint sigh. \u201cYou could say that I\u2019m trying to even the scales.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven the scales?\u201d</p><p>His expression became distracted as he allowed his fingers to run through her hair, as if mesmerized by the satin smoothness of the strands. \u201cBecause of my bloated ego, the Weres were nearly destroyed,\u201d he said, clearly regretting the years he\u2019d devoted to helping Briggs, a crazed Were who\u2019d been in league with the demon lord holding her captive. \u201cIt\u2019s only fair that I sacrifice to keep their most prized possession safe.\u201d</p><p>She tensed at his low words, absurdly hurt. \u201cSo I\u2019m a duty?\u201d</p><p>His head lowered so he could bury his face in the curve of her neck, breathing deeply of her scent. \u201cThat\u2019s what I tell myself so I can sleep at night.\u201d</p> <p>She laid her hands against his chest, angling her head so he could have easier access to the vulnerable line of her throat.</p><p>This was Caine. And she trusted him without question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what that means,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He went rigid at her unspoken gesture of capitulation, his fingers biting into the curve of her hip before he was abruptly jerking away, a flush staining his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cNeither do I, and I intend to keep it that way,\u201d he muttered, turning to head across the gaudy carpet of the casino.</p><p>\u201cCaine?\u201d She hurried after him, unsure what she\u2019d done wrong. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner.\u201d His step never slowed as he grimly headed for the nearby buffet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, you have no freaking idea.\u201d</p><p>Gaius\u2019s lair in the Louisiana wetlands</p><p>The Immortal Ones were the stuff of legends.</p><p>Centuries ago a clan of vampires had chosen to leave the world behind. Using Nefri\u2019s powerful medallion, they\u2019d traveled through the Veil to another dimension where they were secluded from the weaknesses that plagued the less civilized.</p><p>Beyond the Veil there was no hunger, no lust, no need for sleep.</p><p>Instead, they devoted their nights to studying among the endless libraries or cultivating the gardens that managed to grow despite the lack of sunlight. And their days to meditation.</p><p>But it was the rumors that they retained the old powers lost to the vampires of this world that made them feared.</p><p>Most of the gossip was exaggerated, but there were still some forgotten talents that could be mastered.</p><p>Which, of course, was precisely why Gaius had petitioned to travel through the Veil after the death of his mate. Although most had assumed that he\u2019d been seeking the peace to be found on the other side.</p><p>As if meditation and flowers could ease the brutal loss of his beloved Dara.</p><p>Stupid bastards.</p><p>Forced to stand and watch his mate being burned at the stake by a rival vampire clan, Gaius would have walked straight into the sun if it hadn\u2019t been for the Dark Lord.</p><p>Even as Dara had burned, the powerful deity had appeared as a misty shadow at his side, whispering promises of Dara\u2019s return from the grave, all for the small price of Gaius\u2019s soul.</p><p>It was a trade-off that Gaius had made without a second thought. The return of his mate? Hell yes, he\u2019d sell his soul a dozen times over. And it was a decision he hadn\u2019t regretted, despite the long years of seclusion beyond the Veil.</p><p>Obeying his new lord, he\u2019d avoided attracting attention while learning the skill of shape-shifting and eventually using the medallion he\u2019d found hidden beneath one of the fountains to mist-walk. It was the latter skill that had allowed him to escape undetected from the Veil to return to the world he\u2019d left behind so many years ago.</p><p>Briefly disoriented by his abrupt journey, Gaius leaned against the nearest cypress tree and struggled to regain his balance.</p><p>He felt . . .</p><p>Yeah. That was it.</p><p>He felt all the things that were forgotten on the other side.</p><p>The weight of his slender body covered by a simple robe. The summer breeze that stirred the dark strands of his hair, which he wore short and slicked from his face. Startled, he lifted a hand to touch the chilled skin of his cheek before trailing down the strong thrust of his nose, which bore the proud stamp of his days as a Roman general. Most creatures would find him handsome, he vaguely recalled, although his dark eyes remained as bleak and lifeless as the day he\u2019d watched Dara die.</p><p>And then he was struck by less desirable sensations.</p><p>With a frown his fingers shifted to the fangs that suddenly throbbed at the distant scent of human blood.</p><p>Hunger.</p><p>And not just of the liquid variety, he angrily realized, his body hardening with a nearly forgotten ache of desire.</p><p>Shoving away the unpleasant realization, Gaius grimly turned his attention to the secluded house that was located on the edge of the Louisiana swamp.</p><p>Built on brick stilts, it was a large structure painted white with black shutters and a screened-in wraparound porch. The front yard was filled with large trees draped in Spanish moss that effectively hid the place from the narrow path that led to the small town.</p><p>All in all it was the perfect place for a vampire to remain hidden.</p><p>Which was no doubt why the Dark Lord had sent him here to wait for his next orders.</p><p>Ignoring the humid heat and swarms of bugs that filled the air, Gaius made his way through the front gate and up the wide staircase. He stepped through the door of the porch, relieved to catch sight of the overhead fan providing a much needed breeze.</p><p>Although he\u2019d been on the other side of the Veil, he was well aware of the changes in this world, and after centuries of choosing a spartan existence to concentrate on his studies, he was anxious to enjoy a lair equipped with all the modern technology. Including electricity and a hot shower.</p><p>And privacy.</p><p>Narrowing his gaze, he belatedly realized the scent of human was coming from inside the house. And that it was drawing closer.</p><p>His time away had made him sloppy, he chastised himself, reaching beneath his robe to withdraw the pugio\u2014a small Roman dagger\u2014he\u2019d hidden among the satin folds. Then, moving with a silent speed, he shoved open the door and stepped into the shadows of the living room.</p><p>\u201cWho is there?\u201d he growled, his gaze skimming over the padded bamboo chairs and couch that were scattered over the wooden floorboards.</p><p>There was a faint rustle, then the lights tucked in the high, open-beamed ceiling were flipped on and a young female stepped into the room.</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>Gaius tucked away his dagger. If he decided to kill the human it would be by draining all that sweet, tempting blood.</p><p>\u201cBe more precise,\u201d he commanded, his speech pattern becoming rigidly formal as his anger overcame his months of secret training to mingle among the natives.</p><p>\u201cSally Grace.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed as he studied the intruder. She might have been cute in a childish manner, with her dark hair pulled into two braids on each side of her pale, pretty face. But her brown eyes were heavily lined with makeup and her full lips painted a shocking shade of black and pierced with a gold hoop. There was a matching hoop in one brow and a dozen more along the shell of her ear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Worse was her strange costume.</p><p>The scarlet corset was all that covered her tiny bosom and a tiny leather skirt was plastered to her hips. She had on leggings and high-heeled boots, but they did little more than emphasize her slender curves. She clearly had no males in her life to forbid such a shocking display of her body.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you in my home?\u201d</p> <p>She propped her shoulder against the doorjamb, looking far too comfortable. \u201cOur master sent me to make sure you had everything you need for your return.\u201d</p><p>So, she was sent by the Dark Lord.</p><p>Not that it made her presence any more welcome.</p><p>\u201cYou are a housekeeper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHousekeeper?\u201d The female straightened, her hands slapping on her hips in outrage. \u201cDo I look like a freaking housekeeper?\u201d</p> <p>His jaw tightened at her shrill tone. \u201cDo not test me, female.\u201d</p><p>She gave a toss of her head. \u201cI happen to be a very powerful witch. One who is favored above all of the Dark Lord\u2019s disciples . ..\u201d</p><p>\u201cA witch.\u201d His power blasted through the air, sending the female slamming into the wall of the attached dining room. He stalked forward, his fangs exposed as he prepared to put an end to the bitch. It had been a witch who had held him powerless as his beloved mate was burned at the stake. \u201cI detest witches.\u201d</p><p>Reaching the female, he wrapped his fingers around her throat and began to squeeze. He sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to soil his tongue with her tainted blood.</p><p>Intent on choking the life from his companion, Gaius was unprepared when her dark eyes abruptly flashed with a crimson fire.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she commanded, her voice low and filled with a power that made Gaius pause in astonishment.</p> <p>Staring at her suddenly blank face, Gaius felt alarm flicker down his spine. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your eyes?\u201d</p><p>Sally\u2019s lips parted, but it wasn\u2019t her voice coming out of her mouth. \u201cGaius.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, realizing that the power choking the air had nothing to do with the witch and everything to do with the strange being invading her body.</p><p>\u201cWho is here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is your master, my beloved son.\u201d</p><p>Gaius narrowed his gaze, his fingers maintaining their tight grip on Sally\u2019s neck. \u201cIs this a trick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo trick,\u201d the deep voice assured him. \u201cSally is a conduit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConduit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThrough her I am capable of speaking directly with my servants.\u201d</p><p>Was that supposed to be reassuring?</p><p>Gaius grimaced. It\u2019d been bad enough to have the Dark Lord whispering in his mind when he was meditating. To have his voice coming out of the witch\u2019s lips was . . . what were the words used today?</p><p>Freaking him out?</p><p>Yeah, that was it.</p><p>Totally freaking him out.</p><p>Not that he was about to reveal his weakness. The Dark Lord was a pitiless monster who would destroy him the moment he suspected Gaius might not be of use to him.</p><p>\u201cI have no love for magic,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>The black lips twisted in a mocking smile. \u201cThen we will make this swift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Grudgingly loosening his grip on the witch, he hid his shaking hands in the folds of his black robe. \u201cI am here as you wished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have acquired the skills that I requested?\u201d</p><p>Gaius gave a dip of his head. \u201cI am capable of altering my shape, although only for short periods of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was able to travel through the Veil with the medallion you left hidden on the other side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The crimson fire flickered in the female\u2019s dark eyes. \u201cThe medallion will also allow you to enter the mists where I am trapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you desire of me?\u201d Gaius demanded, hoping his bland tone disguised his reluctance.</p><p>He was willing to do whatever necessary to bring back his dearest Dara, but the thought of joining the Dark Lord in his hell dimension was enough to give anyone the shudders.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I have a duty for you to perform before joining me.\u201d</p><p>He offered a bow. \u201cI am yours to command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d the dark voice purred.</p><p>Gaius wisely ignored the taunt. \u201cWhat would you have of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA prophet has been discovered.\u201d</p><p>Gaius widened his eyes in shock. He\u2019d heard the rumors, of course, but he\u2019d dismissed them. It had been centuries since the last prophet had walked the earth.</p><p>\u201cA true seer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want her brought to me,\u201d the Dark Lord commanded. \u201cAlive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Is she a human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Were.\u201d</p><p>Gaius considered the logistics. He didn\u2019t remember his life as a Roman general, but he maintained a rare talent for strategy.</p><p>Which, unfortunately, was precisely the reason his clan had been attacked . . .</p><p>No. He wrenched his mind from the painful memories. He couldn\u2019t go there. Guilt, no matter how well deserved, was a distraction he couldn\u2019t afford.</p><p>\u201cThat will make her capture a trifle more difficult, but I am confident I will be capable of bringing her to you with minimal injury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is being protected by a male Were,\u201d the Dark Lord continued. \u201cI want him brought as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Even as the word left his lips, Gaius knew he\u2019d made a mistake.</p><p>On cue, an agonizing pain drilled through his head, sending him to his knees.</p><p>\u201cIt is not your place to question me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will provide you with the necessary companions to assist you in your task.\u201d</p><p>Companions? That was the last thing he needed, or wanted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary . . .\u201d Once again the pain shot through his brain, briefly blinding him with the sheer anguish. \u201cGods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGaius.\u201d The witch jerkily moved to pat the top of his aching head, her face still blank and her eyes glowing with an eerie power. \u201cDo not make me wish I had chosen another servant for this important task.\u201d</p><p>Forcing himself back to his feet, Gaius managed a stiff smile. \u201cYou will have no reason for regret, Master.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause. As if the Dark Lord was debating the pleasure of killing him against the need to capture the prophet. At last the witch gave a nod. \u201cSally will travel with you as my personal eyes and ears.\u201d</p><p>Gaius was proud and stubborn and obsessed with his dead mate. But he wasn\u2019t stupid.</p><p>This time there was no hesitation as he gave a nod of his head. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will have two others join you.\u201d</p><p>Another hasty nod.</p><p>He would make certain his . . . companions understood who was in charge when they arrived.</p><p>\u201cWhere will we find the prophet?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The crimson eyes flared. \u201cIf I knew where she was I would not need you, would I?\u201d</p><p>Good point.</p><p>Las Vegas</p><p>After consuming enough food to feed a small army, or one hungry Were, Caine escorted Cassie back through the casino. Instinctively, he slowed his pace to match his companion\u2019s as she studied the drunken crowds that weaved their way past blinking machines toward the cover band singing at the back of the vast room.</p><p>He wanted to be far away from the chaotic blast of sound and light and emotions that beat at his senses. His change to pureblooded Were left him hypersensitive to even the most subtle stimulus and being stuck in the middle of Vegas made him feel as if he were being sandblasted by sensations.</p><p>Worse, his most primitive instincts were stirred to a fever pitch by the male gazes that followed Cassie with blatant lust.</p><p>But, he wasn\u2019t a masochist.</p><p>With every passing night it was growing more difficult to keep to his role as protector. Spending any extra time alone with her in a hotel room . . .</p><p>A very bad idea.</p><p>Especially when she\u2019d just dropped her latest little bombshell on him.</p><p>Covertly studying her perfect profile, he kept a possessive hand at her lower back, steering her toward the front lobby. Maybe if they were on the streets he could clear the cobwebs and return his mind to the task of keeping this female safe.</p><p>Which was all he should be thinking about.</p><p>Busy reminding himself that there wasn\u2019t a demon around who wouldn\u2019t kill to get their hands on a genuine prophet, Caine was unprepared when Cassie came to an abrupt halt, regarding him with a baffled expression.</p><p>\u201cHave I done something wrong?\u201d</p><p>He frowned at the unexpected question. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep staring at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the only one,\u201d he muttered, curling his lips into a snarl as a group of men dressed in khakis and polo shirts halted to ogle Cassie\u2019s slender body shown in shocking detail by the sundress. \u201cYou need more clothes on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be distracted. Tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>Caine heaved a sigh. For once the emerald eyes held a remarkable clarity. The one time he wanted her to be oblivious to him, he wryly acknowledged.</p><p>A typical female.</p><p>\u201cWhat you said earlier,\u201d he abruptly admitted.</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I still don\u2019t know why I felt compelled to come here,\u201d she said, misunderstanding his confession. \u201cI suppose it will eventually come to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, not that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout you . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCaine?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>Oh hell.

A lot.\u201d</p> <p>He swallowed a moan, his body reacting with predictable enthusiasm to her words. \u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, she lifted her hand to stroke her fingertips lightly down the line of his jaw.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a prophet to know that a female who has been held in one prison after another doesn\u2019t have a great deal of experience with men,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThere were a few, of course, but not like a normal female would enjoy.\u201d</p><p>He held her gaze, reaching up to press her fingers against his cheek. \u201cBriggs?\u201d he asked, referring to the demented Were that had helped to hold her hostage.</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriggs . . .\u201d\u2014he found it difficult to even utter the question\u2014\u201cnever abused you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d She allowed a small, mysterious smile to curve her lips. \u201cHe was terrified of me.\u201d</p><p>Caine released a shaky breath, savagely relieved that she hadn\u2019t been harmed, even though he\u2019d already suspected the truth.</p><p>The innocence shimmering in her eyes was more than just a lack of worldly experience.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirgin.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Caine shuddered.</p><p>There . . . She\u2019d said it.</p> <p>The V word.</p><p>\u201cVirgin,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She blinked, tugging her hand from his loose grip. \u201cWhy do you make it sound like a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad. Just . . .\u201d He shoved his fingers through his hair. Dammit, how did he explain he wanted her so badly he could barely breathe, but she was depending on him to keep her safe? And to top it off, she was a damned virgin. Only an animal would take advantage of her. \u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the books that I used to read the males always seemed to appreciate the privilege of taking their mate\u2019s innocence,\u201d she mused.</p><p>He moaned, wondering if she were deliberately trying to torture him. \u201cLet me guess,\u201d he said in a thick voice. \u201cYou read romance books?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Briggs would bring them to me. I liked them.\u201d She tilted her chin. \u201cIn fact, I still do.\u201d</p><p>Holy hell. Could this get any worse?</p><p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d he muttered, regarding her warily. \u201cBut you understand that men aren\u2019t really like the heroes in a story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d she said with a confidence that had him shaking his head in instant denial.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou rescued me from the demon lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d He stepped close enough to make sure that not even a vampire could overhear his words. \u201cThe only thing I did was stand in front of the bastard long enough to get myself killed and then mysteriously resurrected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou led me out of the caves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was saving my own skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you have taken the role of my protector,\u201d she said, clearly determined to see him as some sort of savior. A pathetic joke. \u201cWhat is that if not heroic?\u201d</p><p>He grasped her shoulders, gazing down at her wide eyes with a rising sense of frustration. \u201cShit, Cassie, if I was really heroic I would take you to your sisters where you would truly be protected and get the hell out of your life.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, clearly not eager to be reunited with her three identical sisters.</p><p>Understandable, considering that one was wed to Styx, the King of Vampires, and another wed to Styx\u2019s most trusted guard, Jagr. While the third had mated with the King of Weres, Salvatore.</p><p>As soon as they managed to get their hands on Cassie she would be locked away for her own good. Even if being caged again would drive her mad.</p><p>\u201cBut you won\u2019t?\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d he admitted without hesitation. \u201cBut not because I\u2019m a good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><p>His hands slid up to lightly graze the sides of her neck, relishing the trust she offered him. A Were would never allow anyone but family or their most intimate friends to be near their throat.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a selfish SOB.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted, as if to deny his words; then he felt her tense beneath his fingers, her eyes widening.</p><p>\u201cCaine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He shifted to make certain his body was between her and the lobby. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>His instincts were on full alert, but with no visible enemy, he was stuck growling at thin air. \u201cI\u2019ve warned you, I don\u2019t speak vague.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA . . .\u201d Her words died on her lips as the astonishing green of her eyes was clouded by a strange white glow. \u201cFluctuation,\u201d she at last said.</p><p>Caine frowned, waiting for the familiar glyph to shimmer in the air, revealing yet another prophecy that only Cassie could decipher.</p><p>On this occasion, however, nothing appeared.</p><p>\u201cA fluctuation in what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe game. A new player has arrived.\u201d</p><p>Freaking perfect.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose he or she is batting for our team?\u201d he asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cNo. His heart is dark.\u201d The white faded from her eyes to reveal a sudden flare of horror as she grabbed his arm to keep her knees from buckling. \u201cPain. So much pain.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping a steadying arm around her waist, he covertly made sure he could easily palm the dagger he\u2019d hidden at the small of his back as well as the handgun holstered beneath his left arm.</p><p>\u201cIs he in Vegas?\u201d</p><p>She heaved a sigh of frustration. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose we\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u201d He stepped back, his gaze sweeping over the lobby for any hint of danger. \u201cIn the meantime we need to get away from these crowds.\u201d</p><p>Two days later</p><p>Gaius\u2019s lair in Louisiana</p><p>Gaius brushed a hand down the elegant black suit that was perfectly tailored to his slender body before making sure the pale silver tie was lying smooth against the white silk shirt.</p><p>Despite his dislike for the witch, he had to admit that Sally had done a fine job in preparing for his arrival. Not only had she refitted the house with heavy shutters that kept out most of the daylight, and surrounded it with a revulsion spell that would keep out all but the most powerful demons, but she\u2019d ordered an entire closet full of clothing that suited his understated but elegant tastes.</p><p>Odd that such a flamboyant little freak could possess such fine taste in men\u2019s attire.</p><p>He could only hope she was equally talented in fulfilling his most current need.</p><p>On cue, he caught the scent of peaches that always seemed to cling to the witch and moments later there was a light knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cCommander?\u201d she called softly.</p><p>Gaius\u2019s lips twitched. After two days in his constant companionship the female had lost most of her smug arrogance. There was nothing quite like being trapped with a lethal predator who hated witches to give a person an attitude adjustment.</p><p>\u201cEnter.\u201d</p><p>He heard her draw in a deep breath before pushing open the door to study him with a brittle bravado that didn\u2019t mask her wariness.</p><p>Smart little witch.</p><p>Hovering in the doorway, Sally looked like a goth rag doll with her pigtails and heavy black eyeliner and matching lipstick. She was wearing some sort of red camisole with a puffy net skirt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Gaius adjusted the French cuff links, his expression frigidly controlled. There was no way in hell he was going to reveal to the sneaky little bitch just how unnerved he was by the thought of allowing her to perform her magic on him. It was bad enough that he\u2019d gone to his knees to plead for mercy when the Dark Lord had announced that Gaius would be \u201caltered\u201d to better suit the master\u2019s needs.</p><p>\u201cYou have brought what I requested?\u201d he instead demanded.</p><p>Her lips thinned, but she offered a ready nod. Good. The witch was learning. Like any good general, he expected complete obedience from his soldiers.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the guest room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>The dark eyes flared with annoyance at his imperious tone but, wise enough to keep her mouth shut, Sally turned to lead him down the hallway.</p><p>Gaius followed at a measured pace, on full alert despite the supposed security of the lair. He\u2019d learned a cruel lesson in ever lowering his guard the night his clan was attacked.</p><p>A lesson he would never forget.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from our companions?\u201d he demanded as they climbed the steps leading to the upper floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, they should be arriving within a few hours.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened as he glowered at the back of her head. \u201cYou still claim to know nothing about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know as much as you do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you say.\u201d</p><p>She flinched as his icy power lashed through the air, but hunching her shoulders, she halted in front of a heavy door and pointed at the small window that revealed the metal-lined cell inside.</p><p>\u201cThe woman is in there.\u201d She waited for Gaius to move to peer through the window. \u201cIs she satisfactory?\u201d</p><p>Gaius hissed as his fangs lengthened in primitive hunger. The slender female chained to the wall possessed the long, dark hair that he\u2019d demanded as well as the golden skin and dark, almond eyes that spoke of the Middle East.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t an exact match for his beloved Dara, of course.</p> <p>Her features weren\u2019t nearly so delicately carved and her body was covered by a pair of cutoff shorts and a tiny halter top that his mate would have considered tacky, but she was close enough to stir the lusts that he\u2019d nearly forgotten on the other side.</p><p>\u201cYes, she is . . . satisfactory,\u201d he admitted, his mouth watering as his gaze traced the line of throat. \u201cWhere did you find her?\u201d</p><p>Sally shrugged. \u201cWhere you find everything. The Internet. Lucky for you she makes house calls.\u201d She grasped his wrist as Gaius\u2019s hand reached for the doorknob. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Gaius tensed, poised and ready to strike. \u201cRemove your hand, witch.\u201d</p><p>Hastily, the female snatched back her hand, sensing death in the air. But she stubbornly refused to back down.</p><p>\u201cFirst the ceremony and then the girl,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Gaius offered her an icy glare. \u201cYou aren\u2019t foolish enough to believe you are in a position to give me orders?\u201d</p><p>There was a sudden crimson fire in the witch\u2019s dark eyes and a warning heat that sizzled through the air.</p><p>\u201cThe order doesn\u2019t come from me.\u201d</p><p>Gaius shuddered. Cristo. He didn\u2019t know what was worse. His fear of being at the mercy of the witch\u2019s spell or the heavy weight of the Dark Lord\u2019s smothering powers.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he snapped. \u201cLet us be done with this ridiculous ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Sally nodded her head toward the end of the hallway. \u201cI have prepared the room.\u201d</p><p>Still twitchy, Gaius followed the witch into the large room, his gaze landing on the thick line of salt poured into a circle in the center of the wood floor.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He turned to regard Sally with a deep scowl. \u201cExplain precisely what you intend to do to me.\u201d</p> <p>She heaved a resigned sigh. \u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>He bared his fangs. \u201cYou\u2019ve been remarkably unwilling to reveal the details.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened before she attempted to hide her fear behind a mask of bravado. \u201cWith the master\u2019s assistance I will conjure a spell that will remove your . . . scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will not only protect you from being tracked by your enemies, but as a shape-shifter you will be capable of becoming whomever or whatever you want to be without giving away your true identity.\u201d</p><p>She tried to make it sound oh so simple. Just a flick of her hand and, abracadabra, his scent was gone.</p><p>But nothing was ever simple.</p><p>For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.. . .</p><p>Especially when it came to magic.</p><p>There would be a cost that he was far from certain he wanted to pay.</p><p>\u201cI can accomplish the same goal with a disguise amulet,\u201d he pointed out in cutting tones.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, this spell will strip you a little . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeeper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will remove more than just your scent.\u201d</p><p>Gaius narrowed his gaze. \u201cYou mean it will take away my very identity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly on a physical level.\u201d</p><p>Her casual dismissal made his hands clench. It was that or wrapping them around her neck and crushing the life from her.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I choose not to be\u201d\u2014he curled his lip in derision\u2014\u201cstripped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something you need to discuss with the master.\u201d</p><p>Damn the witch. She had him backed in a literal corner and she knew it.</p><p>\u201cCristo,\u201d he growled, moving to stand in the center of the corner. \u201cJust be done with it.\u201d</p><p>Sally ignored his command, moving around the room to light the wax candles with a solemn expression. Next she laid several long feathers in a bowl and set them on fire, filling the air with a cloud of smoke.</p><p>Then, once satisfied she\u2019d performed the proper ritual, she slipped on a heavy black robe and shifted to stand directly in front of him.</p><p>Gaius made a sound of disgust, unimpressed by the elaborate ceremony. \u201cIs this going to take all night?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hands, a slow smile curling her lips. \u201cYou might want to brace yourself.\u201d</p><p>That was the only warning before the spell slammed into him, sending him to his knees. Gods. He bent his head, quivering as the pain ravaged through him.</p><p>It felt as if he were being seared from the inside out.</p><p>As if the damned witch had ignited a bonfire in the pit of his stomach that was burning its way out of his body.</p><p>He groaned, his eyes squeezing shut as he battled back the howls of misery.</p><p>The bitch was doing this on purpose, he savagely told himself. She had him at her mercy and was obviously intent on making the most of her brief moment of power.</p><p>There was another wave of blazing pain and the sense of his very . . . what? His essence? Yes, his essence, being yanked from deep inside him.</p><p>He bent down until his forehead was pressed to the wood planks of the floor. This was no simple spell. This was a soul-deep invasion that was threatening to destroy him.</p><p>A sudden fear crawled down his spine as he recalled Sally\u2019s reference to the Dark Lord assisting her with the spell. Had the master decided to put an end to his faithful servant? It wouldn\u2019t be the first time the evil bastard had killed one of his minions for the sheer pleasure of watching him die.</p><p>Then, as quickly as the ruthless pain had struck, it was gone.</p><p>Slowly coming back to his senses, Gaius remained kneeling for a long moment. It was shameful enough that the witch had seen him collapse like a spineless sprite beneath her spell. He wasn\u2019t going to make it worse by trying to rise to his feet before he was certain he wouldn\u2019t end up planting his face into the floor.</p><p>When at last he was confident he could stand without embarrassing himself, Gaius flowed to his feet, glaring at the witch.</p><p>\u201cYou . . . whore,\u201d he growled, his hand pressing to his unbeating heart. \u201cDid you take my soul?\u201d</p><p>She paled as the candles flared, then were snuffed out by his icy fury, but grimly held her ground. \u201cYou sold that a long time ago, Commander.\u201d</p><p>Well, wasn\u2019t that the god-awful truth?</p><p>He shrugged off the dark thought. What was done, was done. There was no going back now.</p><p>Instead, he pointed a finger toward the witch, his powers lashing against her with enough force to pin her against the wall.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you did to me.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, the scent of her fear teasing at his senses.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d</p><p>He took a threatening step closer. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI removed your existence,\u201d she hastily babbled.</p><p>Gaius barely resisted the ridiculous urge to glance down and make sure he hadn\u2019t simply vanished.</p><p>\u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hands in a pleading motion. \u201cI don\u2019t know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry,\u201d he snapped. \u201cTry very, very hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe spell is designed to purge your identity,\u201d she haltingly attempted to clarify. \u201cYou have no scent, no . . . presence. Others will know that you\u2019re near, but unless they\u2019re an extremely powerful demon they won\u2019t be able to detect anything about you. Not even the fact you\u2019re a vampire.\u201d</p><p>It was exactly what he expected. So why did he feel as if he\u2019d just been raped? He hissed, wishing he could at least have the satisfaction of killing the witch responsible for his sudden sense of loss.</p><p>\u201cGods.\u201d</p><p>Easily sensing his desire for death, Sally inched her way along the wall. At last she reached the door and, never allowing her wary gaze to leave his grim expression, she shoved it open. \u201cGo to your female,\u201d she husked. \u201cShe\u2019ll make you all better.\u201d</p><p>His fury was abruptly forgotten.</p><p>Dara.</p><p>No. He gave a shake of his head. Not Dara. But a female who would ease his most pressing hungers. Surely he would feel better once he\u2019d taken care of his needs?</p><p>Strolling toward the door, he paused long enough to whisper in Sally\u2019s ear. \u201cSomeday soon, witch,\u201d he warned.</p><p>He had the pleasure of watching her turn a sickly shade of gray before he was headed back down the hall and entering the lead-lined cell. Closing the door behind him, Gaius halted to savor the moment.</p><p>Was there anything sweeter than the rich scent of warm, female blood? Or the sight of his prey struggling in helpless terror?</p><p>A smile curved his lips as the female strained against the shackles chaining her to the wall. She turned her head from side to side, able to hear his arrival although the room was too dark for her human eyes to see him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s there? What do you want with me?\u201d she rasped, the frantic beat of her heart like a siren\u2019s call to Gaius. \u201cTalk to me, you perverted freak.\u201d</p><p>Compelled forward by his sharp-edged hunger, Gaius used his powers to light the lone candle set on a stool in a far corner. The flickering flame was barely noticeable in the vast darkness, but it provided just enough of a glow for the female to see Gaius\u2019s approach.</p><p>Her lips parted to scream, but cupping her face in his hands, Gaius peered deep into her wide eyes.</p> <p>\u201cShhhh. Look at me,\u201d he purred, capturing her gaze and easily ensnaring her mind. He wasn\u2019t as talented as some vampires in enthralling humans, but the female readily succumbed to his power. In a heartbeat her face became slack and her muscles eased until her arms hung limply at her side, the heavy shackles forgotten.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cFarah.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was too high with a harsh American accent instead of Dara\u2019s husky, singsong voice, but Gaius grimly blocked out the reminders that this female could never fill the empty ache in the center of his heart.</p><p>\u201cPretty, but from this night forward you will be known as Dara.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDara,\u201d the female obediently parroted.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I am Gaius. The man of your deepest fantasy.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, her eyes darkened with a mindless devotion, her lips parting on a soft sigh. \u201cGaius,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d he commended, his hands tightening on her face as he guided her down to her knees. \u201cNow you will demonstrate just how pleased you are to be reunited with your beloved mate.\u201d</p><p>With the obvious skill of a professional, the female had his pants unzipped and her lips wrapped around his erection. Gaius groaned in approval, closing his eyes as he dredged up memories of his beautiful mate.</p><p>All too soon he was reaching an intense orgasm that had more to do with physical release than actual pleasure and, shoving one hand into her long hair, he yanked her upright. She made no move to fight him as he angled her head to the side and with one smooth strike had his fangs buried deep into the flesh of her neck.</p> <p>He heard her low moan of arousal at his bite but, ignoring her writhing body, he drank deeply of her blood. He grimaced as the warm liquid slid down his throat. There was no taint of drugs and alcohol, thank the gods, but the taste was flat on his tongue.</p><p>Still, he drank deeply, only halting as he felt her heart flutter in warning. It had been too long since he\u2019d enjoyed feeding straight from the vein and the sensation was intoxicating.</p><p>Later, he would find a surrogate for Dara who was more pleasing to his taste buds. Then he could take full pleasure in draining this one dry.</p><p>Catching the sound of approaching footsteps, Gaius extracted his fangs and released his hold on the female. Boneless from her sexual reaction to his bite and her sudden drop in blood pressure, the female sagged against the chains that were all that kept her off the floor.</p><p>Not that Gaius noticed.</p><p>The woman was forgotten as he straightened his clothing and turned toward the door. He already sensed the reason for the witch\u2019s untimely approach.</p><p>With a brief rap on the door, Sally pressed it open, her gaze flicking toward the unconscious prostitute before meeting Gaius\u2019s sardonic smile.</p><p>\u201cOur guests have arrived,\u201d she said stiffly.</p> <p>His nose flared at the stench of dog already tainting his lair. \u201cCurs?\u201d</p><p>The witch didn\u2019t look any happier than Gaius. But then, why should she? Curs didn\u2019t like magic-users any more than vampires did.</p><p>\u201cA matched set.\u201d</p><p>Gaius frowned. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou have to see it to believe it.\u201d</p><p>Not about to play guessing games, Gaius brushed past her to step into the hall. \u201cBring them to my study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the whore?\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at the female, who hung from her shackles like a broken doll. \u201cShe will remain here.\u201d</p><p>Sally wrinkled her nose. \u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she dies I will see to her removal,\u201d he interrupted in impatient tones. Humans were annoyingly squeamish when it came to corpses.</p><p>\u201cCharming,\u201d Sally muttered.</p><p>Without bothering to reply, Gaius headed down the stairs and into the small library he\u2019d taken as his study.</p><p>Not that he would ever consider the long room lined with shelves and furnished with a walnut desk and two matching chairs as more than a temporary place to conduct his business. Once Dara was returned to him, he would take her back to their vast palace hidden among the hills of Italy.</p><p>His lavish home possessed a library that was twice the size of this entire house and filled with thousands of precious books that dated back to the invention of the printing press. That did not even include the fragile scrolls that were kept protected in his vault.</p><p>Unfortunately, \u201cbeggars couldn\u2019t be choosers\u201d and until the Dark Lord was satisfied that Gaius had fulfilled his side of the bargain, he was stuck in this backwoods swamp.</p><p>And worse, stuck with allies he neither wanted nor needed.</p><p>Leaning against the desk, Gaius smoothed back his dark hair and squared his shoulders as the stench of cur filled the air. There was a sharp knock on the door, but he waited for several long minutes before answering.</p><p>He was a master tactician who knew that the most subtle power plays were the most effective. Anyone could be a bully. It took cunning and patience to be a leader.</p><p>\u201cEnter,\u201d he at last commanded.</p><p>A young man who looked to be thirty in human years entered first. He was built on muscular lines with a square head that was propped on a thick neck. His hair was blond and buzzed in military fashion that was matched by the green T-shirt and cammo pants.</p><p>Behind him was a smaller, female version of him, down to the military buzz and cammo pants.</p><p>Cristo. He understood Sally\u2019s comment that they were a matched pair.</p><p>Strolling forward, the twins halted to stand side by side, their arms folded over their chests.</p><p>\u201cVampire,\u201d the male said with a respectful dip of his head.</p><p>Gaius slowly straightened from the desk, his expression one of chilly displeasure. \u201cYou will call me Commander.\u201d</p><p>Anger sizzled through the cur\u2019s hazel eyes, but he was smart enough to keep his annoyance to himself.</p><p>\u201cWhatever floats your boat,\u201d he muttered with a shrug. \u201cI\u2019m Dolf and this is my sister\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not care who you are or about your tedious life stories,\u201d Gaius interrupted in crushing tones.</p><p>The air prickled with the heat of the cur\u2019s mounting frustration.</p><p>\u201cAnd a big fucking hello to you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not a social call.\u201d Gaius flicked a dismissive gaze over the two. \u201cTell me why the Dark Lord believes mere curs can be of service to me.\u201d</p><p>Dolf clenched his jaw. \u201cBecause I have powers beyond a mere cur.\u201d</p><p>Gaius ignored the hint of sarcasm in the man\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat powers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d Lifting his hand, the cur pointed toward the shelves of books, muttering beneath his breath. There was a brief moment when Gaius wondered if the man was demented; then without warning one of the heavy books flew off the shelf to land on the desk with a loud thud.</p><p>Gaius hissed in disgust. Magic. Was the Dark Lord deliberately attempting to test his loyalty by surrounding him with creatures he most detested?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a witch?\u201d he spat before he could control his reaction. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d</p><p>The cur shrugged, obviously accustomed to the question. Not surprising. He might very well be the only magical cur on the face of the earth.</p><p>\u201cI was a fully trained witch before I was turned.\u201d</p><p>Gaius narrowed his gaze. \u201cCurs hate witches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how did you get bitten?\u201d</p><p>The cur smiled with a smug arrogance. \u201cI can be very convincing.\u201d</p><p>Gaius wasn\u2019t impressed. \u201cIf that is your only skill, then you and your sister can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d the cur rasped.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIngrid.\u201d Dolf glanced toward the silent woman at his side. \u201cShow him.\u201d</p><p>Reaching into her back pocket, the female cur withdrew a small cell phone and held it up for his inspection.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here to sell me a phone?\u201d he mocked.</p><p>Ingrid pressed a button on the phone that brought up the picture of a blond-haired man with pale blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI worked for Caine,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCaine?\u201d It took Gaius a moment to realize why the name was familiar. \u201cThe Were protecting the prophet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d The cur smiled. \u201cThis is his direct line.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Las Vegas</p><p>The penthouse suite of the casino consumed most of the top floor. Tastefully decorated in muted shades of brown and tan, it had a large sitting room filled with long sofas and overstuffed chairs arranged around a wet bar and hot tub. On each side were matching bedrooms with their own private bathrooms that were as large as most spas.</p><p>Such hushed elegance was a welcomed respite from the crowded gaming rooms, but it was the stunning view from the glass walls that attracted most guests. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caine included, although it wasn\u2019t for the usual reasons, Cassie wryly conceded.</p><p>The overprotective Were didn\u2019t care that the view at night offered a dazzling display of lights from the nearby casinos, or that during the day there was a breathtaking panorama of the surrounding desert and line of craggy hills.</p><p>His only interest was having the best possible view to make sure that nothing could sneak up on them. And of course, being high enough off the ground to keep anything without wings from sneaking through the window.</p> <p>Cassie appreciated his concern. She truly did. It was just...</p><p>Pacing from one end of the sitting room to the other, Cassie struggled to pinpoint the source of her dissatisfaction. Not an easy task. Cassie rarely remembered that beyond her visions she was a normal female who should possess normal female emotions. And she most certainly never took them out to examine them.</p><p>Not until Caine.</p><p>So now she was stuck trying to process the bizarre contradictions that were plaguing her.</p><p>The breathtaking tingles of excitement that raced through her whenever Caine happened to touch her, followed by the achy sense of disappointment when he pulled away. The restless inability to concentrate when he was in the same room and the ridiculous fear the moment he left the hotel suite without her.</p> <p>A growingly common occurrence, she acknowledged, halting to stare out the glass wall, barely noticing the streets baking beneath the fierce summer sun or the wilting tourists jamming their way into the buses that briefly halted before moving on to the next casino.</p><p>Over the past four days Caine had spent an inordinate amount of time searching for enemies that he seemed convinced were lurking just outside the door. She sensed it was more than the driving need to protect her that was sending him out the door, but she didn\u2019t have interpersonal experience to know what she was doing wrong.</p><p>Or more importantly, how to halt him.</p><p>She turned, her gaze instinctively searching out the clock set above the entertainment center. It had been three hours since Caine left.</p><p>Far longer than he was usually gone.</p><p>Her strange sense of abandonment ratcheted up another notch. Had he gone for good this time?</p> <p>It would be perfectly understandable. Playing babysitter to a female who spent most of her life besieged by glimpses of the future wasn\u2019t a role any man would willingly take on. If Caine had grown tired and decided to cut his losses, she wouldn\u2019t blame him for a minute.</p><p>The brave, noble thought had barely crossed her mind when she ruined it all by breathing a tiny sob of relief as she caught the familiar scent of Caine\u2019s approach.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t abandoned her . . .</p><p>Wrapping her arms around her waist, she forced herself not to leap forward and knock the poor man down as he stepped into the hotel suite and closed the door. Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t prevent her shaky sigh of relief or the compulsive words that tumbled from her lips before she could halt them. \u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>He appeared weary, with a hint of golden stubble on his jaw and his exquisite sapphire eyes shadowed. His white-blond hair was rumpled, as if he\u2019d been running his fingers through it, and his muscles tightly coiled beneath the tight white T-shirt and faded jeans.</p><p>Still, he was on instant alert as he caught sight of her pale face. Moving with liquid speed, he was across the room, grasping her shoulders in a tight grip.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d His gaze ran down her slender body, assuring himself that she was unharmed. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you were just gone a long time. I thought . . .\u201d She bit her lip, unwilling to burden him with her ridiculous fears.</p> <p>Of course, he easily read her mind. It was one of his tricks that she didn\u2019t particularly appreciate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Stepping back, he scrubbed his face with his hands. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to worry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI made a sweep of the hotel.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. It didn\u2019t take three hours to make a sweep of the hotel. Not unless he was searching room by room.</p><p>\u201cDo you sense trouble?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>She caught the dry edge in his voice. It wasn\u2019t a sense of trouble that was bothering him. Or at least, not entirely.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to make excuses, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor leaving the room.\u201d She tried to keep her voice steady. \u201cYou clearly dislike being here with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDislike?\u201d A raw disbelief darkened his eyes. \u201cIs that what you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can sense your tension.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure as hell isn\u2019t dislike.\u201d She could hear his teeth grinding together. \u201cI wish to God it was.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, realizing that once again she\u2019d gotten it wrong. \u201cThen what\u2019s bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a shower.\u201d</p><p>With an abrupt motion, he was spinning on his heel and heading into the bedroom he\u2019d claimed as his own. Minutes later she heard the sound of the shower running.</p><p>For a confused moment she was hurt by his sharp retreat. What had she done now to make him so eager to flee from her company?</p><p>Then she caught the unmistakable scent of his arousal.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Was that why he\u2019d taken off in such a hurry? Because he wanted to make love to her?</p><p>The thought was thrilling. Intoxicating.</p><p>She shivered as a bolt of desire sliced through her body. Along with a determination to do something about her clawing need. She might not understand why Caine was taking a shower rather than wrapping her in his arms as she longed for him to do, but she knew that she was done waiting for him to make the first move.</p><p>Before she could lose her nerve, Cassie headed across the room and into Caine\u2019s bedroom. She didn\u2019t have experience. But she did have primitive instincts.</p><p>What else did she need?</p><p>Pausing long enough to strip off her clothes, Cassie entered the bathroom, crossing the mosaic-tiled floor to step into the shower stall that was the size of most apartments.</p><p>The air, filled with moist steam laced with the scent of soap and warm male skin, wafted over her like a delicate caress. Cassie trembled, her nipples beading in anticipation as Caine turned to regard her with a wary gaze.</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d He reached to shut off the water. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, slowly advancing even as he backed against the wall, his golden body shimmering with water droplets and his hair slicked from his beautiful face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to ease your tension.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut, as if in pain. \u201cA back rub isn\u2019t what I need, pet. Maybe later.\u201d</p><p>Halting directly in front of him, Cassie skimmed her hands over his broad chest, savoring the sensation of his muscles clenching beneath her soft touch. \u201cThen tell me what you do need.\u201d</p><p>His eyes snapped open, his hands reaching to grasp her wrists, although he made no effort to pull them away.</p><p>Thank the gods.</p><p>\u201cI need you out of here before I do something we\u2019re both going to regret,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cYou would regret making love to me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes blazed with a compulsive need, even as his face twisted with an expression of supreme torment. \u201cAre you deliberately trying to drive me crazy?\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward, trailing her lips over the silken smoothness of his chest. He tasted of heat and feral animal. Delicious.</p><p>\u201cI only wanted to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp?\u201d he breathed, his heart thundering beneath her lingering kiss and the scent of wolf suddenly filling the air.</p><p>Cassie felt her own wolf responding. Just because she couldn\u2019t shift she wasn\u2019t any less of a Were. Her animal was prowling just below her skin, restlessly seeking the touch of this man. \u201cTo relieve your tension.\u201d</p><p>Unexpectedly, Caine stiffened, his muttered curses warning he wasn\u2019t pleased by her explanation. \u201cSo you\u2019re willing to give away your virginity for a pity fuck?\u201d he growled.</p><p>She pulled back, confused by his sudden anger. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced, instantly regretting his harsh words. \u201cIt means that I\u2019m not so desperate for sex that I\u2019m willing to take your innocence.\u201d</p><p>Ah. Relief surged through her. He was simply protecting her.</p><p>Again.</p><p>She reached up to brush her lips along the line of his stubborn jaw. \u201cAnd what if I am?\u201d</p><p>She felt him tremble, his muscles coiled so tight it was a wonder he didn\u2019t cramp.</p><p>\u201cWhat if you are what?\u201d he managed to husk.</p><p>\u201cDesperate,\u201d she readily admitted, nipping the lobe of his ear. \u201cWould you give me a pity fu\u2014\u201d</p><p>Caine swooped his head down to end her words with a kiss that sent a sizzling jolt of pleasure straight through her body. She gasped, clutching at his shoulders as her toes curled in the warm water pooling at their feet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d he commanded against her lips.</p><p>She allowed her tongue to trace the chiseled lines of his mouth, pleased when he groaned in helpless need.</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d she reminded him softly.</p><p>\u201cI say a lot of stupid things when I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTense?\u201d she offered when he bit off his explanation, a line of color marking his cheekbones. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice was hoarse, his eyes glowing with his wolf in the billowing steam. \u201cCassie, you really need to leave.\u201d</p><p>In response, she pressed herself against his naked body, her breath catching at the feel of his hard erection pulsing against her lower stomach.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t expected it to be so large. Not only long, but thick. And hot. It burned against her skin like a branding iron.</p> <p>Or maybe that was just her fevered imagination. Not because she was nervous. Or uncertain. But because she was so damned hungry for him.</p><p>She might be a virgin, but she had zero doubt that she wanted Caine. He was, in fact, the only man she\u2019d ever wanted.</p><p>All of him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>His hands gripped her hips, his fingers digging into her flesh as if he were caught between the urge to yank her closer and shove her away. \u201cSo badly that I can barely think straight,\u201d he breathed.</p> <p>She allowed her fingers to skim over his shoulders and then up the curve of his throat. Her touch was tentative. A Were was extremely selective in who was allowed to touch their neck. The fact he made no effort to halt her exploration proved he already accepted her on the most intimate level.</p><p>\u201cThen make love to me.\u201d</p><p>He tensed, his eyes dark with pain. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Stubborn man. Thankfully, she could be just as stubborn.</p><p>She threaded her fingers through his damp hair, deliberately rubbing the tight buds of her breasts against his chest, groaning at the tiny darts of sensation that arrowed straight to the pit of her stomach.</p><p>Oh . . . my.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Caine swore, his fingers biting into the flesh of her hips. \u201cI won\u2019t take your innocence because you\u2019re feeling sorry for me.\u201d</p><p>She stilled, tilting back her head to study him in confusion. \u201cIs that what you think? That I feel sorry for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy else would you be in my shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want . . .\u201d</p><p>He frowned as she struggled to find the words to express the need aching deep inside her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d</p><p>She might not have the words, but she knew what she wanted. Besides, talk was overrated under the best of circumstances. And in this moment, it was completely superfluous.</p> <p>Cupping his face in her hands, she went up on her tiptoes, pressing her lips to his in a kiss of blatant longing.</p><p>Caine froze and Cassie felt her heart sink. So much for her awkward attempt at seduction.</p><p>Then, just as she was about to pull back, Caine\u2019s arms lashed around her body and he hauled her off her feet so he could deepen the kiss with a satisfying urgency. Unlike her, the male possessed all the experience and skill necessary to turn the fumbling connection of their mouths into pure magic.</p><p>Sheets of heat blasted through her as his tongue expertly parted her lips and dipped inside. She trembled. Sweet heaven. It was just as wonderful as she\u2019d dreamed it would be.</p><p>The hungry press of his lips. The enticing stroke of his warm tongue. The arms that held her so tightly she could barely breathe.</p><p>But she needed . . .</p><p>What?</p><p>Hell, she didn\u2019t know. Only that Caine still wasn\u2019t close enough.</p><p>Using her innate strength, Cassie wrapped her legs around his waist and they both moaned as her most sensitive part rubbed against his fully erect shaft.</p><p>Oh yes. That\u2019s precisely what she needed.</p><p>The thought had barely drifted through her fuzzy mind when Caine lifted his head, regarding her flushed face through eyes that glowed with sapphire fire. \u201cCassie,\u201d he groaned, a feverish color staining his high cheekbones. \u201cChrist. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>She licked her tongue up the length of his neck, capturing the droplets of water clinging to his bronzed skin. \u201cNot yet, but you\u2019re going to teach me.\u201d</p><p>He released a shuddering sigh. \u201cI am?\u201d</p><p>The heavy scent of his musk wrapped around her, his cock twitching against her.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she husked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His hand skimmed up her back to cup her nape. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>She nuzzled at the pulse hammering at the base of his throat, wondering what she was doing wrong. It was never this hard in the romance books to get a man to make love to a woman. They were always ready to get down to business.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He moaned as her teeth lightly bit his neck. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to be making life-altering decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife-altering?\u201d she tilted back her head to meet his smoldering gaze. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a little melodramatic?\u201d</p><p>His gaze skimmed over her flushed face to the small breasts that were begging for his attention.</p><p>\u201cPet, when I make you mine it\u2019s going to rock your world,\u201d he said, his need making his voice rough.</p><p>\u201cI want it to be rocked now,\u201d she murmured, not above pleading. \u201cPlease, Caine.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened as his gaze skimmed downward, lingering on the small tattoo that marred the skin just beneath her belly button. \u201cYou\u2019ve already been used enough.\u201d</p><p>Cassie barely resisted the urge to cover the crimson hieroglyphic that flickered with an unsettling shimmer. It wasn\u2019t as if Caine hadn\u2019t already seen the mark of the demon lord. Or felt the chill that clung to the strange tattoo.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about being used,\u201d she corrected softly. \u201cIt\u2019s about sharing something wonderful. I need you, Caine.\u201d</p><p>There was a charged silence as Caine\u2019s savage need visibly battled with his conscience. Cassie held her breath, knowing that she\u2019d already said too much.</p><p>The last thing she wanted was for him to do something he might later regret.</p><p>Then, with a low growl he moved to the back of the shower, lowering her onto the wet marble bench. Gently, he tugged her legs from around his waist, although he kept them parted so he could kneel between them, his face on level with hers.</p><p>Oddly, their new position felt even more intimate, a sensation only emphasized as his gaze ran a searing path over her breasts and down to her feminine core, already damp with her arousal.</p><p>\u201cCaine,\u201d she breathed, tracing the curve of his noble brow and down the narrow line of his nose.</p><p>His eyes were more wolf than human as they lifted to meet her steady gaze. \u201cChrist, you\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She offered a dimpled smile. \u201cNo, you\u2019re the beautiful one.\u201d</p><p>He captured her fingers, which had been exploring his face, pressing them to his lips. \u201cI\u2019m an immoral bastard who has no right to paradise,\u201d he corrected in harsh tones. \u201cBut if you want to offer me heaven, then I\u2019m going to snatch it with both hands.\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s lips parted, but her words went unsaid as he leaned forward to place an openmouthed kiss at the base of her neck. Oh. Her arms instinctively wrapped around his shoulders, her head falling back to offer him greater access.</p><p>Stroking his lips up the curve of her throat, he took a minute to trace the line of her jaw before at last finding her mouth to claim it in a kiss of sheer possession. Her wolf growled in satisfaction as her lips were crushed beneath his hungry onslaught, her nails scoring down the smooth skin of his back.</p><p>Still surrounded by the thinning steam and the quiet hush of the outrageously expensive suite, they might have been alone in their own world. There was nothing beyond the feel of Caine\u2019s kiss and the light touch of his fingers as they tucked her hair behind her ears.</p><p>Cassie moaned. The water was turned off, but she felt as if she were drowning beneath the tidal wave of sensations crashing through her.</p><p>As if sensing her rising passion, Caine eased his kiss, allowing his lips to sweep over her upturned face. Tenderly, he caressed every line and curve before turning his attention to the sensitive flesh of her neck.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed in encouragement, shivering as his hands moved slowly downward, at long last cupping the swollen fullness of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cSo perfect,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She barely heard his soft words as she arched in pleasure, her eyes sliding shut as his fingers lightly teased the puckered tips of her nipples. Who knew her breasts could be so sensitive? Or that his touch could offer such pleasure?</p><p>A pleasure that went from sensational to shattering as he dipped his head even lower and sucked one nipple between his lips.</p><p>A soft cry tumbled from her lips as she shoved her fingers into the thick strands of his hair, shifting restlessly on the marble bench.</p><p>So this was what all the fuss was about, she conceded, trembling as his tongue and teeth sent her up in flames. She never, ever wanted him to stop. And yet . . .</p><p>There was an empty ache between her legs that demanded attention.</p><p>\u201cCaine,\u201d she murmured, trusting he would know what she needed.</p><p>\u201cPatience, pet,\u201d he countered.</p><p>She wanted to protest, but then he turned his attention to her other breast and she decided that patience wasn\u2019t such a bad thing. Especially when she felt his clever fingers drift along the curve of her hip and down the length of her leg.</p><p>Her head pressed back against the tiles as he suckled her with a growing insistence, his searching fingers drifting up her inner thigh. He was close. So close. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then suddenly he was there.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Her heart slammed against her chest as his finger swept through her moist heat.

She groaned. She was quite certain that she could become addicted to his skillful caresses.</p><p>But as the shimmering excitement began to clench her muscles, she grasped his face in her hands. \u201cI want you, Caine,\u201d she husked. \u201cI want you inside me.\u201d</p><p>The sapphire eyes darkened with feral hunger, but surprisingly he made no move to pull her from the bench and have his wicked way with her. Instead, he returned to brush his lips over her breasts before skimming his mouth slowly down her quivering stomach.</p> <p>What the devil was he doing?</p><p>The answer came when he gently tugged her legs even farther apart and, leaning forward, replaced his seeking finger with his tongue.</p><p>Sweet, sweet heaven.</p><p>Forgetting her aching need to feel him take her innocence, Cassie moaned, her fingers knotting in his hair as he stroked and nibbled and teased her with unmistakable skill. Not that she minded his obvious experience, she acknowledged as his tongue penetrated her tight channel before returning to lavish attention on that small knot of nerves. Not when she was the recipient of his exquisite talent.</p><p>Her breath came in short pants as the pleasure spiraled even higher, her toes curling in anticipation. Oh Lord, it was glorious. So glorious.</p><p>Easily sensing she was nearing the peak, Caine clamped his arms around her thighs and sucked her between his lips.</p> <p>It was all that it took to make Cassie shatter in pure ecstasy.</p><p>Crying out, she was barely aware that she was trembling from head to foot. Not until Caine gave her one last sweep of his tongue, then gently tugged her to her feet and wrapped her tightly in his arms.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he whispered into her hair, his lips stroking her temple.</p><p>She clutched at his shoulders, the tiny quakes of pleasure still shooting through her. \u201cThat was . . .\u201d</p><p>He chuckled as she struggled to find the words. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost perfect,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>She felt him tense beneath her hands, his head lifting to regard her with a searching gaze.</p><p>\u201cAlmost?\u201d</p> <p>She allowed a smile to curve her lips at his male pique. Clearly, he wasn\u2019t pleased by her refusal to admit that what had just happened had been the most spectacular event of her life.</p><p>Then, deliberately holding his gaze, she allowed one hand to drift down his chest. His breath caught as she traced the tense muscles of his stomach.</p><p>\u201cCassie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to share our pleasure.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, his hand reaching to grasp her wrist. \u201cWe will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched, his breath rasping through his gritted teeth. \u201cOnce the danger is past and you can think clearly.\u201d</p><p>Although considerably smaller than Caine, Cassie was a pureblood Were with a strength that always caught others off guard.</p><p>With a twist of her arm, her wrist was free of his grasp and her hand was continuing its downward path until it at last reached her goal.</p><p>\u201cYou might be my protector, but you\u2019re not allowed to tell me that I can\u2019t decide what I want.\u201d She wrapped her fingers around his thick erection. \u201cOr when I want it.\u201d</p><p>He cursed, but he was wise enough not to try and get into a tug of war with her hand. Not when she was holding such a tender object.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking your innocence,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Already prepared for his stubborn refusal, Cassie pressed her lips to Caine\u2019s chest, just above his pounding heart. \u201cThen I\u2019ll find another way for us to share this moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he breathed as she planted a trail of kisses to his beaded nipple.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have any idea if it would feel as good for him as it had for her, but she was hoping he would give her a clue. With perfect timing, he gave a low groan, his hand threading through her hair to hold her against him.</p><p>It was all the encouragement she needed.</p><p>Allowing her wolf out to play, she tasted the nipple with her tongue even as her fingers explored the hard length of his erection. It was astonishingly smooth, and warm. Deliciously warm.</p><p>Curious, she skimmed down his shaft, finding the heavy sack at the base. He jerked beneath her touch, and tilting back her head, she met his wild gaze. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, did I hurt you?\u201d she husked.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d He clearly struggled to swallow. \u201cNo, it didn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d enjoyed her stroking his arousal. A lot.</p><p>With a wicked chuckle, she skimmed her fingers back to the tip of his cock, finding a tiny drop of moisture. She rubbed it lightly, circling the broad head before returning downward.</p><p>She repeated the caress twice more before he released an explosive sigh. \u201cFor the love of God, Cassie, don\u2019t torture me.\u201d</p><p>Although the thought of making Caine plead for release was tempting, she sympathized with his desperation. They\u2019d been hurtling toward this moment for weeks. Later, she would enjoy the heady power of making him wait for hours before she gave in to his pleas.</p><p>She lifted herself on tiptoes to press her lips softly to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>With a choked groan, Caine reached to wrap his hand over her fingers, pressing them tight against his cock. Then, slowly he urged her to stroke up and down the shaft, his breath hissing through his teeth as his hips surged forward.</p><p>Cassie could feel the blood pulsing beneath the velvet skin and smell the rising musk. Instinctively, she quickened her pace, pleased when Caine gave a low growl of approval.</p><p>\u201cYes . . . that\u2019s it,\u201d he ground out, his hand cupping the back of her head and urging her face toward his neck.</p><p>Her wolf knew exactly what he wanted and without hesitation she sank her teeth into the side of his neck, the raw male taste of him on her tongue sending another climax pulsing through her.</p><p>At the same time, Caine gave a shout of joy as he pumped his erection in her hand, the warm spray of his seed covering her stomach.</p><p>\u201cHmm. That was nice.\u201d Cassie licked the trickle of blood her teeth had drawn. \u201cCan we do it again?\u201d</p><p>Several hours later Caine lay with Cassie wrapped in his arms on one of the wide beds. Predictably, she had fallen fast asleep the moment her head hit the pillow, while he\u2019d remained wide awake, watching her in stunned amazement.</p><p>He was a fool.</p><p>No surprise there, of course. He\u2019d worked so hard to keep his hands off this beautiful, all-too-vulnerable Were. Cold baths, long runs across the desert, hours of patrolling the sixty-story hotel for the least hint of danger.</p><p>But one soft touch of Cassie\u2019s hand and all his good intentions went flying out the window. Or rather, flying out the shower. He swallowed a harsh groan as he recalled the afternoon in vivid detail. Every kiss, every tentative stroke of her hand, every soft groan.</p><p>His only consolation was that while he might have stolen her innocence, he hadn\u2019t committed the ultimate sin of taking her virginity.</p><p>Why was that so important?</p><p>Caine grimaced, not wanting to consider the dangerous question. It was easier to tell himself that he was simply being noble. That he wanted to wait until Cassie was out of danger and capable of considering the consequences with a clear mind.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to acknowledge the tiny voice that warned taking her virginity would somehow tie him irrevocably to the beautiful Were. And that once he\u2019d truly made her his lover he would never, ever be willing to let her go.</p><p>No matter what she wanted.</p><p>Mate . . .</p><p>With a low growl, he fiercely squashed the terrifying word.</p><p>Nope. Not going to go there. Things were bad enough.</p><p>As if to emphasize the point, Cassie turned in her sleep, her slender body snuggling into him with a trust that made his heart shift in his chest.</p><p>Hell. He should never have allowed her to climb into bed with him. Not just because he was a full-blooded male not a damned saint, and the feel of her warm curves covered by nothing more than the tiny teddy he\u2019d been stupid enough to buy was destined to keep him hard and aching throughout the long night. But because the sheer intimacy was touching him places he didn\u2019t want to be touched.</p><p>Of course, it wasn\u2019t as if he\u2019d had a choice. One pleading glance from those big emerald eyes and he\u2019d been a lost cause. Pathetic. With a rueful smile, he buried his face in the silken softness of her hair. What was a poor man to do?</p><p>Absently running a soothing hand down her back, Caine was near the point of drifting off when he abruptly felt Cassie\u2019s muscles tense. He frowned, lifting his head. Was she dreaming or had his slight touch wakened her?</p><p>He had his answer the moment her eyes opened to reveal the beautiful green was already veiled by a disturbing white film.</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d He grasped her shoulders, ridiculously attempting to shake her awake. \u201cCassie.\u201d</p><p>Oblivious to his presence, Cassie shrugged off his hands and scooted off the bed. Then, with mechanical movements, she headed out of the bedroom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShit.\u201d Leaping to his feet, Caine rapidly pulled on his jeans and a sweatshirt that had been tossed on a nearby chair. A loaded Glock was tucked at his lower back, then, yanking a robe hanging on the back of the bathroom door, he hurried in her wake.</p><p>There was no use trying to stop her. Lost in the power of her visions, she wouldn\u2019t halt until she\u2019d reached her goal. Whether that goal was standing in the sitting room to weave one of the strange, shimmering glyphs that revealed a foretelling. Or dragging him halfway across the country.</p><p>All he could do was keep her from hurting herself. He entered the sitting room only to find it empty with the door standing open. With a curse he jogged into the hallway, at last catching up with her as she stepped into an empty elevator.</p> <p>\u201cHold on, baby, I\u2019m with you,\u201d he muttered, entering the small cubicle at the same moment she hit the button for the lobby.</p><p>She stared straight ahead, her face blank even when he tucked her into the robe and tied the belt. He grimaced. At least the hotel was nearly silent. Well, if one didn\u2019t count the hideous music being pumped into the elevator.</p><p>It was that strange hour just before dawn.</p><p>The window of time when even the most hardened of gamblers had returned to their beds and the early morning workers were still gulping down their first cup of coffee. He and Cassie wouldn\u2019t be bothered by unwelcomed gawkers, and more importantly, there would be no crowds an enemy could use to disguise their approach.</p><p>The elevator at last gave a subtle shudder as it slowed, the metal doors sliding open. Without hesitation Cassie stepped into the lobby, her feet moving at a measured pace across the tiled floor and out the glass doors to the street.</p> <p>Staying at her side, Caine shook his head at the uniformed driver who was leaning against his limo in the off chance of a fare, and captured Cassie\u2019s arm as she started to step off the curb, directly in the path of an oncoming taxi.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he commanded, refusing to release her until he was certain the coast was clear.</p><p>She stood passively beneath his touch, waiting in silence for him to at last release his grip so she could continue across the road and toward the edge of town at a swift jog.</p><p>Caine sighed as he followed behind. If the whole knight protector gig crapped out he might just have a career as a crossing guard. Something to consider.</p><p>Focusing on the absurd thoughts to keep from panicking as Cassie remained locked deep in her vision, Caine nevertheless was on full guard as they circled the edge of the airport and headed into the desert.</p><p>Not that there was much to guard against. A few coyotes, lizards, snakes . . . Nothing that could harm a pureblooded Were. Thank the gods.</p> <p>Eventually, the perpetual glow of the city was left behind and all signs of civilization were lost to the barren desert. Still, Cassie continued forward, indifferent to the cool breeze and the thick silence.</p><p>Where the hell were they going?</p><p>It took another half hour before the question was answered, and even then it didn\u2019t make any sense.</p><p>Halting in the middle of a flat basin, Cassie stood at rigid attention, her pale hair floating on the breeze. Then, as if she were possessed by a sudden madness, she dropped to her knees. Caine cursed, leaping to the side as she grabbed a sharp stone and began to feverishly draw symbols in the arid ground.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Caine tried to leash his primal instincts that demanded he scoop Cassie off the filthy ground and return her to the safety of the hotel room. He even succeeded for several torturous minutes. But when the scent of Cassie\u2019s blood hit his nose, his good intentions were blasted into a million pieces.</p><p>Her knees were scraped raw and her hands cut more than once by the stone. Enough was enough.</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d He managed to take a step forward when a soft voice floated on the air.</p><p>\u201cDo not interfere, Were.\u201d</p> <p>The sudden sound combined with the scent of brimstone had him spinning around, the Glock in his hand.</p><p>His eyes narrowed at the sight of the small creature standing directly behind him. Shit. How had she managed to sneak up on him?</p><p>Not that she looked like much of a threat. She was barely over three feet tall with a tiny body currently covered by a white robe that shimmered in the moonlight. Her heart-shaped face appeared almost childlike, with delicate features that gave the illusion of innocence.</p><p>At least until one noticed the razor-sharp teeth and the ancient power that smoldered in the black, almond eyes.</p><p>Yeah, this creature was about as helpless as a live grenade. Or a nuclear bomb.</p><p>His wolf was on full alert, his hand steady, as he pointed the fully loaded gun at the center of her chest. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he snarled.</p><p>She held up tiny hands as if that would convince him to trust her. \u201cYannah.\u201d</p><p>His finger found the trigger. \u201cGive me a reason not to put a bullet through your heart.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to the side. \u201cYou cannot harm me with human weapons.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, not surprised. \u201cThen I\u2019ll rip out your throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for threats. I\u2019m not here to harm your mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not\u2014\u201d He bit off his ridiculous denial. \u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo offer a warning.\u201d The black eyes narrowed at the unmistakable sound of Caine cocking the hammer. \u201cHell\u2019s bells, what\u2019s wrong with you? I said I offer a warning, not a threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I should trust the word of a creature who pops out of thin air to offer mysterious warnings because . . . ?\u201d he mocked, shifting to make sure his body was still blocking Cassie as she frantically continued to dig in the dirt.</p><p>The tiny demon wisely kept her gaze trained on Caine. One glance toward the vulnerable Cassie and Caine would rip off her head.</p><p>Or at least he would try, he silently corrected, shivering as Yannah allowed a hint of her terrible power to glow in the black eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe warning is not mysterious,\u201d Yannah assured him. \u201cIn fact, it couldn\u2019t be more clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll play.\u201d Like he had a choice? \u201cWhat\u2019s the warning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the very near future Cassie is going to demand that you leave her.\u201d</p><p>Leave her? Caine was instantly furious. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Yannah heaved a resigned sigh. \u201cWhy do males always make everything so difficult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a prophet?\u201d he managed between clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The demon shook her head, sending her long braid sliding across her back. \u201cCassie stands alone with her gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGift?\u201d Caine snarled. \u201cIt\u2019s a freaking curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>He lowered the gun, afraid in his current mood he might do something stupid. It was his usual modus operandi. Besides, it wasn\u2019t going to do him a damned bit of good.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not a seer, then how do you know what Cassie will or won\u2019t do in the future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother, Siljar, is an Oracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d The last thing he needed was interference from the Commission, or as he called them, the Pain-in-the-Asses-Who-Ruled-the-Demon-World. \u201cHow does she know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe possesses a talent for sensing a principium.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced, recognizing the term. It meant that Cassie was important enough to the future of the world that her life was written in the stars.</p><p>\u201cA thread of destiny,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cSo you aren\u2019t just a pretty face.\u201d Yannah flashed her razor teeth. Yikes. \u201cUnusual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cI\u2019m still not entirely clear on why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fate of all of us rests upon young Cassie\u2019s shoulders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as far as I\u2019m concerned, fate can go screw itself,\u201d he retorted, knowing he was being childish. But, dammit, he was standing helplessly in the middle of a desert while the female he was obsessed with protecting was crawling through the dirt until she bled. He had a right to think destiny or fate, or whatever a person wanted to call it, totally sucked.</p><p>Something that might have been sympathy touched the heart-shaped face. \u201cIt\u2019s her destiny,\u201d she said softly, \u201cbut she doesn\u2019t have to walk her path alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not alone.\u201d Caine frowned. \u201cUnless you mean her sisters? Cassie has refused to contact them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I speak of you. You must never waver.\u201d</p><p>Waver? Was she freaking kidding? His anger returned. With interest. \u201cAre you questioning my loyalty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but like most alpha males you have more pride than sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you.\u201d She looked at him as if wondering if he\u2019d always been so stupid. \u201cCassie will come to a crossroads. In that moment she will try to push you away. You must not allow her to leave you behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going anywhere without me,\u201d he snapped. \u201cNot ever.\u201d</p><p>His fierce words were still ringing through the air when there was a faint groan from behind him. He turned, his heart halting as he watched Cassie collapse onto the desert floor.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d With one leap he was bending down beside her, knocking the rock out of her hand before tugging her slender body against his chest. No use taking a chance of getting beaned. A distinct possibility if she was still caught in her vision. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He brushed his lips over her forehead, pulling back as her lashes fluttered upward to reveal her eyes. Back to emerald. Thank the gods.</p><p>\u201cCaine?\u201d she husked.</p><p>\u201cI got you.\u201d</p> <p>She blinked, her dazed eyes taking in the star-spattered sky over his shoulder before shifting to glance over the barren desert. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cIn the middle of freaking nowhere.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed in bewilderment. \u201cI thought . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard voices.\u201d</p> <p>Oh hell. Caine jerked his head up. He\u2019d completely forgotten the strange intruder.</p><p>Gone. Thank the gods. He didn\u2019t care why Yannah had come. Or how she\u2019d managed to appear and disappear without leaving a trace. All that mattered was that the powerful demon wasn\u2019t anywhere near Cassie.</p><p>He returned his attention to the woman in his arms. \u201cWe\u2019re alone,\u201d he assured her softly. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d She gently pried herself from his ruthless hold, taking a puzzled inventory of her fading scrapes and bruises. Then, as if seeking the reason for the wounds, her attention shifted to the glyphs she\u2019d carved into the desert floor. \u201cDid I do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite the Picasso,\u201d he said, forcing a teasing smile to his lips as he helped her to her feet. He had no intention of burdening her with his fierce fear that one day she would disappear into her visions and never return. She had enough to deal with, thank you very much. \u201cDo you happen to know why you did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I think this is why we were here.\u201d</p> <p>Good news. At least he hoped it was. He was tired of trying to protect Cassie in such a populated area. Of course, there was no guarantee they weren\u2019t about to be led someplace even worse.</p><p>On that happy thought, he pointed toward the strange symbols. \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a warning.\u201d She frowned, shaking her head. \u201cAt least I think it\u2019s a warning.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her chin in his hand, tugging her face up so he could study her pale features. His heart faltered. Man, she was so beautiful drenched in moonlight.</p><p>\u201cHow can you reveal a prophecy and not know what it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for me,\u201d she said as if the simple words weren\u2019t a mind-bender.</p><p>\u201cThen who . . . ?\u201d He gave a sharp shake of his head as she swayed in weariness. \u201cNever mind,\u201d he muttered, scooping her off her feet and cradling her in his arms. \u201cAre we finished here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>He peered deep into the emerald eyes. \u201cDoes that mean we can go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have someplace better to be?\u201d he demanded, praying to the gods that she said no.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had a home.\u201d</p><p>That dangerous, intoxicating warmth filled his heart and spilled through his body. Caine didn\u2019t care. Bending his head, he touched his lips to hers in a reverent vow.</p><p>\u201cYou do now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Despite the early hour, Caine had them packed up and checked out of the hotel by sunrise.</p><p>Not that Cassie was in the mood to argue. She would always harbor fond memories of Vegas.</p><p>A smile touched her lips. No, not just fond. Stunningly fabulous memories.</p><p>Even now she could close her eyes and recall every touch, every kiss, every mind-blowing orgasm. In vivid, X-rated detail.</p><p>But she was more than happy to return to Caine\u2019s lair outside Chicago. What could be better than having Caine all to herself without the distraction of trying to blend in?</p><p>It was exhausting trying to be normal.</p><p>With a sigh of contentment, she shifted in her seat, the breeze tugging at her hair. Caine had removed the top of the Jeep and the late afternoon sunlight spilled over her skin left bare by her khaki shorts and stretchy tube top. Lazily, she watched the cornfields of Nebraska whiz pass, breathing deeply of Caine\u2019s warm, wolfy musk.</p><p>The smell of him . . . grounded her. There was no other way to say it. Even when she was lost in the dark mists of her visions, when she was blind to the world, she could catch his scent nearby and know that nothing could harm her.</p><p>Dwelling on the miracle that had brought Caine into her life, Cassie was unprepared for the burst of unease that destroyed her momentary illusion of peace.</p><p>She straightened, reaching out to touch Caine\u2019s shoulder. \u201cPull over.\u201d</p><p>He shot a frowning glance toward the endless miles of corn. \u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>With obvious reluctance, he slowed the Jeep and pulled onto the shoulder. He turned his attention to her. \u201cAre you sick?\u201d</p><p>Puzzled by the question, she gave a shake of her head. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have to pee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what the hell are we doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe phone.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cWhat . . .\u201d The sound of his ring tone brought his words to an abrupt end. \u201cShit,\u201d he muttered, digging his cell phone out of the front pocket of his jeans. \u201cI\u2019m never going to get used to that.\u201d He glanced at the screen, his scowl only deepening. \u201cIngrid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend?\u201d she forced herself to ask, squashing the odd stab of aversion toward the unknown female.</p><p>This phone call was important. Even if she didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>\u201cA lifetime ago,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhy would she be calling now?\u201d</p><p>She slid until she was leaning against the hard muscles of his shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t know everything.\u201d She pointed her finger toward the phone. \u201cMaybe if you push that little button and talk with her you\u2019ll find out.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head to nip the end of her nose. \u201cSmart-ass.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t fooled by his playful manner. There was something troubling him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you answer?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cShe\u2019s a part of my past I want to forget.\u201d</p><p>The ringing stopped as the phone sent the caller to voice mail only to start again seconds later.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she agrees with being a part of your past.\u201d Cassie studied Caine\u2019s tight expression, feeling his tension as if it were her own. \u201cWas she your lover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But . . .\u201d Regret flashed through his stunning blue eyes as he reached to outline her lips with the tip of his finger. \u201cThere were women, Cassie. I don\u2019t share your innocence.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, realizing that the unpleasant sensation that had been plaguing her since Caine\u2019s phone started ringing was jealousy. How . . . astonishing.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lover now?\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched, easily sensing her inner turmoil. \u201cOnly one,\u201d he assured her, leaning forward to steal a possessive kiss. \u201cThe rest are a part of that past I intend to forget.\u201d</p><p>Cassie nodded, the tightness in her chest easing, although the phone continued its annoying ringing. \u201cShe\u2019s very persistent,\u201d she muttered, her finger moving to point at the top of the phone screen. \u201cWhat\u2019s that blinking light?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sent me a video.\u201d</p><p>Cassie tensed, her personal emotions smothered beneath the power of her forewarning. \u201cI think you should watch it.\u201d</p><p>He studied her with a frown. \u201cAre you speaking as a jealous lover or as a prophet?\u201d</p><p>She considered a long moment. \u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>His breath hissed between clenched teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be a seer to know I\u2019m not going to like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay it, Caine,\u201d she softly commanded.</p><p>He muttered something beneath his breath, but holding the phone at an angle so they could both easily view the screen, he tapped the blinking light.</p><p>Within seconds a young female with hazel eyes and oddly buzzed blond hair flickered to life, her features more striking than pretty as she flashed a cocky smile.</p><p>\u201cLong time, no see, liebling,\u201d she said, her voice low and raspy. \u201cI suppose you don\u2019t have time for your old friends now that you\u2019re a big bad Were.\u201d The female\u2019s lips curled in disdain. \u201cYeah, word\u2019s out that you\u2019ve turned traitor to the curs. So listen closely\u2014you got what you wanted, now I want it. If you can become a Were, so can I. And to make sure you don\u2019t blow me off as you have everyone else, I have a little . . . incentive.\u201d</p><p>The video went blurry as Ingrid swung her phone camera toward the side and downward. For a minute there was nothing but the vague outline of a person, then the camera came back into focus and Cassie gasped in shock.</p><p>The tiny female filling the screen was almost an exact replica of herself. Oh, her hair was a few inches shorter and more golden than silver. And her slender body, which was covered in a casual pair of jeans and stretchy blue shirt, was toned by obvious hours spent in a gym. But her heart-shaped face was precisely the same and if her eyes had been opened, Cassie was willing to bet that they would be some shade of green.</p><p>It was one of her three sisters. They hadn\u2019t yet been formally introduced, but the resemblance was too great for it to be anyone else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHarley.\u201d Caine answered her unspoken question, his finger pressing the screen to pause the video.</p><p>Cassie clutched his arm in horror, frantically studying the image of her sister bound to a chair with silver chains and a heavy silver collar around her neck. She appeared to be unconscious as her head drooped to the side, a thin line of blood trailing down her cheek from a wound to her temple.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, she\u2019s hurt,\u201d she breathed, turning to find Caine watching her with concern. \u201cIs there more to the video?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but maybe you should let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay it,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>She felt his muscles clench beneath her fingers, but with obvious reluctance he at last pressed his thumb to the screen and the image of Harley was joined by Ingrid as she knelt beside the chair.</p><p>\u201cIf you want her released unharmed . . .\u201d The female cur smirked. \u201cWell, relatively unharmed, then call me so we can set up a meet and greet. You have twenty-four hours. Oh, and if you\u2019re thinking about sharing this video with your new allies . . . don\u2019t.\u201d She leaned sideways so the camera could catch her hand reaching toward the small bulge of Harley\u2019s belly. \u201cIf I even suspect that I\u2019m being hunted, the first to die will be these sweet, innocent pups.\u201d She pressed her lips to the phone. \u201cCall me, liebling.\u201d</p><p>The video went black and Caine clenched the phone until the case threatened to shatter.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill that bitch.\u201d</p><p>Cassie nodded, fully onboard with the kill-the-bitch plan, but only after they were certain Harley was safe.</p><p>\u201cWould she really hurt the babies?\u201d</p><p>The muscle of his jaw knotted as he visibly fought the urge to protect her with a lie.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to rescue her.\u201d She frowned as he pressed his thumb against the phone screen to replay the video. \u201cCaine, did you hear me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a trap,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of trap?\u201d</p><p>He hit pause, his brow furrowed as he studied the image of Ingrid standing in a dark room with shelves of wine bottles in the background.</p><p>\u201cIt could be a trick that your sisters dreamed up to lure you back to their protection.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. It was no secret her sisters were desperate to have her returned to the bosom of her family. But she didn\u2019t for a moment think they would go to such extremes. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so either,\u201d Caine readily agreed, \u201cbut it has to be considered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are your other theories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be that Ingrid was telling the truth.\u201d His gaze returned to the screen where the female cur was smiling with smug arrogance. \u201cShe might genuinely believe I have some magical means to transform her into a pureblooded Were and is trying to force me to give her what she desires.\u201d</p> <p>She studied his perfectly chiseled profile. \u201cBut you don\u2019t believe that?\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted. \u201cThere was a time when I was vain enough to assume that the world revolved around me, but I\u2019m not a complete idiot.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to her side. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d</p><p>He reached to give her ponytail a gentle tug. \u201cI\u2019m traveling with the most sought after creature in the entire universe. If someone\u2019s trying to capture us, it\u2019s all about you, pet.\u201d</p><p>Cassie grimaced. Being the most sought after creature in the entire universe wasn\u2019t nearly so fun as it sounded. In fact, it sucked.</p><p>\u201cEven if that\u2019s true, I\u2019m not leaving my sister in the hands of that female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Caine soothed. \u201cAre you getting any . . .\u201d He waved his hand in vague motion.</p><p>\u201cAny what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVibes.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in confusion before at last realizing he was referring to her visions. \u201cOh.\u201d She paused, searching for any hint of a foretelling. \u201cNo,\u201d she at last said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>He heaved a sigh. \u201cSo you get the command to watch the video, but nothing to tell us what to do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it works.\u201d She shrugged, pointing toward his phone. \u201cYou have to call.\u201d</p><p>His gaze followed her finger, his muscles abruptly tensing as he studied the image of Ingrid still filling the screen. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaine . . .\u201d She halted her pleading words, sensing his distraction. \u201cYou have a plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so much a plan as a desperate hope that we can spring the trap before it\u2019s set and escape with your sister unscathed,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cIs that possible?\u201d</p><p>He tapped the screen. \u201cI recognize where Ingrid took this video.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Salvatore\u2019s wine cellar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in the wine cellar of the King of Weres?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He turned to meet her expression of disbelief. \u201cSalvatore used to be my enemy. Hell, he still wants to nail my furry ass to the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why were you in the wine cellar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he turned up in America I needed a secret way to enter his lair if I had to take drastic measures to protect myself. There\u2019s a tunnel that leads into his wine cellar.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cI suppose I should expect such madness from you. You are far too reckless. But this female . . .\u201d She frowned at the cur\u2019s smug confidence that was captured by the video. \u201cIs she insane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always suspected she came from the shallow end of the gene pool,\u201d Caine said. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would be stupid enough to hold the mate of the King of Weres hostage in his own wine cellar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvatore must be out of state or Ingrid wouldn\u2019t have managed to get within a mile of the lair, let alone get her hands on Harley,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Cassie still thought the female must be a nut bar.</p><p>\u201cSo you think they\u2019re still in the wine cellar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtful, but we should be able to pick up Ingrid\u2019s scent and track her from there.\u201d</p><p>Her nails unconsciously dug into his arm, her wolf eager to be on the hunt even as her heart clenched with fear. \u201cWhat if she hurts Harley or the babies before we can reach them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have twenty-four hours. If we don\u2019t pick up Ingrid\u2019s trail, then I\u2019ll make the call.\u201d He cupped her cheek in his hand, brushing her lips with a soft kiss. \u201cI promise nothing\u2019s going to hurt your sister.\u201d</p><p>She leaned her forehead against his, taking strength in his familiar scent.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s lair in St. Louis</p><p>Gaius was fuming as he paced from one end of the wine cellar to the other.</p><p>Who could blame him? He was standing in the lair of the King of Weres with two curs who looked like matching G.I. Joe dolls and a goth witch who was wearing a tight leather skirt and spike-heeled boots that were as impractical as they were ridiculous. He\u2019d been forced to shape-shift to look like the Queen of Weres in an attempt to lure the prophet into his clutches. And now he was stuck waiting with his trio of idiots on the off chance the plot would work.</p><p>Plus, adding insult to injury, the entire place reeked of dogs.</p><p>Che macello.</p><p>Clearly possessing more brawn than brains, the male cur sauntered within striking distance of Gaius, seemingly indifferent to the frigid fury that prickled through the air. \u201cIt really is remarkable,\u201d Dolf murmured, compounding his stupidity by lifting a hand toward Gaius\u2019s long mane of blond hair.</p><p>\u201cTouch me and your sister will be dragging you out of here as a corpse.\u201d</p><p>The cur jerked his hand back, his face flushed at the icy warning. \u201cNo need for threats,\u201d he protested. \u201cWe\u2019re all on the same side here.\u201d</p><p>Gaius curled his lips. \u201cDo not remind me.\u201d</p><p>The cur grimaced. \u201cWhat crawled up your ass and died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you in such a pissy mood?\u201d</p><p>Gaius narrowed his gaze. \u201cAre you trying to be amusing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I want to humiliate myself with this\u201d\u2014Gaius waved a hand to indicate his slender, delicately curved body\u2014\u201cfemale form?\u201d</p><p>The flush drained from Dolf \u2019s face to leave him a frightened shade of gray. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr to spend hours trespassing in the lair of the King of Weres?\u201d Gaius continued, his voice edged with a bitterness that was capable of flaying the skin off a lesser creature. \u201cWho, by the way, has his full powers returned and would happily kill me on sight.\u201d</p><p>Dolf lifted his hands in a desperate attempt at damage control. \u201cI told you, Ingrid\u2019s source says that the king and queen are in Chicago for at least two more days.\u201d</p><p>Gaius wasn\u2019t any more impressed now than he\u2019d been when he first heard the reassurance. Not that he was given any choice, he grimly reminded himself. When Ingrid had approached him with the suggestion of using his ability to alter shapes to bait a trap for the prophet, he\u2019d emphatically refused. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wasn\u2019t about to make a fool of himself by prancing around looking like a damned female while lurking in the wine cellar of the King of Weres. He did have some pride left. But, of course, the witch had instantly done her wireless communication with the Dark Lord and Gaius discovered himself on his knees, agreeing to travel to St. Louis and pose as Harley.</p><p>He didn\u2019t, however, agree to like it.</p><p>\u201cHer mysterious source could be mistaken,\u201d he pointed out in biting tones. \u201cOr hoping to keep us here long enough to become lambs to the slaughter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIngrid knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201d Dolf sent a glance that was far too intimate toward his sister. Creepy. \u201cShe came up with the plan to trick Caine into coming to this wine cellar, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she did.\u201d Gaius shifted his attention toward the female cur who leaned against the shelves of wine, her muscular arms folded over her chest. \u201cYou\u2019re certain he will come to this cellar instead of calling as you demanded?\u201d</p><p>Ingrid shrugged. \u201cCaine is pathologically suspicious, which makes it almost impossible to ambush him. We have to convince him that he\u2019s actually avoiding the trap while we nudge him where we want him to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re assuming that he watches the video you sent and then ignores your demands to call despite the threat to his queen.\u201d Gaius impatiently brushed back his long blond hair, which was proving to be a constant nuisance. Cristo, he would be relieved when this stupid charade was done and he could return to his true form. \u201cAnd that he recognizes this wine cellar.\u201d</p><p>The cur smiled. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p> <p>Gaius hissed in disgust. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s lair in St. Louis</p><p>Caine left the Jeep parked several miles away from Salvatore\u2019s lair, located in a northern suburb of the city. Then, leading Cassie along the edge of the large lake surrounded by brick mansions set like fine jewels among the manicured lawns and formal gardens, he came to a halt behind a boathouse.</p><p>It was late enough that the neighborhood was shrouded in a slumbering darkness, but his night vision easily allowed him to scour his surroundings for any sign of danger. Not that there was any to be found.</p><p>He dismissed the incubus currently fulfilling the fantasy of a neglected housewife and the nest of harpies who were hidden on the small island in the middle of the lake. They posed no threat to a pureblooded Were.</p> <p>Far from reassured, he studied the vast three-story home perched on a hill that overlooked the lake. The back walls, which were made almost entirely of glass, were partly obscured by a large veranda framed by marble columns. Trellised gardens descended the length of the steep slope, coming to a halt at the edge of a stone grotto that not only served as a perfect picnic spot, but a lookout for Salvatore\u2019s guards.</p><p>Guards that should have been on duty.</p><p>So where the hell were they?</p><p>He was still searching for an answer when he felt Cassie crouch beside him, her wide gaze trained on the mansion above them.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord,\u201d she breathed. \u201cThat\u2019s Harley\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very large.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted at the understatement. The place was big enough to lodge a small country. \u201cIf you like it I could have one built for you.\u201d</p> <p>She shuddered. \u201cNo, I spent too many years in soulless caverns to feel comfortable in such a place,\u201d she said. \u201cI prefer your home.\u201d</p><p>He reached to give her hand a light squeeze. \u201cOur home,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her dimples made a brief appearance. \u201cOur home.\u201d</p><p>Satisfaction seared through him and with a small groan, Caine tugged her close enough to claim her lips in an urgent kiss. Our sounded amazingly perfect.</p><p>Then, with a curse, he forced himself to pull away. Now wasn\u2019t the time to be distracted. No matter what the temptation.</p><p>Even if this wasn\u2019t a trap, he knew that Salvatore had a bounty out on his head. If the king\u2019s pack caught scent of them he would never shake them off their trail.</p><p>\u201cDo you sense anything?\u201d he asked, returning his attention to the seemingly abandoned house.</p><p>She tilted back her head, sniffing the air. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cIs that a good thing or a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>That was the question, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cSalvatore would never have left Harley completely alone,\u201d he muttered. \u201cIf she was kidnapped, his pack should be swarming through the neighborhood searching for her.\u201d</p><p>Cassie shrugged. \u201cMaybe they don\u2019t know she\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they should at least be guarding the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s a trap?\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at his blunt honesty. \u201cThen shouldn\u2019t we be somewhere that isn\u2019t here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to the side, regarding him in confusion. \u201cCaine?\u201d</p><p>He heaved a sigh. His every instinct screamed to toss Cassie over his shoulder and rush away from Salvatore\u2019s lair at top speed. The very air whispered a warning.</p><p>But he\u2019d spent enough time with Cassie to know that she wouldn\u2019t be satisfied until she was certain that Harley had been rescued and was safely back in the hands of her mate.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m going to pick up Ingrid\u2019s scent I have to get closer.\u201d</p><p>Without hesitation she pushed herself to her feet, as always completely fearless.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He straightened, taking her hands in a warning grip. \u201cI want your promise that you won\u2019t leave my side. Not even for a second.\u201d</p><p>Cassie hesitated, chewing her bottom lip. \u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d she at last conceded.</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I can promise.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted as he met her candid gaze. \u201cI suppose it is.\u201d</p><p>He grasped her hand and led her along the lakeshore, ignoring the stone steps leading to the house. Cassie fell into step beside him, a puzzled frown marring her brow.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>Caine led her past the boat dock and at last halted at a line of Dumpsters near the gravel service road. \u201cThe entrance to the secret tunnel is hidden inside the Dumpster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClever,\u201d Cassie said, only to slap a hand over her nose and mouth as Caine broke the lock and threw back the lid on the green metal bin set slightly away from the others. \u201cAnd pungent,\u201d she muttered, taking an instinctive step backward. \u201cYow.\u201d</p><p>Prepared for the spell of revulsion, Caine ignored the foul smell billowing from the Dumpster as well as the magical \u201cpush\u201d to turn and walk away. \u201cIt keeps demons from sniffing close enough to discover the entrance,\u201d he said, vaulting into the bin and holding out his hand.</p><p>\u201cA very effective deterrent,\u201d Cassie gagged out, reluctantly taking his hand and climbing into the Dumpster.</p><p>Once they were both through the barrier the spell abruptly vanished to reveal a scrupulously clean container with a trapdoor cut into the metal bottom. Caine bent down, sliding his fingers along the outline of the door until he found the hidden lever. With a faint click the door abruptly swung downward to reveal a tunnel dug into the ground.</p><p>Reaching behind him, he grabbed Cassie\u2019s hand and tucked her fingers into the waistband of his jeans. \u201cHold on and don\u2019t let go,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cBossy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Terrified.\u201d</p><p>Without giving her time to reply, Caine dropped into the tunnel, landing on the cement floor with Cassie descending lightly behind him.</p><p>He paused, searching the darkness with his heightened senses. There was . . . nothing.</p><p>No lurking enemies.</p><p>No waiting traps.</p><p>And no scent of curs.</p><p>He growled in frustration. \u201cIngrid didn\u2019t come in or out of the tunnel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we have to go on,\u201d Cassie whispered softly. \u201cWe know she was in the wine cellar. We can pick up her scent there.\u201d</p><p>He shot a glance over his shoulder, meeting her stubborn glare. \u201cAnd what if this is a trap?\u201d</p><p>She managed to look even more stubborn.</p><p>Stubboner.</p><p>Was that a word? If not, it should be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving until we find the trail leading to my sister.\u201d</p><p>He turned to move down the tunnel, muttering beneath his breath. Man, it had to be the greatest cosmic joke ever. Fate had given him his deepest desire and transformed him into a pureblood Were only to punish him with the constant pressure of keeping the most endangered creature in the entire world safe.</p><p>He was supposed to be enjoying a carefree existence at the top of the food chain, surrounded by his adoring harem and collecting hordes of ill-gotten gains. Hadn\u2019t that been his fantasy?</p><p>Certainly, it hadn\u2019t been creeping through the dark, tormented by the fear that he was somehow going to fail the female who\u2019d become an essential part of his life.</p><p>Fingers tightened on his waistband, and his bout of self-pity was forgotten as the scent of warm female and lavender wrapped around him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cassie.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t trade one hour with this female for all the harems and fortunes in the world.</p><p>Oh, how the mighty were fallen.</p> <p>Shaking his head at his foolishness, Caine followed the tunnel that led straight to the cellars beneath Salvatore\u2019s lair. Then, as they reached the heavy wood door imbedded with iron spikes, he sucked in a deep breath, not at all comforted by the strange void filling the air.</p><p>There should be some odors.</p><p>On full alert, he reluctantly shoved the door open, doing his best to keep Cassie behind him as they entered the room, which had a dirt floor and cement walls lined with towering shelves that held hundreds of dusty bottles. In the center of the room sat a collection of aged-wood barrels and across the vast space were a number of arched doorways that led to storage alcoves and high-tech refrigerators.</p><p>Focused on searching the nearby shadows for an ambush, Caine nearly missed the slender, blond-haired Were that was sprawled in a chair next to the wine racks, apparently knocked unconscious.</p><p>He did, thankfully, sense the moment Cassie prepared to launch herself across the room. Grabbing her arm, he grimly held on. \u201cWait.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Harley,\u201d she hissed, straining against his grip. \u201cWe have to help her.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped an arm around her waist, speaking directly in her ear. \u201cCassie, there\u2019s something missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t smell . . .\u201d She stiffened as she realized there wasn\u2019t any hint of her sister\u2019s scent in the air. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>On the point of shoving her back through the doorway, Caine felt the air stir as one of the shelves swung open to reveal a hidden chamber. He had a brief impression of a small cement-lined cell before his attention turned to the two matching curs and dark-haired witch who spilled out of the cramped space.</p> <p>\u201cVery good, Caine,\u201d the female cur mocked, obviously overhearing their private conversation.</p><p>\u201cIngrid.\u201d</p><p>Caine\u2019s lip curled in derision as his attention shifted to the male cur. The twins looked like Tweedledum and Tweedle-dummer on steroids with their matching buzz cuts and muscular bodies bulging beneath the olive wife-beaters and cammo pants. He\u2019d always been creeped out by Ingrid\u2019s overly intimate relationship with her twin, and not just because Dolf was a magic-user.</p><p>His opinion of the two hadn\u2019t improved when he discovered the male had managed to get turned into a cur.</p><p>In fact, he\u2019d been downright homicidal. And it was only because the cur had gone into hiding he hadn\u2019t given in to his impulse to rid the world of his perverted presence.</p><p>\u201cAnd Dolf,\u201d he sneered. \u201cI should have known there wouldn\u2019t be one without the other.\u201d</p><p>The male shrugged, the crystal hung around his neck glinting in the muted overhead light. \u201cDid you think you could keep me in the closet forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have killed you the minute I realized your sister had managed to get you turned.\u201d He covertly shifted to stand between the curs and Cassie. \u201cYou\u2019re a freak of nature.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a freak of nature?\u201d Dolf mocked, folding his arms over his chest. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the pot calling the kettle black, Caine? You\u2019re the one who walked into a cave as a cur and walked out as a Were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ingrid added. \u201cWe\u2019re all agog with curiosity at how you performed that little miracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you lured me here?\u201d</p><p>Without warning, the faux Harley rose from the chair, shaking back her long mane of blond hair. \u201cNo.\u201d The female moved to the side, her gaze seeking Cassie. \u201cYou\u2019re here because the Dark Lord has requested the presence of the prophet.\u201d</p><p>Caine heard Cassie suck in a sharp breath. \u201cYou aren\u2019t my sister,\u201d she accused.</p><p>\u201cObviously not,\u201d Gaius retorted, grimacing with intense relief.</p><p>That was his cue.</p><p>With a surge of power, he shifted back to his true form, grabbing the long satin robe he\u2019d left on the nearby shelf to cover his naked body. Then, smoothing back his raven hair, he turned to meet the wary gazes of the intruders.</p><p>They didn\u2019t look like they should be on the Dark Lord\u2019s most wanted list. The tiny, pale-haired female with her green eyes too big for the heart-shaped face and the surfer boy Were who looked like he should be sunbathing on the nearest beach.</p><p>How had they managed to elude the most skilled trackers in the demon world?</p><p>Then Caine placed a protective arm around the prophet and Gaius caught a glimpse of feral fury smoldering in the blue eyes. The surfer boy would destroy the world to protect the female at his side.</p><p>\u201cShit. Who are you?\u201d Caine muttered in revulsion. \u201cNo, scratch that. What the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>Insulted by the lack of appreciation for his considerable skill, Gaius smoothed his hands down the black satin of his robe. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m continually shocked by the Weres\u2019 lack of manners,\u201d he drawled. \u201cYou are dogs, after all.\u201d</p><p>Caine narrowed his gaze, obviously struggling to accept Gaius\u2019s unusual talents. \u201cLeeches can\u2019t shape-shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have powers beyond your imagination.\u201d</p><p>The Were snorted. \u201cAnd an ego to match.\u201d</p><p>Gaius clenched his teeth, waving his hand at the two curs. He wasn\u2019t going to bicker with a damned dog. Not when he was standing in the wine cellar of the King of Weres. The sooner they were away from St. Louis and back in his lair, the better.</p><p>\u201cGet the seer,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>Caine growled, his eyes glowing with power as he prepared to shift. \u201cOver my dead body.\u201d</p><p>Dolf swiftly shed his clothing, his own eyes flashing the crimson of all curs. \u201cThat can be arranged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you idiots, the Dark Lord wants them taken alive,\u201d Gaius snarled as the air around Ingrid and Dolf shimmered and with the savage sound of popping muscle and bone they shifted into wolves.</p><p>The size of small ponies with pale fur and crimson eyes, they bared their fangs, ignoring Gaius\u2019s sharp reprimand as they kept their attention fixated on Caine.</p><p>Muscle-bound morons. If their lust for violence ruined this opportunity for him to please the Dark Lord and reap his long overdue reward, he was going to have them skinned and nailed to his wall.</p><p>Not that their lack of control seemed to matter. Even as they crouched for an attack, a choking heat filled the cellar and with an explosion of power Caine was shifting. Gaius muttered a curse, watching in horror as the monstrous beast appeared out of the shimmering magic.</p><p>Standing as tall as Gaius even on all four legs, the beast\u2019s head was the size of an anvil and his chest as wide as a small car. Even more unnerving was the ruthless intelligence burning like sapphire fire in his eyes.</p><p>Unlike the curs, Caine wasn\u2019t consumed by his bloodlust. Just the opposite.</p><p>With a frustrating cunning, the Were used his head to herd the reluctant prophet into the cement cell, then blocked the narrow doorway with his large body. There would be no getting to Cassandra without going through Caine.</p><p>Bastardo.</p><p>Gaius took a covert step backward as Ingrid and Dolf charged into the literal jaws of death. He had no intention of getting caught in the fray. Not when he was drained from his shape-shifting, not to mention the effort of mist-walking with two curs and a witch to get to this wine cellar in the first place.</p><p>Instead, he waved an imperious hand toward the witch, who tried her best to hide behind a stone column. \u201cSally.\u201d</p><p>Her feet visibly dragged as she forced herself to move to his side. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He scowled at her petulant tone. \u201cAre you just going to stand here gawking?\u201d</p><p>She sent a wary glance toward the snarling curs who were trying to use the tag-team offense against the larger Were.</p><p>A futile effort.</p><p>Even as one managed to dig their fangs into Caine\u2019s thick fur, he was savagely ripping into the flesh of the other. Of course, the brutal battle did mean he was temporarily distracted.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d Sally demanded, her nose wrinkling as the potent scent of blood saturated the air. Or maybe it was the howls of pain that echoed through the cellar as Caine managed to rip a chunk out of Dolf \u2019s muzzle.</p><p>The two curs were managing to wound the Were, but not without taking a dangerous amount of damage.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a witch, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s too small a space to risk a spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were quick enough to use magic when we first arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a harmless masking spell to disguise our presence in this place,\u201d she reminded him, her gaze deliberately skimming down his tense body. \u201cNot all of us have been . . . neutered.\u201d</p><p>Gaius grasped the bitch by her neck, infuriated by the reminder he\u2019d allowed himself to be stripped of his very essence. Digging his claws into her throat, he yanked her off her feet, holding her so they were eye to eye. \u201cDon\u2019t think you can taunt me, witch,\u201d he hissed, his voice thickening with an accent as ancient as the Roman Empire.</p><p>She grabbed his wrist, her eyes wide with agony. \u201cThe Dark Lord\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill accept my most abject apologies for the death of his conduit and swiftly find another,\u201d he smoothly interrupted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she begged. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly releasing his hold, he allowed Sally to drop to the ground. Her ridiculous pigtails bobbed around her face, which was painted with black liner and lipstick, as she straightened, wiping the blood from her neck.</p><p>\u201cThen make yourself useful and bring me the seer,\u201d he snapped.</p> <p>\u201cAre you mental?\u201d</p><p>Gaius watched the witch\u2019s fear of him being replaced by a flare of panic at being ordered to wade into the gory battle.</p><p>\u201cEven if I could get past her rabid protector, which I couldn\u2019t, she\u2019s a pureblooded Were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can still rip me in half.\u201d</p> <p>He leaned down until they were nose to nose, his power making her flinch. \u201cSo can I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap. I should have just let my mother kill me,\u201d she muttered. \u201cShe, at least, intended to make it quick.\u201d</p><p>Clenching her hands at her sides, Sally grudgingly made her way across the floor, abruptly jumping sideways when a bloody Ingrid went sailing past her to slam into the wine barrels and lay unconscious.</p><p>Gaius shook his head. Things weren\u2019t going well.</p><p>Not that he was particularly surprised. He\u2019d suspected from the beginning that the curs\u2019 confidence that they could defeat a pureblooded Were was more a product of their mutual arrogance than genuine skill.</p><p>But he\u2019d at least hoped they could disable Caine long enough that he could get his hands on the prophet and disappear from the cellar.</p> <p>Now Ingrid was down and out for the count. Dolf was pinned to the ground with the Were\u2019s fangs clamped in a death lock on his throat.</p><p>And the witch was trying to wriggle her way into the narrow cell with all the enthusiasm of a prisoner headed to the gallows.</p><p>The temptation to simply walk away from the unfolding fiasco screamed through him. He could return to his lair and pretend he\u2019d never been near St. Louis. Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t be certain that Caine and Cassandra would do him the service of actually killing the Three Bumbling Amigos. And if one survived, they were bound to squeal to the Dark Lord.</p><p>Then . . .</p><p>He shuddered, unwilling to imagine what might happen. No. He couldn\u2019t run. But he was still too weak to battle an enraged pureblooded Were. So now what?</p><p>Lost in his dark broodings, he was caught off guard when Sally gave a sudden war cry. Or he assumed that\u2019s what it was supposed to be. To be honest, it sounded like a bad imitation of Tarzan.</p><p>Gaius watched in disbelief as the witch darted toward the female Were and grabbed her by the ponytail, giving it a violent tug.</p><p>Had she gone mad?</p> <p>Clearly as baffled as him, the prophet shoved the female away with more confusion than actual fear. Her protector, however, didn\u2019t give a shit what Sally was trying to do and, after giving the unconscious Dolf a toss to land on top of Ingrid, Caine turned his lethal attention to the witch.</p><p>Sally screeched as he snapped his bloody fangs directly at her face, and she charged out of the cell with a speed that was considerably faster than the pace she used going in.</p><p>Nothing quite like having a Were trying to bite off your head to offer a bounce to your step.</p><p>Heading directly toward him, she waved a closed fist in the air. \u201cGet us out of here.\u201d</p><p>He scowled, silently hoping that the rabid Were managed to strike the killing blow.</p><p>Of course, he couldn\u2019t be so lucky.</p><p>Clearly wounded, the animal refused to give in to his bloodlust. Instead, he remained in the doorway, resolutely protecting his companion rather than yielding to his primitive instincts.</p><p>Bastardo.</p><p>Cursing in resignation, Gaius moved to stand beside the mangled curs who were neatly piled next to the shelf. Then, wrapping his fingers around the medallion that hung from a chain around his neck, he waited only long enough for Sally to reach his side before muttering a word of power and surrounding them in mist.</p><p>A spectacular fuck-up from start to finish.</p><p>Caine had a vivid memory of his battle with the two curs. The taste of their blood as he\u2019d ripped out chunks of fur and flesh. The sound of their howls of pain. And the scent of their escalating desperation.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t managed to entirely avoid injury. And while none of his wounds were life-threatening, they were all leaking blood at a rate that was rapidly stealing his strength.</p><p>Grimly ignoring his increasing weakness, he managed to drive away the human witch before his legs collapsed beneath him. His head hit the cement of the floor with enough force to briefly knock him loopy and when he at last managed to clear the fog, it was to discover he\u2019d shifted back to human form and Cassie was kneeling beside his naked body.</p><p>\u201cCaine.\u201d She tenderly brushed the hair from his sweaty forehead. \u201cWe have to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice was hoarse, but he sensed that most of his wounds had sealed shut during his shift. Unfortunately, it would take time to completely heal. Time he wasn\u2019t sure they had.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you,\u201d Cassie murmured, slipping her arm beneath him as he struggled to stand.</p><p>\u201cThe vampire?\u201d he rasped, his blurry gaze searching the seemingly empty cellar.</p><p>\u201cHe disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly allowing Cassie to take the majority of his weight as they stumbled toward the tunnel, he frowned at her vague response. \u201cWhich way did he go?\u201d</p><p>Her arm snaked around his waist as they entered the tunnel, her lavender warmth wrapping around him. He sucked in the sweet scent, hoping to ease his wolf \u2019s rabid fury.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter that he logically understood Cassie was unharmed. Or that there didn\u2019t appear to be any immediate danger. The beast inside him wasn\u2019t going to be satisfied until those who dared attack his female were destroyed.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean he disappeared, disappeared,\u201d she said. \u201cPoof.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. Had the witch managed to befuddle Cassie long enough to make it seem as if they\u2019d disappeared?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThen he has made himself and his companions invisible.\u201d She sent him a challenging glance. \u201cIs that more possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe witch . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was the vampire,\u201d she stubbornly insisted. \u201cHe grabbed an amulet that was hanging around his neck and they all vanished.\u201d</p><p>Christ. His head throbbed as he tried to accept the nasty leech could not only shape-shift, but could appear and disappear in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Just. Freaking. Perfect.</p><p>\u201cThe entire world has gone mad,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Cassie patted his shoulder. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you humoring me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Caine swallowed a sigh, too weak to conjure the proper outrage. In fact, it was taking everything he had just to put one foot in front of the other.</p><p>He clenched his teeth as they slowly made their way to the end of the tunnel, but glancing up at the opening, he was forced to concede defeat. There was no way in hell he was going to be able to leap five feet in the air.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get out until I rest,\u201d he grudgingly admitted.</p><p>Cassie moved so he could lean against the side of the tunnel, her expression one of calm determination. \u201cI\u2019ll go up first and pull you out.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because you\u2019re the male?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cSexist dog.\u201d</p><p>It was an accusation that had never been thrown Caine\u2019s way before. Even when he was a cur he\u2019d preferred women who were strong and independent, with a dangerous edge. Nothing kept a man on his toes like bedding a woman who might rip out your throat if you pissed her off.</p><p>But with Cassie . . .</p><p>He wanted to become the worse sort of clich\u00e9.</p><p>He wanted to build a perfect lair where she would be safe and warm and so comfortable she would never leave.</p><p>He wanted to hunt for their food and then stand guard, offering protection as she eased her hunger.</p><p>He wanted to hold her in his arms as she slept, feeling her soft breath on his neck and her heart beating steadily beneath his hand.</p><p>\u201cI like having you depend on me,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She smiled, moving to place a gentle kiss on his lips. \u201cPartners depend on each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartners,\u201d he breathed, ignoring just how perilously close the word sounded to mates.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Cassie had learned a great deal about patience over the past three decades.</p><p>Being a hostage to a demon lord meant that she\u2019d spent the majority of her life in dank caves. On occasion, she was allowed a television or books to help pass the time, but for the most part she\u2019d had to endure endless days with nothing but her visions to distract her.</p><p>Still, it took all of her skill to urge the testy Caine out of the tunnel, using her strength to boost him up and then over the garbage bin. And then, ignoring his snappish complaints that he wasn\u2019t an invalid, she\u2019d managed to wrestle him to the waiting Jeep, loading him into the passenger seat before sliding behind the steering wheel.</p><p>Trying to hide the lingering weakness from his injuries, Caine wiped the sweat from his brow and sent her a frustrated glare. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hid her smile. He wouldn\u2019t be in such a foul mood if he weren\u2019t healing.</p><p>When he\u2019d first collapsed at her feet she\u2019d been frantic with fear. What if he\u2019d been killed trying to protect her? The mere thought had been like a brutal punch to her gut.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bear the loss.</p> <p>It was that simple.</p><p>Wrenching her thoughts away from the destructive memory, Cassie instead turned to the task at hand. Whether he liked it or not, Caine was still weak and it was going to be up to her to take charge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get us out of here,\u201d she said, nibbling her bottom lip as she concentrated on locating the key that Caine always kept hidden beneath the floor mat and sticking it into the ignition.</p><p>\u201cCan you drive?\u201d Caine demanded.</p><p>The engine roared to life and she studied the knobby thing that she recalled she had to pull down to allow the vehicle to move forward.</p> <p>\u201cHow hard can it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he muttered. \u201cJust wait. I\u2019ll be fine in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>She managed to get into gear and pressed gently on the gas pedal, holding the steering wheel in a death grip as they eased down the dark, empty street.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we were followed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a masking spell that should have dampened our scent,\u201d he said, his hand reaching to brace on the glove box as she began to pick up speed. \u201cBesides, whatever is chasing us can\u2019t be any more dangerous than you behind the wheel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny. I happen to be doing just fine, so sit there and be quiet.\u201d She sent him a chiding glare, only to have her moment of victory ruined as the wheels hit the curb and they took out a stop sign. \u201cOops.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess we\u2019re about to find out if I\u2019m truly immortal.\u201d</p><p>With a sniff, she turned her attention back to the road. \u201cKeep it up and I\u2019ll kick your naked butt out. Maybe Ingrid and her creepy twin will stop by and pick you up.\u201d</p><p>He made a sound of disgust, but obviously accepting he was in no position to complain, he instead pointed toward the side street. \u201cTurn left here.\u201d</p><p>Cassie followed his direction, keeping her speed slow but steady as they headed out of the fringes of St. Louis. Soon they left all signs of town behind, traveling down a gravel road that was flanked by cornfields.</p><p>An hour later Cassie was wondering if she\u2019d bitten off more than she could chew. She hadn\u2019t wrecked, thank the gods, but her muscles were cramped from her nervous tension and her fingers were aching from gripping the steering wheel so tightly.</p><p>\u201cHow much farther?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot far,\u201d Caine assured her. \u201cTake a right at that mailbox.\u201d</p><p>She slowed, turning onto a narrow path that was rough and nearly overgrown with weeds. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p> <p>He straightened in his seat, his power sizzling through the air to assure her that he was nearly fully recovered from his battle. \u201cI have a hidden lair just a few miles north of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many lairs do you have?\u201d</p><p>It spoke of his trust in her that he didn\u2019t even hesitate to answer. \u201cA dozen spread across North America and another six in Mexico.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. That seemed . . . excessive. \u201cWhy so many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always knew that Salvatore would eventually stumble across my trail,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cI needed to be able to disappear no matter where I was.\u201d</p><p>Wise, of course. Being hunted by the King of Weres was a lethal sport. Still, she couldn\u2019t resist teasing him. \u201cAlways prepared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my motto. Just like a Boy Scout.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine you were ever a Boy Scout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he readily agreed, \u201cbut there was a time when I aspired to become an altar boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn altar boy?\u201d She couldn\u2019t disguise her shock. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a life before I was turned into a cur, you know,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>She kept her gaze trained on the narrow path, hoping that nothing darted out of the thick underbrush that had replaced the cornfields. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>He tensed at her request. \u201cIt was so long ago I barely remember.\u201d</p><p>Cassie hesitated. She might be socially inept, but not even she could miss the I-don\u2019t-want-to-talk-about-this vibe he was sending out. Which, of course, only made her more determined to discover what he was hiding. \u201cWhere were you born?\u201d</p><p>She heard his faint sigh. \u201cIn the gutters of Paris in the year 1787.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParis?\u201d She sent him a startled glance. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEyes on the road, pet,\u201d he reprimanded, gently grasping her chin until she was facing straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain. You seem very . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She considered, trying to find the perfect word for his blond good looks, his hint of swagger, and the devilish charm that sparkled in his sapphire eyes. \u201cAmerican,\u201d she at last said.</p><p>\u201cNot surprising.\u201d She felt him shrug. \u201cI was barely thirteen when I signed on as a deckhand to the first ship that would take me. I foolishly thought nothing could be worse than starving in the streets.\u201d</p><p>She had read enough about history to suspect that being a young boy on a ship wasn\u2019t the dashing adventure that the poor kid no doubt hoped it would be. \u201cBut there was?\u201d</p><p>His fingers drummed a restless tattoo on the door handle. \u201cWe\u2019d been out to sea less than a month when the ship was taken by pirates.\u201d</p><p>Oh . . . gods. She slowed the vehicle to a mere crawl. \u201cDid they hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>And that was all he was going to say on the subject, she ruefully acknowledged. Not that she needed the gory details. A young boy in the hands of brutal, lawless pirates . . . it was all very self-explanatory. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The tapping halted as Caine sucked in a slow, deep breath, no doubt battling back the memories of those bleak years of misery. \u201cI survived and eventually they sailed close enough to land for me to risk throwing myself overboard and swimming for shore. I ended up in New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy then I\u2019d lost track, but I think I must have been around seventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo young,\u201d she breathed. \u201cHow did you survive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI begged or stole. Occasionally, I sold my body.\u201d His voice was bland. Too bland. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford pride or morals when you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He reached to brush a stray curl from her cheek. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>Cassie nodded. She\u2019d never been beaten or starved or raped. But she\u2019d been held against her will by one of the most evil creatures to ever touch the world. She knew the toxic combination of anger and frustration and fear at being at the mercy of others. And the strange sense of guilt at not being strong enough to take control of her own destiny.</p><p>\u201cHow long were you in New Orleans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor five years.\u201d He smoothed the curl behind her ear as she kept her gaze on the path, which was becoming increasingly more difficult to see beneath the weeds. \u201cI might have stayed there until I died, but one day I was caught in bed with the wife of the mayor. The bastard put a bounty out on my head, so I thought it might be a good idea to leave Louisiana for a few years.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. It didn\u2019t surprise her at all that he\u2019d been run out of town by a cuckolded husband. What female wouldn\u2019t try to lure him into her bed?</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSt. Louis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>His fingers outlined the shell of her ear before trailing along the line of her jaw. Cassie shivered in anticipation. She hoped his lair was near. Once Caine was fully rested, she intended to have her wicked way with him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I had barely stepped foot in the city when I was attacked by a strange animal. I thought it was going to be the end of my sorry life.\u201d He paused, his hand cupping her nape in a gesture of pure male possession. \u201cInstead it was just the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Caine stroked his fingers down the elegant curve of Cassie\u2019s neck, his thumb lingering on the steady beat of her pulse. A part of him felt . . . raw at having exposed a past that he\u2019d devoted over two hundred years trying to erase from his mind.</p><p>Not that it had ever truly been forgotten, he wryly conceded.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to be a shrink to know that his obsessive search for a way to become a pureblooded Were came from an overwhelming need to climb the evolutionary ladder. He\u2019d spent his entire life at the mercy of others. He\u2019d been determined to become the master, not the slave.</p><p>But a larger part of him was relieved to have unburdened his darkest secrets. It was like lancing a wound that had been festering for far too long.</p><p>A faint smile touched his lips as he studied Cassie\u2019s profile, which was tense with concentration. She\u2019d accepted his confession without judgment or disgust. And for once, he hadn\u2019t been insulted by the knowledge he was being pitied. Her sympathy was as pure and untainted as her heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At last it was the call of a robin that jerked him out of his dangerous preoccupation with his beautiful companion. He swallowed a curse as he glanced toward the overgrown hedge, realizing his distraction had nearly allowed him to drive right past his lair.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>Caught off guard, Cassie stomped on the brake, nearly sending him through the windshield. Wisely, he reached over to shove the gearshift into park and switch off the key.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are we stopping here?\u201d she asked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cMy lair is just beyond the hedge.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cIt\u2019s not a cave, is it?\u201d</p><p>He gave a soft chuckle. \u201cThe house is hidden behind an illusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>Crawling out of the vehicle, Caine was relieved to discover he was nearly healed. A shower, some food, and a few hours of sleep and he would be as good as new. He stretched, getting the kinks out of his muscles before moving around the hood of the Jeep and pulling open the driver\u2019s door. Then, with one smooth motion, he was scooping Cassie out of the seat and cradling her against his naked chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe hexes that guard the house are specifically cast to recognize me,\u201d he warned, halting to place his hand flat against the hedge.</p><p>There was a silvery shimmer in the air that revealed a narrow opening that would be invisible to all but the most powerful demons.</p><p>He stepped past the magical barrier, halting to run a searching gaze over the large, wooden cabin set among the thick trees. It wasn\u2019t nearly as large as many of his lairs, but the simple structure with the A-frame roof and large windows offered a panoramic view of the small pond in back and was fully equipped with every modern convenience as well as Internet service. There were also sturdy cells beneath the house to hold his prisoners and a dozen escape tunnels.</p><p>He continued up the stone pathway, pausing at the foot of the railed porch, placing his hand against the invisible barrier until it briefly parted to allow him to step through.</p> <p>Cassie leaned her head back to send him a puzzled frown. \u201cThere are hexes around the house as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He climbed the wide steps and skirted around the hot tub. \u201cThey\u2019re particularly nasty, so don\u2019t leave the porch unless I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be easier to turn them off?\u201d</p><p>He snorted, pulling open the glass door to enter the living room, which was spotlessly clean. The L-shaped room was paneled in a glossy cedar with an open-beamed ceiling and matching wood floors. A huge stone fireplace consumed one wall and at the back of the room was a staircase leading to the open loft above. Traditional leather furnishings were scattered over the handwoven rugs and priceless Turner oil paintings were framed on the walls instead of the usual mounted animal heads.</p><p>\u201cI could also send an engraved invitation to every demon hunting you and request them to creep up on us while we sleep, but I\u2019d rather not,\u201d he said, crossing the room to enter the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think hexes are going to protect us from the vampire, no matter how nasty.\u201d</p><p>He set her on a stool next to the breakfast bar and folded his arms over his chest. \u201cNo, that\u2019s something we need to discuss.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose, no doubt sensing what he was going to say. \u201cDinner first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCassie . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr we could shower,\u201d she interrupted, the wicked invitation in her eyes making him hard in an instance. \u201cThe last one was fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d He turned to yank the frilly apron off the peg near the stove and wrapped it around his waist to cover his thickening erection. \u201cAre all females born knowing how to manipulate men?\u201d</p><p>She batted her lashes. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvenient.\u201d</p><p>Her dimples flashed, stealing any ability for him to be annoyed. \u201cI truly am hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Let me check the pantry.\u201d He conceded defeat. Or maybe he was just as reluctant as Cassie to discuss what had to come next, he acknowledged as he entered the large pantry and opened the stand-up freezer. He reached for the nearest box. \u201cPizza?\u201d he called out.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He returned to the kitchen, pulling the pizza out of the box. \u201cI\u2019ll get this in the oven, if you\u2019ll set the table.\u201d He slid the pizza on a cooking tray and popped it in the oven. \u201cThe plates are in the cabinet over the sink and the cutlery is in the drawer near the fridge.\u201d</p><p>He was choosing a bottle of wine from the rack on the marble-top counter when he heard her give a choked laugh. Turning, he discovered she\u2019d pulled open the wrong drawer to reveal the skimpy aprons, maid\u2019s uniforms, and edible panties that his playmates enjoyed.</p><p>\u201cDo you keep all you lairs so well stocked?\u201d she asked with an overly innocent smile.</p><p>He moved to shove the drawer shut and yanked open another to pull out two forks and the corkscrew. \u201cSome better than others,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She laughed, moving to collect the plates, and placed them on the breakfast bar along with linen napkins. Then, ignoring his warning growl, she moved to peer into the oven.</p><p>\u201cMmmm.\u201d She sucked in a deep breath. \u201cIt looks odd but it smells yummy.\u201d</p><p>In the process of pouring the wine, Caine glanced toward his companion in surprise. \u201cYou\u2019ve never had pizza?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, moving to stand in front of him, her hands boldly exploring the bare width of his chest. \u201cThere are a lot of things I\u2019ve never tried,\u201d she reminded him, her fingers circling his beaded nipples.</p><p>He choked back a groan, his hands gripping her wrists to halt her bewitching seduction. \u201cKeep that up and we\u2019ll burn down the house. Literally,\u201d he groaned, grimly stepping back to reach for the wineglasses. Christ, this female was going to be the death of him. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>She took the glass he offered, sniffing it with a frown. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very fine Ch\u00e2teau Margaux,\u201d he explained, sipping the delicate bouquet with the appreciation of a true connoisseur.</p><p>Cassie hesitated, watching his obvious enjoyment. Then, taking a reluctant sip, she grimaced as if he\u2019d shoved a lemon down her throat.</p><p>\u201cBleck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBleck?\u201d He lifted his brows in amusement. \u201cIt cost five hundred dollars a bottle.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cIt still is bleck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s an acquired taste.\u201d He moved to gather an oven mitt to take the pizza from the oven, swiftly running a knife through it before returning to divvy up the slices.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to acquire a taste for something that costs a fortune?\u201d Cassie asked as he settled on a stool next to her.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cBecause it costs a fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may have just crawled out of a cave, but even I know that\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He watched as she picked up a slice, studying the chunks of sausage and mushrooms. \u201cBe careful, it\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward, taking a small bite as Caine watched. Her teeth sank into the cheese and sauce, her eyes closing in pleasure. \u201cMmmm.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, attacking his own food with gusto. He\u2019d expended energy at an alarming rate. First to fight off the damned curs and then to heal his wounds. He needed serious calories to regain his full strength.</p><p>\u201cI take it that the pizza meets with your approval?\u201d he asked between bites.</p><p>She demolished her first slice and chewed her way through another. \u201cMuch better than the wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait until you taste my famous lava cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLava?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMolten chocolate paradise.\u201d</p><p>She popped the last of the pizza in her mouth and shoved the plate away. \u201cIt sounds delicious, but not tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold still.\u201d He leaned sideways to brush his thumb over her lower lip. \u201cYou have cheese right . . .\u201d</p><p>He forgot what he was going to say. Hell, he forgot how to think as the feel of her lush lip sent a blaze of heat through his body.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>He\u2019d struggled so hard to leash his driving lust for this female. He wanted to be noble. Chivalrous. Cassie was all that mattered, and he wanted to do what was right for her. Even if it meant denying what he desired with every breath, with every beat of his heart.</p><p>With every fiber of his being.</p><p>Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t get his body on board with the whole Dudley Do-Right plan. It wanted to knock the plates aside and take her right there on the breakfast bar.</p><p>Or against the fridge . . .</p><p>Or...</p><p>As if to add to his torment, Cassie parted her lips to suck his thumb into the warm wetness of her mouth. He jerked, feeling like he\u2019d just been struck by lightning.</p><p>\u201cCassie, don\u2019t,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>She nibbled the tip of his thumb, her eyes darkening with a desire that pulsed deep inside him.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, why not?</p><p>His entire body clenched in agony as he struggled to think past his painful erection.</p><p>A tug\u2014just one little tug\u2014and she\u2019d been in his lap, her legs spread wide and her innocence his for the taking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe have to talk,\u201d he hissed between clenched teeth.</p><p>She shook her head, leaning so close he could feel the heat from her skin. A scalding promise of lavender temptation. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie, listen to me.\u201d He reached to grasp her shoulders, hanging on to the last shreds of coherent thought. \u201cI can\u2019t protect you from the vampire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou already did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know that was nothing but shithouse luck.\u201d His lips twisted with regret. Some hero he was turning out to be. \u201cChrist, I led you straight into the trap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t possibly have known that the vampire could shape-shift.\u201d She lifted her hands to skim them down the bare skin of his arms in a soothing motion. \u201cOr appear and disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason for you to be protected by your sister and their mates,\u201d he forced himself to admit, trying to disguise his bitterness. What did it matter if he couldn\u2019t be the one to protect her? So long as she was safe, he should be satisfied. \u201cThey could make sure that you\u2019re surrounded by enough guards to keep away any danger.\u201d</p><p>She shook off his hands, which held her at a crucial distance, leaning forward until they were nose to nose. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>He shuddered, becoming lost in the drowning emerald of her eyes. \u201cDammit, why do you have to be so stubborn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being stubborn, Caine,\u201d she said softly, her hands shifting to frame his face. \u201cI had a foretelling.\u201d</p><p>And that was that.</p><p>He bit back his protest as his heart sank to his toes. Did he want to be the one protecting Cassie? Hell, yeah. Was the future of the world more important than his pride? Hell, yeah.</p><p>How was he supposed to keep her safe when he didn\u2019t have a clue how to stop the vampire and his trio of doom from attacking whenever they felt the urge?</p><p>He leaned his forehead against hers. \u201cDid this foretelling happen to mention some magical means to keep us from becoming leech food?\u201d</p> <p>She brushed her lips over his mouth. \u201cNo. But we have to return to your lair in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>As far as foretellings went, it could be worse, he wryly conceded. He wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if he were expected to haul her to the nearest hell dimension and fight off an entire army of demons.</p><p>An unnerving shiver of premonition inched down his spine and with a curse, Caine shoved aside all thoughts of looming foretellings, of vamps with crazy-ass abilities, and traitorous curs.</p><p>Just for a few minutes he wanted to be a man alone with the female who set him on fire.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d he rasped, spanning her waist with his hands.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She gave a small shriek as he lifted her to set her on the edge of the bar. Then a slow smile of anticipation curled her lips. \u201cSoon, but not tonight.\u201d</p><p>Rising to his feet, he stepped between her legs and skimmed his hands beneath her shirt.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 8</p><p>Gaius\u2019s lair in Louisiana</p><p>Arriving back at his private lair, Gaius dumped the two unconscious curs on the porch. Then, ignoring the witch\u2019s demands that he wait and listen to her babbling, he headed up the stairs and into the cell holding the human female.</p><p>Still under his enthrallment, she willingly went into his arms, tilting her head to offer her throat for his hungry fangs.</p><p>He drank deeply, desperate to regain his strength. He wasn\u2019t going to share his lair with his unwelcomed comrades while he was on the point of collapse. Which, of course, meant that he was forced to drain the female until she was nothing more than an empty shell that would have to be dumped in the swamps.</p><p>Damn the idiots.</p><p>Dropping the dead female on the floor, Gaius retraced his steps. Someone was going to pay for this screwup. And it wasn\u2019t going to be him.</p><p>Although dawn was nearing, he followed the scents of the curs to the kitchen. He intended to vent his displeasure before seeking his bed for the day.</p><p>Punishment was like a souffl\u00e9. If not served immediately, they both fell flat.</p><p>He entered the kitchen, taking a moment to glance around the narrow room. At one end the walls were lined with a tiled countertop and white painted cabinets. An ancient fridge hummed in the corner and a matching stove was set under a window that overlooked the dilapidated chicken coop.</p><p>At the other end was a small wooden table with matching chairs. Not that there was much to see of the table beneath the huge slab of raw meat the two curs were consuming with gusto. In the corner the witch was perched on a stool, reading from a battered, leather-bound book.</p><p>At his entrance the three froze, smart enough to comprehend that their lives hung in the balance.</p><p>He concentrated on the dim-witted duo. He would have to take greater care with the witch.</p><p>\u201cI trust that the two of you are proud of yourselves?\u201d</p><p>Ingrid flinched, lowering her head in a gesture of subservience. \u201cCaine was a lot stronger than we expected him to be.\u201d</p><p>Gaius moved to stand in the center of the tiled floor. \u201cYou knew he\u2019d become a pureblooded Were.\u201d</p><p>Dolf shifted closer to his sister, his hand lifting to touch the crystal hung around his neck. \u201cYes, but his power isn\u2019t just that of a Were,\u201d he tried to bluff. \u201cI doubt there\u2019s anyone but Salvatore who could beat him in a head-to-head fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA convenient excuse for your failure,\u201d Gaius said, his voice soft. Lethally soft.</p><p>\u201cA convenient excuse?\u201d Dolf \u2019s fingers tightened on the crystal, no doubt wishing he had the nerve to lob a spell in Gaius\u2019s direction. \u201cThat bastard almost killed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly a great loss,\u201d Gaius drawled.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Dolf scowled. \u201cWell, where were you during the battle? I didn\u2019t see you doing anything to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good commander directs his troops. He doesn\u2019t waste his talent by becoming a foot soldier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about convenient,\u201d Ingrid muttered beneath her breath.</p><p>The bitch was dead.</p><p>Her and her perverted brother.</p><p>Gaius clenched his fists, his power slamming through the room with enough force to overturn the table and shatter the overhead light.</p><p>\u201cDo you dare imply that I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d The witch was abruptly standing directly in front of him, her hands held up in a gesture of peace. \u201cSquabbling among ourselves isn\u2019t going to help. What we need is a new plan.\u201d</p><p>Utterly unaware of how close he came to death, Dolf turned the table upright and continued chewing on the bloody slab of meat. \u201cWhat kind of plan?\u201d he demanded between bites. \u201cThere\u2019s no way in hell we\u2019re going to be able to lure the seer and her protector into another trap.\u201d</p><p>Sally shrugged, looking worse for the wear with her black eyeliner smeared and her pigtails drooping. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for a trap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d With an effort, Gaius regained command of his temper and regarded the tiny female with a mocking smile. \u201cDo you intend to wiggle your nose and make them appear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d She reached into her bustier to pull out several golden strands of hair. \u201cAbracadabra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHair?\u201d Gaius rasped.</p><p>\u201cNot just hair. The prophet\u2019s hair.\u201d</p><p>Gaius frowned, recalling Sally\u2019s insane charge toward Cassandra in the cellar. Was that what she\u2019d been doing? Yanking out the female\u2019s hair?</p><p>\u201cAm I supposed to be impressed?\u201d</p><p>Sally smiled. \u201cI can use this to track her.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Dolf was at the witch\u2019s side, his face filled with awe. \u201cYou can scry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Annoyed at being left out of the conversation when he should be in control of it, Gaius pointed a finger toward the witch. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>She paled, swallowing heavily as his displeasure was focused on her. \u201cHaving a part of Cassandra means I can use a spell to locate her.\u201d</p><p>A portion of Gaius\u2019s fury eased. As much as he wanted an excuse to kill his bumbling companions and lay the blame on them for allowing the prophet and her protector to escape, he understood that the Dark Lord might not be in a forgiving frame of mind. In fact, he might just kill Gaius before he could convince him that the fiasco wasn\u2019t his fault.</p><p>\u201cYou can locate her now?\u201d Dolf growled, his eyes glowing crimson.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be any more of an idiot than you have to be, cur,\u201d Gaius snapped.</p><p>The stupid creature scowled. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Gaius waved a hand to slam shut the heavy shutters over the window. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . .\u201d Realization at last managed to penetrate his thick skull. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d Dismissing the fool, Gaius turned his attention to the witch, moving with blinding speed to grab her by the throat and lift her off the floor. \u201cYou will perform this scrying at nightfall,\u201d he commanded, his glare warning that he would rip out her heart if she tried to find the prophet while he was imprisoned by daylight. \u201cNot a moment before, capisce?\u201d</p><p>She struggled to breathe, her eyes wide with fear. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cOh, and I\u2019ll need a new female. Order one off the computer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that\u2014\u201d She squeaked as his fingers tightened, a fraction from crushing her windpipe. \u201cYes, fine.

The wolf inside him remained edgy, needing the comfort of holding this woman in his arms to reassure himself that she was safe. The man . . .</p><p>He needed something far more primitive.</p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>She brushed the hair from his brow, her smile oddly uncertain. \u201cDo you truly think so?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. Was it possible she didn\u2019t realize she was the most gorgeous creature ever to walk the earth? \u201cYou\u2019ve looked in a mirror, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot often. My appearance has never mattered to me.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cNot until now.\u201d</p> <p>His thumbs slid beneath her chin, tilting back her head to meet his curious gaze. \u201cWhy should it matter now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to find me attractive.\u201d</p><p>He growled, his hands cupping her face as his body ached to show her just how damned attractive he found her.</p><p>\u201cYou are exquisite,\u201d he assured her, his voice thick with the need pulsing through his veins. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the shimmer of silver in your hair, or the stunning emerald of your eyes that has bewitched me.\u201d His gaze slid downward. \u201cIt\u2019s not even your hot little body, although that has given me more than one sleepless night.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward to nip the lobe of his ear. \u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>Pleasure jolted through him at the tiny bite, his erection so hard that the mere brush of the ridiculous apron was painful. Christ, he felt like he was going to explode.</p><p>Don\u2019t pounce, Caine. Do. Not. Pounce.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he instead lowered his hand to press his palm over her rapidly beating heart. \u201cThis.\u201d</p> <p>Her brows lifted. \u201cMy heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her arms wrapped around his neck as her eyes melted into pools of emerald. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about these things, but I believe that was the perfect thing to say.\u201d</p><p>He flashed a smug smile. \u201cWas it?\u201d</p><p>She stroked her lips along the line of his jaw. \u201cHmmm.\u201d</p><p>Caine went rigid, a groan wrenched from his throat. \u201cI try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She found a particularly erotic spot just below his jaw, using her tongue to drive him mad with need. \u201cYou certainly do.\u201d</p><p>He muttered a curse, reaching his breaking point. There was more than one way of sharing pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI could try better if you had on fewer clothes.\u201d</p><p>Without missing a beat, Cassie leaned back to hook her hands beneath the bottom of her top and peel it off. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>His breath escaped him on a hiss as she tossed the shirt on the floor, his gaze locked on the sight of her mouthwatering breasts barely concealed by the black lace bra. \u201cIt\u2019s a start,\u201d he managed to choke out.</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d</p><p>Oh. He wanted so much more.</p><p>\u201cLet me help,\u201d he rasped, reaching to pop the button and unzip her jeans before dropping to his knees.</p><p>Ignoring her protests, he gently removed her tennis shoes and tugged off her socks. He lifted her foot to stroke his lips along the line of her arch.</p><p>She gasped, the scent of her arousal spicing the air. \u201cThat tickles.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, nipping the tips of her toes. \u201cSuch sweet little toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh . . . Lord.\u201d</p><p>Grasping the hem of her jeans, he pulled them ruthlessly downward. They dropped on the tiled floor as his hands lifted to worship the pale alabaster skin of her calves.</p><p>\u201cAnd these legs.\u201d His voice was rough with the power of his wolf. \u201cThey were surely made to wrap around me.\u201d</p><p>Her breathy chuckle filled the air. \u201cAnd here I thought they were made to take me from one place to another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are far too lovely for such a mundane task.\u201d</p><p>His kissed a path up the inside of her leg, tilting back his head to savor the sight of her poised above him.</p><p>Wearing nothing more than her lacy bra and matching panties, she perched on the edge of the breakfast bar like a statue of feminine temptation. Her fragile features were flushed with passion and her hair a satin curtain of pale silver that tumbled over her shoulders. But it was the musky scent of her wolf that made his heart slam against his ribs.</p><p>Cassie might not be able to shift, but her beast was telling him that she was ready and eager.</p><p>He swallowed a pained groan, continuing to kiss a path up her leg, taking time to explore the sensitive back of her knee before performing the same service to her other leg. She shivered beneath his light caresses, her fingers gripping the marble top of the bar as he found the sensitive skin of her inner thigh.</p><p>\u201cCaine,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cPatience, pet.\u201d He used his tongue to outline the edge of her panties, breathing deeply of her sweet scent. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to explore. And I intend to taste every . . .\u201d He kissed the icy tattoo just below her belly button. \u201cSatin . . .\u201d He grasped her hips to keep her from squirming as he continued up her flat stomach until he was able to slice through the bow holding her bra together with a sharpened fang. \u201cInch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to explore,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d His tone was distracted as the bra fell away to expose the tender curves of her breasts.</p><p>They were delectable, he decided. Perfectly shaped to fit his palms and tipped by rosy nipples that tightened beneath his heated gaze.</p><p>\u201cAnd I can do whatever I want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want,\u201d he agreed, his head dipping toward the waiting bounty.</p><p>\u201cDo you promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He abruptly paused, sensing he\u2019d just stepped into a trap. Lifting his head, he studied her with a narrowed eye. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, her eyes glazed with need. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I just promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I could do whatever I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should be more specific.\u201d</p><p>A slow, teasing smile curved her lips. \u201cScared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWary,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve told you I won\u2019t take your innocence.\u201d He watched as her expression tightened into stubborn lines.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take something that I give you willingly.\u201d</p><p>His gut twisted. What the hell was she trying to do to him? He was hanging on to his nobility by a thread. A very thin, very fragile thread.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Cassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glowed with an emerald fire. His wolf was on instant alert, sensing the sudden danger in the air.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m too stupid to decide what I want?\u201d</p><p>Okay, so his words hadn\u2019t come out right. He was lucky he could still form a full sentence when his brain had relocated considerably lower in his body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying that you don\u2019t have enough experience to know what you want. That\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>She looked spectacularly unimpressed with his logic. \u201cSo you\u2019d make love to me if I wasn\u2019t a virgin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>He struggled to express his fear that he was taking advantage of her naivete. It was easy for her to become convinced that he was some sort of Prince Charming when she didn\u2019t have a comparison.</p><p>\u201cHow many men have you known in your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, there were a few.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her chin, forcing her to meet his piercing gaze. \u201cBriggs and the demon lord don\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t Briggs\u2019s only accomplice.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI can just imagine the kind of scum who would work with the bastard.\u201d</p><p>She poked her finger into the center of his chest, seemingly annoyed by his dismissal of her potential lovers. \u201cSome were scum, but there were others who were like you.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, offended by her comparison to Briggs\u2019s nasty servants. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She gave him another poke. \u201cThey were decent men who were simply desperate and willing to believe Briggs\u2019s promise he could give them what they most desired.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In a heartbeat, Caine catapulted from who-the-hell-cares about the males in her past to insane jealousy. \u201cAnd you spent time with these men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few.\u201d A reminiscent smile curved her lips, making his wolf snarl in possessive outrage. \u201cThere was a very handsome fairy who used to sneak me chocolate when he visited.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI adore chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fairy,\u201d he muttered. He hated fairies.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then there was a charming vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharming vampire is an oxymoron,\u201d he snapped, deciding he hated leeches even more than he hated fairies.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHe swore he could release me from the demon lord.\u201d</p><p>Lying bastard. The only way to release her from the demon lord was to cut off the creature\u2019s connection to this world. And she still wasn\u2019t completely free if the tattoo on her stomach was any indication. But she must have been tempted.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go with him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I knew I had to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>She planted her hand directly over his heart, her gaze holding his captive. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit.\u201d His eyes slid shut as he leaned forward to rest his forehead against hers. The warm scent of lavender filled his senses, his entire body trembling with the driving need to claim this female in the most basic way possible. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>Her arms wrapped around his neck, her lips brushing against his ear. \u201cTake me to the bedroom, Caine.\u201d</p><p>His nobility died a swift, unmourned death as he plucked her off the breakfast bar and headed out of the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Caine registered Cassie\u2019s soft chuckle as he charged with lightning speed through the living room and up the stairs to the loft. The soft sound brushed over his sensitized skin like a tangible caress, winding him impossibly tighter.</p><p>He was on fire. The desire he\u2019d kept leashed for so long threatening to burn out of control.</p><p>Belatedly realizing the danger, Caine forced himself to slow his pace as he reached the loft. No matter what his instinct, he wasn\u2019t going to take Cassie like an animal in heat.</p><p>If she was willing to offer him the gift of her innocence, then he would offer her the respect she deserved.</p><p>Crossing the polished wood floor, he gently laid her on the bed, which had been hand-carved by the finest craftsmen and matched the armoire tucked in a far corner. The ceiling was open-beamed with a skylight built into the sloping roof that allowed the early morning sunlight to pour over her nearly naked body.</p><p>His heart went crazy, skipping beats and then pounding at a frantic pace, as if trying to catch up for lost time. She was just so stunning. An exquisite work of art made of alabaster and gold and shimmering emerald.</p> <p>He ripped off the ridiculous apron, his aching arousal twitching as he felt her gaze examining the hard length. He paused, searching her expression for any sign of hesitation. Then she smiled, holding out her arms in welcome, and he was lost.</p><p>With a leap he landed on top of her, pressing her slender body into the mattress covered by a hand-stitched quilt. \u201cLast chance, pet,\u201d he warned, his voice a low rumble.</p><p>She rubbed against him, her hands clutching at his shoulders. \u201cEnough talking,\u201d she protested, lifting her head to nip his bottom lip.</p><p>A growl rumbled in his throat. \u201cYou want action?\u201d</p><p>Her tongue peeked out to soothe the tiny wound she\u2019d made. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>Caine didn\u2019t need any further urging. Swooping down his head, he was kissing her, a forceful demand that hinted at the endless nights he\u2019d spent tormented by his need for her.</p><p>Later there would be time for soft seduction and hours of foreplay. For now he allowed the delicious sensations to flood through him, drowning any lingering concern.</p><p>Gently parting her soft lips with the tip of his tongue, he plunged into the moist temptation of her mouth, groaning at her sweet taste. He heard Cassie give a small sound between a gasp and a moan, her nails biting into his skin.</p><p>The tiny pain made his back arch in response, his erection pressing against the soft skin of her stomach. On some level he was aware of the small tattoo that radiated a brutal chill just below her belly button, but that was a worry for another time.</p><p>In this moment he was far more interested in the exquisite heat blasting through him. He eased his kiss, moving to trace a soft trail down the line of her jaw. \u201cI should have brought the wine with us,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She brushed her hands down his back. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be intoxicating to lick it off your beautiful body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy body?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at her puzzled tone. \u201cHere.\u201d He nuzzled the hollow at the base of her throat. \u201cAnd here.\u201d He kissed down the line of her collarbone, his hands cupping her breasts. Her skin quivered beneath his light touch, her breath coming out in a small explosion as his lips found the tip of her tight nipples. \u201cYeah, especially here.\u201d</p><p>She shifted beneath him, one leg wrapping around his hips to allow him to settle more firmly against her feminine core. They groaned in unison.</p><p>\u201cI feel intoxicated enough without the wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what you like, Cassie,\u201d he rasped, teasing her nipple with the tip of his tongue. \u201cTell me what feels good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d she moaned. \u201cThat feels so good.\u201d</p><p>He captured the nipple between his teeth, biting it just hard enough to have her gasping in pleasure, her hips pressing up in a silent plea for release.</p><p>Oh yes. No matter how vivid his fantasies, nothing could compare to the sensation of her slender body spread beneath him, her hands cupping his ass as her soft pants filled the air.</p><p>Continuing to caress her breasts, Caine allowed his fingers to trail downward, following the curve of her waist. He took time to appreciate the delicate flare of her hips before moving to the soft skin of her inner thigh.</p><p>He felt her tremble as he stroked tiny circles that brushed near her clit without touching her most sensitive flesh. Up and down he moved, smiling as she gave a choked curse.</p><p>\u201cCaine, please.\u201d</p><p>Her harsh plea sent a shudder of need through him. Giving her nipple a last lick, he surged up to bury his face in her neck.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ready?\u201d he whispered, his body trembling as his canine fangs erupted from his gums at the scent of her arousal. \u201cMy hunger for you is too great. I\u2019m not sure how gentle I can be.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, she reached between them to press his hand to the wet slit between her legs. \u201cDo I feel ready to you?\u201d</p><p>Caine hissed, his finger sliding into her body as his thumb sought out the source of her pleasure. Slowly, he stroked his finger deeper and deeper, listening to her short gasps as she spiraled toward release.</p><p>\u201cNo more teasing,\u201d she moaned in a strangled voice, her hands grasping his hips.</p><p>He quivered, his hunger so intense it filled the air with pulses of heat.</p><p>\u201cCassie,\u201d he growled, his voice oddly strained.</p><p>\u201cNow, Caine,\u201d she commanded, her other leg shifting to wrap around his hips, blatantly demanding his penetration.</p><p>Pulling back far enough to meet her gaze, which glowed with the hunger of her wolf, Caine grabbed her fingers, wrapping them around his hard shaft to guide him to the entrance to her body.</p><p>His teeth clenched at the feel of her slender fingers circling his cock, his balls tightening as she gave him a slow, destructive stroke.</p><p>Christ. He was close.</p><p>Too close.</p><p>Gently tugging her hand away, he pushed his hips forward, breeching her with the head of his shaft. He paused one last time, giving her the opportunity to protest. Even if it killed him.</p><p>When she lifted her head to sink her teeth into his neck, Caine lost all ability to think.</p><p>With a choked howl, he grasped her hands and jerked them over her head, pressing them against the quilt as he slowly forged a path into her tight body, breaking through her virginity with barely a hesitation.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed against his neck, her legs tightening around his waist. \u201cOh, God, Caine.\u201d</p><p>His eyes squeezed shut as he struggled to rein his savage desire. He wasn\u2019t going to pound his way to paradise. Not when slow and steady was so much sweeter.</p><p>With care he pulled back, bending his head to the side. \u201cYour teeth, Cassie,\u201d he managed to rasp. \u201cI want to feel them on my neck.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate as she sank her teeth back into the base of his throat, sending a jolt of pure adrenaline through his system.</p><p>\u201cCassie. Gods.\u201d</p><p>He surged back into her slick heat, his harsh groans matching her soft sighs as he found a steady pace, his hips rolling upward with each thrust.</p><p>Her teeth clenched harder on his neck as she lifted to meet his quickening onslaught, her nails raking across his back.</p><p>He forgot to breathe, his heart thundering in his chest. Deep inside, his wolf howled in primitive satisfaction.</p><p>This was more than sex. More than a passing hookup with a female who stirred his lust.</p><p>This was soul-deep and forever.</p><p>The terrifying thought barely had time to form when he felt Cassie stiffen and then shiver beneath t2e force of her orgasm. The sensation of her convulsing around his erection toppling him over the edge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a shout of release, Caine gave one last thrust, his eyes squeezing shut as the profound bliss exploded through his body.</p><p>Cassie slowly drifted awake, heaving a sigh of contentment at the sensation of Caine\u2019s warm arms wrapped around her and the steady beat of his heart beneath her ear.</p><p>Mmm. This was how every day should start. A warm bed, a delectable male wrapped around her, and not one demon lord, vampire-on-steroids, or crazed cur in sight.</p> <p>Or at least she was assuming there were no lurking enemies. Just to make sure, she forced open her eyes to cast a quick glance around the room. Nope. She was all alone with her delicious, delectable, divine lover.</p><p>Yes, lover.</p><p>Finally.</p><p>A smug smile curved her lips as the memories from the previous night flooded through her. Once she\u2019d managed to convince the stubborn Were that she wasn\u2019t some fragile treasure he had to protect, even from herself, he\u2019d taught her the true meaning of desire.</p><p>Several times.</p> <p>Breathing in the rich scent of his musk, Cassie tilted back her head. She wasn\u2019t surprised to find Caine studying her with a slumberous gaze. She\u2019d already sensed he was awake. What surprised her was the excited flutter of her heart even after hours of decadent sex.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he murmured, his attention shifting over her shoulder to glance at the clock on the dresser. \u201cOr I suppose I should say good afternoon.\u201d</p><p>She stretched, too lazy to turn her head. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust past two.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been out nearly five hours? Amazing.</p><p>About to admit she never slept so well alone, Cassie belatedly noticed Caine\u2019s recently shaved face and the scent of soap that clung to his bronzed skin.

Hurt her? \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t always gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d A faint blush touched her cheeks. Not at the memory of his aggressive lovemaking.

But at the recollection of her wild response. \u201cWe both know my screams weren\u2019t from pain.\u201d</p><p>A growl rumbled in his chest, his eyes darkening with a ready heat. \u201cDon\u2019t give me encouragement unless you plan on spending the next several hours in this bed.\u201d</p><p>With a wicked smile, she lifted her hand to brush the pale hair off his forehead. \u201cIs that a promise?\u201d Cassie felt his body tense at her husky words, the scent of his musk laced through the air.</p><p>\u201cYou, Cassandra, are a very dangerous female.\u201d</p><p>Her smile widened as she inwardly gloated. She liked knowing how easily she could rouse his desire. \u201cDangerous is good,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s much better than loony.\u201d</p><p>His brows snapped together, as if he were angered by her confession. \u201cDon\u2019t ever say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t say it, other people do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if they want to avoid a nasty death,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>She blinked at his vehemence. He truly was upset. Then, with a wistful smile, she allowed her fingers to smooth down the angular line of his cheekbone. \u201cMy protector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor all eternity.\u201d</p><p>They both froze as his words seemed to hang in the air. Like a live grenade that might explode if anyone moved.</p><p>Did he say eternity?</p><p>Only mates stayed together for an eternity. Or at least that\u2019s what she\u2019d always believed.</p><p>So was he implying they were more than temporary lovers?</p><p>\u201cCaine?\u201d</p><p>With one fluid movement, Caine was tossing aside the quilt and sliding off the bed. As if he was hoping to distract her.</p><p>And it worked.</p><p>No big shocker, of course. What female could think clearly when she was offered such a tempting view?</p><p>Caine was naked male perfection.</p><p>Lean, flawlessly chiseled muscles. A wide chest and wider shoulders. Smooth, bronzed skin. And a fully erect arousal that would make any man proud.</p><p>And any woman sigh in anticipation.</p><p>Ignoring her appreciative glance, Caine leaned down to tuck her hair behind her ear in a tender gesture. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>Cassie pressed her hand to her stomach as it growled on cue. \u201cStarving,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable.\u201d He smiled with sinful amusement, his fingers trailing down her jaw. \u201cYou expended a lot of energy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, turning to cross the floor and pull a pair of faded jeans and white T-shirt from the dresser. \u201cHave a shower while I make us some breakfast,\u201d he said, quickly dressing. \u201cThere are clean clothes that should fit you in the closet.\u201d</p><p>Sitting up, Cassie regarded him with a narrowed gaze. \u201cFemale clothes?\u201d</p><p>The sapphire eyes twinkled and Cassie abruptly realized that the edge in her voice must be jealousy.</p><p>How odd.</p><p>\u201cMost of them have never been worn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>He shoved his feet in a pair of sneakers and then moved to place a lingering kiss on her forehead. \u201cLater, I\u2019ll go to the Jeep and get your suitcase,\u201d he promised.</p><p>The disturbing sensation eased at his soothing touch. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome down to the kitchen when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>She watched him stroll out of the loft, a smile of satisfaction curving her lips. Who would ever have believed it? After thirty years of being crapped on by fate, she\u2019d at last hit the jackpot.</p><p>And what a jackpot he was.</p><p>A pity she couldn\u2019t halt time. She couldn\u2019t imagine anything better than spending the rest of eternity alone with Caine in this isolated cabin.</p><p>Taking a few minutes to wallow in her rare sense of happiness, Cassie at last forced her lethargic body out of bed and into the shower. She truly was hungry. And besides, she didn\u2019t want to spend one unnecessary minute away from Caine.</p><p>Once clean, she dried off in front of the window that overlooked the pond. The sun was shimmering on the water and the wildflowers danced in the breeze. A perfect invitation for a picnic, she decided.</p><p>With a smile of anticipation, Cassie pulled on a pair of khaki shorts and a scoop-neck white shirt. She shoved her feet into her own sneakers and combed her hair into a ponytail. Once presentable, she headed for the stairs.</p><p>A step away from the door, however, she staggered to a halt, her balance precarious as a vision slammed through her with shocking force.</p><p>She hissed in shock.</p><p>Usually, the visions flowed through her to appear as a floating hieroglyphic that she could decipher later. Sometimes she understood them. Sometimes she didn\u2019t. But only rarely did she actually see her predictions in full-fledged living color as they seared through her mind.</p><p>Pressing her palms to her aching temples, she watched in confusion as the vision of herself came into focus. She was standing alone in the middle of a white fog that was so thick she couldn\u2019t see through it. She sensed there was something lurking in the fog. Something so powerful that its mere presence was flaying the skin from her body.</p><p>Oh, Lord. She whimpered in pain. She wanted to curl into a tiny ball and pray the lurking thing wouldn\u2019t notice her. But she couldn\u2019t. The scent of Caine was drifting through the air and she knew she had to reach him.</p><p>He was in trouble.</p><p>Deep trouble.</p><p>Then, as if on cue, the fog slowly parted.</p><p>She cried out in shock as she caught sight of Caine. Oh, please blessed mother, no.</p><p>He was lying in the mist, his body twisted and deformed as if he\u2019d been caught midshift, trapped between human and wolf. Impulsively she stepped toward him, only to come to a halt as he bared his fangs in warning.</p><p>Only then did she notice the sapphire eyes were filled with a feral insanity.</p><p>He didn\u2019t recognize her.</p><p>The thought had barely flashed through her mind when he was awkwardly shoving himself upright, his savage howl echoing through the creepy fog. Frightened, Cassie backed away.</p><p>Precisely the wrong thing to do.</p><p>Lost in the savage instincts of his wolf, Caine tracked her movements with the cunning of a predator. In this moment she was his prey.</p><p>And he was preparing to attack.</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t fear for herself. She\u2019d always assumed she was destined for an early grave. She was, after all, the only known prophet. The most desired and feared creature in the world.</p><p>No. She\u2019d prepared for years to die. But if Caine came to his senses and realized what he\u2019d done . . .</p><p>A gut-wrenching dread lodged in her heart. He would never, ever be able to forgive himself.</p><p>Or worse, what if he was stuck in that hideous state between wolf and man? What if he was forever trapped as a monster? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As if sensing her fear, Caine crouched, no doubt excited by the scent of her panic. But even as she braced for the impact, the vision vanished as abruptly as it had arrived.</p><p>Reeling in reaction, Cassie fell to her knees, her head bowed with the sheer horror of what she\u2019d been shown.</p><p>Oh, gods, she had to stop this.</p> <p>But how?</p><p>She didn\u2019t know where the two of them had been, or how they\u2019d been taken, or even what evil had been lurking just out of sight.</p><p>\u201cThink, Cassie, think,\u201d she muttered, wiping away the useless tears.</p><p>Though she didn\u2019t know where they\u2019d been, she sensed that it would happen soon. And if they were both in the strange fog, then they\u2019d obviously been together when they were taken.</p><p>So . . . she had to make sure they weren\u2019t together.</p> <p>Ever.</p><p>She ignored the brutal pain that sliced through her at the mere thought of spending the rest of her life without Caine. It would be a barren, lonely existence, but she could survive if she knew that Caine was alive and well.</p><p>And more importantly, she ignored the whispered warning that she\u2019d never been able to alter the future. No matter how often she tried.</p><p>This time it would be different.</p><p>It had to be different.</p><p>With an effort she forced herself to straighten, her knees still weak and her head aching. She would worry about the future later. For now, she had to get away from Caine.</p> <p>Something that was easier said than done.</p><p>She was under no illusion that she could simply give him a kiss good-bye and stroll away. Caine had declared himself her protector and nothing short of death was going to pry him from her side.</p><p>Which meant she would have to slip away.</p><p>Her gaze turned toward the window. Although she couldn\u2019t shift, she was still as strong and as fast as other Weres. If she jumped out the window and took off at top speed there was a fifty/fifty shot she could reach the Jeep before Caine realized she was trying to escape.</p><p>Of course, she\u2019d only have one shot.</p><p>Caine would chain her to the wall if she failed.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, she was actually in the process of crossing the floor when she was struck by a sudden thought.</p><p>Crap. She couldn\u2019t just leave. The hexes surrounding the cabin would fry her if she left the house alone.</p> <p>Which meant she\u2019d have to find a way to have Caine escort her past the barriers and then escape.</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut in frustration. Yeah. No problem.</p><p>\u201cCassie?\u201d</p><p>The sound of Caine\u2019s voice calling from the kitchen jerked Cassie out of her dark broodings. First things first. She had to convince Caine to leave the house. She would worry about escaping later.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d she called, heading reluctantly down the stairs and stepping into the kitchen.</p><p>She was greeted by the scent of waffles fresh from the toaster and warm syrup. Her stomach rumbled in approval, even as her heart sank to her toes at the sight of Caine mixing frozen orange juice into a pitcher.</p><p>It all looked so wondrously homey. Like a scene from her deepest fantasies.</p><p>Caine turned at her entrance, instantly sensing her distress despite her forced smile. Setting aside the pitcher, he moved across the tiled floor, grasping her hands in a tight grip. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. She might be the world\u2019s worse liar, but this was for Caine. It was her turn to step up to the plate and do whatever was necessary to protect him. Just as he\u2019d always protected her.</p><p>\u201cI had a vision,\u201d she admitted, sticking to the truth for as long as possible.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he muttered, the contentment leeching from his magnificent eyes. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Her heart nearly shattered at his ready nod. He was prepared to follow her no matter what new disaster she was leading him into. Without question, without hesitation. How had she ever earned such steadfast loyalty? \u201cDo you know where we\u2019re headed?\u201d</p><p>She forced her eyes to meet his searching gaze, fiercely reminding herself that Caine\u2019s life hung in the balance.</p><p>\u201cWest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d His brows lifted, but he looked more confused than suspicious. Thank the gods. \u201cJust west?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we at least have time for breakfast?\u201d</p><p>Say no, a voice whispered in the back of her head.</p><p>The sooner she was away from Caine, the sooner she could hope she\u2019d managed to avoid his fate. But, the need to spend just a few extra moments in his company overcame her common sense.</p><p>Surely a half an hour wouldn\u2019t make any difference?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreakfast in bed?\u201d he murmured, his fingers brushing over her cheek. Then, noting her strained expression, he gently tapped the end of her nose. \u201cCome on, your waffles are getting cold.\u201d</p><p>Squashing her prick of guilt at her selfish need to savor just one meal with the man who\u2019d rescued her from hell and filled her heart with joy, Cassie joined him at the breakfast table.</p><p>They ate in near silence, but Cassie was content to absorb the pleasure of his leg pressed against hers, and the delicious musk of his wolf that spiced the air. These memories were going to have to last her a lifetime and she intended to enjoy every moment.</p><p>All too swiftly they were finished with the waffles and Caine had cleared away their dishes.</p><p>With an effort, Cassie crushed the urge to find some excuse to linger and instead allowed herself to be carried out the front door and down the walk to the waiting Jeep. She had already dared fate enough. She had to get away from Caine before destiny took matters out of her hands.</p><p>Settling her in the seat, Caine moved to take his place behind the wheel. Then, with an ease that made her shake her head in rueful resignation, he had the vehicle shifted into gear and they were hurtling down the dirt path with a steady speed.</p><p>Her lips parted to tease that he would have to give her driving lessons so the next time she had to save his butt she wouldn\u2019t embarrass herself, only to snap shut as she remembered there would be no next time.</p><p>She clenched her hands, something deep in her heart slowly withering and dying.</p><p>Was it hope?</p><p>Stoically, she watched the overgrown meadows being replaced by well-manicured fields, the road widening to a paved street that eventually became a four-lane highway.</p><p>Beside her she felt Caine\u2019s concerned glances, while inside she was increasingly tormented by the urgent need to travel north to Caine\u2019s lair outside of Chicago. She\u2019d known for weeks she would eventually have to return to the farmhouse. Now it was an imperative demand she wasn\u2019t going to be able to fight for much longer.</p><p>Still, she\u2019d hoped to lead Caine as far west as possible. Once she managed to escape him, she wanted him convinced that she would be fleeing toward Kansas City. It would hopefully give her the necessary time to disappear before he could pick up her scent.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quiet.\u201d Caine at last broke the thick silence.</p><p>She turned to meet his worried gaze, pasting a fake smile to her face. \u201cI\u2019m distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together, trembling with the effort to deny the powerful compulsion to leap from the Jeep and head north.</p><p>\u201cCan we pull off here?\u201d she rasped, pointing toward the narrow road just ahead.</p><p>He automatically exited, his brow furrowed as he studied the empty parking lot that framed a small park with public bathrooms and a handful of picnic tables.</p><p>He pulled to a halt beneath a shade tree, his eyes skimming the park in confusion. \u201cA rest stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something in the woods.\u201d She pointed toward the distant line of trees. \u201cSomething you need to see.\u201d</p><p>He jerked his gaze toward her, his jaw clenching as if sensing he wasn\u2019t going to like what she had to say. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>She drank in the bronzed beauty of his face, memorizing every angle, every line and curve until it was branded on her heart.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to stay here.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, returning his gaze to the empty countryside. \u201cI don\u2019t like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cIf something attacks I\u2019ll be too far away to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing will attack. It\u2019s daylight.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look reassured. In fact, he looked downright pissy. \u201cThere are more dangers than just leeches.\u201d</p><p>She trembled, struck by another urgent need to be traveling north. \u201cPlease, Caine.\u201d</p><p>Clearly sensing her distress, Caine muttered a curse and reached beneath his seat to pull out a small handgun. \u201cHere.\u201d He pressed the weapon into her hand and wrapped her fingers around the grip. \u201cShoot anything that moves.\u201d</p><p>Knowing that this was most likely her last moments with the man who would haunt her for the rest of eternity, she leaned forward to brush her lips softly over his mouth.</p><p>\u201cTake care of yourself,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He nipped her bottom lip before pulling back with a rueful smile. \u201cI\u2019d rather take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Oh . . . Lord. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She battled back the tears as she pushed him away. \u201cYou have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he sighed.</p><p>With one last scan to make sure the park was empty, Caine crawled out of the Jeep and took off at a swift trot. She waited until he reached the edge of the woods, knowing he would glance back before disappearing from view.</p><p>Once certain he wasn\u2019t going to come charging back, Cassie hastily clambered into his seat and put the Jeep into neutral. She clutched the steering wheel, gnawing her bottom lip as she resisted the urge to stomp on the gas. Caine would hear the change in the engine even from such a distance.</p> <p>Refusing to glance back, Cassie concentrated on keeping a straight line as the Jeep rolled with excruciating sluggishness across the parking lot and back onto the access road. Only when she was near the interstate did she offer a silent plea for the fates to keep Caine safe, and shoved the gearshift into drive, taking off with enough force to lay rubber.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Despite being shifted into his wolf form, Caine could feel the panic claw through him as he reached the end of Cassie\u2019s trail and realized that it had doubled back.</p><p>God dammit. He\u2019d wasted nearly an hour running along the highway, desperate to catch up with the Jeep and massacre the bastards who\u2019d kidnapped his female.</p><p>Now he was forced to halt and reassess his limited choices. With a snarl of impatience, he padded behind a hay bale and shifted, careful to remain hidden from the passing cars. For whatever stupid reason, humans were far more shocked to catch sight of a naked man standing in a field than a massive wolf.</p> <p>Sucking in deep, shuddering breaths, he wiped the sweat from his brow and tried to think through his mind-numbing fear.</p><p>When he\u2019d first heard the squeal of tires he\u2019d been terrified that Cassie had accidentally knocked the Jeep out of gear. He\u2019d burst out of the woods expecting to see her driving in circles around the parking lot or, gods forbid, crashed into a tree.</p><p>What he hadn\u2019t expected was to find she was gone.</p><p>Just . . . gone.</p><p>The parking lot was empty, with no scent of any intruders and no sign of a struggle.</p><p>For long minutes he\u2019d stood in the center of the parking lot, baffled.</p> <p>If Cassie had been attacked, why hadn\u2019t she fired the gun? Or at least screamed for help?</p><p>And why couldn\u2019t he catch their scent?</p><p>Then, with a growl of sheer fury he\u2019d shifted and gone in pursuit of Cassie\u2019s rapidly fading trail.</p><p>What the hell did it matter who or how or why Cassie had been kidnapped? All that mattered was finding her before she could be hurt.</p><p>Now he had to wonder if he\u2019d been deliberately led on a wild-goose chase.</p><p>And if he had, what now?</p><p>He was debating the question when there was a faint rustle directly behind him. With a snarl he whirled around, his teeth bared in warning.</p><p>The sight of the tiny demon with oblong black eyes and fair hair pulled into a tight braid standing in the hay field did nothing to soothe his desire for blood.</p> <p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, me.\u201d Yannah smoothed her hands down her pristine white robe, her lips pinched in disapproval. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know why I bother. I specifically warned you not to be separated from the prophet. And yet, here you are with Cassie nowhere in sight.\u201d</p><p>Why the aggravating . . . bitch.</p><p>Caine clenched his hands, too infuriated to care he was completely nude. Or that the hay bale was poking his bare ass.</p><p>Instead, he was savagely reminding himself this demon had enough power to destroy him with a thought. And as much as he might want to shake the tiny creature until her pointed teeth rattled, he couldn\u2019t rescue Cassie if he was rotting in hell.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I deliberately left her?\u201d he demanded. \u201cShe disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Yannah snorted. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how you were separated, only that you find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think I\u2019m trying to do?\u201d</p><p>Yannah shrugged. \u201cIt looks to me like you\u2019re running in circles.\u201d</p><p>Caine tensed. How the hell had she known he was running in circles? Unless . . .</p><p>\u201cHave you been spying on us? Do you know where she is?\u201d He stepped forward, glaring down at the tiny heart-shaped face. \u201cHas she been kidnapped? Is she hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo and no and no and no.\u201d</p><p>He trembled, his wolf straining to be released to return to his hunt. With every passing second Cassie\u2019s scent faded a little more and the beast didn\u2019t give a shit that this demon might or might not hold information that could help them find their female.</p><p>\u201cThen what happened to her?\u201d</p><p>The black eyes widened. \u201cIt would seem that she dumped you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDumped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that how you say getting rid of an unwanted partner?\u201d she asked with faux innocence. \u201cDump, chuck, give the ol\u2019 heave-ho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got the meaning,\u201d he ground out. \u201cI just don\u2019t know why you think Cassie would dump me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe drove off and left you at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>Caine hissed, refusing to allow the smallest suspicion to taint his mind.</p><p>It would kill something inside him if he thought Cassie deliberately abandoned him.</p><p>\u201cShe must have been kidnapped,\u201d he said with more force than necessary, reminding himself of their passionate night together.</p><p>There was no way a woman would so eagerly give her innocence to a man she intended to discard at the first opportunity. Hell, they\u2019d still be in that bed if it hadn\u2019t been for the damned vision.</p><p>Caine sucked in a sharp breath, realizing he could pinpoint the precise moment that Cassie had changed from his sweetly generous lover to a distant stranger who could barely look him in the face.</p><p>Clearly sensing his revelation, Yannah narrowed her dark eyes. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA prophecy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d With a muttered curse he shoved his fingers through his tangled hair. \u201cI knew something was wrong. Gods. I should have forced her to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Yannah snapped impatient fingers. \u201cYou can wallow in self-pity later.\u201d</p><p>His low growl rumbled through the air. \u201cYou are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharmingly blunt?\u201d she interrupted with a hint of warning. He was nearing her line in the sand. They both knew he didn\u2019t want to step over it.</p><p>With an effort, he leashed his frustration. \u201cDo you know where Cassie is going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d He scowled at the ridiculous accusation. \u201cIf I knew, I wouldn\u2019t be running in circles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you were all brawn and no brain.\u201d Yannah shook her head with profound disappointment. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re so pretty.\u201d</p><p>His hand dropped, his fingers curling into a tight fist. He wanted to hit something. Or better yet, kill something.</p><p>\u201cGod dammit, we\u2019re wasting time,\u201d he rasped. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know.\u201d She held up a hand as his lips parted with an angry protest. \u201cI only know that you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re making my head ache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must have said something,\u201d Yannah said, utterly unapologetic. \u201cThink.\u201d</p><p>Caine bit back his angry words and forced himself to recall what Cassie had said about her vision. For all he knew this Yannah was a crazy-ass demon who was following him around to make his life hell. But if there was even the slightest chance she could help him locate Cassie, then he\u2019d jump through hoops and dance the mambo if that\u2019s what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cAll she said was that she had a vision and we had to travel west.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust west?\u201d Yannah appeared troubled. \u201cThat\u2019s a little vague.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>A choking power filled the air, wrapping around Caine with enough strength to warn Yannah could easily crush his every bone.</p><p>\u201cCareful, Were.\u201d</p><p>He waited until the power had receded enough he could draw in a breath. Only when he was reasonably confident he wasn\u2019t about to become a mangled corpse did he speak. \u201cShe\u2019d obviously decided to take off before . . .\u201d He lost track of his words as he actually considered the time line. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He stared blindly over the recently mowed field, mentally walking through the morning from the moment that Cassie woke in his arms.</p><p>\u201cShe started acting strange after her vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vision must have convinced her that she had some task she had to deal with alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Yannah waved an impatient hand. \u201cQuite possibly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when she said we had to travel west she must have been trying to throw me off her trail.\u201d He frowned, not entirely satisfied with his logical conclusion. \u201cBut why the elaborate scheme? Why not sneak away from me while I was cooking breakfast?\u201d He sorted through his chaotic thoughts, brutally ignoring his snarling wolf, which was nearing the edge of a meltdown. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so stupid,\u201d he at last muttered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yannah flashed her pointed teeth. \u201cYou\u2019ll get no argument from me.\u201d</p><p>He ignored the insult. \u201cShe had to get past the hexes.\u201d</p><p>The demon blinked in confusion. \u201cWhat hexes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe ones I had placed around my lair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were holding her prisoner?\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed in outrage. \u201cNo, I damned well was not holding her prisoner. I was trying to protect her. In case you haven\u2019t noticed she has more than a few demons desperate to get their hands on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all too aware of her danger. Which is why you must find her.\u201d The demon poked a finger into his belly. \u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>Caine froze in fear, detecting the worry that Yannah was attempting to disguise. \u201cYou know something,\u201d he accused. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI only sense that she\u2019s being hunted.\u201d She gave him another poke. \u201cThink, Caine. Where did she go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he roared.</p><p>Pacing in a tight circle, he wracked his mind for any clue he might have overlooked. Cassie rarely spoke of the future. Who could blame her? Her visions were a crippling burden that she wanted to forget, not dwell on.</p><p>But a niggling voice in the back of his mind whispered that she had said . . . what?</p><p>Something he should remember.</p><p>He continued his pacing, ignoring Yannah\u2019s dark glare and the distant sound of passing cars as he fiercely tried to recall his every conversation with Cassie over the past week.</p> <p>Then suddenly he had a vivid image of Cassie perched on the edge of the breakfast bar as the scent of pizza filled the air.</p><p>\u201cDid this foretelling happen to mention some magical means to keep us from becoming leech food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But we have to return to your lair in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Soon, but not tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou know?\u201d Yannah demanded.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to my lair near Chicago.\u201d</p><p>The demon studied him with a frown, as if trying to decide whether or not he could be trusted. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Without warning, she reached out to clamp her fingers around his wrist, her grip shockingly strong. \u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo?\u201d</p><p>Her smile sent a sizzle of alarm down his spine. \u201cHang on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Caine tried to pull free of the nutty female. Who knew what she was plotting? But it was too late. Before his eyes the world simply melted away, leaving him surrounded by a black sense of nothingness. \u201cOh, shit.\u201d</p><p>Caine\u2019s lair outside Chicago</p><p>Dusk was painting the sky in vibrant shades of violet and amber as Cassie pulled to a halt near the two-story brick farmhouse. With a shaky sigh, she turned off the engine and allowed her trembling hands to fall into her lap.</p><p>It\u2019d been a hellacious trip.</p><p>Not only because she\u2019d spent the past six hours struggling not to kill hapless motorists as she\u2019d driven to this remote location, but she\u2019d been on constant edge that Caine might somehow manage to pick up her trail and follow her.</p><p>Now that she was here, however, with no sign of the Were who\u2019d become a vital part of her life, she felt . . . what? Hollow. As if she was a mere shell that was going through the motions.</p><p>Where was Caine? Was he still searching for her? Perhaps tormenting himself with blame that she\u2019d disappeared?</p><p>Or had he at last decided he\u2019d had enough of her craziness?</p><p>He certainly had every right to walk away in disgust. After he\u2019d sacrificed everything to become her guardian, she\u2019d just disappeared with no warning, no explanation. What man in his right mind wouldn\u2019t decide she was more trouble than she was worth?</p><p>She clenched her teeth against the pain that sliced through her heart. Dang it. So what if she felt like she\u2019d lost a part of her very soul? As long as Caine was safe, nothing else mattered. Nothing.</p><p>Forcing her stiff muscles to move, she stepped out of the Jeep and started cautiously toward the house. The last time she\u2019d visited the lair, Caine had altered the hexes to recognize her. But it had been weeks since she\u2019d last been there. Would they remember her?</p><p>One way to find out.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, Cassie moved through the hedge and followed the narrow pathway. When she wasn\u2019t zapped or skewered or turned into a newt, she continued forward, climbing the steps of the wraparound porch.</p><p>She paused, taking a last glance around the empty yard, which was surrounded by a heavy line of trees, before pulling open the heavy oak door and stepping into the living room.</p><p>It was a plain room with rustic furniture and towering bookshelves that were stuffed with leather-bound chemistry books. A wistful smile touched her lips. The house was a painful reminder of Caine.</p><p>Gods, the very air smelled of him.</p><p>The thought had barely crossed her mind when the door was slammed shut behind her and she whirled to discover a blond-haired Were leaning against the wall, his arms folded over his chest and a mocking smile on his lips.</p><p>\u201cHello, pet. Miss me?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth literally dropped open.</p><p>Caine.</p><p>But . . . it wasn\u2019t possible, was it?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be here when she\u2019d left him miles behind.</p><p>\u201cAre you a trick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo trick.\u201d He shoved away from the wall and prowled toward her stiff form, wearing a casual pair of jeans and white T-shirt. \u201cSurprised?\u201d</p><p>She gave a shake of her head, struggling to come to terms with the fact he was really there and not just a figment of her imagination.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat and tried again. \u201cHow did you get here?\u201d</p><p>Without warning, he grabbed her upper arms and spun her around so he could press her against the wall. Only then did she realize that beneath his sardonic composure he was seething with fury.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the question.\u201d</p><p>The heat of his anger seared over her skin, his grip careful not to bruise, but tight enough to warn she wasn\u2019t getting away.</p><p>\u201cCaine.\u201d</p><p>The sapphire eyes glittered in the gathering gloom. \u201cThe question is why the hell you took off without me.\u201d</p><p>His words seared away the stunned shock fogging her mind. He was right. It didn\u2019t matter how he\u2019d found her. Or even how he\u2019d managed to know where she was going and get here ahead of her.</p><p>All that mattered was getting rid of him before it was too late.</p><p>She turned her head to stare at the rolltop desk set near the window, desperate to hide her all too expressive face. \u201cI would think that would be self-explanatory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He snorted, his hands cupping her chin and forcing her face back to meet his narrowed glare. \u201cObviously I\u2019m particularly dense because I don\u2019t find anything self-explanatory about being abandoned at a rest stop by my lover.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, floundering beneath his penetrating gaze. Who knew that lying would be such a vital skill? Or that sucking at it might very well get Caine trapped in hell.</p><p>Crap. She had to do this. And she had to do it well enough to make sure Caine walked away and never returned. With an effort, she plastered something she hoped resembled a smile to her lips. \u201cI decided that I\u2019d had enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman doesn\u2019t give her innocence to a man when she\u2019s \u2018had enough,\u2019\u201d he challenged.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re making such a big deal about my virginity,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>His simmering anger that she\u2019d hope to provoke into a don\u2019t-call-me-I\u2019ll-call-you rage abruptly faded to be replaced with a heart-melting tenderness.</p><p>\u201cBecause it was a big deal to me.\u201d His thumb traced her lower lip, a ready passion darkening his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift I\u2019ll always cherish.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed a sigh of frustration. What was wrong with the man?</p><p>\u201cWell, it was nothing more than a burden to me,\u201d she said, adamantly refusing to shiver at the exquisite sensation of his thumb tracing the curve of her lip. \u201cNow it\u2019s gone I can move on to . . .\u201d</p><p>Something that might have been amusement glinted in his eyes. \u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo someone else.\u201d</p><p>That should have been it. What man could stand to be told his female was leaving his bed and going to another? Instead, that annoying amusement only deepened.</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought you would find this mysterious someone else in my lair?\u201d he drawled. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t really make any sense, does it, pet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI needed somewhere to stay until I can find a lair of my own.\u201d</p><p>His gaze lowered to where his thumb continued to stroke over her mouth. \u201cSurely, your next lover will provide you with a lair? Or at least a bed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is if you intend to use my private lair for your orgies.\u201d A wicked smile curved his lips. \u201cI should at least be allowed to participate.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, a deep yearning threatening to undermine her noble intentions. \u201cStop that,\u201d she hissed, batting away his tormenting hand and reminding herself the cost of failure.</p> <p>His amusement vanished as he slammed his hands against the wall on each side of her shoulders, caging her with his body. \u201cTell me why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head, frightened by the grim resolve etched on his beautiful face. \u201cBecause I wanted to get away from you and I thought this would be the last place that you would look for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with your vision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, now go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll leave.\u201d She grabbed his arm, frantically trying to push it aside. \u201cDammit, let me go.\u201d</p><p>There was a tense silence and she could feel Caine\u2019s gaze searing over her rigid profile.

There was no way she was getting rid of the stubborn Were. At least not unless she could prove to him it was too dangerous for him to stay.</p><p>Something that was as likely as her sprouting wings and flying.</p><p>She heaved a resigned sigh, resting her head against the welcome strength of his chest. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His hands glided up and down her stiff back in a comforting motion. \u201cCan you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d He stiffened, obviously shocked by her confession. \u201cDo I do something wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re captured.\u201d She shuddered, the memory of her vision painfully vivid. \u201cWe both were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptured by whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were we being held?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She gave another shudder. \u201cWe were surrounded by a white fog.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause.</p><p>\u201cSo you took off because a vision revealed I\u2019m going to be captured?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She heard his low growl a mere heartbeat before he was roughly pulling away, his jaw clenched and his eyes glowing with the power of his wolf. \u201cGod dammit, Cassie,\u201d he barked. \u201cWhat the hell were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>Caught off guard by his unexpected attack, she blinked in confusion. \u201cI was trying to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He pointed a finger toward her, the veins on his neck visible as he struggled to contain his outrage. \u201cThat\u2019s not allowed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot allowed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your job.\u201d</p><p>She scowled. \u201cBut it\u2019s fine for you to protect me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His blunt response left her tongue-tied. How did you argue with someone who didn\u2019t bother to be reasonable? \u201cHow is that even logical?\u201d she finally managed to inquire.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the prophet.\u201d His tone was hard, unapologetic. \u201cAnd whether you like it or not, you\u2019re number one on the most wanted list right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her childish outburst. \u201cAnd for whatever twisted reason, fate has chosen me as your protector. That\u2019s just how it is.\u201d</p><p>She stepped forward, desperate to make him understand the danger he was in. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear it, Caine.\u201d She framed his face in her hands, her voice thick with fear. \u201cYou were . . .\u201d</p><p>He swooped down to capture her lips in a fierce kiss that stole her words.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he commanded softly, pulling back to regard her with a somber expression. \u201cI don\u2019t care if I was dead, you will never again try to leave me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her fingers tightening on his face. \u201cI won\u2019t let you be hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink, Cassie. You said yourself it\u2019s too dangerous to try and alter fate.\u201d He peered deep into her wide eyes, his hands lightly encircling her wrists and his thumbs rubbing over her unsteady pulse. \u201cWhat if your misguided attempt to keep me safe has tilted the balance of power to the Dark Lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>He went still at her harsh words. \u201cYou would sacrifice the world for me?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d With a groan, he leaned forward, resting his forehead against hers. \u201cGods, you never fail to astonish me.\u201d</p><p>She made a sound of exasperation. She didn\u2019t want to astonish him. She wanted to make him flee in fear.</p><p>\u201cPlease, please go, Caine.\u201d</p><p>His jaw jutted. \u201cNo way in hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is quite likely where we\u2019re going,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cI always knew it was inevitable.\u201d</p><p>She hissed at his flippant retort. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I would say that it\u2019s the greatest cosmic joke in the history of the world,\u201d he added, a humorless smile twisting his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose visions of yours are bigger than both of us.\u201d He turned his head so he could plant a kiss in the center of her palm. \u201cAnd right now I\u2019m all you\u2019ve got to guard you from the bad guys.\u201d He gave a sharp laugh. \u201cThe gods help us.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Gaius\u2019s lair in Louisiana</p><p>The female wasn\u2019t as adequate as the last. Her dark hair was too short and her skin too pale, while her curves were on the wrong side of lush. But beggars couldn\u2019t be choosers, and shuddering to a climax beneath the skilled stroke of her mouth, Gaius grasped her by the hair and jerked her upright.</p><p>Her dark eyes were drenched with adoration as she rubbed her naked body against him. \u201cWas it good, baby?\u201d</p><p>Gaius grimaced, roughly turning her around as he straightened his black slacks that he\u2019d matched with a crisp white shirt. Then, pressing her against the paneling of his private bedroom, he tilted her head to strike deep into the flesh of her throat.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d she groaned, writhing in pleasure as he drank deeply of her blood. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>He continued his meal even as he heard the sound of approaching footsteps. It was only when the sharp knock rattled his door that he at last pulled out his fangs and licked shut the female\u2019s tiny wounds.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he commanded, stepping back to smooth down his hair and adjust his black silk tie.</p><p>Without warning the female turned to toss herself against him, wrapping her arms around his neck. \u201cNo, don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>He hissed, his lips curling in disgust. \u201cRelease me.\u201d</p><p>The dark eyes were filled with mindless need. \u201cPlease, fuck me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your language.\u201d Raising his hand, he slapped her hard enough to slam her head against the wall. With a low groan she crumpled to the floor and Gaius turned toward the door. \u201cEnter.\u201d</p><p>The door was pushed open to reveal Sally dressed in her usual uniform of tight black leather skirt and red bustier with her hair in pigtails. Instead of heels, however, she was wearing black combat boots that laced up to her knees, with spiderweb stockings peeking between the top of the boots and the hem of her too-short skirt.</p><p>Her heavily lined eyes widened as she stepped into the room to discover the unconscious female sprawled at his feet. \u201cDid you kill another one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lives,\u201d Gaius said with utter indifference. \u201cWhy have you interrupted?\u201d</p><p>The witch licked her black lips. \u201cYou said that you wanted to know when I was ready to scry for Cassandra.\u201d</p><p>Gaius paused, making certain he was at his full strength before he gave a short nod. There was no way in hell he was agreeing to go after the prophet unless he was confident he could keep himself protected.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He waved a dismissive hand. \u201cGet the curs in place and I\u2019ll join you in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>With a last glance at the motionless whore, Sally left the room, pulling the door shut behind her.</p><p>Once alone, Gaius reached beneath his jacket to pull out an antique gold locket. Pressing the hidden lever, the locket sprang open, revealing the miniature portrait of Dara.</p><p>His unbeating heart warmed at the sight of his mate. Her pretty features. Her satin-smooth hair. The proud tilt of her head. And the piercing sweetness of her smile.</p><p>His fingers tightened on the locket, the aching void in his soul so large he thought at times he would fall in and never crawl back out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t approve of my methods, my love, but I do these things for you.

Please, my love, forgive me.\u201d He pressed the locket to his lips. \u201cForgive me.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly replacing the locket, Gaius headed toward the door, allowing his anguish to transform back to the frigid anger that kept him from sinking into complete madness.</p><p>Soon Dara would be returned from the grave, he reassured himself.

With a hiss, he moved with fluid speed to enter the kitchen, not at all surprised to discover a circle of flickering candles on the floor with a wooden bowl set in the center filled with thick blood.</p><p>Black magic always demanded a sacrifice.</p><p>The greater the magic, the greater the sacrifice.</p><p>Without hesitation he charged around the circle to grab the witch by her neck. \u201cI told you to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s not me,\u201d she squeaked, her eyes wide with panic. \u201cDo you think I could kill and drain a full-grown fairy?\u201d</p> <p>His fangs burst from his gums as he dropped the female and whirled to prowl toward Dolf, who tried to scramble backward. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreparing a spell.\u201d He gave a yip of pain as Gaius slammed him against the wall. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Keeping the cur pinned to the wall with one hand, Gaius lifted the other to point a finger directly into Dolf \u2019s flushed face. \u201cYou\u2019ve obviously forgotten the first rule of this household.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat rule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo magic without my permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to cast it,\u201d Dolf hastily assured him. \u201cAt least not yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Magic.\u201d His power was a tangible force that blasted through the room. \u201cIs that clear enough?\u201d</p><p>Blood trickled from Dolf \u2019s ear from the explosive burst of power, but with a dogged determination, he refused to back down. \u201cLet me explain.\u201d He grimaced as Gaius\u2019s hand pressed against his chest with enough pressure to crack a rib. \u201cPlease, it\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>Dio. Gaius dropped his hand and stepped back. Obviously the stupid dog wasn\u2019t going to be satisfied until he\u2019d pleaded for his cause. \u201cMake it quick,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>Dolf sucked in a shallow breath, his expression wary. \u201cWe have to assume that Caine will be protecting Cassandra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd unless you plan to get your hands dirty, we\u2019re going to need a weapon to keep him out of the fight.\u201d</p><p>The bastard had a point. If Gaius was forced to use the medallion to take them to the prophet, he would be weakened and not about to risk a battle with a pureblooded Were.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean he had to like it.</p> <p>\u201cA spell?\u201d he managed to spit out.</p><p>Dolf fumbled to grab the crystal hung around his neck. The clear stone glowed with a disturbing green light. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Gaius stepped back, his nose flaring in revulsion. \u201cWhat does it do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce the magic is released it will hold Caine in stasis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>Dolf furrowed his brow. \u201cIt\u2019s like a magical coma,\u201d he struggled to explain. Thinking always proved to be a chore for the cur. \u201cHe\u2019ll be suspended in a place between life and death.\u201d</p><p>Gaius abruptly narrowed his eyes, struck by a sudden inspiration. \u201cHe\u2019ll be completely incapacitated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long can you hold it?\u201d</p><p>Dolf nodded toward Ingrid, who stood in a corner with a duffel bag that matched her cammo pants and T-shirt. \u201cLong enough for Ingrid to put him in a pair of silver shackles.\u201d</p><p>Absently smoothing his tie, Gaius paced across the floor, weighing his options. \u201cCan you put the prophet in the same spell?\u201d</p><p>There was a startled silence before Dolf nervously cleared his throat. Did he sense that Gaius was plotting to betray their twisted little Justice League?</p><p>\u201cI can only cast it once, but if she was standing close enough to Caine, then it should work on both of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Gaius turned back to meet the cur\u2019s guarded gaze. \u201cI want them both incapacitated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee\u2014\u201d Dolf bit off his words as Gaius took a step forward. \u201cOf course. No problem.\u201d</p><p>Confident the cur would obey, Gaius snapped his fingers in Sally\u2019s direction. \u201cWitch.\u201d</p><p>The female moved toward him with a sulky pout. \u201cI have a name.\u201d</p><p>He dismissed her complaint with a wave of his hand. \u201cDo whatever it is you have to do to find the prophet so we can be done with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a witch, not a miracle worker. It\u2019ll take a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>He bared his fangs. \u201cThen stop wasting time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Stomping toward the counter, she dropped Cassandra\u2019s hair into a shallow bowl. \u201cDon\u2019t get your panties in a twist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeday you will learn your place,\u201d he warned. \u201cLet\u2019s hope you survive the process.\u201d</p><p>Seeming to sense he wasn\u2019t joking, Sally hastily bent over the bowl and muttered low words of magic. As she\u2019d warned, it took several moments before she at last lifted her head, a layer of sweat coating her face.</p><p>\u201cI found her.\u201d</p><p>Gaius strolled to stand at her side while the matching curs crowded behind her. He peered into the bowl, uncertain what to expect. Then, as he studied the thin layer of water, he realized that there were pictures flickering over the silver surface.</p><p>Leaning closer, he watched in fascination as the image of a pretty young female with long, blond hair and emerald eyes came into focus.</p><p>Cassandra.</p><p>The debacle of his last encounter with the prophet was forgotten as renewed hope flared in his frozen heart.</p><p>This time there won\u2019t be any mistakes, he silently swore.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d</p><p>The witch waved her hand over the bowl and the picture shifted. Or more precisely it expanded, like a camera zooming back to reveal a wider angle. He saw a farmhouse surrounded by trees and acres of rolling cornfields. Then the cluster of lights that marked a small town.</p><p>\u201cFascinating, but nothing helps to pinpoint the location,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cThis could be anyplace in the Midwest.\u201d</p><p>The image widened even farther and Sally made a sound of satisfaction. \u201cThere\u2019s a city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Chicago,\u201d Dolf abruptly announced.</p><p>Gaius sent him a warning glance. \u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I recognize the skyline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Gaius pointed toward the bowl. \u201cReturn to the prophet.\u201d</p><p>There was a blur of movement as the image condensed to focus on the female Were, who was standing in the center of a book-lined room with Caine holding her in protective arms.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you wanted?\u201d Sally demanded.</p><p>\u201cI need to know if she\u2019s alone with the Were.\u201d</p><p>The witch concentrated as she shifted the images to search the farmhouse and outlying buildings.</p><p>\u201cLooks like it.\u201d</p><p>It did, indeed. Which did nothing to reassure Gaius.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Dolf sent him a baffled frown. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are they always alone?\u201d he clarified in icy tones. Was he the only one with a brain? \u201cThey could surround themselves with the most powerful Were guardians. Or even vampires. Why leave themselves so vulnerable to attack?\u201d</p><p>Dolf shrugged. \u201cCaine has hated the King of Weres and his people for centuries. There\u2019s no way in hell he\u2019d turn his honeypot over to that megalomaniac,\u201d he said, clearly indifferent to any fear they might be walking into a trap. \u201cAnd he isn\u2019t stupid. He would never trust the leeches. To be honest, I don\u2019t think Caine has ever truly trusted anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re not unprotected,\u201d Sally added, pointing toward the edge of the yard. \u201cThe entire house is surrounded by layers of hexes and cloaking spells. There\u2019s no way we\u2019ll get through that barrier without some serious magical mojo.\u201d</p><p>Gaius was not entirely satisfied, but he wasn\u2019t stupid enough to believe the Dark Lord\u2019s patience was infinite. Any moment he was going to demand results.</p><p>And the gods have pity on all of them if the evil bastard was disappointed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get us in,\u201d he grimly promised, stabbing Dolf with a warning glare. \u201cYou make sure you have your spell ready.\u201d</p><p>The cur smiled. \u201cWhatever you say, boss.\u201d</p><p>Caine kept Cassie locked tight in his arms, his wolf needing the intimate contact to reassure the beast that she was unharmed and back where she belonged.</p><p>The past few hours had been . . .</p><p>He shuddered, unwilling to relive the torturous wait for Cassie to arrive.</p><p>Logically, he\u2019d been convinced that the aggravating female was headed to this isolated lair. But after his hair-raising journey with Yannah that had defied the basic laws of physics, he\u2019d had far too many hours to pace the floors and dwell on the numerous ways this could all go to hell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What if she\u2019d had another vision that led her in a completely different direction?</p><p>What if she\u2019d been attacked or kidnapped on the way?</p><p>What if she\u2019d wrecked the damned Jeep and was even now lying hurt alongside the road?</p> <p>What if she was simply lost?</p><p>The worrisome thoughts had looped through his mind, gnawing at him until he felt like climbing the walls.</p><p>Then, at last, he\u2019d heard the sound of the approaching vehicle and watched as she made her way to the lair, clearly unhurt. From one beat of his heart to another, his savage fear had mutated to fury.</p><p>A fury that had gone ballistic when she admitted that she\u2019d left herself vulnerable because she wanted to protect him. Dammit, his entire life had been an empty struggle for survival and even after he\u2019d made his deal with the devil to try and alter curs into Weres, he\u2019d known that there was something vital missing.</p><p>Then he\u2019d stumbled across Cassie in the caves of the demon lord and he\u2019d realized with crystal clarity that she was his reason for existing.</p> <p>There had been no trumpets or angels singing or freaking rainbows and unicorns. Just an acceptance that he had been created to protect the prophet in a world gone mad.</p><p>Now, his burst of outrage faded and he just wanted to hold the female who meant more to him than life itself and savor the lavender scent that soothed his wolf as nothing else could.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d he at last asked.</p><p>She shook her head, her hands wrapped around his waist and her head resting on his chest.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He brushed his lips over her temple. \u201cI have chocolate.\u201d</p> <p>She pulled back, her eyes filled with a sudden glow of anticipation. \u201cChocolate?\u201d</p><p>With a smile, he led her through the large, airy kitchen decorated with blue and white tiles and gingham curtains and up the stairs to the second floor. Then, with a tug he had her in the bedroom that was dominated by a carved walnut bed. Leaving her standing next to the armoire, he entered the closet and returned with a slim black and gold box.</p><p>\u201cStraight from Godiva in Brussels.\u201d He crossed to stand beside Cassie, pulling the lid off to reveal the truffle temptations. \u201cIt\u2019s so decadently good it will spoil you for any other chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She reached to take one of the small chocolates, popping it into her mouth.</p><p>Caine waited, a low growl rumbling in his throat as her eyes slid shut in sensuous pleasure and her tongue peeked out to capture the tiny crumb on her bottom lip. He bent down, stealing the speck of chocolate with a swipe of his tongue.</p><p>\u201cJust as I\u2019ve spoiled you for any other man,\u201d he whispered against her mouth.</p><p>She shivered, her hands lifting to smooth over the hard muscles of his chest. \u201cArrogant.\u201d</p><p>He nibbled down the line of her jaw. \u201cConfident in a manly man sort of way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d She angled her head to offer her throat in a gesture that sent an explosion of heat through his body. \u201cYou haven\u2019t told me how you got here ahead of me.\u201d</p><p>He found the tender spot at the base of her neck that always made her heart beat faster. \u201cA story for later,\u201d he murmured, his tongue stroking over her racing pulse.</p><p>She pressed her slender curves tight against him, but she refused to be completely distracted. \u201cYou\u2019re hiding something from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing important.\u201d He\u2019d be damned if he allowed the thought of Yannah to spoil the mood. \u201cRight now I don\u2019t want to think about anything but you.\u201d</p><p>Just for a second she held herself rigid, as if wanting to press for an answer. Then, with a soft sigh, she melted against him. No doubt she understood better than he did that their time together was limited.</p><p>Stroking his hands up and down her spine, Caine buried his face in the curve of her throat, soaking in the rare moment of peace.</p><p>He lost track of time, but his senses remained on full alert. Which meant Cassie was unable to hide the sudden change in her heartbeats.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWho, Cassie?\u201d He pulled back, his heart squeezed in a painful vice at the sight of her eyes shrouded in white. He gripped her beautiful face in his hands. \u201cCassie, stay with me. We have to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>Even as the words tumbled from her lips, Caine felt the unmistakable change in air pressure. Whirling toward the doorway, he reached back to make sure Cassie was hidden behind him as there was a shimmer in the air.</p><p>The shimmer solidified into four distinct shapes and Caine struggled to rein in his wolf as he recognized the vampire and his Three Stooges from the wine cellar.</p><p>\u201cLeech.\u201d He curled his lips in open disdain. There was no point in trying to be diplomatic. They\u2019d come to take Cassie and he would either kill them or die trying. Nothing diplomatic about that. \u201cAnd his stray mutts. Did you come to get your asses kicked?\u201d He sent the male cur a taunting glance. A cur\u2019s downfall was always his temper. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe master wants the prophet, Were,\u201d the vampire stated the obvious in a frigid voice. \u201cThis time you won\u2019t be allowed to stand in my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in this lifetime,\u201d he snarled, already shifting when Dolf stepped forward, his eyes sparking with crimson light.</p><p>\u201cBring it on,\u201d the cur challenged.</p><p>But even as Dolf took another step forward the leech was grabbing him by the arm, the cold prickle of his power like shards of ice piercing Caine\u2019s skin.</p><p>\u201cThe spell, you idiot,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>Lost in his transformation to wolf, Caine barely heard the words, but he caught the flash of green fire as the cur lifted a crystal. Then, trying his best to protect Cassie with his half-turned body, he braced for the explosion of magic.</p><p>Gaius would never change his opinion of magic. Or magic-users. If he had his way, they would all be burned at the stake, just like they were in the good old days.</p><p>But he had to admit that the cur\u2019s spell had achieved results.</p><p>Spectacular, if gruesome, results.</p><p>Taking a cautious step forward, Gaius studied the male Were who had been frozen in midchange. The face had elongated, but retained human characteristics, while his body was oddly twisted and covered in patchy fur.</p><p>It was . . . unnerving, to say the least.</p><p>With a shake of his head, he turned his attention to the female lying on the floor beside the contorted Were, obviously caught in the same spell. She looked incredibly young and fragile as she sprawled unconscious on the hardwood, but Gaius understood that the visions she carried in her head made her the most powerful weapon on the face of the earth.</p><p>Which made her a potent bargaining tool.</p><p>\u201cIt worked,\u201d Dolf muttered at his side, seeming as surprised as anyone at the success of his spell.</p><p>\u201cSo it did.\u201d Gaius snapped impatient fingers toward the silent Ingrid. \u201cWhat are you waiting for? Get the restraints on them.\u201d</p><p>With a visible shudder the female cur crept forward, tugging on leather gloves before removing the silver shackles from her bag. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d she breathed, snapping the cuffs around Caine\u2019s distorted wrists. \u201cThat\u2019s nasty.\u201d</p><p>Gaius watched as the cur efficiently placed matching cuffs around the Were\u2019s ankles before she moved to perform the same service on Cassandra. Instantly, the stench of searing flesh filled the air.</p><p>The silver would keep the prisoners incapacitated even if they did manage to wake from the spell.</p><p>Once she was finished she moved back to stand at Dolf \u2019s side, her hand running an intimate caress along the bulging muscles of his bare arm.</p><p>Gaius didn\u2019t bother to disguise his grimace. He had more important things to hide.</p><p>\u201cTake your sister and search the rest of the house,\u201d he commanded of the male cur. \u201cStart in the cellars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? We already know that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you a command, dog.\u201d</p><p>Both twins flinched at the icy warning in his voice.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Dolf muttered, grabbing his sister by the hand and pulling her out of the room.</p><p>Waiting until he could hear their footsteps descending the staircase, Gaius pointed toward the witch, who hovered near the door, as if ready for a quick retreat. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSally,\u201d she reminded him in sullen tones. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to remember.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her complaint. \u201cGo outside and make sure the spells are still intact.\u201d</p><p>Predictably, the witch narrowed her gaze in suspicion. Unlike the curs, she had a functioning brain. Unfortunate, but nothing that was going to spoil his plans.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you plotting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m plotting to keep us from being ambushed. Do you have a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go.\u201d</p><p>She studied him for a long minute, then with a shrug, she turned to head out the door. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>Gaius remained frozen in place until the door had shut behind the witch and he could sense her moving down the staircase and out of the house. Only then did he cross to kneel beside the unconscious Weres, making certain they remained locked in the spell before he tugged the medallion from beneath his sweater, clutching it in a white-knuckled grip. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The strange amulet allowed him to mist-walk. That much he\u2019d already proven by leaving behind the Veil. And the Dark Lord had said that it could be used to travel to the prison where he was being held.</p><p>But the question was, just how close would the medallion take him to his master?</p><p>A hell dimension, after all, could consume a considerable amount of territory. He could waste hours, days . . . hell, centuries.</p> <p>Still, he had no choice but to take the risk. It was the only way to be certain he could claim full credit for fulfilling the Dark Lord\u2019s command.</p><p>Closing his eyes, Gaius sorted through his mind with a clinical precision, at last locating the faint bond that led from the medallion to the distant sense of power.</p><p>Evil, pulsing, insidious power.</p><p>He shuddered in revulsion, but grimly reminding himself of all he\u2019d already sacrificed, he closed his eyes and allowed the world to dissolve around him.</p><p>Chapter 12</p> <p>Mere seconds later he wrenched open his eyes to discover he was surrounded by a thick white fog. Disoriented, it took him a second to realize he was still on his knees with the unconscious Weres stretched out beside him.</p><p>Slowly he rose to his feet, scanning the strange mist with a wary frown. Where the hell was he?</p><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d he called softly, puzzled by the emptiness that surrounded him. He\u2019d been expecting fire and brimstone. Instead, it felt as if he were standing alone in the middle of a snow globe. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>Then, just when he was debating whether or not to chalk it up to a failed experiment and return to the farmhouse, Gaius was sent back to his knees as an annihilating pain slammed through him.</p><p>\u201cHow terribly odd,\u201d a deep, disembodied voice mocked. \u201cI do not recall inviting you into my lair, vampire.\u201d</p><p>Gaius pressed his head to the ground covered by mist, his muscles trembling beneath the brutal pressure of the Dark Lord\u2019s power.</p> <p>Be careful what you wish for, he wryly told himself.</p><p>\u201cI have come to show you that I have captured the prophet and her protector as you commanded,\u201d he managed to grit between clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cAnd you assume that your gifts will allow me to forgive your intrusion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you would wish to have them in your hands as soon as possible, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d There was a long, excruciating pause. \u201cAnd where are your companions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were unnecessary baggage once the Weres had been incapacitated.\u201d</p><p>The power pulsing in the air altered, the pressure easing to become a sharp-edged punishment that threatened to flay the skin from his body.</p><p>\u201cAnd you hoped to be granted the full reward for their capture?\u201d</p> <p>Hell, yes.</p><p>Why would he share the rewards with the damned curs and witch if he could claim full benefits? Honor was the first thing he\u2019d sacrificed after the death of his mate.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Dark Lord didn\u2019t seem to be as pleased by his surprise appearance as Gaius had hoped. Perhaps it was time for some damage control.</p><p>\u201cI only seek to be given what I was promised,\u201d he carefully admitted.</p><p>\u201cI have not forgotten our bargain.\u201d The fog stirred, as if reacting to the Dark Lord\u2019s flare of impatience. \u201cNor the fact that you pledged fealty to me until I deemed you had earned the return of your mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe prophet . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs a mere down payment on the debt owed.\u201d</p><p>The razor-sharp words sent a shiver of anxiety down Gaius\u2019s spine. Cautiously he lifted his head, unable to see anything beyond the choking fog.</p><p>\u201cDown payment?\u201d</p><p>There was a sneering laugh. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t hold the value of your beloved mate so cheap as to think you could earn her return so easily?\u201d</p><p>Easily?</p><p>Cristo. He\u2019d betrayed his son, his clan, and his own soul to become a servant of darkness.</p><p>A spike of loss pierced his heart, giving him the foolish courage to slowly rise to his feet. \u201cI have served you loyally for centuries, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what have I asked of you?\u201d The force of the angry question sent Gaius reeling backward. \u201cTo acquire skills that have only made you more formidable? To be prepared for the day of my return? Hardly onerous tasks.\u201d</p><p>Gaius bowed his head, but his growing desperation overcame his claim to sanity. \u201cPerhaps not, but I have missed Dara so badly that each day is a torture,\u201d he confessed, unashamed of the edge of pleading in his voice. \u201cI ache to hold her in my arms again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile I have been trapped in this hell between worlds, stripped of my form and all but my most primitive powers.\u201d The fog suddenly boiled with a searing heat, threatening to toast Gaius into a tiny pile of ash. \u201cDo not speak to me of torture.\u201d</p><p>Gaius fell to his knees, his head bowed. \u201cForgive me, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your pathetic apologies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour obedience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am your servant, as always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen prove your loyalty.\u201d</p><p>Gaius didn\u2019t dare to so much as twitch as the blast of heat slowly began to dissipate. Inwardly, he fiercely struggled to obliterate the niggle of suspicion that was beginning to worm its way through his mind.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t allow himself to question whether or not the Dark Lord intended to fulfill his end of the bargain.</p><p>The doubt would destroy him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d he instead asked.</p><p>\u201cReturn to the servants I have given you.\u201d</p><p>Gaius glanced toward the Weres nearly hidden in the fog. \u201cWhat of the prophet and her companion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s now mine.\u201d The voice purred with satisfaction. \u201cWhich means her gift is mine. At last.\u201d</p><p>Gaius struggled to disguise his impatience. If the Dark Lord was so pleased, why wasn\u2019t he showing a little more gratitude?</p><p>\u201cSo I just return and await my reward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The Dark Lord crushed his brief hope and Gaius struggled to rise to his feet. \u201cYou will lead your allies to protect my disciple, Rafael.\u201d</p><p>Yet another disciple?</p><p>Merda. Was he expected to babysit every damned demon who claimed allegiance to the Dark Lord?</p><p>\u201cI am, of course, anxious to do as you command.\u201d</p><p>There was a chuckle that made Gaius\u2019s flesh crawl. \u201cYou don\u2019t sound anxious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I have the necessary strength to use the medallion to transport two curs and a witch without an opportunity to rest and feed,\u201d he improvised.</p><p>Although he had no memory of his years as a Roman general, he retained all the cunning that had led him to such a position of power.</p><p>\u201cThere will be no need to shadow-walk,\u201d the voice informed him. \u201cIt\u2019s a short distance from Caine\u2019s lair to where Rafael is hidden.\u201d</p><p>Before Gaius could contrive another excuse there was a sudden explosion in his head. With a sharp cry, he pressed his hands to his temples, unprepared for the vision\u2014a gaunt spirit with crimson fire burning in his sunken eyes\u2014that was branded into his brain. As the Dark Lord had promised, the creature was hidden in a spiderweb of tunnels only miles away from Caine\u2019s farmhouse. That didn\u2019t, however, make him any happier.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to protect a dead wizard?\u201d he hissed, shaking his head in an effort to ease the pain of his brain being used as the Dark Lord\u2019s personal GPS.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do as I command,\u201d the master snapped. \u201cI have no interest in your prejudice toward magic-users.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Gaius readily agreed, dropping his hands. \u201cI just wonder why such a powerful spirit can\u2019t protect himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I need to explain my orders to you, Gaius, but the wizard is currently protecting my child.\u201d</p><p>Gaius made a sound of shock, abruptly understanding the Dark Lord\u2019s vehemence that the wizard be protected.</p><p>The babes had been created centuries ago and, if rumors were to be believed, they were intended to be used as a means of resurrecting the Dark Lord if all other efforts failed to return him to the world.</p><p>\u201cThe Alpha and Omega,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cOnly one.\u201d An anger as vast and merciless as the pits of hell pulsed through the fog. \u201cThe other babe is in the hands of the leeches. They can\u2019t be allowed to interfere again. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you will lead the curs and the witch to this meadow.\u201d There was another painful intrusion into his mind. This time the image was of a slender fey male with long chestnut hair and oddly metallic bronze eyes. At his side was a slender female vampire with dark hair and blue eyes. They both stood in the center of a meadow not far from the tunnels where the wizard was hidden. \u201cThe Sylvermyst and the vampire must not be allowed to reach Rafael while he is finishing his preparations to bring me my child.\u201d</p><p>Gaius nodded. Did he have a choice? \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce the child has been brought to me, I want you and Dolf to return here.\u201d There was a kiss of pain. \u201cUnderstood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, Gaius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe next time you arrive without invitation I will assume that you\u2019re here to challenge me,\u201d the Dark Lord warned in soft, lethal tones. \u201cYou won\u2019t like my punishment.\u201d</p><p>Gaius offered a deep bow, wryly conceding he\u2019d miscalculated. Badly.</p><p>He\u2019d hauled the prophet and her protector to this dimension in the futile hope that the Dark Lord would be so pleased that he would return Dara in effusive gratitude. Instead, the Dark Lord had barely acknowledged his offering and, rather than being pleased, he\u2019d threatened grim reprisals if Gaius ever approached without permission.</p> <p>To make matters worse, he had to return to the damned curs and witch to save yet another magic-user.</p><p>Not his finest night.</p><p>Wrapping his fingers around the medallion, he closed his eyes and disappeared.</p><p>The Dark Lord\u2019s prison</p><p>Two weeks later</p> <p>Cassie opened her eyes to discover she was shrouded in a thick mist.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t surprised.</p><p>Despite being held unconscious in the cur\u2019s spell, she\u2019d been distantly aware of being transported to another dimension and the passage of time.</p><p>There had also been dreams. Strange dreams where she\u2019d sensed a female vampire and Sylvermyst creeping through the fog in search of a mage carrying an unconscious child.</p><p>And then there had been a terrifying power struggle that had made the very air shudder in fear.</p><p>And speaking of shuddering in fear . . .</p> <p>Shoving herself to her feet, Cassie absently rubbed her wrists, feeling the uncharacteristic smoothness. New skin. Which meant she\u2019d been injured while she slept. No doubt silver handcuffs, she hazarded a guess.</p><p>Not that she gave a damn. Not when she was desperate to find Caine.</p><p>With shaky steps, she moved through the clinging fog, her senses so muted she nearly stumbled over his unconscious form hidden by the swirling white mist.</p><p>Her heart halted as she realized he was still trapped in his mutated form, caught between wolf and man.</p><p>\u201cCaine.\u201d She squatted beside him, her hand reaching to touch the silver manacles that had seared to the bones of his wrists. \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d Closing her eyes, she concentrated on the bonds of awareness that connected them, only to find . . . emptiness. As if there was nothing left of the man she\u2019d come to love so desperately.</p><p>\u201cOh, gods,\u201d she whispered on a sob. \u201cWhy did you have to come after me, you stubborn, stupid wolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow terribly touching.\u201d</p><p>Caught off guard by the mocking voice, Cassie jerked upright, spinning around to discover a slender young woman standing just a few feet away.</p> <p>Her first thought was that she was an astonishingly beautiful human teenager. In the strange glow, her naked skin was tinted a rich honey with long, dark hair that spilled down her back. Her eyes were a stunning blue and when she smiled a pair of disarming dimples danced next to her mouth.</p><p>Then the force of her power lashed through the air and Cassie nearly fell to her knees as her skin was nearly flayed from her body.</p><p>Yikes.</p><p>Only the Dark Lord could pack that sort of punch.</p><p>Which meant that her dreams had been real. The Dark Lord had managed to get his hands on the babe and turn it into his vessel.</p><p>Now he was a \u201cshe\u201d with a physical body to replace the one he\u2019d lost when he\u2019d been banished from the world.</p><p>The words of the prophecy whispered through her mind as she met the eyes that flickered from blue to crimson.</p><p>Flesh of flesh, blood of blood, bound in darkness.</p><p>The Alpha and Omega shall be torn asunder</p><p>and through the Mists reunited.</p><p>Pathways that have been hidden will be found</p><p>and the Veil parted to the faithful.</p><p>The Gemini will rise</p><p>and chaos shall rule for all eternity.</p><p>\u201cThe Omega,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes, my servants managed to resurrect me.\u201d With a preening smile, the Dark Lord ran a hand down her slender stomach. \u201cDo you like my new form?\u201d</p><p>Cassie took a cautious step to the side, trying to draw attention away from Caine\u2019s unmoving body. If she was going to get fried, then she didn\u2019t intend for Caine to get caught in the crossfire.</p><p>\u201cIf you were resurrected why are you still here?\u201d</p><p>The crimson fires consumed the blue of her eyes. \u201cThe vampire bitch destroyed this body. She\u2019ll pay for that. They all will.\u201d</p><p>Cassie could only surmise that the battle she\u2019d sensed while held in the spell hadn\u2019t gone well for the Dark Lord. Not that she could see any physical damage to the slender form. Still, there was no way the powerful creature would be wasting her time chatting with Cassie if she could return to the world.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re trapped?\u201d</p><p>The air thickened, making it nearly impossible to breathe. Then, with an obvious effort, the Dark Lord managed to rein in her temper. Her eyes even returned to blue, although there were a few embers burning deep in the center.</p><p>\u201cI merely await the arrival of the other child. Once the two have been reunited I will be invincible.\u201d</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t miss the implication. The two babies had been hidden for centuries, but recently they\u2019d reemerged. One was rumored to be in the hands of the vampires, while the other was now standing in front of her in the guise of the Dark Lord.</p><p>If the two were reunited . . .</p><p>\u201cThe Gemini will rise.\u201d Cassie quoted the prophecy with a shiver.</p><p>\u201cAnd chaos shall rule for all eternity,\u201d the Dark Lord completed.</p><p>A stab of sheer terror arrowed down her spine.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need an ancient prophecy to warn her of the hell awaiting the world if the Dark Lord was allowed to destroy the barriers between dimensions.</p><p>Or that it was her duty to do whatever necessary to prevent such a hideous fate.</p><p>Not that she had a clue what she could do.</p><p>The Dark Lord could squash her like a bug if she tried to attack. And she didn\u2019t have the talent to travel between dimensions.</p><p>All she could do was discover how the evil minions intended to steal the child and try to pass along a warning.</p><p>\u201cYour minions will never get close to the child,\u201d she deliberately prodded the dangerous creature. \u201cHe\u2019s being guarded by the vampires.\u201d</p><p>As hoped, the creature couldn\u2019t help but share just how clever she was. \u201cThen who better to slip past them than another vampire?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cGaius?\u201d</p><p>The female shrugged, not refuting or confirming Cassie\u2019s guess. \u201cHe is but one of many vampires who worship me.\u201d</p><p>Well, that wasn\u2019t overly reassuring. And worse, it was too vague to be of any help.</p><p>\u201cOnly those most trusted by the king will be allowed near the child,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d The female stroked her fingers through the dark satin of her hair. \u201cGaius can be anyone he chooses to be, after all. Even the King of Vampires.\u201d</p><p>Damn. She\u2019d forgotten about that unfortunate trick.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but his lack of scent will alert the Ravens long before he can get to the babe.\u201d</p><p>A secretive smile made the Dark Lord\u2019s dimples dance. Cassie grimaced. The contrast of such innocent beauty housing such pure evil was creepy as hell.</p><p>\u201cNever trust the shadows,\u201d she taunted.</p><p>Cassie blinked. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am the Dark Lord. Nothing can stand in the path of my destiny.\u201d</p><p>Well, the resurrection certainly hadn\u2019t done a thing to diminish the creature\u2019s arrogance.</p><p>She took another step away from Caine, a raw pain festering deep inside her as he remained so frighteningly still.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what shadows have to do with getting your hands on the child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d the Dark Lord commanded, allowing a thin ribbon of her power to slice through Cassie\u2019s upper arm. \u201cMy plans for the child are none of your concern.\u201d</p><p>Cassie ignored the blood dripping down her arm, but she wasn\u2019t stupid enough to press for more information. The Dark Lord had always been rumored to have an impulse control problem, often killing trusted servants in a fit of temper. She didn\u2019t want to be added to the very long list.</p><p>Instead, she silently concentrated on trying to send the warning to the one mind she could still sense through the mists. Only then did she return her thoughts to the female who continued to punish her with those razor-thin strikes.</p><p>\u201cWhy have you brought us here?\u201d</p><p>As hoped, the creature was distracted by the abrupt question, her sweet face lighting with a sudden anticipation. \u201cYou, my dear, have something I want.\u201d</p><p>Cassie stiffened. That didn\u2019t sound good. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>There was another disarming flash of those dimples as the Dark Lord moved to brush her fingers over Cassie\u2019s cheek. \u201cThose pretty, pretty visions.\u201d</p><p>It was, no doubt, what Cassie should have expected, but she still found herself reeling in confusion. \u201cI thought you massacred prophets because you didn\u2019t like the visions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was perhaps a bit hasty.\u201d The female gave a tiny pout, as if the wholesale slaughter of dozens of seers was a mere inconvenience. \u201cI had hoped that by ridding the world of the prophets I could alter my fate.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>The fingers shifted to cup Cassie\u2019s chin in a punishing grip. \u201cNow I accept that the future cannot be changed.\u201d</p><p>A bleak sense of failure raced through Cassie at the aching emptiness in the sacred center of her heart.</p> <p>Caine.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she breathed. \u201cIt can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I intend to use it to my advantage.\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to meet the unnerving blue gaze flecked with crimson. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will show me my future so I will know precisely what to expect.\u201d The fingers tightened until Cassie felt her chin fracture beneath the force. \u201cThere will be no more unpleasant surprises.\u201d</p> <p>She hissed in pain, struggling to concentrate. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that. I have no control over the visions or what they show me.\u201d</p><p>Loosening her brutal grip, the Dark Lord patted Cassie\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Bitch.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve never had the necessary encouragement to train your abilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNecessary encouragement?\u201d Cassie echoed. \u201cI suppose you mean torture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSemantics.\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, easy for the one not being tortured to say.</p><p>She tilted her battered chin, refusing to show fear. \u201cIf pain could give me control over the prophecies, then the demon lord who held me prisoner would have been torturing me for the past thirty years.\u201d</p><p>The creature shrugged. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t doubt that you would endure any amount of suffering to cling to your annoying morals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with morals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might be what you believe, but I suspect that the block is unconscious.\u201d Dropping her hand, the Dark Lord stepped back to regard Cassie with a confidence that made her stomach clench. \u201cOnce we break it down we will be able to tap into those visions. The future will belong to me.\u201d</p><p>Cassie shook her head, baffled by the female\u2019s assurance that the visions could be controlled. As far as Cassie knew there\u2019d never been a seer capable of focusing her prophecies so they showed a particular person or event.</p><p>Had her latest failure driven the Dark Lord\u2014or whatever she was supposed to be called now\u2014over the edge? The thought wasn\u2019t particularly reassuring.</p><p>\u201cYou can torture me all you want, but it won\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>Cassie scowled in confusion. \u201cBut you just said . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that you would allow yourself to die before giving me what I need.\u201d The female overrode her words, a hint of disdain in her voice. \u201cWolves are so stupidly stubborn. But there is more than one way to skin a cat.\u201d She deliberately paused, her wide blue eyes turning toward the unconscious Caine. \u201cOr in this case, a wolf.\u201d</p><p>Realization hit a split second too late. Diving toward Caine, Cassie could do nothing to halt the Dark Lord as she pointed her finger in his direction and a bolt of power slammed into his helpless body.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Landing on her knees, Cassie cradled his head in her arms, feeling his body tremble beneath the force of the attack.</p><p>\u201cOnly you can halt the pain, prophet,\u201d the Dark Lord warned. \u201cGive me what I want.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Styx\u2019s lair in Chicago</p><p>The Anasso\u2019s private study in his vast mansion wasn\u2019t what most people expected.</p><p>Far from the dank dungeon with torture devices of the previous King of Vampires, or even the high-tech office that was wired better than the Pentagon that Viper preferred, Styx had chosen a book-lined room with polished mahogany furniture and a delicate Persian carpet.</p><p>It was all very civilized. Well, as long as a person didn\u2019t count the dozen spells and hexes that were wrapped around the room. Or the entire horde of vampires patrolling the hallway just outside the door.</p><p>Nothing was coming in or out without Styx\u2019s say-so.</p><p>Perched on the edge of the massive desk, Styx was in his usual garb. Leather pants, shit-kicker boots, and T-shirt stretched tight over his heavily muscled chest. His hair hung down in a long braid threaded with turquoise ornaments.</p><p>A complete opposite of Viper, who stepped into the study, his ivory silk shirt ruffled at the neck and cuffs and his black velvet pants as flamboyant as Styx\u2019s were stark.</p><p>\u201cAll quiet?\u201d the clan chief of Chicago demanded, his silver hair shimmering in the light from the overhead chandelier.</p><p>Styx grimaced. \u201cSo far.\u201d</p><p>Viper halted in the center of the room, his dark gaze all too perceptive. \u201cYou don\u2019t sound as pleased as you should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate this waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still have your Ravens guarding the child?\u201d</p><p>Styx gave a sharp nod. He\u2019d insisted that Tane and Laylah remain in his lair with their child, Maluhia. It had become even more vital that the babe be protected after Jaelyn and Ariyal had escaped from the hell dimension to reveal that the female twin of Maluhia had already been used to resurrect the Dark Lord. It\u2019d only been because Jaelyn had drained the blood of the creature during their battle that the Dark Lord hadn\u2019t been able to return to this world.</p><p>Now the bastard, or rather the bitch, would be more determined than ever to get her hands on Maluhia. And if the prophecy was to be believed, the reunion of the two children behind the Mists would be nothing less than . . . chaos.</p><p>Not only would the Dark Lord return to this world, but the barriers between dimensions would be destroyed.</p><p>Hell would quite literally spew into the streets.</p><p>Which was why he had his most trusted guards on duty around the clock.</p><p>\u201cYes, but they can only be asked to be trapped on babysitting duty for so long before they\u2019ll go stir-crazy.\u201d</p><p>Viper folded his arms over his chest. \u201cI know you\u2019re a control freak, Styx, but I have trusted soldiers who can help fill in rotations. That will give the Ravens a chance to rest and feed. You only have to ask.\u201d</p><p>Styx allowed a small smile to touch his lips. He was a control freak, but he wasn\u2019t stupid. His men were getting as twitchy as hell.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Send them to Jagr. I put him in charge of protecting Maluhia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it done,\u201d Viper assured him. \u201cHow is Tane holding up?\u201d</p><p>Styx abruptly straightened, restlessly pacing from one end of the office to the other. \u201cHe isn\u2019t thrilled to have so many feral males around his mate and child, but he understands that nothing is more important than keeping them out of the hands of the Dark Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd talking about feral males,\u201d Viper murmured.</p><p>Styx turned back toward his friend with a scowl. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Ravens aren\u2019t the only ones going stir-crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like Darcy.\u201d</p><p>Viper arched a brow. \u201cHas she been fussing over you like a devoted mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she kicked me out of the bedroom and told me not to return until I got the \u2018ants out of my pants.\u2019 Her words, not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not wrong.\u201d The dark eyes narrowed. \u201cYour temper tantrum last night took out half of Chicago\u2019s power grid.\u201d</p><p>Ah, so that\u2019s why Viper had taken time from his heavy duties as chief to visit. In the past few days the streets of Chicago had become a free-for-all as demons had turned on one another. Even the most peaceful creatures had become violent as the heavy sense of doom continued to build.</p><p>It had kept Viper struggling to prevent a bloodbath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the King of Vampires,\u201d he countered, not about to admit he\u2019d lost control of his temper when Salvatore had accused him of not doing enough to locate Cassandra and Caine. As if he had the power to travel between dimensions. Annoying dog. \u201cI don\u2019t have temper tantrums.\u201d</p><p>Viper looked unimpressed. \u201cCall them whatever you want, they\u2019re threatening to destroy my city.\u201d</p><p>Styx released a low growl of frustration. \u201cI hate being forced to sit on my ass and twiddle my thumbs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now there\u2019s nothing else you can do.\u201d Viper studied him with a somber expression. \u201cHave you heard from Santiago?\u201d</p><p>Santiago was one of Viper\u2019s most trusted soldiers and had gone on a futile mission to find Cassandra when he\u2019d instead stumbled across Nefri\u2014the mysterious and powerful female clan chief who lived beyond the Veil.</p><p>It\u2019d been Santiago who\u2019d learned that the vampire who had sold his soul to the Dark Lord and betrayed them was one of her clansmen.</p><p>And unbelievably, Santiago\u2019s missing sire.</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s assisting Nefri in her search for Gaius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Jaelyn, he has a medallion similar to Nefri\u2019s that he can use to travel. Can\u2019t she use hers to track him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still trying to discover where his medallion came from. As far as she knew, she had the only one ever created.\u201d</p><p>Viper frowned, his slender fingers adjusting his ruffled cuff. \u201cI don\u2019t like this.\u201d</p><p>Styx stepped forward, sensing his companion\u2019s genuine concern. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSantiago is very skilled in pretending he wasn\u2019t affected when his sire abandoned him to travel through the Veil, but he carries wounds that have never fully healed,\u201d Viper explained. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he can think clearly when it comes to Gaius.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf the vampire has betrayed us, then I don\u2019t care if Santiago is thinking clearly,\u201d Styx said in hard tones. He was running empty on compassion these days. \u201cI want the bastard dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not always so easy to kill those we consider our family, even when we know it\u2019s for the greater good.\u201d</p><p>Styx hissed at the reminder that he\u2019d nearly condemned the vampire race to the insane brutality of the former Anasso out of misplaced loyalty. \u201cPoint taken.\u201d</p> <p>Viper reached into his pocket to remove a slim cell phone. \u201cDo you want me to call him home?\u201d</p><p>He shook off the unwelcome memories, his lips twisting in a wry smile. \u201cYou can try.\u201d</p><p>Viper lowered the phone, his expression suspicious. \u201cIs there something I should know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy claims I have the social sensitivity of a slug demon, but even I\u2019ve noticed how Santiago watches Nefri when he thinks no one is looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike he\u2019s longing to devour her.\u201d</p><p>Viper made a sound of shock. \u201cNefri?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? She\u2019s a very beautiful woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStunningly beautiful,\u201d the clan chief agreed. \u201cAnd dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Styx couldn\u2019t argue. She was the only vampire he\u2019d met who could match him in strength. Actually, in a head-to-head battle he wasn\u2019t sure who would win. \u201cHer power is off the charts. Not every man is capable of accepting a female who possesses such strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d Viper gave an impatient wave of his hand. \u201cSantiago has always chosen women of power.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the rumors are to be believed, Nefri deliberately turned her back on this world to live like a cloistered nun,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want her manipulating Santiago with her beauty to get what she needs from him and then disappearing behind the Veil. He has enough abandonment issues without her screwing with his head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a big boy, Viper.\u201d Styx moved forward to clap his companion on the shoulder. \u201cI think he can handle his private affairs.\u201d</p><p>They both froze as the unmistakable stench of granite wafted through the air.</p><p>Viper rolled his eyes. \u201cWere you expecting company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Styx muttered as the gargoyle waddled through the door.</p><p>Not that he was much of a gargoyle. Granted, he possessed the conventional grotesque features, covered by a thick gray skin. His gray eyes were reptilian, his horns stunted and his hoofs cloven. He even had a long tail he polished and pampered with great pride.</p><p>But his fearsome appearance was ruined by his stunted size and the pair of delicate, gossamer wings that should have been on the back of a sprite. And worse, his magic was as unpredictable as the Midwest weather.</p> <p>Who could blame the Gargoyle Guild for voting him out? He was a three-foot pain in the ass who\u2019d latched onto Viper\u2019s and Styx\u2019s mates and refused to be dislodged.</p><p>\u201cLevet,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Oblivious to the distinct lack of welcome, Levet blew them both kisses. \u201cAh, mes amis, have you missed me?\u201d</p><p>Styx snorted. He\u2019d missed the gargoyle like he missed a hot poker shoved in his eye. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Levet\u2019s delicate wings, shimmering in shades of crimson and blue and gold, fluttered in confusion. \u201cWhere else would I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were searching for Yannah?\u201d he reminded the beast, referring to the peculiar demon who had a habit of appearing and disappearing without warning.</p><p>\u201cBah.\u201d Levet rubbed his stunted horn. \u201cShe is making me nutmeg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNutmeg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he means nutty,\u201d Viper said dryly.</p><p>\u201cShe pops here. She pops there.\u201d Levet waved his hands. \u201cPop, pop, pop, pop. How can I catch her if she will not stand still?\u201d</p><p>Viper snorted. \u201cFemales rarely make the chase easy. In fact, I\u2019m beginning to suspect they\u2019re born to make men utterly and completely nutmeg.\u201d</p><p>There was a brief silence as the three males nodded in rare agreement. Then, with a sharp shake of his head, Styx pointed toward the door. \u201cGo keep Darcy and Shay company,\u201d he commanded. \u201cI have business to discuss with Viper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I prefer the company of your charming mates, I need to speak with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon.\u201d Levet stubbornly held his ground. \u201cThis is important.\u201d</p><p>Styx clenched his hands. As much fun as it would be to mount the damned creature over the marble fireplace, he knew Darcy would never forgive him. Dammit.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d His lips curled back to display his massive fangs. \u201cSpit it out.\u201d</p><p>The gargoyle\u2019s tail twitched, but he wasn\u2019t so stupid as to challenge Styx\u2019s patience. Not tonight.</p><p>\u201cYou know that I keep in contact with Darcy and her sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you use some sort of telepathy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly telepathy. It\u2019s more a portal that I form inside their mind. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a point?\u201d Styx interrupted, not giving a shit how the creature managed to speak mind to mind with his mate.</p><p>Levet sniffed. \u201cDarcy asked me to try and contact Cassie using my powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClever,\u201d Styx murmured, his pride in his wife swelling through his heart.</p><p>\u201cClever, but, unfortunately, my efforts did nothing but give me the aching head,\u201d Levet admitted.</p><p>\u201cSo you failed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so much a failure as a . . . misfire.\u201d</p><p>Levet wasn\u2019t the only one with the aching head, Styx silently conceded. \u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could not contact her, but she did manage to contact me.\u201d</p><p>A sudden tension filled the air as both vampires stared at the tiny demon in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cYou spoke with her?\u201d Styx bit out.</p><p>Levet gave a lift of one shoulder. \u201cOnly a brief moment.\u201d</p><p>Viper stepped forward. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, but she sent this.\u201d</p><p>Levet held out his hand to reveal a small piece of paper. Styx leaned forward, taking the paper and unfolding it to study the squiggle of odd lines.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Viper demanded.</p><p>\u201cA prophecy.\u201d Styx lifted his head to stab his friend with a worried frown. \u201cGet Roke.\u201d</p><p>Gaius\u2019s lair in Louisiana</p><p>Gaius sat in a leather wing chair in his office, holding a history book that glorified his battles as a Roman general. He might not remember his human days, but he took pleasure in the knowledge he had been a brilliant commander feared by all. Usually, it was his favorite way to spend a quiet evening in his lair.</p><p>Tonight, however, he found no peace.</p><p>Not even several hours of rough sex followed by a deep feeding had eased the sense of foreboding that had haunted him for the past two weeks. Tossing aside the book, Gaius surged to his feet and paced toward the window, his brocade dressing gown brushing the floor.</p><p>He knew what was troubling him.</p><p>After following the Dark Lord\u2019s commands to protect the wizard spirit, he\u2019d then returned to the mists along with Dolf. He perhaps shouldn\u2019t have been surprised to discover the master had been resurrected into the child. But he\u2019d been frankly unnerved by the sight of the powerful deity in the body of a teenage girl.</p><p>Thankfully, he\u2019d concealed his growing apprehension\u2014unlike Dolf, who had managed to incur the anger of the Dark Lord\u2014long enough to escape out of the mists.</p><p>There was no way he was going to hang around to bear the brunt of the Dark Lord\u2019s frustration when he couldn\u2019t use his new body to return to the world. Drained or not, she was still powerful enough to turn Gaius into a puddle of screaming pain.</p><p>Now he was left to stew in his own doubts, caught between the urgent need to hear from the Dark Lord so they could finish their deal and he could demand the return of his beloved mate, and a growing desire to be forgotten by the evil bastard. Or rather . . . the evil bitch.</p><p>Sensing the approach of a male cur, Gaius was careful to mask his emotions as he slowly turned to watch Dolf step into the room. In the candlelight the dog was looking distinctly worse for the wear.</p><p>In the past two weeks his hair had grown past the buzz cut and had acquired several streaks of gray. Worse, he\u2019d dropped nearly fifty pounds, leaving his face gaunt and his stomach sunken.</p><p>Not at all the cocky mutt that Gaius had first met just a month ago. But then again, they\u2019d all lost a bit of their cock.</p><p>\u201cYou disposed of the body?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Dolf nodded, his eyes glittering with a hectic light. The cur was hanging on to his sanity by a thread. A thin thread.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rotting deep in the swamp with all the others.\u201d His lips curved in a gruesome imitation of a smile. \u201cYou have quite a collection out there. Thirteen, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Gaius stiffened. He didn\u2019t like being reminded of the whores that he\u2019d killed over the past few nights. Not because of his conscience. That had died along with Dara. But it was a nasty reminder of his loss of control. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was happening far too frequently.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t presume to judge me.\u201d His words were coated in ice. \u201cMy hungers are instinct, not a perversion of nature like some I could name.\u201d</p><p>Dolf snorted, indifferent to Gaius\u2019s disdain. \u201cHell, I don\u2019t care if you drain every whore from here to Timbuktu, but the locals are starting to get itchy about the girls who\u2019ve gone missing. Unless you want an angry mob, complete with torches and pitchforks, on our doorstep, you might want to dial back on your feedings.\u201d He paced to study the books that lined the shelves. \u201cOr at least import your meals from farther away.\u201d</p> <p>Gaius narrowed his gaze. \u201cIs there a reason you\u2019ve intruded into my privacy?\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence, as if Dolf was considering his words. Never a good thing. Then slowly he turned to meet Gaius\u2019s rigid expression. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s odd we haven\u2019t heard from the master?\u201d</p><p>Gaius hissed. The question had, of course, been nagging at the edge of his mind. But he was smart enough to know it was too dangerous to speak aloud.</p><p>\u201cShe will contact us when she needs our services,\u201d he said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cAre you so certain?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>Dolf \u2019s humorless laugh echoed through the silent house. \u201cOur last mission was yet another epic failure.\u201d</p><p>Gaius shrugged. \u201cThe wizard was to blame for bringing the Hunter and Sylvermyst into the master\u2019s lair. It wasn\u2019t our fault.\u201d</p><p>Dolf shuddered, still obviously traumatized by their time spent in the master\u2019s company. \u201cYeah, well, the wizard is dead and the Dark Lord is still trapped,\u201d the cur unnecessarily pointed out. \u201cShe might have decided to spread the blame around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would know if she\u2019d decided to punish us for the latest disaster,\u201d Gaius said with a grimace. \u201cShe\u2019s never subtle.\u201d</p><p>Dolf nodded, but his brow remained furrowed. \u201cIf you say.\u201d</p> <p>Gaius rolled his eyes. He could send the cur away, but Dolf would only return until he\u2019d said whatever was on his tiny mind. \u201cNow what\u2019s bothering you?\u201d</p><p>The cur hunched his shoulders. \u201cTo be honest, I preferred the thought that we\u2019re being punished.\u201d</p><p>Gaius frowned. \u201cAs opposed to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you considered the possibility that the Dark Lord hasn\u2019t contacted us because . . .\u201d</p><p>His words trailed away and Gaius made a sound of impatience. \u201cCristo, just say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Gaius cursed, instinctively glancing around the seemingly empty room. Even if the Dark Lord was trapped in another dimension, he\u2014or rather she\u2014had spies everywhere.</p><p>\u201cYou are a fool,\u201d he hissed.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps, but I would be even more of a fool to spend the next century waiting in this godforsaken swamp for a master who has already lost the war,\u201d Dolf grimly pressed, too far gone in his growing madness to consider the danger.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d Gaius asked, the ice in his voice warning he wouldn\u2019t be coaxed into an indiscretion. His growing doubts would go with him to the grave. \u201cThat we abandon the Dark Lord and pray she doesn\u2019t manage to escape her prison?\u201d</p><p>Without warning, the nearest bookshelf slid outward to reveal a hidden passageway.</p><p>Gaius tensed in shock, his fangs lengthening in preparation for an attack. Instead, Sally stepped into the room, her hair hanging around her face, which was amazingly devoid of her ridiculous black makeup, and her slender body covered by a flannel nightgown.</p><p>She looked like a child. As long as you didn\u2019t look into the eyes, which were glowing with a crimson fire.</p><p>\u201cYes, Dolf, please enlighten me on how you intend to betray me?\u201d</p><p>The cur fell to his knees, his head pressed to the floor at the sudden blast of power that had nothing to do with Sally and everything to do with the Dark Lord. \u201cMistress.\u201d</p><p>Sally moved forward, her expression slack as she was piloted by the evil deity to stand directly next to the cringing cur. \u201cI have made allowances for you because you are young and impetuous, but my patience has run its course.\u201d The voice was female, but not Sally\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNo, please,\u201d Dolf whined, the stench of his fear filling the air. \u201cI swear I will never again question your powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you will not.\u201d</p><p>Leaning down, Sally placed her hand on the back of Dolf \u2019s head, her touch almost gentle. But even as the cur\u2019s violent shudders began to ease, a dark mist formed around his body.</p><p>At first nothing happened and Gaius wondered if it was simply a spell to keep him trapped on the floor. Then, instinctively, Gaius stepped back, watching in horror as the blackness began to boil and churn, consuming Dolf \u2019s body with a silent swiftness.</p><p>There was no other way to explain it. Wherever the mist touched Dolf, his body just . . . vanished. There was no sound, no scent, no sense of anything but death claiming its latest trophy.</p><p>A ball of dread lodged in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Sally was only supposed to be a conduit for the Dark Lord, but it was obvious she was able to call on some hefty magic. The thought should have been reassuring. It surely meant that the Dark Lord still maintained a large portion of her powers and was capable of returning Dara from the grave.</p><p>Instead, Gaius could only watch Dolf being efficiently destroyed and wonder if the cur had been given the preferable fate.</p><p>It was the distant howls of Ingrid who had been driven to her wolf form as she sensed the loss of her brother that at last snapped Gaius out of his dangerous sense of unreality.</p><p>Lifting his head, he found Sally regarding him with those eyes that burned with crimson fire.</p><p>\u201cA shame, but he had outlived his usefulness.\u201d Stepping over Dolf \u2019s disintegrating body, Sally walked to stand directly in front of Gaius. \u201cWhat of you?\u201d</p><p>Gaius swiftly bowed. \u201cI am yours to command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I have your loyalty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what of your faith?\u201d</p><p>Gaius warily straightened, praying the creature was incapable of reading his mind. \u201cMy faith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple, vampire.\u201d She reached to run a nail down his cheek. \u201cDo you still believe we can achieve your glorious future together?\u201d</p><p>Gaius suppressed his shudder, holding himself motionless beneath her light touch. No use provoking the crazy creature. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d The nail dug deep enough to draw blood. \u201cNot the ringing endorsement I might have hoped for from one of my most devoted disciples.\u201d</p><p>Gaius desperately sought a distraction. \u201cWhat would you have of me?\u201d</p><p>The crimson eyes narrowed before she dropped her hand and stepped back. \u201cI need you to travel to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Caught off guard, Gaius spoke without thinking. \u201cDid the prophet escape?\u201d</p><p>The air hummed with a surge of power and Gaius silently cursed his stupid question. What the hell had happened to his frigid discipline?</p><p>\u201cYou agree with Dolf?\u201d Sally asked in a lethally soft voice. \u201cYou suspect that I\u2019m incompetent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you suspect I\u2019m incapable of holding on to my prisoners?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gaius sought to minimize the danger. \u201cI was just curious why you would want me to return to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>The punishing pressure eased, although the crimson gaze regarded him with an unwavering intensity that warned his brush with death was far from over.</p><p>\u201cThe child I need is being held there.\u201d</p><p>Child? There was only one child that the Dark Lord could be interested in, and yet, Gaius paused, certain that he must have misunderstood.</p><p>\u201cYou mean the babe that\u2019s being protected in the King of Vampire\u2019s lair?\u201d</p><p>Crimson eyes flared with hunger. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is . . .\u201d This time Gaius managed to swallow his impulsive words.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something you want to share?\u201d the Dark Lord mocked.</p><p>Hell yes, there was something he wanted to share. He wanted to share that it was sheer madness to try and battle his way into the most highly guarded lair in the entire world.</p><p>He would be dead before he ever reached the front gates.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what my powers, I can\u2019t possibly bluff my way past the Anasso and his Ravens,\u201d he cautiously pointed out. \u201cAnd I certainly can\u2019t overpower them.\u201d</p><p>Sally shrugged. \u201cYou won\u2019t be alone.\u201d</p><p>Gaius glanced toward the flakes of black dust that was all that remained of Dolf. \u201cI doubt my remaining companions would offer the firepower I would need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe curs are no longer necessary to my plans.\u201d Sally gave a wave of her hand. \u201cI have a new servant to assist you.\u201d</p><p>Gaius didn\u2019t know whether to be relieved or terrified. \u201cMay I ask who it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vampire named Kostas.\u201d</p><p>Kostas. The name wasn\u2019t familiar to Gaius, but that wasn\u2019t surprising considering that he\u2019d spent the past few centuries beyond the Veil. But he did know that the vampire wasn\u2019t one of Styx\u2019s Ravens or one of his trusted allies, which made him wonder what kind of help he could provide. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe has access to the babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe assures me that he is capable of sneaking in and out of the lair unnoticed.\u201d</p><p>Gaius frowned. \u201cThen why do you need me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou will provide the distraction so no one will notice the absence of the child until he is well away from the lair.\u201d</p><p>Which meant he would be the one the infuriated vampires, and perhaps even a few pureblooded Weres, would be chasing. \u201cPerfect,\u201d he muttered beneath his breath.</p><p>Sally put a hand on his shoulder, her palm searing a painful heat through the fabric of Gaius\u2019s dressing gown. \u201cOnce you\u2019re away from the vampires, you will bring me the child. This time there will be no mistakes. Understood?\u201d</p><p>Gaius nodded. The mistakes had been made the moment he\u2019d allowed the Dark Lord to whisper in his ear.</p><p>The only question was whether or not it was too late to correct them.</p> <p>Chapter 14</p><p>Styx\u2019s lair in Chicago</p><p>Styx and Viper stood in rigid silence as Roke studied the piece of paper Levet had given them. The Las Vegas clan chief was wearing his usual attire of a pair of faded jeans, with his dark hair left loose and his chest exposed to reveal the dragon tattoo that marked his position as chief.</p><p>So far as Styx knew, Roke had rarely left the rooms that he\u2019d been given after his arrival in Chicago. No big surprise. The taciturn vampire had never been the life of the party, and being forced to remain so far from his people hadn\u2019t improved his temperament.</p><p>Unfortunately for him, Styx had no intention of allowing him to leave. Not until the latest danger from the Dark Lord had passed.</p><p>\u201cIs it a prophecy?\u201d Viper demanded, his impatience adding a sharp chill to the air.</p> <p>Slowly, Roke lifted his head, his lean face hard with concern. \u201cNot so much a prophecy as a warning.\u201d</p><p>Styx stepped forward. \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeware the shadows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Viper snapped. \u201cBeware the shadows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Viper hissed, clearly not pleased by the vague forewarning. \u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>Roke moved until he was nose to nose with the Chicago clan chief, his smoky eyes shimmering with power. \u201cYou asked me to decipher the glyph and I did. It\u2019s not my fault you don\u2019t like what it says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, Viper.\u201d Styx smoothly stepped between the two. Tensions were riding high and the last thing he needed was two of his most powerful brothers at each other\u2019s throats. Literally. He kept his gaze on Roke. \u201cIs that all you can give us?\u201d</p> <p>There was a tense moment when Styx prepared for violence. Then, with a tight smile, the younger vampire stepped back, his gaze lowering to the paper still clutched in his fingers.</p><p>\u201cI sense the child when I touch the glyph, as if the prophet was thinking of Maluhia when she sent this message.\u201d</p><p>Viper was already headed toward the door by the time Roke finished speaking. \u201cI\u2019ll have the guards doubled,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cViper.\u201d</p><p>The silver-haired vampire turned to regard him with an impatient scowl. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them . . .\u201d Styx grimaced.</p><p>\u201cTell them what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo look for shadows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to think I\u2019ve lost my mind,\u201d Viper growled.</p><p>Styx shrugged. \u201cThey assumed that centuries ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d With a flash of fangs, Viper turned and disappeared down the hall.</p><p>At the same time, Roke moved to stand at his side. \u201cIs that all you need from me?\u201d</p><p>Styx folded his arms over his chest. \u201cAre you in a hurry to be somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d Roke said, a muscle in his jaw knotted with a seething resentment at being away from those he\u2019d taken as his family. \u201cMy clan needs me.\u201d</p><p>Styx shook his head. As much as he sympathized with Roke\u2019s fierce loyalty, he needed his talents. Hard times called for hard decisions. \u201cI understand your urgency to be with your people, but for now your duty is here.\u201d</p><p>Roke hissed, waving a slender hand toward the glass cases that contained some of Styx\u2019s most treasured artifacts. \u201cSo I can sit on my ass, surrounded by your collection of froufrou, just on the off chance you need me to transcribe a prophecy?\u201d</p><p>Styx lifted his brows. \u201cFirst, my collection isn\u2019t froufrou, it\u2019s chichi,\u201d he informed the younger vampire. \u201cSecond, you\u2019re here to stop the end of the world. I think that might be worth a few days of boredom, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Roke stiffened, his pride offended. \u201cI understand my duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I have to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Roke, none of us like the waiting.\u201d Styx laid a comforting hand on his companion\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBut then I doubt we\u2019re going to like what comes next any better.\u201d</p><p>Outside Styx\u2019s lair</p><p>Gaius circled the brick walls that surrounded the Anasso\u2019s vast mansion, careful to remain out of sight of the security systems. Both demon security and the more high-tech kind.</p><p>On his third trip around the estate, he halted in a small patch of trees, his hands clenched in frustration.</p><p>\u201cDio,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhere is the fool?\u201d</p><p>There was a stir of air before the thick shadows near the brick wall suddenly dissipated to reveal an overly muscular male body covered in black fatigues. Gaius\u2019s gaze lifted to the square face that reminded him eerily of his own.</p><p>Dark, finely hewed features and black hair that was currently pulled into a tail at his nape had a distinct hint of Roman ancestors. But it was the soulless black eyes that captured Gaius\u2019s attention.</p><p>Psychopath.</p><p>Always the most dangerous creature.</p><p>\u201cYou really should pay better attention, Gaius,\u201d the large vampire mocked, strutting forward with the confidence of a demon who thought he was cock-of-the-walk. \u201cWho knows what might be lurking beneath your nose?\u201d</p><p>Gaius managed to crush his instinctive urge to teach the arrogant bastard just who was in charge. He could prove who had bigger balls once they had managed to steal the child. And if he didn\u2019t, the Dark Lord certainly would.</p><p>Instead, he concentrated on the man standing before him. Just because he was a blustering idiot, not to mention a supposed partner in crime, didn\u2019t make him any less dangerous.</p><p>\u201cA Hunter,\u201d he said. He\u2019d never met one of the elite vampires who were as secretive as they were lethal, but he knew that there wasn\u2019t any other vampire who could cloak themselves so thoroughly.</p><p>\u201cNot just a Hunter,\u201d the vampire corrected, his tone harsh and his dark eyes flashing with a fury that he could barely contain. \u201cMy name is Kostas.\u201d He waited as if expecting Gaius to recognize the name. \u201cI was the Ruah. The ultimate leader of the Addonexus and commander of all Hunters.\u201d</p><p>Gaius wasn\u2019t nearly as impressed as the man no doubt expected him to be. \u201cWas?\u201d He deliberately latched onto the revealing word. \u201cI assume you were demoted?\u201d</p><p>Kostas\u2019s growl echoed through the trees. \u201cMy position was stolen from me by the King of Vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Gaius smiled without humor. \u201cAnd now you want your revenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the bastard to suffer.\u201d The man\u2019s anger swept through the trees, snapping off several branches. \u201cAnd I want that suffering to last for an eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I thought the cur was unbalanced,\u201d Gaius muttered, irritated by the thought of being saddled with yet another moron who was clearly at the mercy of his emotions.</p><p>Kostas moved with shocking speed to clamp his fingers around Gaius\u2019s arm. \u201cDon\u2019t mistake me for a pathetic dog.\u201d</p><p>With a sharp blow to the vampire\u2019s chest, Gaius sent Kostas\u2019s large body crashing into a nearby tree. He waited for the man to rise back to his feet before pointing a finger in his direction and allowing his power to sear over Kostas\u2019s flesh.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think the Dark Lord can save you if I decide I want you dead,\u201d he warned.</p><p>Kostas lifted a pleading hand. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>Gaius allowed the pain to continue for longer than necessary before he lowered his hand and regarded his companion with an imperious smile. \u201cTell me your plan.\u201d</p><p>Kostas\u2019s eyes smoldered with the desire to rip out Gaius\u2019s throat, but proving he wasn\u2019t a complete idiot, he managed to leash his bloodthirsty urges. \u201cAs you have seen for yourself, I\u2019m capable of shrouding myself in impenetrable shadows,\u201d he said between clenched fangs.</p><p>Gaius studied him in suspicion. \u201cThen why do you need a distraction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t walk through walls. The guards are bound to notice the doors opening, unless they have something else to occupy their minds.\u201d There was a moment of silence, as if the vampire was weighing how much he had to reveal to pacify Gaius. \u201cBesides, I can maintain my shadows for a considerable length of time if I\u2019m standing still, but when I\u2019m forced to move it becomes more draining on my powers. And once I\u2019m carrying the child it becomes even more difficult.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow long?\u201d Gaius pressed.</p><p>\u201cTen, maybe fifteen minutes,\u201d Kostas grudgingly answered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not very long.\u201d With a frown Gaius glanced toward the sprawling mansion, easily sensing the labyrinth of tunnels that ran beneath the grounds. \u201cWhat if you have trouble locating the child?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrouble?\u201d The man\u2019s conceit returned with a vengeance. \u201cI\u2019m a Hunter. There\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t track.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is the Anasso\u2019s lair,\u201d Gaius pointed out. \u201cWho knows what sort of spells and hexes he\u2019s placed around the nursery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trained to avoid such traps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Let the bastard have his heart carved out by the King of Vampires. And, if by some miracle he did survive and escape with the baby, Gaius would be happy to claim the rewards from the Dark Lord. \u201cWhere will we meet after you\u2019ve escaped with the babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll contact you . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gaius pointed a warning finger. \u201cWe\u2019ll arrange a meeting place before you enter the house and you will be there waiting for me with the child. Is that clear enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me?\u201d Kostas sneered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I. How do I know you won\u2019t double cross me?\u201d Kostas tilted his chin to a belligerent angle. \u201cAnd believe me, I\u2019ll know if you\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Gaius believed him.</p><p>The same rumors that whispered of a Hunter\u2019s ability to cloak himself in shadows, also hinted that they could smell a lie a mile off. Not that it mattered. If it came to the point he had to lie to the miserable SOB he would just kill him.</p> <p>\u201cMy command is to take the babe to the Dark Lord,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you truly think I would defy our master?\u201d</p><p>Kostas didn\u2019t look happy, but he knew this was a battle he wasn\u2019t going to win.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll meet at my current lair,\u201d he muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s fifty miles west of here in a small town called Platte. The entrance is at the back of the old quarry. Knock before you enter or you might find yourself in a nasty trap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there before dawn.\u201d Gaius grimaced, his gaze returning to the mansion where he could sense over a dozen powerful demons. \u201cAlways assuming I survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Styx?\u201d Kostas demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was promised he would be given to me.\u201d</p><p>Gaius shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s between you and the Dark Lord.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d better not be disappointed,\u201d Kostas warned, abruptly disappearing in a shroud of shadows.</p><p>\u201cThat, my friend, is almost guaranteed,\u201d Gaius muttered, clutching his medallion as he studied the best place to make his grand appearance in the Anasso\u2019s lair.</p><p>Styx was pacing the carpet in his study, wishing he was upstairs in bed with his mate, when the intercom buzzed.</p><p>Crossing the room, he frowned at the sight of his finest Raven glaring into the camera near the nursery. Jagr was a six-foot-three vampire who had once been a Visigoth chief. He had pale gold hair that was braided to fall to his waist and a pair of ice-blue eyes that were as hard and unforgiving as his stark features.</p><p>If he\u2019d ever been civilized, three hundred years of relentless torture had stripped it away. His recent mating with Darcy\u2019s sister, however, had managed to at least house-train him.</p><p>\u201cJagr, what\u2019s happened?\u201d he demanded, knowing the vampire would never have bothered him if it wasn\u2019t serious.</p><p>\u201cAre you in your study?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Styx frowned in confusion. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeAngelo\u2019s watching the monitors and he just caught sight of you entering the house from a side door and heading toward Tane and Laylah\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGaius,\u201d he growled, silently thanking Nefri for her warning of her clan brother\u2019s peculiar talents. \u201cSend the Ravens to capture him\u2014I\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>Jagr nodded. \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jagr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave the nursery unguarded,\u201d he commanded. \u201cThis might be an attempt to distract us.\u201d</p><p>Jagr wisely didn\u2019t point out he didn\u2019t need anyone telling him how to do his job. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and don\u2019t kill the intruder.\u201d A cruel smile touched Styx\u2019s mouth. \u201cI want the honors.\u201d</p><p>With a blurring speed, Styx was out of his study and headed down to the lower levels of his lair. As he moved, his power spread before him, shattering lightbulbs and toppling marble statues.</p><p>At last reaching the private rooms he\u2019d given to Tane and Laylah, Styx slowed his pace, nodding toward the Ravens standing guard in front of the nursery. Then, with his fangs fully exposed, he moved deeper down the corridor, away from the living quarters toward the narrow stairs that led to his dungeons.</p><p>Rounding a corner, he discovered Jagr standing in front of a silver door that had a small window cut at eye level. The one-time Visigoth turned at Styx\u2019s approach, his always grim expression more bleak than usual and a massive sword held in his hand.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Styx prompted.</p><p>\u201cWe caught him before he could reach Tane\u2019s private rooms and brought him here,\u201d Jagr answered, his ice-blue eyes hard with disgust. \u201cTake a look.\u201d</p><p>Styx moved to peek through the window, hissing in shock as he caught sight of the vampire standing in the center of the lined cell.</p><p>Even prepared, Styx found himself reeling at the image of himself on another vampire.</p><p>The same long, dark hair pulled into a braid, the same large body covered in leather, and distinctly Aztec features. Christ. It was like looking in a mirror.</p><p>Or at least, how he supposed it would be to look in a mirror. Without a reflection, he could only assume the bastard had gotten the features right.</p><p>Which begged the question . . . how had he gotten them right?</p><p>Had they met before? After so many centuries it was impossible to remember every vampire he\u2019d crossed paths with.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d He shook off the inane thoughts, concentrating on what was to come next. \u201cWhat gave him away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was too pretty.\u201d</p><p>Styx snorted. \u201cVery funny. Now the truth.\u201d</p><p>Jagr gave a lift of one massive shoulder. \u201cHe had to search for the hidden door leading to the lower floors.\u201d</p><p>Styx shook his head as the faux Styx folded his arms over his chest in a manner eerily familiar.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCreepy as hell,\u201d Jagr finished for him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Styx reached for the doorknob. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>Jagr frowned, clearly not pleased. \u201cAre you sure? We don\u2019t know the full extent of his powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I\u2019m going in alone.\u201d Styx held Jagr\u2019s gaze, knowing his loyal guard\u2019s first instinct would be to try and defend him. \u201cFor now, nothing\u2019s more important than protecting the child. If something happens to me I want you to get Maluhia to the Commission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Commission?\u201d Jagr looked like he\u2019d chewed on a lemon. \u201cThey haven\u2019t done a damn thing to help so far. Why would they protect the child now?\u201d</p><p>Styx thought back to his recent encounter with Siljar, one of the Oracles who sat on the Commission. She hadn\u2019t revealed much, but it was enough to make him suspect that they weren\u2019t nearly so indifferent to the future of the world as they pretended.</p><p>\u201cI would guess they\u2019ve done far more behind the scenes than we\u2019ve suspected,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cIf you say.\u201d</p><p>Styx laid his hand on his companion\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI have your word?\u201d</p><p>There was a brief hesitation before Jagr gave a sharp nod. Once the vampire gave his promise, it was unbreakable. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Confident the child would be kept safe, Styx opened the door and stepped into the cell. Lifting his sword he\u2019d grabbed on the way out of his office, he pointed it toward the intruder.</p><p>\u201cGaius, I presume?\u201d</p><p>A smile. \u201cI see my reputation precedes me. Should I be flattered?\u201d</p><p>Styx snorted. \u201cYou can drop the disguise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to admit it\u2019s very good,\u201d the creature smirked before there was a shimmer around his body and the image of Styx melted to become a vampire built on slighter lines, with lean features and dark eyes. He was naked now that he\u2019d shifted to his natural form, except for the heavy medallion that rested against his bare chest.</p><p>\u201cNot good enough.\u201d</p><p>The vampire shrugged, appearing far too resigned for Styx\u2019s peace of mind. \u201cIt was worth a try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a dangerous gamble, which makes me think that there\u2019s more to your plan.\u201d He resisted the urge to take a step forward. As Jagr pointed out, they didn\u2019t yet know the full extent of the bastard\u2019s powers and the last thing he wanted was to get within arm\u2019s length. \u201cAre you the bait?\u201d</p><p>Gaius gave a lift of his hands. \u201cThe Dark Lord is growing impatient to get her hands on the child. She doesn\u2019t particularly care how many servants she has to sacrifice to achieve her goal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Styx shuddered. It was hard to remember that the Dark Lord had been resurrected into the body of a young female. \u201cThat I believe. You, however, I don\u2019t.\u201d He pointed his sword toward the center of the vampire\u2019s chest. \u201cHand over your medallion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d Gaius covered the heavy metal necklace with his hand, a faint smile curving his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing but a trinket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou truly must think I\u2019m stupid.\u201d</p> <p>Gaius pretended to ponder his answer. \u201cTo be honest, I haven\u2019t given it a lot of thought one way or another.\u201d</p><p>Styx wasn\u2019t amused. \u201cEven if I didn\u2019t sense its power, I have seen Nefri\u2019s. It\u2019s remarkably similar.\u201d</p><p>Something flashed through the man\u2019s dark eyes even as he took a step backward, his fingers clutching the medallion. \u201cSo, the frigid bitch has left the Veil,\u201d he growled. \u201cAstonishing.\u201d</p><p>Styx allowed his power to fill the room, even as he debated the wisdom of attacking the vampire to get his hands on the medallion. He was fairly certain he could overpower the vampire, but he couldn\u2019t stop him from disappearing before he could get his hands on him. For now, it seemed his only hope was to provoke him in the hopes he could discover what game he was playing.</p><p>\u201cYou will show respect to your clan chief.\u201d He allowed his power to shove the vampire against the silver-lined wall. \u201cShe offered you sanctuary when you were at your most vulnerable and you repaid her trust with betrayal.\u201d</p> <p>Gaius cursed, struggling away from the wall as he glared at Styx. \u201cI had no choice.\u201d</p><p>Styx rolled his eyes. He\u2019d heard the same excuse used thousands upon thousands of times over the centuries. Hell, there\u2019d been once or twice he\u2019d used it himself. And it was always a cop-out.</p><p>\u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>Genuine anger tightened Gaius\u2019s expression. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to be noble when you have your mate safely tucked in your bed.\u201d Gaius tilted his chin, his gaze defiant. \u201cBut tell me, Anasso, how far would you go to keep her there? Is any betrayal too great to have her back in your arms?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Styx shut out the accusing words. He couldn\u2019t afford to feel sympathy for the traitor. Not when the future of the world hung in the balance.</p> <p>\u201cNone of us can comprehend the loss you suffered, but Dara was not the only one to depend upon you,\u201d he said, trying to stir the vampire\u2019s ancient loyalties. Just perhaps it wasn\u2019t too late to remind the once honorable clan chief of his sense of duty.</p><p>\u201cMy clan was better off without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about your son?\u201d</p><p>Gaius stiffened, his eyes dark with a vast sense of loss. The sort of loss that destroyed a man.</p><p>\u201cSantiago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you haven\u2019t completely forgotten about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Gaius clutched the medallion so tightly his knuckles turned white. \u201cHe is my child. He will always be my child.\u201d</p><p>Styx didn\u2019t have to fake his contempt. Not when he\u2019d personally witnessed what had happened to Santiago after Gaius\u2019s abrupt departure behind the Veil.</p> <p>\u201cA father doesn\u2019t abandon his child.\u201d</p><p>Gaius frowned, visibly disturbed by the memory of leaving behind the child he\u2019d sired. \u201cI couldn\u2019t allow him to be tainted by my bargain with the Dark Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo instead you allowed him to become a slave to one of the most vicious vampires it has ever been my misfortune to meet?\u201d Styx rasped, recalling Santiago\u2019s broken and bleeding body he\u2019d found in the fighting pits beneath Barcelona. \u201cHe made him into a Gladiator. Santiago was forced to fight every night in the blood pits just to stay alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you slayed his dragon and became his hero?\u201d Gaius attempted to mock.</p><p>\u201cWould you rather I had discarded him like you did?\u201d</p><p>Gaius flinched, his gaze shifting away from Styx\u2019s accusing expression. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Styx lowered his sword, but he wasn\u2019t foolish enough to approach the skittish vampire. \u201cGaius, it\u2019s not too late to redeem yourself,\u201d he urged.</p><p>Gaius shuddered. \u201cIt\u2019s later than you can even imagine.\u201d</p><p>On cue, the door behind Styx was shoved open and a female with short, spiky strands of red hair and black eyes rushed into the cell. Laylah, the Jinn mongrel and mother to Maluhia.</p><p>\u201cThe baby\u2019s gone,\u201d she announced, her face white with a combination of shock and fear.</p><p>God dammit.</p><p>He\u2019d known that Gaius was merely a distraction.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Styx didn\u2019t bother with platitudes. People didn\u2019t come to him for comfort. They came to him for results.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Laylah struggled to contain her panic. \u201cI was holding Maluhia in my arms when he was suddenly snatched away. He\u201d\u2014she gave a helpless lift of her hands\u2014\u201cdisappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Laylah shook her head, turning to reach out a hand to the male vampire with Polynesian features and a dark mohawk who rushed into the room.</p><p>Behind Tane was another vampire, this one a slender female with long dark hair and tilted blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI could feel the hands as they grabbed Maluhia,\u201d Laylah continued, her voice breaking. \u201cAnd I\u2019m certain something stirred the air when I raced through the door.\u201d</p><p>Tane tucked his mate tight against him, his expression warning that when he got his hands on the evil bastard who had taken his son, he was going to rip them limb from limb. Then he was going to stitch them back together and do it again.</p><p>\u201cThe kidnapper was invisible?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>There was a minute of silence as they all pondered the strange turn of events.</p><p>Then, Jaelyn growled low in her throat. \u201cKostas,\u201d she said.</p><p>Laylah sent the one-time Hunter a puzzled frown. \u201cHow can you know?\u201d</p><p>Jaelyn shuddered. She had never fully revealed what had happened to her in the hands of the Addonexus, and in particular Kostas, but what little Styx had discovered had been enough for him to make a clean sweep. He wouldn\u2019t have his people terrorized by tyrants.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one else who is capable of cloaking themselves so deeply in shadows,\u201d Jaelyn pointed out, her gaze turning toward Styx. \u201cAnd he\u2019s been crazed with the need for revenge since you removed him as Ruah.\u201d</p><p>Shadows.</p><p>Styx felt the urge to ram his thick head into the wall.</p><p>\u201cBeware the shadows,\u201d he snarled. \u201cDammit, we were warned and I still failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the failure was mine,\u201d Laylah said softly, her voice filled with such heartbreak that it filled the air with sorrow.</p><p>\u201cWe will get him back, Laylah,\u201d Styx said, his gaze shifting to Tane. \u201cI swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late, Anasso,\u201d a voice said from behind him. \u201cConcede defeat and bow to the Dark Lord.\u201d</p><p>With a snarl, Styx spun on his heel and prowled toward the forgotten Gaius, delighted as hell to have something to stab with his big-ass sword. It was obvious the vampire had deliberately distracted them to give Kostas the opportunity to steal the child.</p><p>Now he would pay the price.</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>Gaius smiled with unmistakable bitterness. \u201cThen die.\u201d</p><p>His words were still hanging in the air when he abruptly vanished from the cell.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Coming to a halt, Styx lifted his eyes toward the ceiling. \u201cCould this day get any worse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tempt fate,\u201d Tane muttered.</p><p>Leashing his fury, Styx forced himself to concentrate on the best means of tracking Maluhia. Then, turning back to his companions, he took command.</p><p>\u201cJaelyn, see if you can pick up the bastard\u2019s track.\u201d</p><p>The Hunter gave a swift nod. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with her,\u201d Laylah abruptly announced.</p><p>Styx frowned. The half-Jinn was powerful, but no one was certain if she was truly immortal.</p><p>\u201cLaylah.\u201d</p><p>The hint of lightning prickled through the air. \u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He glanced toward the silent vampire at her side. \u201cI suppose you intend to go as well?\u201d</p><p>There was no compromise in the eyes the precise shade of honey. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake Jagr,\u201d Styx said, reluctantly realizing his place was here, organizing additional search parties to look for the babe. \u201cHe\u2019s the best tracker we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll also need the gargoyle,\u201d Jaelyn startled them all by announcing.</p><p>\u201cLevet?\u201d Styx scowled. The tiny demon was a walking disaster.</p><p>\u201cHe can see through illusions,\u201d Jaelyn said.</p><p>Tane\u2019s growl trickled through the room. \u201cThen why didn\u2019t he sense Kostas when he entered the lair?\u201d</p><p>The Hunter shrugged. \u201cI think he has to be searching for the illusion to actually see it.\u201d</p><p>Styx rolled his eyes. It was a sad day when the damned gargoyle was their best hope for halting the end of the world. \u201cFine, take him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Gaius?\u201d Jagr demanded from the doorway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Styx slammed his sword back into its sheath. \u201cHe\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Kostas\u2019s lair</p><p>Once again fully dressed, Gaius easily found the opening to Kostas\u2019s lair, and with an impatient knock on the heavy metal door, he waited for the surly vampire to lead him down the stairs and through a series of cement tunnels. Eventually, they entered an eight-by-eight box of a room with a chair in one corner that was surrounded by a pile of sharp weapons. Nearer at hand was a shelf of tattered books that were focused on the histories of various demon species. No doubt they revealed all the strengths and weaknesses that a Hunter would need to know.</p> <p>\u201cAll the better to kill you with, my dear . . .\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. Not so much at the barren lack of comfort. He\u2019d lived as sparsely as a monk beyond the Veil. But rather at the heavy sense of impending death that filled the room.</p><p>Was it because Kostas had devoted his existence to killing? Or a premonition?</p><p>\u201cThis is your lair?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Kostas glanced around the cement box. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s . ..\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s functional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d Gaius shook his head, dismissing his strange imaginings. He had enough troubles without inventing new ones. \u201cWhere\u2019s the child?\u201d</p><p>Kostas planted his hands on his hips, his bulky body consuming a large chunk of the room. \u201cWhat about my reward?\u201d</p><p>Gaius made a sound of impatience. \u201cI told you, that\u2019s between you and the Dark Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good enough,\u201d the Hunter snapped. \u201cNo reward, no child.\u201d</p> <p>Gaius clenched his hands. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t sympathize with the man\u2019s need to get his payment up front. Merda, he was desperate to be given his own rewards. But he wasn\u2019t in the mood to play the role of diplomat.</p><p>Not only had he seen up close and in person just what happened to a servant who questioned the Dark Lord\u2019s ability to fulfill her promises. But, he was still raw from his encounter with the King of Vampires and the reminder of his duty to Santiago.</p><p>He never allowed himself to think of the son he\u2019d been forced to abandon.</p><p>Never.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot,\u201d he warned his companion. \u201cThe last creature to challenge the Dark Lord was eaten alive by a black mist. Do you think you\u2019ll fare any better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be denied my revenge.\u201d</p><p>Gaius rolled his eyes, wondering how a man could sell his soul for mere revenge. \u201cOnce the Dark Lord has returned, you will be able to torture and torment whoever you want,\u201d he promised dryly.</p><p>\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t return?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen we\u2019re both screwed.\u201d</p><p>The blunt words hung in the air as they both considered the heinous consequences of failure. Then, with an angry shake of his head, Kostas turned to kick aside the chair, revealing a small lever built in the floor.</p><p>Gaius watched as the vampire tripped the lever and stood back while the hidden door slid open to reveal a small room beyond. Instantly, the sound of a crying baby filled the air.</p><p>\u201cIn there.\u201d Kostas waved a beefy hand toward the dark room. \u201cHow do you intend to get it to the Dark Lord?\u201d</p><p>Gaius pointed for the Hunter to enter the room ahead of him. Not only because he feared a hidden spell, but because he didn\u2019t want the powerful demon at his back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a vampire of many talents.\u201d</p><p>Kostas glanced over his shoulder, a sudden cunning in his dark eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the Immortal Ones have weird powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShape-shifting, mist-walking,\u201d he named them off. \u201cEnthralling other vampires.\u201d</p><p>Gaius would never have answered if Kostas was still the leader of the Hunters. Whatever Styx\u2019s accusation, he wasn\u2019t indifferent to the debt he owed Nefri and her clan for taking him in.</p><p>But Kostas had been tossed out of the Addonexus. And more importantly, it was highly unlikely the brash idiot would survive his current tenure with the Dark Lord. Why not give him the answers he wanted?</p><p>\u201cShape-shifting is a talent that only a rare few vampires possess,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s impossible to fully develop the skill without traveling beyond the Veil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the others?\u201d the man pressed.</p><p>\u201cNefri, the clan chief, has a medallion like mine that allows her to mist-walk and also to part the Veil so vampires can travel back and forth. And as far as enthralling other vampires . . .\u201d Gaius shrugged. \u201cThere are those who can seize control of lesser minds.\u201d</p><p>The dark eyes narrowed. \u201cAre you one of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were, we wouldn\u2019t be having this ridiculous conversation.\u201d</p><p>Kostas stiffly moved to stand beside the narrow bed where the baby continued to cry, its tiny body wrapped in a blanket and his face scrunched and red with distress. \u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d Kostas growled, scooping the baby off the mattress.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to like it, you just have to obey.\u201d</p><p>With a warning glare, Kostas shoved the squalling baby into Gaius\u2019s arms. Astonishingly, the child abruptly halted its crying, regarding Gaius with a pair of wide blue eyes that held an innocence that pierced him straight in his dead heart.</p><p>\u201cYou stiff me and there\u2019s nowhere you can hide that I won\u2019t track you down,\u201d Kostas muttered.</p><p>Wrenching his gaze away from the sweet purity that was bundled in his arms, Gaius instead glared at his companion as he grasped the medallion.</p><p>\u201cStand back, you buffoon.\u201d</p><p>The Dark Lord\u2019s prison</p><p>Cassie was lost in a choking darkness. There were no sounds, no smells, no sense of touch. Just a vast emptiness that defied even the passage of time.</p><p>It was almost a relief when she distantly felt a sharp slap on her cheek.</p><p>\u201cWakey, wakey,\u201d a female said in her ear.</p><p>Cassie struggled to wade out of the clinging fog, flinching as the slaps became more painful.</p><p>\u201cCaine,\u201d she breathed, slowly opening her eyes to discover a pretty young face hovering directly over her. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>A pair of dimples flashed. \u201cYes, me.\u201d</p><p>With a hiss of fear, Cassie scooted away from the evil deity.</p><p>And the bitch was evil.</p><p>Only a truly black heart would have taken such pleasure in torturing a helpless Caine while Cassie pleaded on her knees for mercy.</p><p>She had tried, over and over, to conjure the visions the Dark Lord wanted, but she wasn\u2019t a sideshow freak. She couldn\u2019t force the visions to appear.</p><p>At last she\u2019d been sucked into the black hole of unconsciousness, her mind forced to relive every agonizing moment of Caine\u2019s torture for what had seemed to be an eternity.</p><p>Now she could only imagine what new hell was awaiting her.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Caine?\u201d she managed to demand, her voice a mere croak.</p><p>The female straightened, smoothing her hands down the pretty white sundress she\u2019d somehow managed to create to cover her naked body. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Your devoted dog is nearby.\u201d</p><p>The Dark Lord gave a wave of her hand and the swirling fog parted to reveal Caine, who was still trapped between wolf and human, lying motionless.</p><p>Cassie warily rose to her feet, her hands pressed to her aching heart. \u201cWhat have you done to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in stasis.\u201d The blue eyes flickered with a sinister crimson. \u201cAt least for now.\u201d</p><p>Cassie understood the warning. The temporary reprieve was over. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>The female reached to grasp Cassie by the hair, pulling hard enough to bring tears to her eyes. \u201cYou know what I want.\u201d</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t try to fight. What was the point? The creature would simply break her neck. Or worse, she\u2019d continue her torture of Caine.</p><p>Instead, she sent her captor a pleading gaze. \u201cPlease, I can\u2019t give it to you.\u201d</p><p>The Dark Lord gave her an infuriated shake, rattling Cassie\u2019s teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re just not trying hard enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Cassie cried out. \u201cI swear.\u201d</p><p>The female pointed her finger toward the unconscious Caine. \u201cDo you need a reminder of the cost of failure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I beg you . . .\u201d</p><p>No big shocker\u2014the evil bitch ignored Cassie\u2019s pleas. With a small gesture the Dark Lord sent her invisible power slamming into Caine with enough force to wrench him from the spell and make him howl in brutal agony.</p><p>\u201cI need to know the future, seer.\u201d She glared at Cassie, frustration making crimson fire nearly consume the blue of her eyes. \u201cYou will give it to me.\u201d</p><p>Cassie cried out, feeling Caine\u2019s pain as if it was her own. \u201cYou\u2019re killing him.\u201d</p><p>The female gave Cassie another violent shake. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you to save him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop . . .\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s words were lost as a familiar sensation seized her mind, driving out all thoughts of the Dark Lord and even Caine.</p><p>This power was bigger than all of them.</p><p>With violent force, the prophecy raced through her, searing a path from the great unknown to leave her shaken and disoriented. Like she\u2019d been run over by a cement truck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Slowly opening her eyes, she found herself befuddled and unable to remember why she was surrounded by white fog. Or why her head was throbbing. Visions weren\u2019t usually painful.</p><p>Then, her gaze landed on a female who was bent over to study the shimmering glyph that hung in midair. What the hell?</p><p>\u201cAt last,\u201d the stranger straightened, turning to grab Cassie by the throat. \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d Her fingers tightened as Cassie struggled to clear her mind of the lingering confusion. \u201cAre you listening to me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeave me alone,\u201d Cassie rasped.</p><p>\u201cTell me what it says,\u201d the female roared.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe prophecy.\u201d The fingers dug into Cassie\u2019s flesh, branding her skin with a scorching heat. \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d</p><p>Cassie blinked, forcing her mind to focus on her surroundings. Fog. So much fog. And some strange monster who was shuddering in obvious pain.</p> <p>Oh, gods. She was trapped in this hellish white mist with a crazy Dark Lord and Caine.</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me.\u201d The Dark Lord shifted her hand to crush Cassie\u2019s chin in a brutal grip, forcing her face toward the shimmering glyph. \u201cGive me my future.\u201d</p><p>Cassie grudgingly allowed her gaze to settle on the floating prophecy. The last thing she wanted was to give the Dark Lord the advantage in their ongoing war. But then again, did she have a choice? One way or another, the Dark Lord was going to force her to translate the vision.</p><p>She focused on the glyph, her brows drawing together as the words slid across her mind.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d the Dark Lord prompted, her nails slicing through Cassie\u2019s skin.</p> <p>Cassie bent her head, allowing her hair to cover the smile that suddenly curved her lips.</p><p>\u201cThe tides of chaos break upon an impenetrable wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Abruptly loosening her hold on Cassie, the Dark Lord waited until she\u2019d landed on her knees before she gave Cassie a vicious kick to the side. \u201cA lie.\u201d</p><p>Cassie lifted a hand to cover her shattered ribs, sensing that at least one of them had punctured her lung.</p><p>\u201cThe prophecies don\u2019t lie,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThen you lie.\u201d The Dark Lord grabbed another handful of Cassie\u2019s hair, yanking her head back to meet the crimson flames that had engulfed her eyes. \u201cYou hope to save your mate.\u201d</p><p>Cassie frowned, failing to follow the logic. \u201cIf I wanted to save him, then I would have told you the key to your success is to release him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, this is a trick.\u201d The female paced a circle around Cassie, her expression as petulant as if she were a teenage girl. \u201cIt has to be.\u201d</p> <p>Cassie kept a wary eye on the infuriated deity, knowing that it was quite likely she wasn\u2019t going to survive the next blow. \u201cI gave you what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did.\u201d Coming to an abrupt halt, the Dark Lord glared down at Cassie with all-consuming hatred. \u201cNow it is my turn.\u201d</p><p>Cassie tensed, knowing this was going to be bad. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted your mate, didn\u2019t you?\u201d The Dark Lord turned to smile toward Caine, who twitched in continued agony in the mists, his entire body rigid with the pain that was shooting through him. \u201cNow you can have him.\u201d</p><p>The female gave a twist of her hand and Caine jerkily rose to his feet, as if he were a marionette on strings. Then, with another wave of her hand the Dark Lord forced open Caine\u2019s eyes, revealing the madness that had claimed him.</p><p>With a humorless laugh, the Dark Lord patted Cassie\u2019s cheek. \u201cEnjoy your reunion.\u201d</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t bother to watch the bitch disappear into the fog, her attention entirely focused on the savage beast that was stalking toward her with lethal intent.</p><p>Sorrow filled her heart as she edged backward. \u201cCaine.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Kostas\u2019s lair in Platte</p><p>It was almost three a.m. when Styx got the call he was waiting for. Leaving Viper to deal with any emergencies, he took off for the small town of Platte, easily following Jagr\u2019s direction to Kostas\u2019s hidden lair.</p><p>Once there, he moved through the starkly barren bunker to the cramped cell where Jaelyn was waiting.</p><p>The Hunter was nearly invisible in black spandex that covered her from neck to ankle. Even the sawed-off shotgun strapped around her waist was made of a dull, unreflective metal. Currently, she was running her hands along the cement walls, clearly seeking a trapdoor. At his entrance, she turned to regard him with a somber expression that warned Styx the news wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>\u201cKostas was here.\u201d He stated the obvious, catching the scent of the vampire along with a sour hint of growing madness.</p><p>Damn. He had known the Ruah was furious at being demoted. He\u2019d even expected the bastard to plot revenge. Kostas\u2019s bloated pride would demand nothing less. But he hadn\u2019t expected him to sell his soul to the Dark Lord.</p><p>Yet another mistake to add to his very long list.</p><p>Jaelyn nodded. \u201cYes, along with Maluhia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know when he left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLess than an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>An hour. Had the traitor known they were on his trail? Or was it just another example of Styx\u2019s piss-poor luck that Kostas had taken off just before they could corner him?</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t follow his scent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Jaelyn nodded her head toward the open door. \u201cLevet is searching.\u201d</p><p>Perfect. Freaking perfect.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d</p><p>Styx didn\u2019t have to be a mind reader to know who Kostas would be meeting. \u201cGaius.\u201d</p><p>The Hunter grimaced. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Styx clenched his hands at his side, frustration pouring like hot acid through him. \u201cThen he\u2019s already taken the child to the Dark Lord.\u201d</p><p>At his low words Tane stepped into the room, his expression bleak in the glow from the fluorescent lights. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late,\u201d he said, his tone defying anyone to tell him otherwise. \u201cWhere\u2019s Nefri?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Styx moved to stand directly in front of his brother, easily sensing the vampire was about to snap. The one-time Charon\u2019s fear for his son had made him a seething rampage just waiting to happen. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has the same pendant as Gaius. She can follow him and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Tane,\u201d Styx gently interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but Nefri has already tried to use her medallion to locate the Dark Lord, without success. She thinks it\u2019s because Gaius\u2019s medallion is directly connected to the evil pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>Tane shoved unsteady fingers through his mohawk. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Styx placed a comforting hand on Tane\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way to reach your son.\u201d</p><p>The honey eyes blazed with a sense of furious helplessness. \u201cLaylah will demand to use her powers to shadow-walk.\u201d</p><p>Styx grimaced, although he wasn\u2019t surprised. Laylah didn\u2019t have the power of a full Jinn who could move between worlds, but she could enter the mists that traveled between the dimensions. It was only to be expected she would try to use that talent to reach her child. No matter how dangerous it might be.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to forbid her?\u201d</p><p>Tane snorted at the ridiculous question. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>True. Styx might be king, but that didn\u2019t mean jack-squat to a female who was desperate to reach her child. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid she\u2019ll be captured by the Dark Lord?\u201d he instead asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll be disappointed,\u201d Tane admitted, his low voice harsh with pain. \u201cShe\u2019s never sensed the entrance to the Dark Lord\u2019s prison during her previous travels. I doubt it will make a magical appearance now that we need it. She\u2019ll be devastated if she fails.\u201d</p><p>Styx squeezed the younger vampire\u2019s shoulder, offering his unspoken sympathy. \u201cWill you go with her?\u201d</p><p>Tane arched a brow. \u201cIs that a joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be careful,\u201d Styx commanded. \u201cThere are more dangers than just the Dark Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t my first rodeo,\u201d Tane reminded him.</p><p>Styx nodded, wise enough not to point out that both Tane and Laylah were emotionally compromised and hardly capable of making rational decisions.</p><p>At the moment they were all emotionally compromised.</p><p>\u201cAnd stay in contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Tane gave a faint nod before whirling on his heel and disappearing from the room. Jaelyn followed behind him, leaving Styx alone in the barren cell.</p><p>Powerless to do anything to assist Tane in finding his son, let alone halting the return of the Dark Lord as the all-powerful Gemini, Styx turned to ram his fist into the cement wall. A shower of rubble and dust filled the air, along with his blistering curses.</p><p>\u201cGod dammit,\u201d he roared. \u201cI\u2019m tired of constantly being one step behind.\u201d</p><p>There was a faint stir of air before a slender woman with short, spiky, blond hair and green eyes that looked too large for her heart-shaped faced stepped into the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, my love.\u201d</p><p>Styx instinctively reached for his tiny Were mate, pulling her into his arms and allowing her presence to ease his need for destruction. \u201cI\u2019m the Anasso,\u201d he said, leaning his cheek against the top of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s my duty to protect my people.\u201d</p><p>Darcy wrapped her arms around his waist. \u201cNow is not the time to dwell on failure. We must concentrate on what comes next.\u201d</p> <p>Styx\u2019s growl rumbled through the room. \u201cChaos comes next,\u201d he told her. \u201cThe Dark Lord has both of the children. The prophecy has been fulfilled.\u201d</p><p>She gave a click of her tongue, tilting back her head to regard him with a chiding frown. \u201cWe don\u2019t fully know what the words of the prophecy mean,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do know that the easiest way for the Dark Lord to defeat us is for us to simply give up.\u201d</p><p>Ever the optimist, he wryly acknowledged. Which worked out just fine, considering he gave the definition of pessimist a whole new meaning. His gaze skimmed over her delicate face. This female was the light to his dark. Tenderness to his brutality.</p><p>The heart to his brawn.</p><p>Which made her a treasure beyond price. And specifically why he\u2019d refused her request to join him.</p> <p>\u201cI thought I told you to stay at home.\u201d</p><p>She snorted at his reproach. \u201cAnd you know how well I obey orders.\u201d</p><p>He brushed her lips with a rueful kiss. \u201cTroublemaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he instantly agreed, pressing her head back to his chest and returning his cheek to the top of her head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid, my angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered, her hands running up and down his back in a soothing caress. \u201cWe all are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t stop\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d she interrupted his dark words. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re the good guys.\u201d</p><p>His short laugh bounced off the cement walls. No one had ever called him one of the \u201cgood guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt you could find many who would agree with that rather prejudiced claim.\u201d Styx abruptly stiffened, lifting his head to glare at the miniature gargoyle who waddled through the door. \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>Levet stuck out his tongue, as always impervious to the fact that Styx could crush him with one hand. \u201cIs that any way to speak to a demon who is attempting to save your sausage?\u201d the aggravating demon mocked.</p><p>Styx scowled. \u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBacon,\u201d Darcy explained, pulling away to send a brilliant smile toward the walking, talking chunk of granite. \u201cSave your bacon.\u201d</p><p>Styx rolled his eyes. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI picked up his scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKostas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui. He used a tunnel hidden behind a spell of illusion.\u201d The gossamer wings fluttered. \u201cA very good spell. I nearly missed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought I\u2019d say this.\u201d Grudgingly, Styx pulled his sword and pointed toward the door. \u201cLead on.\u201d</p><p>Using his medallion to travel to the Dark Lord\u2019s prison, Gaius placed the child in the swirling mists and lowered himself to his knees. Bending his head, he waited for his presence to be noticed.</p><p>He sensed time passing, although it was impossible to judge the exact length in the strange fog, and in truth, he didn\u2019t really care. Since his last t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with the Dark Lord he\u2019d become . . . what? Not indifferent. Not even numb.</p><p>It was more a sensation of being resigned. As if the last thread of hope he\u2019d clung to since the death of Dara had snapped, leaving him to float in a sea of defeat.</p><p>He would do as he was commanded, quite simply because he had no choice. But his fierce belief that he would soon be reunited with his mate was fading with every passing hour, leaving behind an empty void.</p><p>Eventually, he felt the crushing power that warned of the Dark Lord\u2019s steady approach. He shuddered at the sensation of his skin being flayed from his flesh, but he wisely kept his head lowered.</p><p>\u201cAh, Gaius.\u201d A girlish giggle sliced through the fog. \u201cSo you have learned discretion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes . . .\u201d He struggled for a suitable title. \u201cMistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMistress, hmmm. I suppose that will do.\u201d</p><p>Gaius kept his head down. \u201cI have brought you the child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have.\u201d He felt a stir of air, the punishing pain easing. \u201cBring him to me.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly glancing up, Gaius discovered the Dark Lord had created a throne out of the swirling mist and was perched on it, wearing a white sundress. Cristo. She looked like a Homecoming Queen, not the ultimate of all evil. Then the crimson fires of hell flared in the guileless blue eyes, ruining the image of purity.</p><p>\u201cGaius?\u201d she snapped with impatience. \u201cI\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mistress.\u201d</p><p>Rising to his feet, Gaius scooped the child into his arms, refusing to glance down. The baby had always been destined to be sacrificed. There was nothing he could do to alter fate, was there? Shoving the warm bundle into the female\u2019s outstretched arms, he backed away and stoically waited for her next commands.</p><p>The Dark Lord gave a lift of her brow. \u201cDon\u2019t you intend to demand your payment?\u201d</p><p>Gaius shrugged. \u201cWould it do any good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to pout, vampire,\u201d the lethal female chided. \u201cYou shall soon be given your just rewards.\u201d</p><p>Just rewards.</p><p>Gaius shuddered, recalling Dolf being consumed by black mist. At this moment the only reward he dared hope for was escaping the encounter without some hideous torture.</p><p>\u201cShall I return to my lair and await your next command?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSurely you want to witness my glorious resurrection as the Gemini?\u201d The evil creature sounded truly shocked that Gaius wasn\u2019t begging for the opportunity to bask in her transformation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only your humble servant,\u201d Gaius reminded her. \u201cThere are others much more worthy for such a blessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Gaius.\u201d The blue eyes shimmered with crimson fire, the pain returning to slam him to his knees. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better, I might think you were anxious to leave me.\u201d</p><p>Careful, a voice whispered in the back of his mind. This female was a god. Which meant her vanity was as inflated as her powers. Just the implication that he might prefer to be somewhere else would be enough to earn him punishment.</p><p>\u201cNot anxious, but I do need to feed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can wait.\u201d</p><p>It was a command, not a suggestion. Gaius nodded in defeat. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>Confident that Gaius was playing the dutiful audience, the female turned her attention to the child squirming in her arms. Her expression was one of clinical curiosity, as if making sure there weren\u2019t any defects in her creation.</p><p>\u201cA charming baby, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Gaius frowned. Was this a trick question? It was well known that children were an Achilles\u2019 heel to vampires. They instinctively refused to harm a baby of any species. Or even a pregnant female.</p><p>\u201cYes. Charming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never understood the fuss made over offspring. Slaves are easier to control and less inclined to be a disappointment.\u201d The Dark Lord wrinkled her nose, sniffing the baby\u2019s diaper. \u201cThey also smell better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost creatures feel the urge to procreate.\u201d</p><p>The Dark Lord lifted her head, the blue eyes flickering with crimson. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>Gaius flinched. He didn\u2019t believe in coincidences. So why was he being forced to think of Santiago yet again?</p><p>A warning?</p><p>\u201cYes. I have\u2014\u201d He halted, grimacing as he corrected his words. \u201cI had a son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>Gaius shook his head. \u201cNo, but he\u2019s lost to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost?\u201d The Dark Lord frowned. \u201cYou make no sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt no longer matters.\u201d Anxious to turn the conversation away from Santiago, Gaius pointed toward the baby. \u201cWhat will you do with the child?\u201d</p><p>There was a long, tense moment as the female no doubt considered the pleasure of tormenting Gaius with the loss of his son. Then, abruptly losing interest, the female instead returned her attention to the babe.</p><p>\u201cHe will become a part of me as it was always destined to be. But first . . .\u201d</p><p>The words trailed away and Gaius stiffened. Now what? He\u2019d captured the prophet and her protector, as well as the baby. Two impossible tasks. He\u2019d gone beyond the call of duty, hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>It would seem not, he silently accepted as the Dark Lord sent him a frown, clearly waiting for him to react.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Her dimples flashed. \u201cA sacrifice must be made.\u201d</p><p>He hissed in sharp surprise. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>Her smile widened at his sharp flare of fear. \u201cAre you offering?\u201d</p><p>He grimly fought back his panic. \u201cI doubt I would be suitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMistress, please . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Gaius. As you said, you don\u2019t have the blood I need,\u201d she mocked in cruel tones, her eyes nearly consumed by flames. \u201cNot quite so impervious to the thought of death as you wanted to believe, are you, Gaius?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened in humiliation. It wasn\u2019t surprising the Dark Lord had sensed his growing apathy. Or that she\u2019d managed to shatter his illusion that it no longer mattered whether he lived or died.</p><p>Bitch.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want me to return to the world and acquire what you need?\u201d he demanded in careful tones.</p><p>\u201cActually, I have what I need close at hand.\u201d</p><p>Gaius glanced around the thick fog. It couldn\u2019t be too close. \u201cWho is to be the sacrifice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaine should have destroyed the prophet by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaine? Impossible,\u201d Gaius muttered, too shocked to guard his tongue. He\u2019d seen Caine defending the prophet. The Were had been willing to die to protect the female. Then sharp shards of pain stabbed into his body, reminding him the danger of speaking without thinking. \u201cI mean, Caine is devoted to the prophet. He would never harm her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks to Dolf \u2019s spell Caine wasn\u2019t in his right mind,\u201d she reminded him, a coy smile touching her lips. \u201cAnd, of course, I might have encouraged his madness.\u201d</p><p>Gaius thrust aside his disbelief, instead concentrating on the more important question. \u201cBut why?\u201d He slowly rose to his feet. \u201cYou were desperate to capture Cassandra.\u201d</p><p>The Dark Lord glanced down at the child, the air filled with a searing anger before the creature managed to regain her composure. \u201cShe proved to be a severe disappointment.\u201d</p><p>Gaius felt the hairs on his nape stand upright. Disappointment could have any number of meanings.</p><p>Maybe Cassandra refused to cooperate. Or maybe she hadn\u2019t had a vision since her capture. Or maybe the visions had been impossible to decipher.</p><p>But Gaius didn\u2019t think it was any of those things.</p> <p>If the Dark Lord was willing to destroy the seer, it was because she gave a prophecy that she didn\u2019t like.</p><p>Which could only mean bad news for Gaius.</p><p>Cristo. He was growngly convinced that he would never be reunited with his mate. Now he had to face the possibility the deity who had purchased his soul was destined to fail, dragging Gaius into the pits of hell with her. \u201cA pity,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>The Dark Lord jerked her head up, regarding him with a fiery glare. \u201cRetrieve the dog and bring him to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt once.\u201d</p><p>With a deep bow, Gaius turned to disappear in the swirling mist, following the distant scent of Were.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t know how long she ran through the disorienting mist. Or which direction she was going. Her only thought was to try and evade Caine as he chased her with a crazed bloodlust.</p> <p>At last accepting there was no place to hide and no way to shake off her pursuer, she came to a weary halt. Turning, she held up a pleading hand. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>Astonishingly the Were slowed, pacing around her as he sniffed the air, as if searching for a hidden trap. Or maybe he was savoring the scent of dinner, she wryly conceded, waiting for him to stand directly in front of her, his blue eyes glowing with the power of his wolf.</p><p>She forced herself to hold that hungry gaze, desperate to reach the man who was buried beneath the rabid animal.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Caine, listen to me,\u201d she urged softly. \u201cYou have to remember. Look deep inside, you know me.\u201d</p><p>The creature curled back his lips to expose his massive fangs, his mutated features lacking any hint of recognition.</p><p>So this was it.</p><p>The end.</p><p>Accepting that she was on the brink of death, Cassie squared her shoulders and waited for the killing blow.</p><p>A blow that never came.</p><p>Instead, Caine turned his head to glance over her shoulder, his half-formed paws lifting to expose his razor-sharp claws.</p><p>Now what? Cassie cautiously moved so she could keep an eye on Caine as well as the stirring fog behind her. Whatever was coming was enough of a threat to make Caine crouch in preparation of battle.</p><p>Then she caught the distant scent of vampire. A vampire she recognized.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>Just freaking perfect.</p><p>There was another swirl of fog before the thick shroud parted to reveal the dark-haired leech who had brought them to this hellhole.</p><p>\u201cGaius,\u201d she breathed, the word a curse.</p><p>Coming to a halt, the vampire offered a small dip of his head. \u201cSeer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bastard.\u201d She fisted her hands, wishing she had the strength to rip out his unbeating heart. \u201cThis is all your fault.\u201d</p><p>A dark brow arched at the accusation. \u201cIt was Dolf \u2019s spell that turned your protector into that\u201d\u2014he waved a hand toward the watchful Caine\u2014\u201cmonstrosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn your command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot mine,\u201d the vampire denied, his pale face oddly stripped of its previous arrogance. \u201cAnd you will be happy to know that Dolf \u2019s been suitably punished.\u201d He took a step forward. \u201cHe suffered one of the most gruesome deaths I\u2019ve ever witnessed.\u201d</p><p>Caine growled, his fierce gaze shifting between Cassie and Gaius. No doubt deciding which one of them he wanted to kill first.</p><p>\u201cStay back,\u201d Cassie snapped, covertly angling herself to stand between Gaius and Caine.</p><p>Ridiculous, of course. One or the other was bound to kill her, but she\u2019d be damned if she let the vampire hurt Caine.</p><p>The vampire obviously found her protective urges equally incongruous. \u201cIsn\u2019t there a human saying about being between a rock and a hard place?\u201d he asked with a sneer, giving a wave of his hand toward the growling Caine.</p><p>Cassie hissed as the air shimmered with a curtain of power that hung between her and the suddenly infuriated Were.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d she demanded, flinching as Caine charged the nearly invisible obstruction only to bounce backward with a startled snarl.</p><p>Clearly pissed off, Caine shook off his pain and attempted to break through once again. And again. And again.</p><p>Cassie pressed her hand to her lips as he crashed into the impenetrable wall over and over, his patchy fur becoming coated with blood, and his face contorted with frustration. At last, maddened by his inability to reach his prey, he tilted back his head to howl with the promise of death.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a temporary barrier,\u201d Gaius said with a grimace, instinctively stepping away from the deranged beast. \u201cIt will only last a few minutes so we must speak quickly.\u201d</p><p>Cassie turned to glare at the vampire. \u201cYou have nothing to say that I want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so certain.\u201d</p><p>Something in his icy voice made Cassie swallow her words of searing hatred, regarding him with a wary suspicion. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Dark Lord sent me.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. Was that supposed to be a big shocker? \u201cNo doubt to kill me?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Gaius shrugged. \u201cActually, you\u2019re supposed to be dead already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to disappoint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one you disappointed.\u201d</p><p>Cassie frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>The vampire smoothed a hand down his once elegant suit jacket now coated in dust and torn in several places. \u201cI assume you were foolish enough to share a prophecy that annoyed the Dark Lord?\u201d</p><p>Like she had a choice?</p><p>She hunched her shoulder. \u201cI have no control over the visions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope.\u201d</p><p>He made a choked sound, wise enough to comprehend the power of that one word. \u201cAh. A dangerous viewing.\u201d An expression of aching despair touched his pale face before his frigid composure was slammed back into place. \u201cNo wonder the Dark Lord was anxious to be rid of you.\u201d</p><p>She studied the vampire with a growing confusion. What did he want from her?</p><p>A promise the Dark Lord would be successful in returning to the world? A vision of his own?</p><p>An opportunity to torment her before she was killed?</p><p>\u201cMy death won\u2019t alter the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlter? Perhaps not.\u201d He seemed to consider his words. \u201cBut it might tilt the balance.\u201d</p><p>Cassie waved aside his words. The future was in the future. She was far more concerned with the present. \u201cIs that why the Dark Lord wants me dead?\u201d</p><p>A humorless smile touched his lips. \u201cThe mistress doesn\u2019t need a reason to want you dead. It\u2019s enough that you no longer serve a purpose.\u201d</p><p>True enough. So why hadn\u2019t he struck the killing blow? Was it possible his commitment to his evil mistress was fading? And if it was, why?</p><p>No. It didn\u2019t matter why. All that mattered was how she could exploit his wavering loyalty.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still serve a purpose?\u201d</p><p>The lean face was closed, unreadable. \u201cMy command is to bring the Were to the Dark Lord.\u201d</p><p>Oh, gods. Cassie glanced over her shoulder at Caine, who paced with obvious agitation behind the barrier, his eyes smoldering with a mindless violence. If the Dark Lord wanted him, it couldn\u2019t be for any good reason. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has the child.\u201d</p><p>Lost in her fear for Caine, it took Cassie a second to realize the full extent of the vampire\u2019s words.</p> <p>The Alpha.</p><p>It was here even after her attempt to send a warning to Styx.

She refused to concede defeat.</p> <p>At last she forced her stiff lips to move. \u201cShe\u2019s become the Gemini?\u201d</p><p>Gaius gave a lift of his shoulder, his gaze returning to Caine. \u201cThe ceremony will be completed once she has a suitable sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>Cassie tensed. No. No. No. Shifting until she stood directly between the vampire and Caine, she prepared to fight to the death.</p><p>There was no way in hell the Dark Lord was going to use Caine to unleash her perverted hordes on the world.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Gaius returned his attention to her, the dark gaze studying her resolute expression. \u201cThe choice is not yours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe not, but do you think you can defeat both of us?\u201d she bluffed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not powerless.\u201d</p><p>She spread her legs, her body poised for attack. \u201cNeither am I.\u201d</p><p>The vampire looked more curious than angered by her defiance. \u201cYou intend to protect him even though he just tried to kill you?\u201d</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cOf course. What would you do to protect your mate?\u201d</p><p>That bleak despair returned to the dark eyes as Gaius seemed to be overwhelmed by some unwelcomed memory. \u201cSell my soul.\u201d</p><p>Cassie took a hesitant step forward, the vague hope returning at the vampire\u2019s hint of emotion. A creature who felt that deeply couldn\u2019t be completely evil.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the only one between a rock and a hard place, am I?\u201d she asked softly.</p> <p>He stiffened, belatedly realizing that he\u2019d revealed more than he intended. \u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never too late.\u201d She took another step forward, her expression unabashedly pleading. What did she care about pride? She\u2019d crawl on her knees and kiss the damned vampire\u2019s feet if he could use his powers to get them out of the fog. \u201cHelp us.\u201d</p><p>He gave a short, humorless laugh. \u201cYou believe I can be reformed after all these centuries?\u201d</p><p>Did she?</p><p>Cassie grimaced. Why hadn\u2019t she honed her lying skills? It seemed every time she turned around she needed to tell one fib or another.</p><p>Now she could only shrug and hedge around the truth. \u201cMy vision offered hope. For all of us.\u201d She held out a slender hand, a sudden shiver inching down her spine. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence and Cassie was forced to bite her tongue as the sense of urgency pulsed through her. Something was coming. Something bad.</p><p>But Gaius was skittish enough without her pressing him.</p><p>After what felt like an eternity, he at last muttered a low curse. \u201cI am bound to regret this.\u201d</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t have time to feel relief. Not when the heavy sense of approaching doom was thickening the air until she couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cCan you get us out of here?\u201d she rasped.</p><p>The vampire clutched the pendant hung around his neck. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, as if concentrating on his powers, at the same moment a singsong voice sliced through the air.</p><p>\u201cGaius.\u201d The approaching female purred, a searing heat blasting against Cassie and nearly sending her to her feet. \u201cWhere are you, you naughty vampire?\u201d</p><p>Caine tilted back his head to howl, whether in fury or fear it was impossible to say. Gaius, on the other hand, kept his eyes tightly shut, a shaken expression on his pale face.</p><p>\u201cCristo,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWe are out of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcentrate,\u201d Cassie urged, gritting her teeth as blisters began to form on her skin and Caine whined in sudden pain.</p><p>In answer, Gaius grasped her arm in a punishing grip. Cassie flinched before she realized that the world was beginning to fade to black.</p><p>\u201cNo . . .\u201d She struggled to break from his grasp. \u201cI won\u2019t leave without Caine.\u201d</p><p>Gaius scowled, refusing to release her. \u201cAre you insane? He\u2019ll kill you. If the Dark Lord doesn\u2019t manage to do it for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She grimly yanked herself free, immediately returning to the fog and searing hot agony. \u201cI won\u2019t leave without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid dogs,\u201d Gaius muttered, giving a wave of his hand.</p><p>The barrier was removed, but the pulsing heat had driven Caine to his knees, making his animal cower in pain.</p><p>Thank the gods.</p><p>Moving to crouch at his side, she held out her hand toward Gaius.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming,\u201d she warned the vampire as he appeared to hesitate.</p><p>Like he couldn\u2019t feel the jagged shards of power for himself.</p><p>Then, with a resigned shake of his head, he grasped her outstretched hand and the darkness once again began to form like a bubble around them.</p><p>In the distance, Cassie heard a shriek that nearly shattered her eardrums.</p><p>\u201cNo. What are you doing, you fool?\u201d The fog parted to reveal the slender young female with eyes that glowed with a fiery crimson. \u201cYou will not escape me.\u201d</p><p>The darkness continued to thicken, but not swiftly enough. Cassie quivered as the female was flowing through the mists, her pretty face twisted with an unholy fury.</p><p>With a speed that was nearly too swift to follow, she was at their side, shoving her arm into the rift that Gaius was forming and grabbing the vampire by his hair.</p><p>\u201cGaius,\u201d Cassie breathed in terror, feeling the bubble begin to falter.</p><p>The vampire\u2019s dark eyes widened with a bone-deep fear, but surprisingly, he gave her a shove toward the center of the rift.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>Cassie wavered, realizing in astonishment that the vampire intended to sacrifice himself to save them.</p><p>But why? Hadn\u2019t he been the one to hunt them down, torture Caine with the cur\u2019s hideous spell, and then haul them to this mysterious dimension so he could offer them to the Dark Lord?</p><p>Why would he betray his mistress now?</p><p>The question had barely formed when it was crushed beneath a powerful vision that blasted through her mind. She groaned. The vivid image was there and gone before she could fully process it, but she did comprehend enough to know that it was a warning.</p><p>Not for her. But for the vampire who was being yanked out of the rift by the infuriated Dark Lord.</p><p>\u201cGaius, listen to me,\u201d she shouted over the evil deity\u2019s screams of frustration. \u201cA face, no matter how familiar, can be a lie.\u201d</p><p>His head was bent backward, blood running down his forehead, but he managed to send her a puzzled frown. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t trust your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Still regarding her with confusion, Gaius was sharply jerked out of the bubble and tossed aside. Cassie caught a glimpse of him lying in an unconscious heap before the arm was shoved back into the contracting darkness, reaching toward Caine.</p><p>\u201cI will not be denied my sacrifice,\u201d the Dark Lord snarled.</p><p>Clearly sensing the danger, Caine growled low in his throat, his teeth bared. The female ignored the threat, grabbing Caine by the scruff of his contorted neck.</p><p>Cassie wasn\u2019t certain if the Dark Lord assumed Caine was incapable of hurting her, or if she thought she was the big-bad scary and nothing had the courage to fight back.</p><p>Whatever her logic, she grossly underestimated the level of Caine\u2019s crazy. Even as her fingers dug into his fur, the frantic Were turned his head to sink his teeth deep into her forearm.</p><p>Cassie wasn\u2019t foolish enough to believe that Caine could truly hurt the powerful creature, but he did provide a distraction. No doubt the only one they were going to get. Which meant escape was now or never.</p><p>Without giving herself time to think, Cassie rushed forward, taking full advantage of the element of surprise as she slammed her body straight into Caine.</p><p>Her intention had merely been to knock him away from the Dark Lord. After that . . . well, the truth was that she didn\u2019t really have a plan.</p><p>But her unexpected attack made Caine stumble awkwardly, his teeth ripping deep gouges in the Dark Lord\u2019s arm as he fell backward. In the same motion, he wrapped a thickly muscled arm around Cassie\u2019s waist, pulling her down with him.</p><p>There was another screech from the Dark Lord as the darkness flowed around them, sucking them through the still open rift.</p><p>Cassie groaned as Caine\u2019s claws dug into her back, but there was no breaking away from his ruthless grip as they fell through the empty space. Besides, she didn\u2019t want to get free.</p><p>For the moment they were falling farther and farther from the infuriated Dark Lord.</p><p>She didn\u2019t care where they were going.</p><p>It had to be better than where they were.</p><p>The middle of nowhere, Illinois</p><p>After running nonstop for the past two hours, Styx came to a sharp halt in the center of the narrow road, which was rapidly being overtaken by weeds. In silence, he studied the empty factory that was shrouded in shadows. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It took a minute to realize why the dilapidated building had caught his attention. There was no blinking arrow pointing to it with the words \u201cEvil Minion Lair.\u201d Or nasty creatures peering out the shattered windows, wearing bad-guy uniforms.</p><p>Just the opposite.</p><p>At a glance, it would be easy to assume that nothing had disturbed the crumbling pile of brick and steel for years. There were no footprints, no animal droppings, not even a spiderweb.</p> <p>But to Styx it was the very lack of trespassers, both human and animal, that proved there was something very powerful that lurked in the area.</p><p>\u201cWait, Levet,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>The stunted gargoyle came to a grudging halt, turning to glare at him with obvious impatience. \u201cPourquoi? We are finally gaining on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKostas is near.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon.\u201d The tiny demon shook his head, pointed down the isolated road that headed toward the distant lights of St. Louis. \u201cHis trail continues into town.\u201d</p> <p>Styx pointed toward the silent warehouse. \u201cHe doubled back.\u201d</p><p>Darcy moved to stand next to him, her head tilted to the side as she studied his stubborn expression. \u201cHow can you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I would do.\u201d</p><p>Levet\u2019s wings fluttered as he stomped back toward Styx. \u201cAnd that is all the evidence you have?\u201d</p><p>Styx ignored the aggravating pest, lifting his hand to bring Jagr and Jaelyn from the shadows where they were standing guard.</p><p>\u201cJagr, circle to the back of the building. Make sure nothing escapes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>The massive Goth disappeared in a blur of speed, his sword already drawn and his fangs flashing in the moonlight.</p><p>\u201cJaelyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d The tiny Hunter stroked the stock of her sawed-off shotgun, her eyes shimmering with anticipation. She more than anyone had suffered beneath Kostas\u2019s arrogant harassment. Hell, the bastard had wanted to execute her. It was no wonder she was anxious to get her hands on the ex-Ruah.</p><p>\u201cOn the roof.\u201d</p><p>She was off with the same blinding speed as Jagr, blending into the darkness. Still Styx remained at the edge of the road, forcing himself to wait until his soldiers were in place.</p><p>Restlessly his gaze skimmed over the two-story building. The bricks had faded to a dull shade of rust with occasional rods of rebar sticking out like thorns. The roof was sagging and the window frames were rotted beyond repair. Closer at hand, the parking lot was cracked with large clumps of grass growing wild.</p><p>There was, however, a new lock on the double steel doors and the faint hint of fairy that lingered in the air. Kostas had no doubt brought dinner with him.</p> <p>On the point of heading into the warehouse, Styx was halted as Levet waddled to stand directly in his path.</p><p>\u201cWhat of me?\u201d</p><p>He bit back a curse of impatience. \u201cKeep an eye on the road. I don\u2019t want anything or anyone sneaking up on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBah.\u201d Levet\u2019s tail twitched. \u201cMy talents are wasted out here.\u201d</p><p>Styx scowled. \u201cWhat talents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe he\u2019s referring to his magic,\u201d Darcy gently reminded him, a faint smile curving her lips.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Levet pointed a claw toward Styx. \u201cYou are just trying to be rid of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Styx folded his arms over his chest. \u201cIf you want to fight one of the most powerful vampires to walk the earth, who has not only trained for the past millennium to become the ultimate assassin, but has recently sold his soul to the Dark Lord, then you can take the lead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d The gargoyle cleared his throat, scratching one horn as he glanced toward the deserted road. \u201cPerhaps it would be best if I keep guard out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood choice,\u201d Styx said dryly. Then, knowing the next battle wasn\u2019t going to be so easily won, he turned to study his stubborn mate with a warning glare. \u201cYou,\u201d he growled, cupping her chin in his hand. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>Any other creature would have fainted in sheer terror. Styx was a demon who put the bad in badass.</p><p>Darcy, of course, rose on her tiptoes and poked her finger into the center of his chest. As badass as Styx might be, he was no match for this tiny Were.</p><p>\u201cAnd let you go in there alone?\u201d Her eyes sparked with emerald embers. \u201cNo. Way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you Darcy me.\u201d Poke, poke, poke. Her finger nearly drilled a hole through his chest.</p><p>He grabbed her hand to lift it to his lips, as much to end her painful prodding as to offer her comfort. \u201cAngel, we both know that Kostas is foaming at the mouth to get his hands on me after I demoted him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is precisely why you shouldn\u2019t be the one to confront him,\u201d she pointed out through clenched teeth. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously gone over the edge.\u201d</p><p>Styx shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s also involved with the plot to return the Dark Lord. It\u2019s my duty to stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t he already done his part?\u201d Darcy demanded with a scowl.</p><p>Styx growled at the unwelcomed reminder. His fangs ached for blood. Kostas\u2019s blood. The bastard had snuck into his lair and stolen the precious baby who had become as beloved to him as if he were his own son. And why? Because his bloated pride had been dented at being removed as the head of the Addonexus.</p><p>\u201cOne part. At least, that we know about,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to know if there\u2019s more. And just as importantly, I need to know if I have more traitors among my people.\u201d</p><p>Darcy froze, their bond allowing her to fully feel the sense of unbearable failure that pulsed through him. \u201cYou think he\u2019ll confess the truth to you?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cHe believes he\u2019s beaten me. He\u2019s too arrogant not to boast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>She heaved a resigned sigh, her beautiful features somber as she stepped forward to lay her head over his unbeating heart.</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>Styx pressed his lips to the top of her head, savoring the feel of her warmth seep into his chilled blood. How the hell had he ever survived without this astonishing female?</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t I always?\u201d</p><p>She harrumphed, pulling back to reveal her frown. \u201cBeing immortal doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re immune to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, angel.\u201d He brushed his lips over her forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting rid of me that easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStyx,\u201d she muttered, needing to be reassured that he wouldn\u2019t allow his desire for revenge to overcome his common sense.</p><p>\u201cI will take the greatest care, I promise,\u201d he swore, stroking another kiss over her forehead before shifting his gaze toward the hovering gargoyle. \u201cTake care of her.\u201d</p><p>Levet gave a solemn dip of his head. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Pulling away from his mate, Styx turned to cross the empty parking lot. It was too late for a stealth approach. Thank the gods. Six-foot-five Aztec warriors didn\u2019t do sneaky. At least not very well.</p><p>Of course, they did do destruction quite well, he consoled himself, slamming his foot against the steel doors. With an ear-piercing screech the doors were wrenched off their hinges and flying across the narrow lobby.</p><p>Styx didn\u2019t hesitate. Jogging across the peeling linoleum, he ignored the doors that opened into the warehouse floor and instead headed for the stairs that led to the basement. The air was edged with a distinct chill as he descended into the darkness, and pulling his sword from its scabbard, Styx followed the thickening scent of fairy.</p><p>The traitor was near.</p><p>Pressing his back against the wall, Styx inched his way down the narrow corridor, slowly entering the room at the end.</p><p>A swift glance revealed that it was little more than a six-by-six cement box that had been stripped of everything but a long wooden table that was stained with blood.</p><p>An altar?</p><p>It would explain why Kostas had run to this location. He no doubt hoped his new mistress would protect him from Styx\u2019s wrath. Where else would he go to seek her assistance, but to the shrine where he worshipped her?</p><p>Curling his lips in disgust, Styx stepped through the doorway, briefly glancing toward the fairy who was cowering in the corner. The poor creature was shivering in obvious terror, her deep red hair hanging in tangles around her tear-stained face and her arms wrapped around her naked body. It was her wide gaze, however, that captured Styx\u2019s attention.</p><p>Following the direction where she stared in obvious terror, Styx moved to stand directly beside the altar.</p><p>\u201cYou can drop the shadows, Kostas,\u201d he commanded. \u201cI know you\u2019re here. I smell your worthless ass.\u201d</p><p>The musty air stirred, and then the darkness in front of him faded to reveal Kostas.</p><p>Wearing a too-tight T-shirt that matched his cammo pants, the vampire gripped a large dagger in his hands. Another dagger was strapped to his waist with two guns holstered on each side of his chest. He looked like a paranoid Rambo on steroids.</p><p>With a snort, Styx move forward, his lips twisting with amusement as the large Hunter took a hasty step backward, his hands curled into tight fists. Then, realizing what he\u2019d revealed, the vampire squared his broad shoulders and glared at Styx. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid your nasty little pet rock manage to lead you here?\u201d he mocked.</p><p>Styx shrugged. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be ashamed,\u201d Kostas sneered. \u201cNo self-respecting Anasso would need the talents of lesser demons to fulfill his duties. Especially not a stunted gargoyle that has been banned by his own guild. You are a disgrace to vampires.\u201d</p> <p>Styx flashed his fangs. The savage desire to slash open the bastard\u2019s throat pulsed through him.</p><p>It was only the knowledge that he couldn\u2019t afford to destroy the traitor until he was convinced he didn\u2019t have any information that could help to rescue Maluhia that kept him from striking the killing blow.</p><p>Then . . . oh then, the bastard was going to become up close and personal with a whole world of hurt.</p><p>\u201cYou dare to claim that I\u2019ve disgraced myself when you are one who has betrayed your own people?\u201d he accused with frigid disdain. \u201cAnd for what?\u201d He pointed his sword toward the center of the barren room. \u201cThis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will soon discover.\u201d The dark eyes glittered with a feral hatred. \u201cThe child has been delivered and nothing can halt the return of the Dark Lord.\u201d</p> <p>Styx hissed in pain despite having suspected that Maluhia was in the hands of the evil bitch. Someday very soon he intended to obliterate everyone responsible for the kidnapping. For now, however, he could only try to provoke the traitor into revealing what information he might possess.</p><p>\u201cThen shouldn\u2019t you be out celebrating instead of lurking in this filthy basement?\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cIn good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you haven\u2019t been tossed aside now that you\u2019ve served your purpose?\u201d</p><p>Kostas\u2019s grip tightened on the dagger, but he wasn\u2019t stupid enough to try and attack. They both knew that in a fair fight Styx would kick his ass.</p><p>\u201cI shall soon have my rewards.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Styx continued to prod. \u201cWhy the delay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you truly believe I would be idiotic enough to reveal the Dark Lord\u2019s plans to you?\u201d the Hunter snarled.</p><p>Styx\u2019s scornful laugh filled the room. \u201cNo, because you don\u2019t know his\u2014\u201d He stopped with a grimace, silently reminding himself that the Dark Lord was no longer a he. \u201cHer plans. At least no more than any other bottom-feeder might have picked up.\u201d</p><p>Kostas puffed out his chest, but Styx sensed his taunting words had hit a nerve. The vampire wasn\u2019t nearly as confident in his new mistress as he wanted Styx to believe.</p><p>\u201cA bottom-feeder wouldn\u2019t have been able to steal the babe from beneath your nose.\u201d He deliberately reminded Styx of his failure. \u201cYou and those Ravens who think they\u2019re better than the rest of us. Arrogant SOBs.\u201d</p><p>The vampire\u2019s jealousy of Styx and his Ravens was a tangible force in the air. Christ, it was no wonder that his festering bitterness had driven him into the service of the Dark Lord. The only surprise was that it took so long.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019ve been used and discarded. Not a surprise.\u201d Styx flicked a dismissive gaze down the man\u2019s stiff body, lingering on the weapons before returning to meet the dark, resentful glare. \u201cYou have always had an overly bloated opinion of your worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing,\u201d the vampire blustered. \u201cThe mistress has favored me above all others.\u201d</p> <p>Styx shook his head as he heard the desperation in the man\u2019s voice. He was wasting his time. This idiot was nothing but another meaningless minion that had believed the promises whispered by the Dark Lord. Pathetic.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who knows nothing,\u201d he growled, lifting his sword. \u201cWhich means I have no reason to keep you alive.\u201d</p><p>Realizing that Styx had every intention of chopping off his head, Kostas backed up until he hit the corner of the table. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m pretty sure I can. Do you want me to demonstrate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Styx smiled with anticipation. \u201cIt was more of a rhetorical question.\u201d</p><p>With a futile effort to halt his inevitable death, the Hunter vaulted over the table, his gaze lifted heavenward. \u201cHear me, blessed mistress.\u201d</p><p>Styx rolled his eyes. Idiot. \u201cYou don\u2019t actually think\u2014\u201d</p><p>His mocking words were interrupted as a sizzling heat seared through the room.</p><p>With a grunt of surprise, Styx gripped his sword, sensing the approach of something . . . big.</p><p>Something big and bad and evil.</p><p>Had the bastard actually managed to call the Dark Lord? It would be just his luck that of all the pathetic pleas, the treacherous bitch would choose to hear Kostas. If only to screw with Styx.</p><p>He took an instinctive step backward, warily watching the shimmering line that formed directly over the table. The long, thin streak didn\u2019t look like a portal, although he was no expert.</p><p>Actually, it looked like the air had been sliced open.</p><p>Kostas continued his crazy babble, but Styx kept his attention pinned to the wavering line. Slowly it began to widen, as if the air was being ripped open by a profound power. Gods, was this it? Was this the moment of the Dark Lord\u2019s return?</p><p>He briefly considered yelling for Jagr and Jaelyn, only to squash the impulse. What was the point until he could be certain he wasn\u2019t calling them to certain death?</p><p>The heat intensified, bringing with it the stench of burned sulfur. Styx shuddered, but he refused to budge another step. The time to run was gone.</p><p>He would take a stand and pray for the best.</p><p>As if mocking his spurt of bravado, the heat that seared against his skin became laced with electric jolts of pain. As if he was being skewered by unseen lightning.</p><p>Holy . . . shit.</p><p>He felt like a shish kebab being grilled over an open flame.</p><p>The rift spread wider and with a low moan, Kostas fell to his knees. \u201cMistress, you have heard the pleas of your most loyal servant.\u201d</p><p>The stench of burning sulfur thickened, nearly making Styx gag. Kostas, however, had an expression of euphoria as a light spilled through the rip in space to spill over him.</p><p>\u201cThe sacrifice,\u201d a voice pulsed through the air, nearly driving Styx to his knees.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kostas appeared momentarily confused. Then, his puzzled gaze shifted to the fairy who had been wise enough to faint. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>Scrambling to his feet, Kostas darted across the room and scooped the limp female in his arms. Styx took a step forward, his first thought to protect the fairy from the evil that blanketed the room. But even as he moved, the blazing light flared toward him, driving him backward.</p><p>Blinded, Styx lifted his sword, hearing Kostas cross the room and the sound of the fairy being dumped on the table.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d the vampire said. \u201cMy offering for you.\u201d</p><p>Styx\u2019s eyes cleared in time to see a glowing hand reach through the rift to grasp the fairy by her hair, yanking her into the black mist that swirled on the other side of the opening.</p><p>\u201cYou have served me well, Kostas.\u201d There was a low laugh that sent shards of agony shooting through Styx\u2019s brain. \u201cA pity you shall not survive to appreciate your efforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Belatedly realizing he was about to be abandoned by his faithless mistress, Kostas leaped onto the table, his hand reaching through the opening. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Styx had only a moment to appreciate the sight of the once-smug vampire\u2019s groveling before the black mist boiled from the rift. In the blink of an eye the darkness was crawling over the screaming Kostas, consuming him on a cellular level.</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Styx leaped backward, watching in horror as the powerful vampire became nothing more than a stain on the table.</p><p>He half expected the mist to continue pouring into the room, destroying everything in its path. Instead, it retreated back through the opening.</p><p>Styx had a brief second of relief. Just enough time to believe he\u2019d dodged a bullet, he wryly conceded as all hell broke loose.</p><p>Quite literally.</p><p>Even as the black mist receded, Styx caught a glimpse of a crimson-tinted landscape with black, razor-sharp rocks that were dissected by rivers of flowing lava. The opening had shifted from the Dark Lord\u2019s prison to a hell dimension\u2014whether by accident or intent, he didn\u2019t know. All he was certain of was that a creature that looked something like a troll with a large, muscular body covered in a thick, hairless hide and a large head with beady crimson eyes and a snout with protruding fangs was crawling through the opening.</p><p>The creature smashed the table, his clenched fists the size of a sledgehammer. And no doubt they would cause as much damage if they happened to be aimed at Styx\u2019s face.</p><p>Something he didn\u2019t intend to find out.</p><p>\u201cJagr,\u201d he roared, his feet spread wide and his sword lifted to strike. \u201cJaelyn.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Cassie cursed as the portal that Gaius had created abruptly collapsed, leaving them trapped in the white mist.</p><p>Although . . . She frowned, scanning the swirling fog. It didn\u2019t feel as if it were the same white mist. She couldn\u2019t see more than a few inches in front of her face, but the scalding pain from the Dark Lord had faded and the sense of endless space had narrowed to the sensation they were in a long corridor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Odd.</p><p>Equally confused by their surroundings, Caine released his bruising hold on Cassie to rise to his feet with a low growl.</p><p>Swift to take advantage of his momentary distraction, Cassie scooted away, warily straightening as she considered her extremely limited options.</p> <p>She could run, but Caine would swiftly catch her. And rousing his predator instincts seemed like a bad thing right now.</p><p>She could try to overpower him, but it would be a wasted effort. His strength had been increasing at an accelerated pace since he\u2019d been turned into a Were. She would be no match for him now.</p><p>And in his current state he was beyond trying to reason with. Which left what?</p><p>She didn\u2019t have an answer, but even as Caine started to turn back toward her, the unmistakable scent of vampire filled the air.</p><p>Cassie froze, scanning the thick mist. Could it be Gaius? No. Not Gaius. But the scent was familiar.</p> <p>Caine growled, preparing to attack as the mists stirred to reveal a large vampire with a black mohawk and honey brown eyes. Tane. The vampire Charon that she\u2019d met a few weeks before. And behind him was his mate, Laylah, the tiny half-Jinn with short, spiky red hair and black eyes.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she warned, knowing that Caine was on a razor edge. The least provocation and he would strike. \u201cDon\u2019t come any closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarley?\u201d Laylah asked in shock, then her eyes widened with comprehension. \u201cNo. Cassandra. And . . .\u201d The female grimaced as she caught sight of the hulking beast nearly hidden by the fog. \u201cCaine?\u201d</p><p>Cassie nodded, not entirely certain whether to be relieved or concerned. The Dark Lord had already implied that there was more than one vampire willing to betray their people.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m half-Jinn. I can shadow-walk,\u201d Laylah explained. \u201cHow did you . . .\u201d</p> <p>Her words broke off in a scream as Caine suddenly charged toward Cassie, perhaps fearing that the two intruders were about to steal away his prize.</p><p>Cassie braced herself as Caine grabbed her in a punishing grip, yanking her against his chest as he howled in warning. At the same time, Cassie heard Laylah commanding her mate.</p><p>\u201cTane, do something.\u201d</p><p>Cassie hissed as she felt her ribs crack beneath Caine\u2019s tight grasp, but she held up a hand as Tane moved to rescue her. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt him.\u201d</p><p>The vampire faltered in confusion. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>She struggled to breathe. \u201cDon\u2019t. Hurt. Him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d Tane stalked forward, and then with shocking speed he lifted his arm and slammed his fist into Caine\u2019s elongated jaw. The crazed Were gave a grunt of pain, and then tumbled backward as he was knocked senseless.</p><p>Cassie was thrown from Caine\u2019s arms, but swallowing her groan of pain, she crawled back to his side, her hand reaching to wipe the blood from his mutated face. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d she breathed.</p> <p>Tane folded his arms over his bare chest. He was wearing nothing more than a loose pair of khaki shorts. Well, unless you counted the humongous sword strapped to his back.</p><p>\u201cIt was that or kill him.\u201d</p><p>Logically, Cassie knew he was right. Caine might very well have squeezed her to death if the vampire hadn\u2019t interfered. But that didn\u2019t make it any easier to see Caine lying injured on the ground.</p><p>She felt a hand lightly touch her shoulder and she glanced up to discover Laylah standing next to her, an aching loss in the black eyes.</p><p>\u201cCassandra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The half-Jinn hesitated, as if afraid to ask the question hovering on her lips. \u201cMy baby,\u201d she at last breathed.</p><p>\u201cMaluhia.\u201d</p><p>Laylah pressed a hand to her heart as her mate moved to wrap a protective arm around her shoulders. \u201cHave you seen him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Cassie gave a reluctant nod. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Laylah\u2019s eyes filled with tears as she read the regret that was etched on Cassie\u2019s face. \u201cThe Dark Lord has him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201d</p><p>Laylah leaned heavily against her mate, but her face hardened with a grim determination that only a mother could claim. It warned she would move heaven and earth to get her child. And kill anything that stood in her way. \u201cI have to get to him.\u201d</p><p>Cassie bit her lip as she debated the wisdom of concealing the brutal truth from the poor woman. Then accepting it would be worse to give false hope, she slowly straightened. \u201cThe mists are impossible to penetrate without Gaius\u2019s magic necklace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGaius.\u201d Tane muttered the name as if it were a curse. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Dark Lord has him.\u201d Cassie frowned, thinking back to the vampire who had opened the portal. \u201cHe sacrificed himself so we could escape.\u201d</p><p>Tane scowled at the confession. \u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I doubt we\u2019ll ever know.\u201d Cassie shrugged, not prepared to care what had prompted the vampire to help them. Gaius may have opened the portal, but he was responsible for Caine\u2019s hideous transformation. Not to mention, forcing them to the Dark Lord\u2019s prison. No. She didn\u2019t give a damn why he\u2019d helped or what he might be suffering for his betrayal. \u201cWe have to get Caine to Salvatore.\u201d</p><p>Tane gave a sharp nod, turning to glance at his mate. \u201cLaylah?\u201d</p><p>The half-Jinn closed her eyes in concentration. \u201cHe\u2019s at Styx\u2019s lair in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t take time to wonder why the King of Weres would be in the lair of the Anasso. \u201cCan you take me there?\u201d</p><p>Laylah gave a slow nod. \u201cAs near as possible, but I must continue my search for Maluhia.\u201d</p><p>Cassie squeezed Laylah\u2019s hand, her expression filled with sympathy. \u201cOf course.\u201d She glanced toward Tane. \u201cWill you help me with Caine?\u201d</p><p>Tane moved to bend over the still unconscious Were, pausing to send Cassie a troubled glance. \u201cCassandra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She knew what he was going to say. He was going to tell her that Caine was beyond the point of help. That he\u2019d been lost between the worlds of animal and human without hope of returning to either. \u201cDon\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><p>With a grimace, the vampire grabbed Caine and tossed him over his shoulder. Then, balancing the considerable weight, he rose to his feet and nodded for Laylah to lead them through the mists.</p><p>They walked in silence for several long minutes before Tane spoke the question that had no doubt been on his mind since crossing paths with Cassie. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have any clue at how we\u2019re supposed to halt the Dark Lord.\u201d</p><p>Cassie gave a helpless lift of her hand. \u201cWe must be united.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnited?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wall must have no cracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s . . .\u201d Tane struggled for the proper word. \u201cVague.\u201d</p><p>Laylah glanced over her shoulder with a frown. \u201cTane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the powerful demon muttered. \u201cI just hate being constantly one step behind the evil bitch.\u201d</p><p>A bitter smile touched Cassie\u2019s lips as her gaze lingered on Caine. \u201cKnowing the future doesn\u2019t help prevent it.\u201d</p><p>Her soft assurance brought an end to the conversation and they continued through the mists without talking. None of them were in the mood for chitchat. Not when they were each desperate to save the ones they loved.</p><p>At long last Laylah came to a halt. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Cassie gave a lift of her brows. All she could see was mist and mist and more mist. Certainly, there was nothing to indicate they\u2019d arrived at a specific location. \u201cHow can you be certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a feeling.\u201d Laylah wrinkled her nose. \u201cI really can\u2019t explain how it works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Cassie offered an understanding smile. \u201cI get that.\u201d</p><p>Lifting her hand, Laylah formed a doorway in the swirling fog. Cassie took a step forward, only to halt when Tane shouldered his way past her.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he commanded. \u201cLet me go through first.\u201d</p><p>As if she had a choice?</p><p>Cassie shared a glance of feminine exasperation with Laylah before she leaned forward to place a gentle kiss on the female\u2019s cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t lose hope,\u201d she urged. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s all we have.\u201d</p><p>She stepped through the shimmering opening, giving the manicured parkland and nearby mansion a cursory glance before turning her attention to Tane as he lowered Caine to the ground.</p><p>The vampire studied the unconscious Were with a frown. \u201cYou need to get him locked up ASAP.\u201d He turned to meet her mutinous expression. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to protect him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she promised. \u201cI will do whatever necessary to keep him safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my worry.\u201d He grabbed her chin to force her to meet his honey gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re the prophet. You can\u2019t put yourself at risk.\u201d</p><p>She made a sound of disgust. Right now she didn\u2019t care if she was the prophet, or that she was expected to save the world. All that mattered was that Caine was in trouble and she would sacrifice everything to help him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReturn to your mate,\u201d she said. \u201cShe needs your strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we all need you and your gift,\u201d he persisted. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything foolish.\u201d</p><p>She gave a weary shake of her head. \u201cGo.\u201d</p> <p>Realizing she\u2019d made up her mind, he gave a solemn dip of his head and swiftly disappeared back through the portal.</p><p>She felt the air pressure shift as the doorway was closed, but even as she turned toward Caine there was a blast of frigid air and a pair of matching vampires stood less than a foot away.</p><p>And what a pair they were. Cassie blinked, wondering if they were a mirage. Certainly, they looked too magnificent to be real.</p><p>Identical twins, they were tall with skin polished gold by a long-forgotten sun. Their faces were chiseled perfection with features that were a gift from their Egyptian ancestors. High cheekbones that you could cut paper on. Hawkish noses. And noble brows.</p><p>Their almond black eyes were outlined in heavy kohl and their full lips were touched with color. Long, ebony hair was pulled into a braid that hung down their backs.</p> <p>And their insanely beautiful bodies were covered by . . .</p><p>Good god, were those loincloths?</p><p>One of the two stepped closer, a gun in his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Cassie held up her hands. \u201cPlease, I need to speak with the King of Weres. Is he here?\u201d</p><p>The almond eyes widened as the vampire took a closer look at Cassie\u2019s face, belatedly realizing she had a few twins of her own.</p><p>One of which was the Queen of Vampires.</p> <p>\u201cGod almighty,\u201d vampire one muttered, glancing over his shoulder at vampire two. \u201cGet Salvatore. Now.\u201d</p><p>The warehouse</p><p>Styx had killed two of the troll-like demons and was watching a third crawl through the rift when Jagr dashed into the room. Thankfully, the opening had remained narrow enough that only one creature could crawl through at a time, but Styx was suffering from a dozen small wounds and it wouldn\u2019t take long for him to become too weakened to hold back the slow tide of evil.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d the vampire muttered.</p><p>Styx swung his sword at the demon\u2019s thick neck, having discovered after several futile attempts that their hearts were covered by a layer of bone armor that was impossible to penetrate.</p><p>\u201cA rift has been opened,\u201d Styx growled, lopping off the head of the demon and kicking its body back through the opening. The things were not only ugly, but they reeked.</p><p>There was a momentary silence as the rift remained empty, although he could catch glimpses of various creatures that prowled through the hell dimension. He didn\u2019t doubt that once they discovered there was an open doorway they would eagerly try to enter this world.</p><p>Jagr moved to his side, grimacing at the gaping rip in space. \u201cCan you close it?\u201d</p> <p>Styx snorted. If he was as omnipotent as people expected him to be, he\u2019d be wearing a cape and leaping over tall buildings. \u201cNo. We\u2019re going to need backup.\u201d He grimaced, barely able to form the words. \u201cGet Levet.\u201d</p><p>Jagr blinked. Then blinked again. No doubt wondering if Styx had taken a blow to the head. \u201cI hate to question your decisions,\u201d he said cautiously, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think the gargoyle has the magic to deal with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but my power has no doubt drained our phones,\u201d he admitted, all too familiar with his effect on modern technology. Usually, he was happy as hell to do without the constant buzz and intrusion of electronic devices, but right now he\u2019d give his right nut for a working phone. \u201cAnd he\u2019s the only one who can contact the lair so they\u2019ll send out the troops.\u201d</p><p>Jagr pulled out his phone to glance at the black screen with a grimace. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll have him contact Regan. She\u2019ll be able to organize things from Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Styx nodded. Regan was Jagr\u2019s mate and his own mate\u2019s sister. The female Were was proving to possess a talent for detailed organization. She\u2019d already rearranged Jagr\u2019s massive library so a covey of harpies\u2014who were astonishingly brilliant when they weren\u2019t in mating season\u2014could sift through them in search of any prophecies that might have been overlooked, as well as set up safe houses for children and those too weak to protect themselves.</p><p>Jagr was torn between undiluted pride in his mate and a resigned acceptance that his life would never be the same.</p><p>There was a blast of frigid air as Jaelyn skidded into the room at the same moment a demon with jagged horns, skin the color of puce, and a long snout that made him look like a perverted anteater climbed through the rift.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d the female vampire hissed in shock.</p><p>\u201cYeah, my words exactly,\u201d Jagr muttered, stepping forward to swing his sword at the creature.</p><p>Styx motioned Jaelyn forward. \u201cI\u2019m going to need you, Hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I haven\u2019t had a good fight in days.\u201d She smiled, revealing her razor-sharp fangs in a smile of anticipation. \u201cMove out of the way, Goth-boy.\u201d</p><p>Pulling out her sawed-off shotgun, Jaelyn began firing silver bullets into the creature as Jagr muttered a curse and leaped to the side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a menace,\u201d he informed his fellow vampire.</p><p>Jaelyn shrugged, kicking the demon back through the rift. \u201cYou should see me when I\u2019m pissed off.\u201d</p><p>Both men shuddered. Jaelyn pissed off was a sight neither wanted to experience.</p><p>Then, as there was the sound of nearing growls through the rift, Jagr turned to head for the door. \u201cI\u2019ll return as soon as Levet has contacted Regan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJagr,\u201d Styx called out.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave Salvatore send some of his Weres, but tell him to remain at my lair. This could be yet another distraction.\u201d</p><p>Jagr nodded. \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure my mate returns to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>The large vampire snorted as he continued out the door. \u201cI\u2019m not a miracle worker.\u201d</p><p>Styx grimaced. He knew better than to hope his mate would return to the safety of his lair. But then, he wouldn\u2019t leave her behind. Why should he expect anything different from her?</p><p>Poised for attack, Jaelyn glanced over her shoulder. \u201cDid Kostas create this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Styx\u2019s expression was grim. \u201cThe Dark Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d The blue eyes darkened as she instantly comprehended the danger. \u201cThe ceremony has been completed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it has by now.\u201d His jaw tightened beneath the tide of frustrated fury. \u201cShe has the child as well as a sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>Unexpectedly, Jaelyn frowned. \u201cBut she hasn\u2019t come through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He was struck by a sudden, hideous thought. \u201cOr at least not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think there\u2019s other rifts?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Pathways that have been hidden will be found and the Veil parted to the faithful,\u2019\u201d he quoted in harsh tones.</p><p>\u201cOh hell.\u201d Jaelyn glanced toward the swarms of distant shapes that crawled on the other side of the opening. \u201cThat can\u2019t be good.\u201d</p><p>No it wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>In fact, things were going in the toilet at hyperspeed.</p><p>And all he could do was try and hold back the tidal wave of disaster. Like Hans Brinker sticking his finger in the dyke.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get the warning out.\u201d</p><p>The Dark Lord\u2019s prison</p><p>Gaius remained on his knees, his head pressed to the ground, which was cloaked by white. He\u2019d been in the same position since his abortive attempt to flee with the prophet, simply waiting for the torture to begin.</p><p>Why fight the inevitable? He\u2019d rolled the dice and lost. Now it was time to pay his debts.</p><p>Barely aware of the passing time, he remained kneeling, praying for a swift, painless death even as he accepted it was going to be slow and bloody and quite likely to stretch over centuries, if not longer.</p><p>After what might have been minutes or an eternity, the punishing pain that warned of the Dark Lord\u2019s approach slammed into him.</p><p>\u201cAh, my faithless Gaius,\u201d she purred, her low voice nearly peeling the skin off his flesh.</p><p>His teeth clenched in agony. \u201cMistress.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, he was grasped by his hair and yanked to his feet.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that groveling will save you?\u201d the Dark Lord demanded, her eyes smoldering with crimson fire.</p><p>He hung loosely in the painful grip, his gaze shifting to the unconscious fairy that the Dark Lord had dropped at her feet.</p><p>How . . . odd.</p><p>The powerful bitch gave him a violent shake, reminding Gaius that he hadn\u2019t answered her question.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Fingers grasped his chin, forcing his head up to meet the fiery glare. \u201cSo you are pretending to be resigned to your fate.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze blazed through him like a blowtorch, making Gaius flinch despite his numbing sense of defeat.</p><p>\u201cAs you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be such a . . .\u201d The burning eyes returned to blue as the Dark Lord considered her words. \u201cWhat is the saying? A wet blanket?\u201d</p><p>With a casual flick of her hand she sent Gaius flying backward.

The Dark Lord\u2019s idea of a \u201cspecial treat\u201d would make any sane man cringe in horror.</p> <p>\u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have my sacrifice.\u201d Reaching down, the Dark Lord grabbed the fairy by the throat and dangled her like a trophy. \u201cIsn\u2019t she a beauty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery beautiful,\u201d he dutifully agreed, despite the fact the poor fairy looked like she\u2019d been pulled out of a cesspit.</p><p>\u201cI do wish she was awake,\u201d the Dark Lord pouted. \u201cSacrifices are so much more fun when they scream, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Gaius grimaced, the unwelcomed reminder of his twisted pleasure in causing females pain slicing through him. He tried to tell himself that it had been his driving sense of guilt at betraying his mate, even if she was dead, that had caused the violence. And that he\u2019d always known deep inside him that he was allowing himself to drown in the evil temptation the Dark Lord offered because it was the only way to ignore his faltering sense of honor.</p> <p>But there was no excuse.</p><p>None.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he admitted bleakly.</p><p>The blue eyes narrowed as the Dark Lord easily sensed his pulsing regret. \u201cReally, Gaius, you have proven to be a serious disappointment,\u201d she snapped, her power slashing against Gaius like a thousand knives. Only when blood was dripping from his wounds and his knees barely capable of holding him upright did she return her attention to the fairy dangling from her hand. \u201cBut no matter. Soon enough I shall be able to have my pick of worshippers.\u201d</p><p>Thank the gods, Gaius silently celebrated. The sooner the bitch had her worshippers, the sooner she would put an end to his misery.</p><p>Then his dark thoughts were interrupted by the unmistakable scent of vampire. Testing the air, he realized the odor was coming from the fairy.</p> <p>\u201cShe smells of Kostas,\u201d he muttered in confusion.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The female deity smiled with a cruel satisfaction. \u201cHe was kind enough to have her waiting at his altar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Kostas?\u201d He glanced over her shoulder, seeing nothing but swirling fog. \u201cIs he here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. He used his talents to kidnap the child. He was no longer needed.\u201d The Dark Lord frowned at Gaius\u2019s sharp burst of laughter. \u201cWhat is so funny?\u201d</p><p>Gaius shook his head, unable to mourn the arrogant vampire. He\u2019d warned the bastard, hadn\u2019t he? \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>The Dark Lord stabbed him with a suspicious glare before giving a wave of her hand to part the mists, revealing the baby she\u2019d left hidden.</p><p>\u201cBring me the child,\u201d she commanded.</p><p>Reluctantly, Gaius moved to scoop Maluhia into his arms, a strange ache in the center of his chest as he gazed down at the wide blue eyes.</p> <p>Innocent. So horribly innocent.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s awake,\u201d he said, his voice unsteady. A warning prickle of heat crawled over his skin.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think of doing anything foolish.\u201d</p><p>Gaius\u2019s lips twisted. He\u2019d already tried foolish. What else did you call helping the prophet and her protector to escape?</p><p>It didn\u2019t work out any better than his blind faith in evil.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve accepted my destiny,\u201d he assured his companion, crossing to stand directly before her.</p><p>\u201cAs have I,\u201d the Dark Lord murmured, bending the fairy over her arm and casually ripping out her throat. She chuckled in gruesome pleasure as the blood gushed over both of them, her eyes once again filled with crimson fire. \u201cAnd it is to be glorious.\u201d</p><p>Gaius stumbled backward as the Dark Lord dropped the dead fairy and reached to take the baby into her arms, the mists abruptly thickening around her.</p><p>A suffocating power crackled through the fog and Gaius groaned. Cristo, the very air was crushing him beneath its force.</p><p>He considered fleeing, but where would he go? And what would happen when the Dark Lord came looking for him?</p><p>He\u2019d earned enough punishment for one lifetime.</p><p>Besides, if he stayed close enough, maybe the backlash of her transformation would rip him apart. Not a bad way to go, all things considered.</p><p>The defeatist thought had barely been formed when there was the sensation of trembling beneath his feet. He frowned, glancing down. What was that? An earthquake? A tsunami?</p><p>Or was the very fabric of the world about to be split apart?</p><p>At this point, nothing would surprise him.</p><p>Or at least, that\u2019s what he was arrogant enough to assume.</p><p>Until a blinding flash of light pierced through the fog surrounding the Dark Lord.</p><p>Gaius hissed, throwing up his arm to protect his eyes. It was like being in the middle of a nuclear blast. No, worse, he corrected as an abrupt wind seared past him, melting his flesh from his bones.</p><p>He was being cooked alive with no promise of death.</p><p>Sinking to his knees as the ground beneath his feet heaved and rolled with a growing violence, Gaius screamed until he had no voice left.</p><p>And still the brutal wind continued to pummel him, stripping him to his very bones as a female laugh echoed in the distance.</p><p>\u201cTremble before me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Outside Styx\u2019s lair in Chicago</p><p>Cassie kneeled beside Caine, keeping guard despite the knowledge she would be no match against the powerful vampires and Weres and a dozen other demons she could sense in the massive brick home.</p><p>A fact that was only reinforced as a male Were crossed the manicured lawn with long strides, the glow of his golden eyes visible even from a distance. She shuddered, her muscles rigid with shock.</p><p>Holy crap. The very air sizzled with his power. The kind of power only a king could command.</p><p>She instinctively moved to stand between Caine and the approaching intruder, something in her expression making him halt a few feet away, his hand lifted in a gesture of peace.</p><p>\u201cCassandra?\u201d</p><p>She allowed her gaze to skim over the lean, hard body that was emphasized by the tailored pinstripe suit before rising to the handsome face. With his dark hair slicked back into a neat tail, and his bronzed skin recently shaved, he should have looked like a civilized businessman.</p><p>Instead he looked . . . lethal.</p><p>A predator that would kill without mercy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Salvatore?\u201d she demanded, her voice husky with weariness.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He lowered his hand. \u201cMay I approach?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. She hadn\u2019t forgotten that not so long ago Salvatore and Caine had been mortal enemies. Or that the king had sworn to have Caine\u2019s head on a platter.</p><p>But what choice did she have?</p><p>She didn\u2019t know precisely what had been done to Caine, but she did know their best hope was Salvatore. Only a king could call back a Were once they\u2019d gone feral. It had something to do with their connection to the pack.</p><p>If anyone could reach Caine, it would be this man.</p><p>Hesitantly she moved back, glancing toward the Were who lay unconscious on the ground, his mutilated body bathed in moonlight.</p><p>\u201cCaine\u2019s been hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see,\u201d he said gently, moving to study Caine. \u201cWas it a spell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know who cast it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cur named Dolf.\u201d</p><p>His golden gaze snapped in her direction, the scent of his wolf thick in the air \u201cThe cur traveling with Gaius?\u201d He muttered a curse at her nod. \u201cBastard. Do you know where he is now?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have time to wonder how the king knew about Dolf. \u201cDead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Gaius claimed.\u201d She frowned at the urgency in his tone. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He schooled his features into an unreadable mask. \u201cIt\u2019s always easier for the caster to remove the spell.\u201d</p><p>She heaved a frustrated sigh. She had celebrated the thought of Dolf \u2019s painful demise and now it seemed he was the one person she needed alive.</p><p>Such perfect irony.</p><p>\u201cYou can help him, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Salvatore abruptly cut off his words as Caine shifted on the ground, clearly starting to shake off Tane\u2019s savage punch. \u201cWe need to get him inside.\u201d</p><p>Cassie leaped forward to place a restraining hand on Salvatore\u2019s arm. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>The king frowned, clearly unaccustomed to having his decisions challenged.</p><p>Typical alpha.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have much time before he wakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need your promise that you won\u2019t hurt him.\u201d</p><p>He held her steady gaze, his expression hardening. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t make that promise, Cassandra.\u201d He held up a hand to halt her impulsive words. \u201cBut I do swear that I will do everything in my power to call him back.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at his bleak promise. \u201cThat\u2019s not good enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all I have.\u201d</p><p>Before she could continue the argument, Salvatore bent down to grasp Caine around the waist. Then, with an impressive display of raw strength, he had the still-unconscious Were slung over one broad shoulder and was heading toward the looming mansion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCrap,\u201d Cassie breathed, forced to concede defeat as she rushed to catch up to his long strides.</p><p>She had no choice but to trust that Salvatore would do everything possible to rescue Caine from his feral madness. And if he couldn\u2019t . . . She grimly squared her shoulders. She would make sure that Caine was protected.</p><p>She kept that thought in the forefront of her mind as they reached the mansion and the matching Pharaoh twins appeared to open the French doors.</p> <p>They passed through a sitting room with a blue and silver decor and she had a brief impression of delicately carved furniture along with a large crystal chandelier that was reflected in ornately framed mirrors before they were entering a long marble hallway that held an unmistakable scent of female Weres.</p><p>\u201cAre my sisters here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy is currently with Styx, but Harley and Regan are here.\u201d Salvatore sent her a searching gaze. \u201cThey\u2019re anxious to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Cassie understood their desire. She truly did. There was a part of her that would never be complete until she was reunited with her twins.</p><p>But there was another part, a weak, cowardly part, that wasn\u2019t prepared for the emotional meeting.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps after Caine is recovered,\u201d she hedged.</p><p>Salvatore shifted Caine on his shoulder as they passed by Grecian statues set in shallow alcoves and high, arched windows that overlooked the vast parkland.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be afraid,\u201d he assured her. \u201cThey already love you.\u201d</p><p>She hunched a defensive shoulder. They might love her, but would they be able to accept her?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t . . . normal. Okay, with Caine\u2019s constant encouragement she was becoming more comfortable with the baffling rules of society. But she would never be able to easily mix with others. Not when she was plagued by her visions.</p><p>Besides, being a seer was a dangerous business. She\u2019d been hunted from the day she was born. She would never willingly place her family in such constant danger.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been alone a very long time,\u201d she said, her gaze lingering on Caine\u2019s limp body, her heart twisting with a savage fear. \u201cUntil Caine.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore nodded, almost as if he understood. \u201cCaine found you in the caves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did more than find me,\u201d she corrected. \u201cHe gave his life to rescue me from the demon lord.\u201d</p><p>A dark brow arched. \u201cSo he truly did die?\u201d</p><p>She gave a somber nod. How many times would Caine be forced to suffer for her?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>As if sensing her surge of raw regret, Salvatore reached out to lightly touch her cheek, his power a soothing force as it flowed through her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take good care of him, cara, I promise.\u201d</p> <p>She gave a small nod, but before she could respond there was the unmistakable sound of running footsteps and, with a dizzying speed, two female Weres pounced out of a side hallway and wrapped her in a fierce embrace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Harley,\u201d one of the females said, her heart-shaped face as delicately carved as Cassie\u2019s but with large hazel eyes that were thickly lashed. Her golden blond hair was left free to tumble down her shoulders and her petite frame covered by a loose kimono that hinted at her growing baby bump.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m Regan.\u201d The other claimed Cassie\u2019s attention. She looked remarkably similar to Harley, except her golden blond hair was longer and pulled into a tight braid and her eyes were more green than hazel. She was casually dressed in a stretchy T-shirt and yoga pants, and there was a sheen of sweat on her delicate face, as if she\u2019d been in the middle of exercising.</p><p>The two were laughing and crying at the same time as they bombarded a dazed Cassie with overlapping questions.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will you stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a shower? Do you need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Cassie battled her way free of the clinging arms, her focus trained on Salvatore as he attempted to slip away unnoticed. \u201cWhere are you taking him?\u201d</p><p>Busted, Salvatore had no choice but to halt and meet her suspicious glare. \u201cI have to get him locked in a room before he wakes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She planted her hands on her hips. \u201cI want to be with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Moving to his side, Harley sent her mate a chiding frown. \u201cSalvatore.\u201d</p><p>The king heaved a rasping sigh, his golden gaze remaining trained on Cassie. \u201cI\u2019ll try to use my powers as king to connect with Caine, but since he\u2019s never truly been a part of a pack I don\u2019t know if I can control him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you can\u2019t?\u201d Cassie pressed.</p><p>\u201cMy methods will have to become . . .\u201d He broke off with a grimace.</p><p>Cassie tilted her chin. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMessier.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath. She wasn\u2019t stupid. Messier meant bloodier. \u201cNo. Absolutely not.\u201d</p><p>The golden eyes flared with a drowning power. \u201cDo you want him back or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Cassandra,\u201d Harley softly pleaded. \u201cYou can trust Salvatore. I swear that Caine is in good hands.\u201d</p><p>Cassie reached out a helpless hand, her heart breaking. \u201cHe needs me.\u201d</p><p>Harley wrapped an arm around her shoulders while Regan wrapped another around her waist.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll be there for him once he\u2019s conscious,\u201d Regan assured her.</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would Caine want you to do, Cassandra?\u201d Salvatore overrode her in stern tones. \u201cWatch him while he is at his weakest or go with your sisters and regain your strength?\u201d</p><p>Her jaw clenched at his devious cunning. They all knew precisely what Caine would want and Salvatore was using that knowledge as a weapon against her. Unfortunately, his Machiavellian tactics worked.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she grudgingly muttered. \u201cI will give you until dawn. Not a minute longer.\u201d</p><p>The golden eyes narrowed, but before Salvatore could remind her that he was not only her brother-in-law, but her king as well, her sisters were herding her down the marble staircase.</p><p>\u201cCome with us,\u201d Harley muttered.</p><p>The Dark Lord\u2019s prison</p><p>Gaius assumed his prayer that the merciless light and heat would put an end to his misery had been miraculously answered.</p><p>He had, after all, been burned to a crisp. Quite literally.</p><p>Not even a vampire could come back from such utter ruin.</p><p>But like a damned Phoenix rising from the ashes, his body began to regenerate, the slow process nearly as painful as the original destruction.</p><p>Merda.</p><p>Would this never end?</p><p>It seemed not, he decided, rolling onto his back and at last forcing open his newly healed eyes.</p><p>Only to see . . . what?</p><p>Baffled, he studied the sickly yellow sky spread above him. Where were the choking white mists that had surrounded him? The impenetrable fog?</p><p>Had he actually died and resurrected in a hell dimension?</p><p>The vague hope lasted only long enough for a massive power to smash into him, the scent of burning sulfur filling the air.</p><p>\u201cGaius, rise,\u201d an all-too-familiar voice commanded.</p><p>He didn\u2019t try and fight the compulsion to push himself to his feet. Why bother? If he didn\u2019t do as he was ordered, then he\u2019d be forced to obey.</p><p>In the most painful way possible.</p><p>Still weakened from his intimate brush with death and the effort of regenerating, it took Gaius several tries before he was able to stand upright. Once certain his knees would hold his weight, he took a brief glance around, astonished by the dramatic change to his surroundings.</p><p>With the mists seared away, presumably by the same nuclear energy that had melted him into a puddle of goo, the landscape was revealed in all its bleak glory. Drenched in the same sickly yellow as the sky, the flat ground stretched toward the distant horizon, occasionally dotted with the skeletal remains of dead trees and small pools of noxious water.</p><p>He shuddered. Not long ago he would have sworn that nothing could be worse than the nasty fog.</p><p>Yet another example of \u201cbeing careful what you wish for,\u201d he wryly accepted.</p><p>Speaking of which . . .</p><p>Unable to put off the inevitable any longer, Gaius at last turned his reluctant gaze toward the source of the pulsing power that seemed to be strengthening with every passing moment.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what he expected. A column of pure, searing light. Or a towering ten-foot monster with massive fangs. Perhaps a creature beyond his comprehension.</p><p>Instead, he discovered that the delicate female body remained, currently covered by a black satin robe, as did the long, raven hair that floated on the faint breeze and the guileless blue eyes that held hints of crimson fire.</p><p>It was only when the Dark Lord took a step forward that he realized there was a translucent outline that flickered around the human form. He frowned, studying the odd halo. The head looked vaguely like a lion, although larger and far more terrifying than the real beast. And the body was a muscular human shape that was neither male nor female.</p><p>Was that the Gemini?</p><p>And if it was, why was it still no more than a shadow?</p><p>The questions were driven from his mind as the Dark Lord lifted a hand and her blistering power wrapped around him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He clenched his teeth against the pain. \u201cMistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome forward.\u201d</p><p>The voice rang through the air like a massive bell, sending his feet moving forward. \u201cI am your servant,\u201d he muttered, shuddering beneath the force of her coercion.</p> <p>He was a puppet.</p><p>A weak, spineless puppet.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d To emphasize his defeatist thoughts, the Dark Lord ran a mocking glance down his naked body before reaching out to wrap her fingers around his neck. \u201cPretty, pretty leech. What shall we do first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised to return my mate.\u201d</p><p>Nails sliced into his flesh as the flickering lion\u2019s head briefly merged with the pretty female face. \u201cYou are so eager to join your mate?\u201d</p> <p>Gaius shuddered. He had no desire to be around when that hovering specter joined its power with the Dark Lord.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A petulant expression settled on the deity\u2019s pretty features. She didn\u2019t like that Gaius wasn\u2019t eager to play the devoted worshipper. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d he managed to choke out.</p><p>There was a long pause, as if his captor was inwardly weighing the pleasure of ripping out his throat against her mysterious need of him.</p><p>At last he was shoved away and the Dark Lord smoothed a hand down her robe, turning it to a pale shade of peach. The color emphasized the absurd innocence of her youthful appearance even as the strange shadow loomed behind her in a silent threat.</p> <p>\u201cFor now, you will offer me your military expertise.\u201d</p><p>Gaius blinked. His military expertise? Was this yet another trick?</p><p>\u201cYou intend to lead an army into battle?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>The female smiled with cruel anticipation. \u201cNo, but I do intend to release my hordes on the world.\u201d</p><p>Gaius stilled, his mind racing. It wasn\u2019t that he gave a damn what happened once the Dark Lord unleashed her minions. Hadn\u2019t he turned his back on the world that had allowed the brutal death of his beloved mate? No, of course he didn\u2019t care. But after being deceived and manipulated by this evil bitch, he wasn\u2019t opposed to witnessing her downfall.</p><p>Or even helping it along.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need a general to release hordes,\u201d he pointed out in cautious tones.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI want to be certain they are released where they can cause the most harm. The sooner they deal with my enemies, the sooner I can make my return.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy wait?\u201d Gaius lifted his brows. \u201cSurely you want the satisfaction of personally destroying those who stood in your path?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would certainly be pleasurable to witness the slaughter,\u201d the Dark Lord admitted, \u201cbut I\u2019m not foolish enough to take the risk.\u201d The blue eyes narrowed with suspicion. \u201cAnd as my devoted worshipper, I\u2019m disappointed you would not be more concerned for my safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafety?\u201d Gaius pretended confusion. \u201cAren\u2019t you omnipotent now that you\u2019ve become the Gemini?\u201d</p><p>Something that might have been frustration rippled over the delicate features. \u201cMy powers are still . . . fluid.\u201d</p><p>Gaius\u2019s gaze shifted to the flickering outline of the beast. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.

She ate what was put in front of her and answered the endless stream of questions without being conscious of the words leaving her lips.</p><p>Distantly, she was aware when Regan was abruptly called from the room, her cell phone pressed to her ear and servants scurrying around her as she barked out a series of orders. And then again when she returned to the room to whisper in Harley\u2019s ear. There was even a part of her mind that understood something had happened, no doubt something to do with the Dark Lord, but she could concentrate on nothing but the thought of Caine and the relentlessly slow passing of minutes.</p><p>How long had Salvatore been with him?</p><p>She glanced toward the clock on the ornately carved sideboard. Two hours? Three? Surely long enough for the king to have discovered whether or not his powers were enough to return Caine to his humanity?</p><p>At last reaching the end of her patience, Cassie was at the point of demanding that her sisters take her to Caine when the scent of approaching Were had her rising to her feet and turning toward the door.</p><p>Her heart sank at the sight of Salvatore\u2019s weary expression as he beckoned for his mate to join him.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Harley murmured, pausing to give Cassie a sympathetic hug before hurrying across the room.</p><p>Cassie took a step forward. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll speak later, Cassandra,\u201d Salvatore promised, wrapping his arm around Harley\u2019s shoulders and tugging her into the hallway.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>She was heading toward the door when Regan abruptly stepped in her path, grasping her shoulders with a grip that warned she wasn\u2019t going to let Cassie pass. Not without a fight.</p><p>\u201cCassandra, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll come speak with you when he\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s brows snapped together. Logically, she didn\u2019t doubt that her sister was simply attempting to help. The two female Weres had fussed and fluttered about her with an obvious devotion.</p><p>But at the moment Cassie was in no mood to be logical. Nothing was going to keep her from finding Caine. Not even the love of a sister.</p><p>Meeting Regan\u2019s wary gaze, Cassie dismissed her instinctive urge to simply thrust her sister out of her way. Even if she could match her sister\u2019s strength, something that wasn\u2019t at all certain, she wouldn\u2019t get out of the room before Regan could have half a dozen servants running to help her.</p><p>No. If she wanted to be with Caine, she would have to get rid of her family first.</p><p>Which meant managing to tell a convincing lie.</p><p>She used her heavy sigh to her advantage, allowing her shoulders to wilt and her head to lower, as if in resignation. \u201cYes, I suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassandra, it really is for the best\u2014\u201d Regan\u2019s reassuring words were abruptly interrupted by the buzz of her cell phone. Releasing her grip on Cassie, she pulled the phone from her pocket to read the name flashing across the screen. \u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJagr, just returned,\u201d Regan said, speaking of her mate. \u201cI need to update him.\u201d</p><p>Ah. Saved by the bell. Or rather the buzzer. Cassie, however, was careful to keep her expression resigned. \u201cGo, Regan. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d Her sister bit her bottom lip in a gesture that was endearingly similar to Cassie\u2019s own habit. \u201cI hate to leave you on your own.\u201d</p><p>Cassie refused to acknowledge the stab of guilt as she managed a stiff smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m dead on my feet,\u201d she assured Regan. \u201cI think I\u2019ll try to get a little sleep.\u201d</p><p>The phone buzzed again and Regan gave a grudging nod. \u201cThere are plenty of empty bedrooms upstairs. Take one that you want.\u201d She headed slowly toward the door, clearly torn between her duty to her mate and her newly discovered sister. \u201cYou\u2019ll come find me if you need me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>Watching her sister disappear through the door, Cassie forced herself to count to one hundred. Only when she was certain Regan wasn\u2019t going to pop back into the room did she make her way to the marble hallway and slip silently through the shadows.</p><p>She didn\u2019t like the feeling she was sneaking behind her sisters\u2019 backs, but what choice had they given her? All right, maybe they thought they were protecting her, but they didn\u2019t understand. She had to be with Caine. It was a ruthless, driving force that was making her stomach clench and a cold sweat break out on her skin.</p><p>He needed her.</p><p>She knew it to the very depths of her soul.</p><p>Tracing Salvatore\u2019s scent, she followed it to a narrow staircase that led down to the basement level. Her foot was on the top step when she heard the sound of Salvatore\u2019s voice coming from the ceiling.</p><p>What the heck?</p><p>She glanced up, at last spotting the vent hidden in the ceiling.</p><p>Obviously, the king and Harley were in a room above her, unaware that their conversation could be overheard.</p><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s no hope?\u201d Harley was softly demanding.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d Salvatore said, unaware his bleak words were slicing through Cassie with a savage pain. \u201cHe\u2019s too far gone.\u201d</p><p>Harley made a sound of distress. \u201cWhat if we call for a witch? If the spell could be removed, then maybe you could reach him.\u201d</p><p>She heard Salvatore heave a harsh sigh. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left of the spell.\u201d</p><p>Cassie frowned as Harley asked the question that was on her own lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassandra said that the cur who cast the spell is dead. I would guess the spell died with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvatore, we have to do something,\u201d Harley pleaded.</p> <p>\u201cHe needs to be put out of his misery.\u201d</p><p>Cassie slapped a hand over her mouth to hold back her shattered cry of denial at Salvatore\u2019s ruthless confession. What did it matter what the king wanted? There wasn\u2019t a chance in hell that she was going to let anyone hurt Caine.</p><p>Not now. Not ever.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harley said, her voice shaky.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend to make a decision tonight,\u201d Salvatore assured his mate, although Cassie didn\u2019t miss the grim edge in his voice. He would do what he thought best for his people. Even if it meant destroying a feral Were. \u201cThere are too many other pressing concerns.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Harley grudgingly conceded. \u201cStyx and Jagr have returned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must speak with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I tell Cassandra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing tonight,\u201d Salvatore said in weary tones. \u201cLet her have a few hours of rest. We\u2019ll break the news in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Harley sniffed, as if she were trying to hold back tears. \u201cThis is going to destroy her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if she has us to give her the support she needs,\u201d Salvatore comforted his distraught mate. \u201cAre you coming with me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I need to warn Darcy what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>It took Cassie several deep breaths before she could force her shaky legs to continue down the stairs.</p><p>She had no intention of accepting defeat, no matter what the king might say, but she couldn\u2019t deny a piercing sense of disappointment. She\u2019d desperately hoped that Salvatore could force his way through Caine\u2019s feral insanity. To reach the man, or even the wolf, beneath the madness.</p><p>Now she had no one to depend on except herself.</p><p>Not a particularly reassuring thought.</p><p>Reaching the bottom of the stairs, she was forced to a halt, not surprised by the confusing maze of cement tunnels that sprawled beneath the vast estate. The lair belonged to the King of Vampires. The only surprising thing would be if there weren\u2019t a hundred passageways for Styx\u2019s sun-challenged clan to travel around Chicago.</p><p>A tiny chill inched down her spine. Gods, but she hated being below ground.</p> <p>Even with the high ceilings that were lined with fluorescent lights and the well-ventilated air, the tunnels were enough to make her have flashbacks to those long, dark years she\u2019d been trapped in the demon lord\u2019s lair.</p><p>She needed Caine, she acknowledged with a smile of pure irony. If he were with her, she wouldn\u2019t be afraid.</p><p>He was her courage.</p><p>Reminding herself that she was wasting precious time, Cassie squared her shoulders and followed Caine\u2019s fading scent down the nearest tunnel.</p><p>She was forced to double back twice when she caught the scent of an approaching vamp, but at last she reached the narrow passage that led to Caine\u2019s cell. Her steps were halted, however, by the distinct scent of granite that teased at her nose.</p><p>Granite?</p><p>She slowly turned, her brows rising at the sight of the tiny gargoyle who waddled around the corner, his wings shimmering in a dazzling display of crimson and blue with veins of gold.</p><p>\u201cMa ch\u00e9rie? Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>Cassie frowned; then the brief memory of seeing the small creature in the company of Tane and Jaelyn several weeks before teased at the edge of her mind. \u201cOh. I remember you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLevet.\u201d The gargoyle performed a deep bow. \u201cAt your service.\u201d</p><p>At any other time, Cassie might have been charmed by the odd little creature. Right now, she just wanted him gone. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but I don\u2019t have time now.\u201d</p><p>Turning back to the passageway, she cautiously made her way down the cement floor, trying to ignore the gargoyle, who hurried to keep pace at her side.</p><p>\u201cI received your message,\u201d he said, his voice carrying a lilting French accent.</p><p>\u201cMy message?\u201d Cassie furrowed her brow before she abruptly recalled her futile attempt to send the warning that Maluhia was in danger. \u201cOh. It wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d She grimaced, her gaze trained on the heavy metal door at the end of the hall. \u201cIt\u2019s never enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are all simply trying to do our best in very difficult circumstances,\u201d Levet assured her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she muttered in distracted tones, far more concerned with the imposing door and whether or not it was locked. \u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>There were a few seconds of blessed silence before the gargoyle was tugging on the hem of her new khaki shorts, which Regan had insisted she borrow along with a jade green shirt.</p><p>\u201cDarcy is here.\u201d</p><p>She heaved a sigh, her steps never slowing. \u201cSo I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am certain she would desire an opportunity to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>With a flutter of his wings, Levet moved to stand directly in her path, a worried expression on his ugly little features. \u201cI really think it would be better if you went now.\u201d</p><p>Forced to halt, she glared at her unwanted companion. Had he been sent by one of her sisters? She couldn\u2019t imagine the arrogant Salvatore depending on this demon to guard his prisoners.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Levet,\u201d she pleaded in husky tones. \u201cJust leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hands in a helpless motion, his long tail twitching. \u201cI cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen that expression before.\u201d He pointed toward her face. \u201cOn warriors.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in confusion. Was that one of those things she was supposed to understand? She instinctively turned her head, knowing that Caine would know, only to have her heart miss a painful beat. She pressed a hand to the aching void in the center of her chest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re marching into a battle you don\u2019t intend to survive.\u201d</p><p>Oh. She flinched at his shocking perception. Was he an empath? She\u2019d never heard that was a talent of gargoyles, but then Levet was obviously not the usual run-of-the-mill sort of gargoyle.</p><p>Wary of what other powers he might possess, she cautiously considered her words. \u201cI\u2019m no warrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon, you are the prophet. Our prophet,\u201d he insisted, the gray eyes holding a hint of chastisement. \u201cAnd we need you.\u201d</p><p>She continued to rub her chest, the emptiness becoming a physical pain. \u201cI can\u2019t do this without Caine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, ma ch\u00e9rie, sacrificing yourself will not bring him back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to try,\u201d she stubbornly insisted. Why couldn\u2019t people understand that Caine was as essential to her as her visions were to the world? Besides, she\u2019d already shared what little information she had of the future. A wall could hold back chaos. They had to be united. Blah, blah, blah. What more did they . . . United. Her breath tangled in her throat. \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>Levet took a step forward, his scent of concern drenching the air. \u201cCassandra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must be united,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d the gargoyle said, watching her with a suspicious frown. \u201cThis is a time we must all stand together. Which is why I cannot allow you to do this.\u201d</p><p>A slow, determined smile curved her lips. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but nothing is going to stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassandra.\u201d He grasped her shorts as she stepped past him. \u201cCassie, wait.\u201d His claws scraped against the cement as she forged a path to the door, dragging him along. Two steps from the door he lost his grip and she heard him muttering in frustration as he headed in the opposite direction. \u201cSacrebleu, where is that mangy dog when I have need of him?\u201d</p><p>Cassie ignored the retreating demon, reaching out to turn the handle of the door. Stark relief blazed through her as it swung inward, although she didn\u2019t doubt that once it slammed shut behind her it wouldn\u2019t be nearly so easy to open.</p><p>Not that she cared. She knew once she entered the room there was only one way she was getting out.</p><p>Taking a cautious step forward, Cassie allowed her gaze to inspect the barren cell, which was lined in lead. Heavy silver shackles hung from the low ceiling and there was a drain in the center of the floor that she assumed was to get rid of the blood.</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s words whispered in the back of her mind....</p><p>Messier.</p><p>She swallowed her urge to cry. She couldn\u2019t think about what Caine had been forced to endure. What she had allowed him to endure in the hopes of saving him, she reminded herself with a stab of self-disgust.</p><p>The future was all that mattered. Their future together.</p><p>Gathering her courage, she turned her gaze to the large, twisted body that lay in a corner, the fur caked with dried blood and his ankles seared by the silver manacles around them.</p><p>Her heart twisted, but with a fierce resolve she moved to crouch at his side. Reaching out, she laid her hand on his neck, reassured by the steady beat of his heart even as a frown touched her brow.</p><p>She knew what she wanted\u2014no needed\u2014to do. But she didn\u2019t have a damned clue how to go about it. And for once, she couldn\u2019t blame her years of isolation for her lack of knowledge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>True matings between pureblooded Weres had become nothing more than a distant legend until Salvatore had driven the demon lord back to his hell.</p><p>Now she could only hope that the primitive instincts that had been buried deep inside her would take over and complete the mating ceremony that had begun the moment Caine had rescued her.</p><p>Or at least it had begun for her, she was forced to concede.</p> <p>She had no actual proof that Caine felt the same connection.</p><p>In fact, it was just the opposite.</p><p>What little she read of the ancient matings said that they usually drained the power of the males. The theory was that the female would always have the last say on whether or not to complete the mating. But Caine\u2019s strength had been steadily increasing.</p><p>Of course, he wasn\u2019t a traditional pureblood and his powers had been fluctuating since he\u2019d been transformed from a cur to a Were, she hastily reassured herself.</p><p>Oh, and he hadn\u2019t yet marked her with his musk. Wasn\u2019t that a part of the whole mating thing?</p> <p>Damn.</p><p>Refusing to consider failure, she closed her eyes and concentrated on her connection to Caine. Or at least on the painful void in the center of her heart where she\u2019d come to depend on feeling his presence.</p><p>It was still there, she grimly assured herself. Just . . . muted. As if his current transformation was suppressing the signal.</p><p>For long, stressful minutes she focused everything she had on the tenuous bond. He was there, she could feel him, but every time she tried to hold on to his presence he would slither away.</p><p>Slippery as an eel. The stupid clich\u00e9 teased at her mind even as she clenched her teeth and dug her fingers into his patchy fur.</p><p>No. He wasn\u2019t going to elude her.</p> <p>Ignoring the simmering fear, she again concentrated on the thin connection, releasing her power until the entire cell was flooded with the thick heat of her desperation. And still she couldn\u2019t reach him. Couldn\u2019t force . . .</p><p>Her eyes abruptly flew open.</p><p>Of course she couldn\u2019t force him. Any more than he could force her into the mating.</p><p>All she could do was try and offer her heart and hope that he could battle through his madness to accept it.</p><p>Yeah, one hell of a plan.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, she thrust aside her rising panic and released her fragile connection with Caine. Then, returning her focus inward, she concentrated not on the void in her heart, but the warm, boundless love that spilled through her like a rich, intoxicating nectar.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know when it had started.</p><p>Perhaps when Caine had stepped in front of her to protect her from the demon lord. Or when he\u2019d taken her to his lair and badgered her to eat because she\u2019d forgotten.</p> <p>Or when she opened her eyes after yet another vision to find him patiently waiting at her side.</p><p>Or maybe she\u2019d been fated to love this man before she\u2019d ever been born.</p><p>The when didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Only the fact that it filled every particle of her being.</p><p>Not allowing herself time to marvel at the strength of her emotion, which had become so familiar she took it for granted, Cassie regained command of her connection to Caine. This time, however, she didn\u2019t attempt to bludgeon him with her power.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need more strength to battle back from the edge of madness. He needed a reason.</p><p>Releasing the tidal wave of love, she stroked her hand softly over his head, her wolf impatiently prowling beneath her skin. Her beast had been oddly passive since Caine\u2019s transformation, as if patiently waiting for his return. Now it was anxiously straining to reach something just out of touch.</p><p>A low growl stirred the air and, opening her eyes, she met Caine\u2019s glowing gaze.</p><p>Her heart briefly halted at the glitter of feral insanity that remained in the astonishing blue depths. Gods, had she failed? Was he too far gone to accept the mating she was offering?</p><p>Or had she mistaken the instinctive need of a male alpha to protect her for something more . . . eternal?</p><p>She was pulling back in raw disappointment when she belatedly caught the scent of his musk. His wolf. She leaned closer, fiercely concentrating on the faint sense of his wolf that strained to reach her.</p><p>\u201cCaine,\u201d she breathed, leaning down to bury her face in his neck. \u201cI\u2019m yours. Bond with me.\u201d</p><p>He growled again, but there was no threat in the sound. She pressed herself closer to his trembling body, feeling his power brushing over her skin and the familiar heat of him cloaking around her.</p><p>Then, as if a leash had suddenly snapped, she could feel the essence of his wolf slamming into her, filling the void in her aching heart with an intoxicating combination of wild animal and human male.</p><p>Reeling beneath the impact, she made a sound of shock. Oh . . . gods. It felt as if she\u2019d been run over by a truck.</p><p>Was this the mating?</p><p>The question lasted only long enough for her own wolf to surge up to meet the charging assault, a stunning joy exploding through her.</p><p>Caine.</p><p>He was a part of her.</p><p>In every beat of her heart. And in every breath.</p><p>They were one.</p><p>Complete.</p><p>Slowly pulling back, she shuddered, still trying to adjust to the new sensations racing through her.</p><p>And the power.</p><p>Not just her power. Or Caine\u2019s power.</p><p>But an astonishing new melding of the two that sizzled through her like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>Her gaze encountered the blue eyes that still glowed with a feral wildness, but deep in her heart Caine was firmly entrenched.</p><p>\u201cJust hold on, Caine,\u201d she rasped. \u201cHold on.\u201d</p><p>Styx\u2019s study</p><p>Dawn was approaching, pressing on Styx with a ruthless heaviness. He needed to shower, to feed, to spend several hours in the arms of his mate, and at least a week of uninterrupted sleep.</p><p>Unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t going to be getting any of those things. At least, not any time soon.</p><p>Instead, he was closeted with Salvatore and Roke as they poured over the maps he\u2019d spread across the desk. Regan had done a good job getting reinforcements to Kostas\u2019s warehouse, but now they needed a full-out strategy. Which meant coordinating with Salvatore.</p><p>The King of Weres didn\u2019t look any better than Styx. His elegant suit was gone and replaced with a pair of dojo pants and a loose sweatshirt. And his lean face lined with a tension that was echoed in all of them.</p><p>Roke was standing silently on the other side of the desk. The younger vampire possessed a talent not only for reading prophecies, but for speaking demon dialects. He would be needed if they had to contact the leaders of other species.</p><p>Styx pointed to a spot on the map south of Chicago, speaking directly to the King of Weres.</p><p>\u201cViper has his clan stationed where the rift is opened, as well as several of your Weres outside the warehouse to protect them from any enemies that might be sent to stop them.\u201d He brought Salvatore up to speed. \u201cAriyal should be arriving with several of his tribesmen within the hour.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore nodded. The Sylvermyst were the most powerful of the fey and as their prince, Ariyal was the most talented at creating portals. If anyone could find a way to shut the rift it would be him.</p><p>\u201cDoes he think he can close the opening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows,\u201d Styx conceded with a shrug. \u201cIf he can\u2019t close it they intend to try and block it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still working on plan B.\u201d</p><p>They grimaced in unison.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Chalice?\u201d Salvatore at last asked.</p><p>Styx stroked the amulet at his neck, grateful that he hadn\u2019t been forced to inform Abby that she was going to be spending the next few weeks hidden from the oncoming war.</p><p>As the Phoenix\u2014the mortal chalice who held the Goddess of Light\u2014she had the ability to scorch demons into tiny piles of ash. A wise man didn\u2019t like to annoy her.</p><p>\u201cDante has taken her to a secret lair.\u201d Even Styx wasn\u2019t sure where they\u2019d gone. \u201cShe\u2019s not happy to be taken out of the fight, but we have to protect the goddess she carries inside her. If we can somehow strip the Dark Lord of her newest powers, then we\u2019ll need the Phoenix to keep her trapped in her current prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Assured that the goddess was properly protected, the Were turned his attention to the looming fight. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jagr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Regan for now. Tomorrow at nightfall he will lead Troy in the search for other rifts that the Dark Lord might have opened.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore arched his brows at the mention of Troy, the Prince of Imps. \u201cPoor schmuck,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Styx couldn\u2019t argue. The tall, crimson-haired fey who strutted around in spandex and flirted with anything that crossed his path was a pain in the ass, but war truly did make strange bedfellows.</p><p>\u201cTroy is eccentric, but there\u2019s no one who possesses a greater talent in sensing the dimensions that separate worlds,\u201d he said. \u201cEven Ariyal admitted the imp was superior to his Sylvermysts in predicting where the veils are thinning. He should be able to detect a rift long before any of us could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll send Hess with them,\u201d the Were agreed. \u201cHe can help coordinate with any packs in the area if a rift is found.\u201d</p><p>Styx smiled with wry amusement at the thought of the barely house-trained cur and the nearly feral vampire trying to work together. \u201cThat should make an interesting partnership.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo more than ours,\u201d Salvatore pointed out dryly.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Lifting his head, Styx glanced at the vampire who stood in motionless silence. The younger man hadn\u2019t spoken a word since the meeting started, but Styx had been well aware of his growing disapproval. \u201cRoke?\u201d</p><p>The odd, silver eyes shimmered in the light of the overhead chandelier. \u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have something to add?\u201d</p><p>The lean face remained unreadable. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something on your mind,\u201d he insisted, knowing that the younger vampire would refuse to express his doubts unless directly confronted.</p><p>There was the slightest hesitation before Roke pointed toward the map. \u201cIt\u2019s all defensive.\u201d</p><p>Styx frowned. \u201cWhat is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour strategy,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s all about defense, not offense.\u201d</p><p>Styx made a sound of disgust. Did the younger vampire think that Styx wanted to play the game of whack-a-mole with the Dark Lord? That he didn\u2019t realize how futile it was to be constantly reacting to trouble that popped out of thin air instead of staging an attack on his ground and on his terms?</p><p>\u201cUntil someone finds me a way to get into the evil bitch\u2019s prison, I don\u2019t have a hell of a lot of choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo choices,\u201d Roke slowly agreed, his gaze never wavering. \u201cUnless you draw her out.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore planted his hands on the desk and leaned forward, his expression one of curiosity. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>Roke held his ground despite the Were\u2019s choking power thickening the air. Styx hid a small smile. The Nevada clan chief was as cold-blooded and fearless as the rattlesnakes that populated his territory.</p> <p>\u201cAs long as the Dark Lord is able to hide in the mists while she empties hell into our world, she\u2019ll be impossible to destroy,\u201d Roke clarified. \u201cOur only hope is to lure her to this dimension before we\u2019re completely overwhelmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how are we supposed to lure her to this world?\u201d the King of Weres demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore made a sound of disgust. \u201cA helluva lot of help that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just a humble soldier.\u201d Roke\u2019s eyes flashed with silver fire. \u201cYou\u2019re the king. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want the crown?\u201d Styx mocked. \u201cYou can have it.\u201d</p><p>Roke squared his shoulders, not amused. \u201cAll I want is to return to my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Styx held the younger vampire\u2019s annoyed gaze. \u201cFigure out how to entice the Dark Lord out of the mists and you\u2019ll be free to go.\u201d</p> <p>Roke scowled. \u201cYou keep changing the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the king. It\u2019s my prerogative.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore abruptly straightened, glancing toward the open door. \u201cGargoyle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Styx rubbed the back of his neck, already prepared for the tiny creature to piss him off. \u201cLike this night hasn\u2019t been bad enough?\u201d</p><p>On cue, the miniature gargoyle waddled into the room, his wings twitching and tail as stiff as a board. A sure sign he wasn\u2019t rushing in with good news. But then, who did have good news these days?</p><p>\u201cSalvatore, you must come,\u201d Levet commanded.</p><p>Ah, he wanted the dog. Styx gave a sharp laugh at the sour expression on Salvatore\u2019s face. \u201cThings are looking up,\u201d he murmured softly.</p><p>The King of Weres gave a warning growl before turning to glare at the gargoyle, who was nearly dancing with impatience.</p><p>\u201cActually, whether I come or not is very much up to debate,\u201d Salvatore corrected, his wolf prowling close to the surface. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Cassandra.\u201d</p><p>All three men stiffened at the mention of the prophet. Shit. They\u2019d just managed to get her back. They couldn\u2019t lose her now. Not when she might hold the key to the future.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d Salvatore growled.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with Caine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Salvatore breathed, exchanging a horrified glance with Styx.</p><p>The Were had already revealed that Caine was trapped in his feral insanity with no hope of being salvaged. If Cassie had gone into his cell, then . . . Styx shuddered at the mere thought.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stop her?\u201d Salvatore rasped, his infuriated gaze snapping back to Levet.</p><p>The tiny demon lifted his hands in a helpless motion. \u201cI tried. She refused to listen to me.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore clenched his teeth. \u201cIs she dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Styx felt a small flare of relief. At least there was still a chance she might be alive.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d Salvatore said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d Styx growled, sparing an impatient glance for the vampire still standing beside the desk. \u201cRoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCezar is waiting for me in the library. Get with him and find a way to draw the Dark Lord into this world.\u201d He gestured toward the gargoyle. \u201cLevet will assist you.\u201d</p><p>Roke widened his eyes at the unreasonable command. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Styx lifted a hand to halt the outraged protest. \u201cJust do it.\u201d He turned his narrowed gaze toward the gargoyle. \u201cBoth of you.\u201d</p><p>Roke hissed in frustration. \u201cDamn you.\u201d</p><p>Assured the vampire would do everything in his power to find a method of luring the Dark Lord from her lair, Styx fell into step with Salvatore as he headed out of the study and down the hall.</p><p>One disaster at a time.</p><p>\u201cDamn. I thought I was a bastard,\u201d the Were muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d Styx assured him.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Styx grimaced at the sound of scurrying guards as they wisely fled the tunnels.</p><p>He didn\u2019t blame them for their hasty retreat.</p><p>He and Salvatore were powerful alphas. Perhaps the most powerful in the world. Just being in the same room with them was enough to make most demons cringe in fear. But when they were both in hunter mode, the very air trembled in fear.</p><p>Struggling to leash his power, which was shattering the overhead lights, Styx was caught off guard when Salvatore came to a sudden halt.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d the wolf muttered, his eyes glowing gold.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy weapons.\u201d He glanced down at his sweatpants in disgust. \u201cI left them in my rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Styx pulled a gun from the holster at the small of his back, his expression somber. \u201cIf you want, I can take care of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Caine belongs to me.\u201d He reached to take the gun, loaded with silver bullets. \u201cIt\u2019s my duty.\u201d</p><p>Styx understood. Being a leader not only meant making the hard decisions, but also carrying them through. \u201cEvil times,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Salvatore nodded. \u201cS\u00ed.\u201d</p><p>The Were jerked back into motion, leading Styx down a corridor to the isolated cell. The true dungeons were a level below. These rooms were for vampires awaiting sentencing from the Anasso, or for the nonmagical demons who could be held by conventional means.</p><p>They had taken less than two steps when they caught the sound of a muffled female voice.</p><p>\u201cCaine, can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassandra?\u201d Styx demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Pure relief flowed through Styx. \u201cAlive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least for now,\u201d Salvatore said, racing toward the end of the corridor and throwing open the heavy steel door.</p><p>Styx entered the cell directly behind the King of Weres, his fangs lengthening as he caught sight of the mutated beast that rose up in fury at their entrance.</p><p>Holy . . . shit.</p><p>Even after Salvatore\u2019s warning, he was shaken. He\u2019d seen any number of creatures, some so grotesque they could turn the stomach, but this was . . . wrong.</p><p>Perverted.</p><p>Distracted, Styx nearly overlooked the tiny female until she darted in front of the beast, her arms spread wide.</p><p>\u201cNo, stay back,\u201d she cried, her delicate features so like Darcy that it made Styx\u2019s heart clench in fear.</p><p>She had to be kept safe. His beautiful mate would be devastated if she were to lose her sister.</p><p>Not to mention the danger to the world at the loss of their prophet.</p><p>\u201cSalvatore,\u201d he muttered in low tones. \u201cDo something or I will.\u201d</p><p>The Were ignored his threat, focusing his power on the stubborn female who stood between them and the feral beast who could kill her with one blow.</p><p>\u201cCassandra, come to me.\u201d</p><p>The force of his words crashed through the small cell, sizzling through the air with enough power to make Styx hiss in annoyance and Caine whine in pain.</p><p>Cassandra, however, stood without flinching, her eyes flashing emerald fire and the fine strands of her blond hair floating in the sudden breeze. \u201cNo. I won\u2019t let you hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll kill you,\u201d Salvatore muttered, taking a step forward. \u201cNow come to me.\u201d</p><p>She scowled as the beast behind her growled in warning, his eyes glowing with madness and his large body poised to attack, despite the heavy silver manacles wrapped around his ankles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t hurt me,\u201d she ridiculously tried to convince them. \u201cHe only wants to protect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cassandra, more sorry than I can say, but he isn\u2019t trying to protect you,\u201d Salvatore said, lifting the gun. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even recognize you. He\u2019s too far gone.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, the scent of her agitation making Caine howl in fury. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d she hissed, her hands lifted in a pleading motion. \u201cI reached him.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot for his mate.\u201d</p><p>Styx heard the King of Weres suck in a startled breath. \u201cMate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe . . . no.\u201d The prophet waved a frantic hand as Salvatore took a step forward when the feral beast wrapped a clawed hand around her arm. \u201cStay back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassandra, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Salvatore slowly continued forward, his gun aimed at the center of Caine\u2019s chest. \u201cI have to get you out of there.\u201d</p><p>Cassandra winced as the beast dug his claws into her arm, his glowing gaze watching Salvatore with a growing fury, but still she tried to keep her body between her approaching king and the creature who had once been her mate.</p> <p>\u201cListen to me. We\u2019re connected,\u201d she said in desperate tones. \u201cHe\u2019s part of my family now.\u201d</p><p>The words had barely left her lips when Caine thrust her behind his large body. The rough shove sent the much smaller female sailing through the air, her head hitting the lead wall with a sickening thud.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Styx rasped, watching Cassandra crumple to the ground before he turned to glare at the Were standing silently at his side. \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>A muscle in Salvatore\u2019s jaw knotted, as if he were battling back his wolf. \u201cShe said family,\u201d he replied, his voice harsh.</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Styx snapped, his attention shifting to the beast, who was pacing as far as the silver chains would allow him, his fangs bared in warning. The only good thing in this most recent debacle was that he seemed to have forgotten the unconscious woman behind him. \u201cShe\u2019s desperate to save her mate. She would say anything to prevent the inevitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed. Her mate.\u201d</p> <p>Assuming that the King of Weres was regretting the need to sacrifice one of his pack, even if he had more than once desired Caine\u2019s death, Styx held out a hand. \u201cSalvatore, allow me to deal with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The Were shook his head. \u201cThey weren\u2019t mated before.\u201d</p><p>Styx grimaced. \u201cShe completed the mating even knowing his madness is irreversible? Foolish female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot foolish,\u201d Salvatore said in low tones, turning to meet Styx\u2019s frustrated gaze. \u201cActually, she\u2019s been very, very clever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t reach Caine because he was transformed into a pureblood by the demon lord. He\u2019d never been a part of a pack.\u201d</p><p>Styx didn\u2019t know the ins and outs of the mangy mutt society, but Salvatore\u2019s words made sense. \u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow he\u2019s bound to Cassandra.\u201d</p> <p>Styx glanced toward the unconscious female. \u201cBut wasn\u2019t she raised in isolation with the demon lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she isn\u2019t a part of a pack either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer connection was formed in the womb with her sisters, as well as through her mother, Sophia, to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat there\u2019s a chance I can call him back.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes clashed, a silent battle between Salvatore\u2019s grim determination and Styx\u2019s fierce refusal to endanger the prophet.</p><p>At last, Styx reached to pluck the gun from Salvatore\u2019s hand, conceding with ill grace to the Were\u2019s need to try and salvage his newest pack mate. \u201cHere, give me that.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore narrowed his gaze in warning. \u201cStyx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou concentrate on doing your thing and I\u2019ll make sure the rabid wolf doesn\u2019t kill us all.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore arched a brow. \u201cDoing my thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get on with it.\u201d</p><p>Convinced that Styx wasn\u2019t going to go Tony Montana the minute his attention was diverted, Salvatore turned back toward the crazed beast and lifted a hand.</p><p>At first, nothing seemed to happen.</p><p>Caine continued his frantic pacing, his eyes wild with his desire to sink his massive teeth into the two male intruders. Styx lifted the gun, willing to give Salvatore a chance to reach the rabid dog, but only as long as the creature didn\u2019t so much as glance in Cassandra\u2019s direction.</p><p>The minutes ticked past, Salvatore\u2019s hand still raised and the air beginning to heat with his power. Then the King of Weres was abruptly striding forward, his wolf so thick in the air that Styx could taste fur on his tongue.</p><p>Caine tossed back his head, howling beneath the force of Salvatore\u2019s will. Salvatore never faltered, reaching up to grasp the creature\u2019s chin and force him to meet his ruthless gaze.</p><p>Styx hissed. The crazy-assed King of Weres was going to get himself killed. Something he wouldn\u2019t tolerate.</p><p>Not when he\u2019d promised himself the pleasure.</p><p>Placing his finger on the trigger, he aimed between Caine\u2019s eyes. But before he could fire there was a sudden flurry of magic surrounding the one-time cur. At the same time, Salvatore fell heavily to his knees, his head bent in exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Shoving the gun back into the holster at his lower back, Styx darted forward to grasp Salvatore by the shoulders and towed him away from the shower of sparks that were swirling around Caine. Then, halting in the doorway, he watched as the sparks died away to reveal that Caine\u2019s mutated form had been altered into his wolf form.</p><p>The beast that came to Styx\u2019s chest gave himself a shake before he lowered his head to study the unconscious woman at his feet. Styx tensed, but the animal gave a low whine, gently nuzzling her cheek.</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d Styx muttered. \u201cI think it worked.\u201d</p><p>Rising to his feet, Salvatore ran a weary hand over his face. \u201cS\u00ed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, he doesn\u2019t look any happier.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore snorted as the large wolf stepped out of the manacles that no longer held him captive and bared his teeth, clearly prepared to pounce.</p><p>\u201cHow happy would you be to have two males near your unconscious mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough, but you can\u2019t leave her in there with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but only Cassandra can calm his beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the only one who can call off the enraged wolf is the unconscious woman?\u201d Styx rolled his eyes. \u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring Styx, the King of Weres once again raised his hand, pointing a finger at the motionless prophet.</p><p>\u201cCassandra,\u201d he commanded, his voice echoing through the small cell. \u201cCassandra, open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Cassie was perfectly comfortable as she floated in a state of unconsciousness.</p><p>Why not? Here in the darkness there were no cares, no worries, and best of all, no bothersome visions.</p><p>Well, there was that nagging voice that kept calling her name, she ruefully conceded, wishing it would go away. Of course it didn\u2019t. In fact, it became so compelling that it wrenched her out of her soothing cocoon with a merciless jerk.</p><p>Vaguely realizing she was lying on a hard floor, she lifted her head, only to give a low moan. Crap. It felt like someone was trying to drive a spike through her brain. \u201cOw,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cCassandra.\u201d The damn voice refused to leave her in peace. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, do you have to shout?\u201d she complained, her hand lifting to the large bump on her temple. \u201cMy head is killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it was recently smacked into the wall,\u201d a familiar voice informed her.</p><p>Salvatore.</p><p>Yes, he was the aggravating pest who kept interfering in her attempt to return to the darkness. And he was saying that her head hurt because she\u2019d smacked it into the wall.</p><p>Odd.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cassie gave a small gasp as her memories rushed back with shattering force.</p><p>Caine.</p><p>Shaking off the lingering fog in her brain, she surged to her knees and sent a frantic glance toward the looming presence she could feel beside her.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d A lump formed in her throat, her heart nearly shattering at the sight of the large wolf standing protectively in front of her. She\u2019d hoped her mad plan would work, of course. She\u2019d even prayed. But she hadn\u2019t believed. Not really, truly believed. Now she burst into tears as she threw her arms around Caine\u2019s neck and buried her face in his thick fur. \u201cCaine. Caine.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long she wept, lost in the tidal wave of relief. At last it was the sound of Salvatore clearing his throat that brought her head up to meet his golden gaze.</p><p>\u201cCassandra, I rejoice in your reunion, but we need to get you out of here.\u201d</p><p>She leaned her head against Caine\u2019s neck, her fingers stroking through his fur. The rich scent of his musk wrapped around her, seeping into her skin. \u201cYou reached him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The king gave a nod of his head, a smile on his lips despite the weariness that was etched onto his handsome face. \u201cWith your help.\u201d</p><p>She allowed her eyes to briefly flick toward the towering Aztec vampire at Salvatore\u2019s side before hastily returning them to the Were. She wasn\u2019t sure she was ready to deal with both the King of Weres and the Anasso. Not at the same time. Either one was overwhelming. Together . . . well, they were more than any poor female should have to confront.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he still in animal form?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s protecting his mate,\u201d Salvatore said. \u201cUntil you convince him that we aren\u2019t a threat to you he won\u2019t shift back to human.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Of course. Caine had been uberprotective from the moment they\u2019d met. Now that they were mated he was bound to be an over the top, pain in the ass fanatic.</p><p>\u201cCaine.\u201d She grabbed his muzzle with both hands, gazing deep in the glowing blue eyes that were no longer crazed, but still plenty feral. \u201cCaine, listen to me. I\u2019m fine. The danger has passed. No one\u2019s going to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>She said the words slowly, not because the wolf was stupid\u2014Caine was as frighteningly cunning in his animal form as in his human\u2014but because he kept glancing over her shoulder and growling at the two demons near the door.</p><p>\u201cDown, boy,\u201d Styx muttered.</p> <p>Salvatore breathed a low curse. \u201cYou\u2019re not helping, leech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it would be easier if you both would leave,\u201d Cassie pointed out dryly.</p><p>\u201cNo way in hell,\u201d Salvatore snapped, the prickles of his power causing Caine to growl in agitation.</p><p>Cassie heaved a resigned sigh, glancing over her shoulder. \u201cWell, that answers a question that has been bothering me.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore scowled. \u201cWhat question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether Caine\u2019s irrational stubbornness was a personality trait or if it was a character flaw shared by all men.\u201d Her glance encompassed both kings before returning to Caine. \u201cNow I know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think we were just insulted,\u201d Styx drawled.</p><p>Salvatore snorted. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust ignore Shaggy and Scooby-Doo and concentrate on me,\u201d Cassie told her mate, leaning forward to kiss the tip of his nose. \u201cYou\u2019ve done your job. You protected me. Now it\u2019s time to rest.\u201d She settled on the floor as the dangerous blue gaze took a last, cautious survey of the two males standing near the door before slowly sinking down on his haunches. \u201cThat\u2019s right, my love,\u201d she crooned softly, urging his massive head into her lap as she stroked his fur. \u201cJust rest.\u201d</p><p>She felt the massive body shudder beneath her hand, and continuing her gentle strokes, she waited patiently until the ancient magic filled the air. There was the sound of popping bones and the snapping of muscles as Caine shifted back to human, his head still in her lap as he sank into a deep, healing sleep.</p><p>Her heart swelled with an emotion so big it couldn\u2019t possibly be contained in such a small space, exploding through her as her trembling fingers stroked through the pale blond hair that fell over his forehead and down the narrow line of his nose.</p><p>Her mate . . .</p><p>The other half of her soul.</p> <p>She forgot the darkness that still waited to consume the world. And her duty as the prophet to try and halt the approaching doomsday.</p><p>She forgot everything but this man who had sacrificed all to protect her.</p><p>Eventually there was the sound of approaching footsteps and Salvatore squatted beside her.</p><p>\u201cLet me take him upstairs,\u201d he coaxed, wise enough not to reach for Caine until she gave a hesitant nod.</p><p>\u201cBe gentle.\u201d</p><p>The golden gaze slammed deep into her worried gaze, offering her a silent promise of safety. \u201cHe\u2019s a member of my pack. As you are, Cassandra.\u201d His lips twitched. \u201cEven if you did call me Scooby-Doo. You have nothing to fear from me.\u201d</p><p>She believed him. She could feel his presence flowing through her and into Caine, offering his strength without hesitation.</p><p>With another nod she rose to her feet, turning her head as a chill wrapped around her. Not surprising, she discovered that Styx had silently moved to stand beside her, his gaze on Salvatore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower and then share breakfast with my mate,\u201d the vampire said. \u201cUnless a rift opens in the front room I don\u2019t want to be disturbed.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore scooped Caine into his arms and with one fluid motion straightened to regard the Anasso with a mocking smile. \u201cYour wish is my command, oh mighty majesty.\u201d</p><p>The King of Vampires rolled his eyes, his stunningly beautiful face softening as he turned to offer her a small bow of his head. \u201cCassandra, welcome to my lair. I hope you will consider it your home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured, still wary of the large predator who looked like he might eat small children for breakfast.</p><p>\u201cI also hope you\u2019ll make time for Darcy,\u201d he continued, his words more a command than a request. \u201cShe\u2019s anxious to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will try once Caine is healed.\u201d</p><p>The vampire nodded, his expression warning he would come fetch her if she didn\u2019t make the required appearance to meet her sister. Then, with a last glance toward Salvatore, he was turning to move out the door with a fluid grace that was unnerving for such a large man.</p><p>Salvatore was swiftly following in Styx\u2019s path, cradling the naked man in his arms with an ease only a Were could achieve. \u201cThere are rooms upstairs,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be more comfortable there.\u201d</p><p>She hurried to catch up to his swift pace, a faint frown marring her brow as she unexpectedly recalled Styx\u2019s parting words. \u201cWhat did he mean by rifts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Dark Lord has managed to rip open a doorway between dimensions,\u201d Salvatore said.</p><p>She sucked in a shocked breath. \u201cShe\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but her minions are eager to cross over.\u201d</p><p>Cassie never faltered as she followed Salvatore out of the tunnels and up the stairs, but her mind was . . . empty.</p><p>Frighteningly empty.</p><p>The question was, why?</p><p>If the Dark Lord had truly managed to rip open doorways to the world, then surely that meant they were hurtling toward a turning point in time.</p><p>She should be inundated with visions. The gods knew that previous moments of upheaval had nearly drowned her in a confused avalanche of prophecies.</p><p>So why wasn\u2019t she seeing them now?</p><p>Had the Dark Lord done something to steal them from her?</p><p>Or had her mating to Caine altered her on some fundamental level?</p><p>\u201cCrap.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t aware that she\u2019d spoken aloud until Salvatore snapped his head in her direction, his expression concerned.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong? Did you have a vision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She wrapped her arms around her waist as a trickle of alarm inched down her spine. \u201cIt\u2019s dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe future.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>Caine woke in an unfamiliar room, stretched naked on a bed the size of Utah.</p><p>Usually the sign of a great night of partying, he wryly acknowledged, having spent more than a few nights indulging in the sort of decadent sins that would shock the most dedicated hedonist.</p><p>But not on this occasion.</p><p>At the moment, his only hope was that this was the end of a nightmare. A shudder wracked his body, wrenching a groan from his throat. Most of his memories were hazy, thank the gods, although not hazy enough to allow him to forget how close he\u2019d come to doing the unthinkable.</p><p>Regret seared through him as he jerked upright, his gaze skimming over the opulent ivory and gold furnishings. Not that he gave a crap about the antique dressing tables, or armoires, or matching wing chairs. Or even the overhead chandelier that caught the sunlight that spilled through the bay window.</p><p>He had one thing, and one thing only, on his mind.</p><p>\u201cCassie,\u201d he growled, pushing toward the edge of the acre-wide mattress.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t move,\u201d Cassie commanded, appearing in the doorway of the connected bathroom wearing nothing more than a short silk robe. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>A melting tenderness flowed through him as he took in her tousled blond hair and the pillow marks on her cheek that revealed she\u2019d just woken. With her wide emerald eyes and perfectly formed body she was as beautiful as an angel.</p><p>His angel.</p><p>The mating bond pulsed through him, as potent and intoxicating as any drug he\u2019d created in his former life.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you here?\u201d he questioned, patting the mattress in invitation.</p><p>She blinked, as always taking his words quite literally. \u201cI was going to take a shower while you slept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan it wait?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, and Caine felt as if the sun had settled in his heart. Then, with a natural grace, she was moving across the polished floor to perch on the mattress next to him.</p><p>He lowered his head to brush his lips over her cheek, his muscles tensing as he caught an unmistakable scent clinging to her skin. A low growl trickled from his throat. \u201cWhy do you smell of another man?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pulled back with a startled laugh. \u201cAfter everything we\u2019ve been through your first thought is that you can smell another man?\u201d</p><p>He nipped the tip of her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was there when it happened,\u201d she said, her voice husky.</p> <p>His annoyance was abruptly replaced by a jagged burst of guilt. What should have been the most beautiful moment in Cassie\u2019s life had instead been a stark necessity performed in the cramped cell of a vampire\u2019s lair. And, oh yeah, he\u2019d been crazed out of his freaking mind.</p><p>He brushed an unsteady finger over her cheek in a soft caress. \u201cCassie, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>He arched a brow at her uncharacteristic outburst. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>She stabbed her finger to the center of his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re about to make a big production out of your lack of control despite the fact you were under the influence of magic.\u201d</p> <p>Lack of control? He\u2019d become a monster. And if Cassie hadn\u2019t managed to stop him, he would have killed her.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a spell that made me attack you,\u201d he said gruffly, his voice thick with self-disgust.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Her expression was grim. \u201cIt was entirely my fault. I led you directly into a trap.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cCassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t use your guilt to alter the truth.\u201d She gave him another poke. \u201cI have put you into danger over and over and even when I knew you were going to be hurt I allowed you to remain with me. I put my dependence on you above your own life.\u201d</p><p>He grasped her finger and lifted it to his lips, nibbling at the tip. \u201cI don\u2019t remember giving you a choice.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes darkened with an aching remorse. \u201cThe choice has always been mine, but I was so selfish I was willing to risk your life just so I could have you with me.\u201d Caine felt her violent shudder. \u201cGods, I came so close to losing you.\u201d</p><p>With one motion, Caine tugged his mate into his lap and wrapped his arms around her trembling body. \u201cShh.\u201d He buried his face in the fragrant silk of her hair. \u201cI\u2019m not so easy to get rid of.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled into his chest, but she wasn\u2019t done with her self-flagellation. \u201cAnd then I forced a mating on you when you were in no condition to make such a decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForced?\u201d Had she lost her mind? With a frown he wrapped his hand around her throat, then pressed his thumb to the underside of her chin, tilting back her head to study her pale face. \u201cWhy would you even suggest something so idiotic? A mating can\u2019t be forced.\u201d</p><p>She met his outraged glare without flinching. \u201cYou were in no state of mind to decide whether or not you wanted to complete the bond, but I didn\u2019t know any other way to give Salvatore the connection to reach you.\u201d She gave a small squeak as he abruptly tossed her to the center of the mattress, using his larger body to pin her in place. \u201cCaine.\u201d</p><p>He ruthlessly arranged her slender body beneath him, settling between her legs and propping himself on his elbows to gaze down at her startled expression. \u201cLet\u2019s get two things straight,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She remained silent a long minute, no doubt trying to decide whether she wanted to hear what he had to say or punch him in the nose for behaving like a caveman.</p><p>At last, curiosity won out. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was born to become your mate.\u201d He placed a hand over her mouth when she would have protested. \u201cJust listen.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, waiting for him to remove his hand before muttering her opinion of males and their deficient DNA. But thankfully she made no effort to escape. \u201cFine, I\u2019m listening,\u201d she at last conceded.</p><p>\u201cMy destiny has always been to protect you. Always.\u201d He caught and held her gaze, laying bare his heart without hesitation. \u201cAnd if you ever try to take that away it will destroy me.\u201d He heard her breath catch at his blunt honesty, a startled tenderness flowing through their mating bond.</p><p>But, lifting a hand to brush his hair from his forehead, she managed a faux chiding expression. \u201cOkay, but if I\u2019m not allowed to feel guilty, then neither are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d he muttered dryly, well aware that he\u2019d been outmaneuvered.</p><p>He\u2019d intended to spend hours, if not days, wallowing in his self-reproach. Instead, his mate had cleverly snatched the rug from beneath his feet.</p><p>Clever, dangerous wolf.</p><p>He leaned down to nuzzle the curve of her neck, a smile touching his lips as she shivered in ready response.</p><p>\u201cYou said there were two things,\u201d she said in a breathy voice.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need her reminder as he trailed his lips to give the lobe of her ear a punishing nip. \u201cYou\u2019re now my mate.\u201d</p><p>Her hands lifted to stroke through his hair. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head to stab her with a gaze that was only partially teasing. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want you to mention another man\u2019s name when you stink of him.\u201d</p><p>Sensing his wolf was genuinely ruffled, she furrowed her brow in puzzlement. \u201cYou mean Salvatore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI warned you.\u201d Angling his head, he sank his teeth into the flesh of her throat, his musk filling the air to brand the woman beneath him. It was the most primitive sort of marking, but the mating bond was still raw and in need of proclaiming her as off-limits to other males.</p><p>Cassie moaned, the spice of her arousal teasing at Caine\u2019s nose as her fingers tangled in the short strands of his hair.</p><p>\u201cHe carried you to this room and I walked beside him,\u201d she said to comfort his beast. \u201cNothing else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He nuzzled a path along the line of her jaw. \u201cBut I\u2019m finding it hard to be civilized right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaine.\u201d Her fingers tightened in his hair as he covered her lips with slow, drugging kisses.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to rest.\u201d</p><p>His sucked her bottom lip, pressing his fully erect cock against her inner thigh. They groaned in unison, the mating bond only intensifying the potent desire that flowed between them.</p><p>\u201cWhat I need is my mate,\u201d he assured her, stealing another deep kiss before seeking the scented pulse at the base of her throat.</p><p>\u201cMate.\u201d She shivered as his tongue stroked her skin, his fingers tugging at the belt of her robe. \u201cIt feels . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She heaved a satisfied sigh. \u201cAstonishing.\u201d</p><p>Caine was in full agreement.</p><p>It was astonishing.</p><p>Astonishing and magical and entrancing.</p><p>Leaning back, he peeled open her robe, savoring the sight of her small breasts tipped with rosy nipples already hard with need.</p><p>She was exquisite.</p><p>A masterpiece of ivory and gold that perfectly matched the decor.</p><p>With a low growl, he swooped down to circle one of the tempting peaks with the tip of his tongue, chuckling at her soft gasp of pleasure. \u201cAnd how does this feel?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers slid down his neck to trace the line of his shoulders. \u201cMmm . . . nice enough, I suppose,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cNice?\u201d The heat of his desire sizzled through him, nearly setting the air on fire. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t provoke a hungry wolf, pet.\u201d</p><p>Her hands moved to explore the bare width of his chest, a smoldering invitation in her emerald eyes. \u201cAh, but he\u2019s my hungry wolf.\u201d</p><p>For all eternity, he silently swore, refusing to contemplate the world outside the bedroom door. In this rare moment of peace he was just a wolf with the woman who filled his heart with a joy he\u2019d never dreamed possible.</p><p>\u201cYour wolf needs a kiss,\u201d he coaxed softly.</p><p>A slow smile curved her lips. \u201cSuch a demanding beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRavenous.\u201d He gave her nipple a slow lick before turning to share equal pleasure with her neglected breast. \u201cGreedy.\u201d He caught the nipple with the edge of his teeth, biting just hard enough to make her arch in encouragement. \u201cInsatiable.\u201d</p><p>She trailed her foot up and down the back of his leg, the movement brushing her thigh against his straining erection. At the same time, her lips nibbled a line of searing kisses along his collarbone.</p><p>\u201cJust how I like you,\u201d she assured him, giving his own nipple a wicked lick.</p><p>Carnal bliss jolted through him, and with a shaky groan he rested his forehead between her breasts. \u201cCareful, pet. I\u2019m a breath away from early combustion.\u201d</p><p>She stilled. \u201cThat\u2019s one of those strange exaggerations, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re not truly going to combust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt all depends on your definition of combustion,\u201d he muttered, grasping her wrists and tugging her hands over her head.</p><p>He caught a brief glimpse of emerald eyes dark with need before he was claiming her lips in a kiss of blatant hunger. Over and over he devoured her mouth, his hips gently rocking against her in time with her soft sounds of growing need.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m beginning to understand,\u201d she rasped, shivering as he released her lips and stroked his lips down the curve of her neck and then kissed the tip of each nipple.</p><p>Not entirely convinced she was as close to combustion as he wanted her to be, Caine continued his seductive path down the flat plane of her stomach, taking a minute to tease her tiny belly button before he was sliding off the edge of the bed and tugging her legs apart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His wolf strained at the leash, eager to claim the woman who was now bound to him. The man, thankfully, didn\u2019t intend to pounce.</p><p>At least not yet.</p><p>With a tender thoroughness he nibbled down her slender leg to the tips of her toes, breathing deeply of her delectable scent. Silk and lavender. Pure bewitchment. He made a similar path along her other leg before he pulled back to simply admire the sight of her stretched out before him.</p> <p>\u201cYou are so beautiful,\u201d he murmured, his fingers tracing a light path along the inside of her thighs.</p><p>She trembled, her soft pants like music to his ears. \u201cWhy are you waiting?\u201d</p><p>He allowed his fingers to drift upward, brushing close, so very close, to her damp heat. \u201cAnticipation is half the fun.\u201d</p><p>Cassie muttered something beneath her breath, glancing down where he was poised between her legs.</p><p>\u201cCaine?\u201d</p> <p>He hid his smile of satisfaction at her flushed cheeks and the hectic glitter in her eyes. \u201cYes, my love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you deliberately tormenting me?\u201d</p><p>He pretended to consider. \u201cYes, I believe I am.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cI can combust alone, you know.\u201d</p><p>He made a choked sound of disbelief before he tilted back his head to laugh with rich enjoyment. \u201cAh, Cassie. You\u2019re truly an original.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted, but before she could continue her chastisement, he leaned forward to discover the very heart of her pleasure.</p> <p>Whatever she was about to say was lost on a low groan and she flopped back onto the mattress as he used his tongue and teeth until her hips were lifting up in a silent plea for release.</p><p>Scooting her back to the center of the bed, he moved to cover her, giving a startled grunt when Cassie reached to wrap her fingers around his aching cock.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he breathed as she stroked down to his heavy sack before moving back to tease at the sensitive tip. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>She arched a mocking brow, her eyes dark with a smoldering desire. \u201cAnticipation is half the fun.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head to brush his mouth over her lips. \u201cCassie, are you tormenting me?\u201d</p><p>Her smile was as ancient as Eve. \u201cYes, I believe I am.\u201d</p><p>He allowed her another stroke before he gave a low growl and, sliding his hands beneath her hips, entered her with one smooth motion.</p><p>Cassie dug her nails into his shoulders, her legs wrapping around his hips as he began a slow, steady pace.</p> <p>\u201cMy mate,\u201d she whispered, her words settling deep in his heart. \u201cAt last.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down to capture her lips in a kiss that spoke of his unwavering commitment.</p><p>\u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>Six hours later, Cassie still hadn\u2019t managed to get to the shower. Not that she was complaining.</p><p>Laying in a tangle of rumpled sheets and sweaty male Were, she rested her head on the wide width of his chest, listening to the steady beat of his heart as her fingers drew aimless patterns on his skin.</p><p>Having Caine as a lover had been magical from his first kiss. Their chemistry had nothing to do with fate or mystic bonds, and everything to do with old-fashioned lust. But there was no denying that their mating had amped up the intensity of her pleasure to almost unbearable heights.</p><p>Now she was exhausted in all the right ways. Well, mostly, she ruefully corrected. Her body was so limp with pleasure the mere thought of moving made her groan. But her mind . . .</p><p>The stupid thing refused to float in the same sated bliss as the rest of her. It kept churning, searching for answers to the question that refused to leave her peace.</p><p>Assuming that Caine had fallen back to sleep, Cassie was unprepared when he slid a finger beneath her chin and tilted back her head to study her pale face.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something troubling you.\u201d</p><p>She had to concentrate not to be distracted by his masculine beauty. Good . . . Lord. With the dying rays of sunlight shimmering like the finest gold in his pale hair and his eyes glowing like flawless sapphires, he could easily have rivaled Adonis.</p><p>\u201cThese are troubling times,\u201d she managed to hedge.</p><p>His jaw hardened with an unexpected flare of annoyance. \u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d he warned in flat tones.</p><p>She blinked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re, without doubt, the worst liar I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>She lifted herself to a sitting position, glaring down at his ruthless expression. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, that\u2019s a compliment, pet,\u201d he said, folding his arms beneath his head. \u201cBut it does mean that you can\u2019t fool me. Besides, I can feel you worry through our bond.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>She\u2019d been so enchanted by the obvious benefits of their mating bond, she\u2019d never considered the possibility there might be a downside. A sigh escaped between her parted lips. It was too late to regret that she\u2019d forever chained this magnificent Were to her crazy existence.</p><p>It was no doubt inevitable.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it\u2019s a good thing that I don\u2019t have a ton of secrets I want to keep hidden.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, he reached out to cup his hand behind her head, tugging her down to kiss her with blatant possession.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a mating bond to discover your secrets,\u201d he murmured against her lips.</p><p>A shiver of heat raced through her, stirring the passions that she would have sworn were too weary to be stirred. \u201cNo?\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He nipped her bottom lip, the scent of his musk filling her senses, imprinting his claim on her skin. \u201cI have more creative methods of making you talk.\u201d</p><p>Catching a glimpse of his smug pleasure at her tremors of need, Cassie boldly trailed her hand downward, rubbing her hardened nipples against his chest as her fingers curled around the thickening length of his erection. \u201cDo your worse.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, his eyes squeezing shut as she explored the hard shaft with a bold touch. \u201cAh, how the mighty are fallen,\u201d he ground out.</p><p>She tilted back her head as his lips branded a path down her jaw before finding the sensitive curve of her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He bit the flesh at the base of her neck, making her arch in a jolt of shocking bliss. Then, releasing his teeth, he soothed the tingling flesh with tiny kisses.</p><p>\u201cMy creative methods appear to backfire when it comes to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>Reaching down, Caine grasped her wrist and gently tugged her fingers away from his throbbing cock.</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed at her small smile, and he abruptly twisted to the side so he could pin her to the mattress. Tugging her hands over her head, he regarded her with a determined expression. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be distracted,\u201d he warned. \u201cTell me what\u2019s bothering you.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced, accepting playtime was over. The real world was about to intrude whether they wanted it or not.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>His brows snapped together. \u201cCassandra.\u201d</p><p>He never used the full name they\u2019d chosen only weeks before, revealing he was nearing the end of his patience. As if his annoyance wasn\u2019t sizzling through their mating bond.</p><p>\u201cI mean \u2018nothing\u2019 quite literally,\u201d she hastily corrected.</p><p>He stilled. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be a little more specific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the Dark Lord is truly on the brink of returning . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he interrupted, his voice harsh. \u201cI need you to back up, pet. Why do you think the Dark Lord is on the brink of returning?\u201d</p><p>Cassie felt a sharp pang of remorse. How had she forgotten he\u2019d been in no condition to comprehend what was happening during the past few days?</p><p>\u201cShe has Maluhia.\u201d</p><p>His breath hissed through clenched teeth. \u201cI was hoping that was just a nightmare,\u201d he muttered. \u201cHas she become the Gemini?\u201d</p><p>Cassie shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it happen, but she must have completed the transformation if she\u2019s able to open rifts to this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRifts?\u201d His eyes abruptly held the power of his wolf. Hunter. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I only heard Styx mention them to Salvatore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the Dark Lord attempting to come through?\u201d</p><p>Cassie shook her head. \u201cI think she intends to empty out the bowels of hell first.\u201d</p><p>Caine considered her words before giving a slow nod of agreement. \u201cThat would make sense. Why would she risk her neck when she could send her minions to do her dirty work?\u201d His lips curled in pure hatred. \u201cBitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>His thumbs absently rubbed the skin of her inner wrists, his gaze sweeping over her pale face. \u201cAre you worried we won\u2019t be able to stop her?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cIn part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie, talk to me,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Stubborn wolf. He wasn\u2019t going to let this go. Not until he was convinced he\u2019d wrung out her entire confession.</p><p>\u201cThere haven\u2019t been any visions.\u201d</p><p>He seemed more puzzled than frightened by her revelation. \u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>She licked her dry lips. Just talking about her lack of prophecies made her stomach cramp. \u201cSince we escaped from the Dark Lord.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSurely that should make you happy?\u201d he asked cautiously. \u201cYou hate the visions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy preference doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She shivered at the cost of losing her visions when she needed them the most. \u201cThey might make the difference between our survival and the end of the world.\u201d</p><p>He tensed at her blunt words, belatedly understanding why she was so distressed. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been able to conjure them on command,\u201d he tried to soothe. \u201cThey might simply . ..\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cBe on hiatus.\u201d He clearly reached for the first excuse that came to mind. \u201cIt\u2019s been a stressful few days, after all.\u201d</p><p>She smiled wryly, appreciating his effort, even if she didn\u2019t believe for a minute that it was a temporary glitch. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019ve had more than a few stressful days over the years,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cBut there\u2019s never been a time I haven\u2019t had visions. And when the future is in chaos, like it is now, I have hundreds of them. It doesn\u2019t make sense they would suddenly disappear.\u201d</p><p>Caine went rigid above her, his face draining of color. \u201c\u2018The Gemini will rise and chaos shall rule for all eternity,\u2019\u201d he quoted in his husky tones.</p><p>She gave a slow nod. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p> <p>Their gazes locked as the full implication of her words sank in, Caine\u2019s eyes darkening with unease.</p><p>\u201cYou think . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m not having visions because the Gemini has already won.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Styx\u2019s study</p><p>Although he\u2019d managed time for a shower and a few blessed hours in the arms of his mate, Styx was still in a foul mood as he entered his study to find Viper waiting for him.</p> <p>The Chicago clan chief had only minutes before returned from the rift, and as Styx watched him pace the floor, he wasn\u2019t surprised to discover that the younger vampire looked as fatigued as Styx felt.</p><p>His silver-blond hair was hanging loose down his back and his usually immaculate velvet jacket and black slacks were wrinkled and coated with dust. Even the pale features were lined with a weariness he couldn\u2019t disguise.</p><p>Crossing to lean against his desk, Styx folded his arms over his chest, which was covered by a black T-shirt that matched his black jeans.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>Coming to a halt in the center of the room, Viper met his questioning gaze with a grimace. \u201cAriyal\u2019s tribe has managed to block the rift, but it\u2019s taking all of them to do it.\u201d He shrugged a shoulder. \u201cThey\u2019re only a temporary solution.\u201d</p><p>Styx gave a nod. It was as much as he could hope for. \u201cThey\u2019ve given us time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Viper\u2019s lips twisted. \u201cNow what the hell are we going to do with it?\u201d</p><p>Styx snorted. That was a hell of a question. \u201cI\u2019m open to ideas.\u201d</p> <p>Without answers, Viper instead turned the conversation. \u201cHas Jagr taken off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Styx had seen his Raven off less than an hour before. \u201cHe\u2019s promised to report in with Regan.\u201d</p><p>There was a sudden chime and Viper reached beneath his jacket to remove his cell phone. \u201cSpeaking of checking in,\u201d the clan chief muttered, swiftly reading his message. \u201cIt\u2019s Santiago.\u201d</p><p>Styx lifted his brows in surprise. Not that the powerful warrior wouldn\u2019t be a welcomed addition. \u201cHe\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s still with Nefri. They\u2019re traveling to the rift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see if her medallion can close it.\u201d</p><p>Styx hissed in self-disgust. \u201cClever. I should have considered the possibility myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t think of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to if we\u2019re going to survive.\u201d</p><p>With a sharp movement, Viper crossed to the sidebar, pouring two shots of the finest whiskey in Chicago before returning to shove one of the balloon glasses into Styx\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t fighting this battle alone,\u201d Viper said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d With a wry smile, Styx took a sip of the whiskey, enjoying the expensive burn as it slid down his throat. His companion was right. The demon world was coming together as it never had before to face the evil confronting it. \u201cThank the gods.\u201d</p><p>Viper emptied his drink with one swallow, setting the glass on a nearby shelf. \u201cWhat about the prophet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still in her rooms, although that damned guard dog of hers finally let Darcy in to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t had a vision?\u201d</p><p>Styx set aside his own glass, his brows lowering in an annoyed scowl as he recalled his earlier attempt to speak with Cassandra. \u201cNot that I know of, but Caine won\u2019t allow me close enough to ask.\u201d</p><p>Viper rolled his eyes. \u201cNewly mated Weres are a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Styx abruptly chuckled. \u201cYou on the other hand were the very essence of a civilized gentleman during your pursuit of Shay.\u201d</p><p>The younger vampire\u2019s lips twitched. They both knew that Viper had become an obsessed predator the moment he\u2019d found Shay being held captive by a coven of witches.</p><p>Their courtship had been the stuff of legends.</p><p>\u201cThere might have been an occasional glimpse of my more primitive side,\u201d he ruefully conceded.</p><p>\u201cYou were a raving lunatic.\u201d</p><p>Viper sent him a speaking glance. \u201cIt takes one to know one.\u201d</p><p>Styx thought back to his pursuit of Darcy with an unexpected pang of bittersweet longing. At the time, his battle had been with Salvatore. A tangible enemy with enough honor to understand the rules of warfare.</p><p>Now...</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt all seems like a very long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel you,\u201d Viper muttered.</p><p>They shared a glance of mutual regret at the loss of simpler times before the moment was interrupted by the sound of footsteps.</p><p>Styx glanced toward the open doorway, already sensing the identity of the approaching vampire. \u201cRoke.\u201d</p><p>Viper scowled. \u201cWhy is he still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can use all the help we can get.\u201d Styx pointed a finger at the younger vampire. \u201cBehave yourself.\u201d</p><p>Viper pressed a hand to his chest, his fallen-angel beauty emphasized by his overly innocent expression as he quoted back Styx\u2019s own words. \u201cI promise to be the very essence of a civilized gentleman.\u201d</p><p>Styx snapped his fangs toward his companion. \u201cYou\u2019re a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least we can agree on one thing,\u201d Roke drawled as he stepped into the room.</p><p>Viper stepped forward, but Styx grabbed his arm before they could come to blows. If the world managed to survive the looming apocalypse, he was going to lock the two clan chiefs into a room and not let them out until they could play nice.</p><p>\u201cHave you completed your task?\u201d he demanded of Roke.</p><p>\u201cTask?\u201d The Nevada clan chief narrowed his gaze, his strange silver eyes shimmering with a dangerous glow. \u201cYou make it sound like you asked me to rotate your tires, not find a way to tempt the ultimate evil into this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted my tires rotated I would call a mechanic,\u201d Styx informed him without apology. \u201cI expect my clan chiefs to perform miracles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Roke muttered.</p><p>Styx waved an impatient hand. He could feel the relentless ticking of the clock beating against him. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>Roke stood with a quiet confidence that went deeper than his position as vampire or clan chief. He was a lethal predator to the very bones. \u201cWe can\u2019t force her out of her lair.\u201d</p><p>Viper pulled away from Styx\u2019s grip, his expression mocking. \u201cGenius.\u201d</p><p>Roke curled his lips to expose his fangs. \u201cAt least one of us has brains.\u201d</p><p>Styx muttered a foul curse, giving another wave of his hand. \u201cContinue.\u201d</p><p>Roke returned his attention to Styx, although he looked like he would rather continue bantering with his fellow clan chief.</p><p>Not a good sign.</p><p>\u201cSo we have to offer her a temptation too great to resist,\u201d Roke said.</p><p>There was an empty silence as Styx waited for more, swiftly followed by Viper\u2019s sound of disgust.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cViper,\u201d Styx growled, more to prevent yet another headache-inducing squabble than to protest his skepticism. He wasn\u2019t too enthused about the vague solution either.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Viper snapped, lifting his hands in a gesture of peace. \u201cWhat temptation would lure the psycho bastard . . . wait, the psycho bitch, from her bat cave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe person who locked her in her bat cave in the first place,\u201d Roke smoothly retorted.</p><p>Viper frowned. \u201cThe Phoenix?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Styx\u2019s voice filled the air with a frigid power that shattered the overhead chandelier and coated the marble figurines with ice. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>Roke stood unflinching, his raven hair blowing around his lean face as the power rushed over him. \u201cYou asked for a suggestion, I gave you one.\u201d</p><p>Styx clutched his hands. The Phoenix was too vital to the future of the world to risk her in such a dangerous gamble. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot one that\u2019s feasible,\u201d he rasped. \u201cReturn to Cezar and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, Styx,\u201d Viper interrupted, his expression grim.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs much as I hate to agree with Roke on anything, I have to admit his suggestion has merit. We should at least discuss the idea.\u201d</p><p>Styx hissed in shock. Was Viper suggesting that they offer up Abby like a sacrificial lamb?</p><p>\u201cBefore or after Dante chops off your head?\u201d he snarled.</p><p>Viper glanced toward the vampire standing silently near the door.</p><p>\u201cRoke, will you give us a minute?\u201d Viper\u2019s words were more a command than a request.</p> <p>The clan chief paused, then with a glance toward Styx\u2019s dangerously composed expression, he gave a sharp nod. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the library.\u201d</p><p>Viper waited until Roke was out of the room and headed down the hallway before he stepped toward Styx.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Styx growled, holding up a warning hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>The younger vampire planted his hands on his hips, his expression warning it was going to take violence to halt him from sharing his opinion. \u201cStyx, you are without a doubt the finest Anasso to ever lead the vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you can sway me with flattery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done.\u201d</p> <p>Styx snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t let me stop you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was about to say that what makes you such a great leader is also your greatest weakness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoyalty.\u201d</p><p>Styx froze, catapulted back in time to when he was the trusted servant of the previous Anasso. He\u2019d been a savage until the master had recruited him to become his soldier in the fight to pull the vampires out of the dark ages.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been pretty. Nefri had led her clan beyond the Veil to create peace among her people; Styx\u2019s master, on the other hand, had used brute force and intimidation.</p><p>But it had worked. At least marginally. They were, after all, feral creatures.</p><p>Unfortunately, at some point the ancient vampire had become infected by the blood of human drug addicts. Styx had tried his best to save his master from his own weakness, even to the point of hiding the Anasso\u2019s growing madness from others, but in the end there had been no choice but to put him out of his misery.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Viper demanded. The Chicago clan chief had been witness to Styx\u2019s conflicted battle between allegiance and duty. \u201cYour heart was convinced that protecting your mentor was what was best for the vampires even though your head understood what had to be done.\u201d</p><p>Styx narrowed his gaze. Nothing was ever black-and-white. A good leader understood that he had to make decisions among the various shades of gray.</p><p>\u201cAnd if we were speaking of using Shay as bait,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>Viper\u2019s midnight eyes flared with an instinctive fury, but with an obvious effort, he refused to be swayed. \u201cI would try to kill you,\u201d he admitted in cold tones. \u201cBut your duty isn\u2019t just to me. Or Shay. Or Abby.\u201d</p><p>Spinning on his heel, Styx stomped across the room, his body trembling with the force of his emotions. \u201cDamn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I don\u2019t like this any better than you,\u201d Viper continued to press. \u201cDante has been a brother to me for a very long time and Abby has become as dear to me as a sister. The thought of putting her in danger makes me want to ram my head through a wall. But can we destroy the world because we don\u2019t like the choices we\u2019re given?\u201d</p><p>Styx wanted to block out the compelling words. An Anasso was supposed to protect his people, not put innocents in the direct line of fire.</p><p>A damned shame that Viper had a point.</p><p>Could he truly put the future of the world in jeopardy if there was the slightest chance to alter fate?</p><p>Feeling every one of his numerous years weighing down on him, Styx forced himself to turn back to his companion. \u201cEven if I do agree to this madness and we manage to keep Dante from disappearing with his mate, we have no guarantee that the Dark Lord will give a shit about Abby,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cThe creature has to know the Phoenix is in the world, but she hasn\u2019t shown any interest in her before now.\u201d</p><p>Viper nodded. \u201cTrue, but the Dark Lord has always been a victim of his\u201d\u2014he made a sound of annoyance\u2014\u201cI mean her bloated pride. If she caught a scent of the Phoenix near the rift, her desire for revenge might overcome her need for caution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of ifs,\u201d Styx muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s surely worth a try?\u201d</p><p>Was it?</p><p>Styx scowled, not yet prepared to concede defeat. \u201cHave you considered what happens if Abby or the goddess she carries inside her are destroyed?\u201d</p><p>Viper studied him with an unwavering gaze. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now we still have the hope that we can injure the Dark Lord\u2019s current form sufficiently to drive its essence out and she will be forced to retreat back to her prison,\u201d he pointed out, just as he had for Salvatore. \u201cIf we lose the Phoenix nothing will stop her.\u201d</p><p>Viper didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cAnd if we do nothing?\u201d</p><p>Styx briefly contemplated the pleasure of rearranging Viper\u2019s perfect features. It wasn\u2019t the first time. Viper was one of the few vampires with the balls to stand up to him. Something that Styx didn\u2019t always accept with grace.</p><p>Instead he gave a shake of his head. \u201cThere has to be another way\u2014\u201d he began, only to break off as a shrill beep cut through the air. Digging the cell phone out of his pocket, he was astonished to discover his burst of power hadn\u2019t destroyed the thing. He almost wished it had when he caught a glimpse of the message waiting for him. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Viper demanded.</p><p>\u201cRegan heard from Jagr.\u201d</p><p>Viper curled his hands into fists, already sensing the news wasn\u2019t good. \u201cAnother rift?\u201d</p><p>Styx tossed the phone on his desk. \u201cTwo more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re out of time.\u201d</p><p>It was true.</p><p>As much as he hated to put Abby in danger, they had to find some means of destroying the Dark Lord before the hordes of hell overwhelmed them.</p><p>Now the question was how to get Abby to the nearest rift before it was too late.</p><p>\u201cGet Levet,\u201d he abruptly commanded.</p><p>Viper blinked in confusion. \u201cWhy the gargoyle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to get a message to Abby without interference from Dante. If he suspects we intend to use his mate as bait he\u2019ll do everything in his power to stop us,\u201d he said, grimacing at the knowledge Dante would never forgive him. \u201cLevet is the only one who can reach directly into her mind.\u201d</p><p>The gardens at the back of Styx\u2019s mansion were just as rigidly formal as the rest of the estate. Perfectly manicured hedges that framed the individual rose beds, marble fountains circled by wrought-iron benches, and in the center of the flagstone pathways, a domed grotto that was bigger than most homes.</p><p>Lovely, of course, Levet acknowledged, but nothing compared to the gardens he\u2019d known in France. No one could outdo the sun kings when it came to lavish excess.</p><p>Kicking a stray stone, Levet wandered aimlessly through the darkness, his wings twitching and his heart heavy. He hadn\u2019t wanted to contact Abby. Not when he realized that Styx was asking her to deliberately put herself in front of the rift to piss off an evil deity.</p><p>But what choice had he had?</p><p>The vampires had insisted that without the presence of the Goddess of Light the entire world was doomed to be overrun with evil....</p><p>Rubbing his stunted horn, Levet wallowed in his misery, blithely unaware of the hint of brimstone that suddenly mixed with the scent of roses in the air.</p><p>So it was no wonder he nearly jumped out of his skin when a hand lightly touched his shoulder and a female voice whispered next to his ear, \u201cWhy so sad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSacrebleu.\u201d</p><p>Leaping to the side, Levet glared at the small female demon with black, oblong eyes and a pale braid that hung nearly to the ground.</p><p>Yannah.</p><p>The female who\u2019d bewitched him to the point of dropping everything to search for her like a Were in heat.</p><p>Imbecile.</p><p>\u201cHello, Levet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d He scowled, in no mood to be teased. \u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, her heart-shaped face a picture of innocence.

Oh, and the power that thundered through the air.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He tilted his chin, refusing to acknowledge the sizzling awareness that burned through him. So what if he felt like he\u2019d been struck by lightning every time he caught a glimpse of this female? Or that his heart soared with delight? He was finished making a fool of himself. \u201cI have followed you from here to Paris and back again. And for what?\u201d He lifted his hands, waving them in magnificent disgust. \u201cNot so much as a kiss.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head, looking like an inquisitive bird. \u201cWould a kiss take away that frown?\u201d</p><p>A kiss?</p><p>His heart gave one of those flutters, his blood heating at the mere thought of pulling her tiny body into his arms and tasting her brimstone passion. He had waited so long. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt might\u2014\u201d He snapped his lips together. Mon Dieu. She had nearly done it to him again. \u201cNon. This is no time for your games.\u201d</p><p>She pouted, but catching sight of his sour expression, she heaved a sigh. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>He glanced around the shadowed garden, half expecting Yannah\u2019s mother to be hiding among the hedges. Which was ridiculous. Siljar was an Oracle, not a thief that skulked in the bushes. Not to mention the pertinent fact, she had the sort of power signature that could crush at a hundred paces.</p> <p>If she was nearby, he would know.</p><p>He returned his attention to the tiny female who moved to stand in front of him, her white robe long enough to brush the paving stones. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sensed your unhappiness.\u201d She reached to gently stroke the tip of one stunted horn. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done something I will never forgive myself for,\u201d he shocked himself by admitting.</p><p>It had nothing to do with her soft touch or the hint of sympathy in her dark eyes, he assured himself. He wasn\u2019t that easily manipulated.</p> <p>It was just . . . he needed someone to talk to.</p><p>Anyone would do. Even the marble statue of Neptune that spouted water out of his head.</p><p>Yeah, that was it.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cYou\u2019ve called for the Goddess of Light.\u201d</p><p>Levet didn\u2019t bother to ask how the female knew he\u2019d used his magic to speak directly into Abby\u2019s mind. Or that he\u2019d urged her to travel to the rift. Yannah had more than one mysterious talent.</p><p>\u201cOui.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy does that trouble you?\u201d Yannah frowned, obviously puzzled by his distress. \u201cIt\u2019s the purpose of the Phoenix to stand against the tide of darkness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the Phoenix will not be charging into the battle alone,\u201d Levet said, his wings drooping at the mere thought of sweet, oh-so-fragile Abby standing face-to-face with the Dark Lord. \u201cThe spirit will take ma ch\u00e9rie amie along for the outing.\u201d</p><p>Yannah gave a faint shake of her head. \u201cYou mean along for the ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is what I said, is it not?\u201d he asked with an impatient frown.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, it\u2019s a time of change.\u201d Yannah tried to soothe. \u201cWe\u2019re all called to do our duty, whether we like it or not.\u201d</p><p>Levet pulled away from her distracting touch, pacing the distance between two ornate urns. \u201cWell, I do not like it,\u201d he muttered, his tail whipping behind him. \u201cI do not like it at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stop, Levet,\u201d Yannah pleaded. \u201cYou\u2019re making my head spin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBien.\u201d He came to a halt. Not because that\u2019s what she wanted. But how else could he send her a warning glare? \u201cYou have been making my head spin from the moment we met.\u201d He pointed a claw in her direction. \u201cAnd, you punched me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was a love-tap.\u201d</p><p>Levet made a sound of disbelief. \u201cLove-tap? You broke my jaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want an apology?\u201d</p><p>What he wanted was for her to kiss and make it better, a renegade voice whispered.</p><p>Kiss him over and over and over.</p><p>And not just on the jaw.</p><p>They could slip into the grotto where they would be all alone. He could at last indulge in the fantasies that had plagued him for weeks.</p><p>Non. Non. Non.</p><p>He folded his arms over his chest, just like he\u2019d seen Styx do when he wanted to be an intimidating badass. \u201cI want to be left in peace.\u201d</p><p>Yannah studied him, the dark gaze unnerving in its intensity. \u201cThis is more than guilt at calling your friend into danger, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He started to deny her ridiculous accusation only to find the words dying on his lips. Against his will his gaze shifted to the mansion where he could hear the rumble of vampires and Weres shouting orders.</p><p>\u201cThey are preparing for war while I am condemned to the gardens. You see, my skills are\u201d\u2014he searched for the appropriate word\u2014\u201clacking.\u201d</p><p>Yannah regarded him with a shocked confusion that seemed genuine. \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She gave a fierce shake of her head, the braid swinging from side to side. \u201cIt\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>Any other night Levet would have reveled in her fierce defense. Why not? He\u2019d tried every trick possible to capture her attention only to be dismissed, abandoned, and forgotten.</p><p>Tonight, however, he\u2019d been brutally reminded of his numerous inadequacies. With a grimace, he glanced down at his stunted body. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have looked,\u201d she assured him. \u201cMore than once.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head with a scowl. \u201cIf I were one of my brothers they would beg for my assistance. I would be a powerful warrior with magic that would make even the Dark Lord tremble in fear.\u201d</p><p>She slowly stepped forward, her hands folded at her waist and the moonlight pooling around her. Despite her tiny size, she looked as regal as any queen.</p><p>\u201cNo, Levet,\u201d she said, her voice oddly somber. \u201cIf you were one of your brothers you would be hibernating in your lair waiting to offer your loyalty to whoever comes out the winner.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t at all what he\u2019d expected and his pity party was suddenly deflated as effectively as if she\u2019d stuck a pin in a balloon.</p><p>She was right. From all reports his brethren had retreated beneath the streets of Paris, ignoring Styx\u2019s call for demons to stand against the Dark Lord. Like rats fleeing a sinking ship. Gargoyles were infamous for bowing to whoever sat on the throne. Loyalty was not a word in their vocabulary.</p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s true,\u201d he slowly agreed.</p><p>She reached to place her hands on his shoulders, standing close enough he could feel the pulse of her power surrounding him.</p><p>\u201cBesides, you have a weapon far more important than muscles or magic.\u201d</p><p>Levet found himself lost in the compelling darkness of her eyes. \u201cWhat weapon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA heart.\u201d Her hand moved to rest in the center of his chest. \u201cThe one power that can\u2019t be defeated by evil.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>The Dark Lord\u2019s prison</p><p>Gaius seriously underestimated the instinctive desire of any creature for survival.</p><p>He\u2019d been convinced that he had nothing left to hope for. Nothing left but bitter regret and endless days of wishing for a swift death that would at last reunite him with Dara.</p><p>But the moment the Dark Lord had turned her attention to creating further rifts, he found his feet carrying himself forward, scouring the godforsaken surroundings for a way to escape.</p><p>A frustrating, not to mention, futile waste of time.</p><p>Although he still had his medallion, he discovered it no longer obeyed his commands. Not surprising. The Dark Lord wasn\u2019t stupid. She knew he would disappear at the first opportunity.</p><p>And while he could sense the doorways she\u2019d ripped through the veils, and occasionally catch the scent of demons as they sought to use the openings to spill from their particular hell dimension, he couldn\u2019t push his way through them.</p><p>Perhaps this was his punishment.</p><p>To be trapped with the Dark Lord, all the while knowing that freedom lurked just out of reach.</p><p>It seemed fitting.</p><p>Standing near a stunted tree, Gaius flinched as a flare of heat seared over him, threatening to melt the flesh from his bones.</p><p>\u201cGaius.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to turn. Not only because he was weary of her taunting, but because it made him nauseous to watch the strange spirit flickering around her.</p><p>But what he did or didn\u2019t want no longer mattered. Not since he\u2019d bartered away his soul.</p><p>With a slow movement, he stepped around the dead tree and faced the female eyeing him with petulant displeasure. \u201cYes, Mistress?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes smoldered with crimson fire while the misty outline of the Gemini haloed her slender body. \u201cWere you hiding from me?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He wryly glanced around the empty landscape. \u201cWhere would I go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but you were plotting something,\u201d she accused. \u201cI can sense it.\u201d</p><p>He stoically refused to react. Instead, he tried for a distraction. \u201cWas there something you needed?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause before she dismissed any thought of him with a wave of her hand. \u201cThe transformation should be complete,\u201d she complained. The lion\u2019s head flickered in and out of focus just behind her, as if being shorted out by some unseen electrical charge.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps another sacrifice is needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she glared at him with malevolent annoyance. As if the spirit\u2019s refusal to complete the binding was his fault. \u201cThere is something interfering. Or someone.\u201d</p><p>He took an instinctive step backward. \u201cYou can\u2019t think that I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she snapped. \u201cDespite the treachery you harbor in your heart, you don\u2019t possess the power to halt my inevitable victory.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted. All true.</p><p>Humiliatingly true.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one else here.\u201d He pointed out the obvious.</p><p>\u201cWhich means the interference must be coming from one of the rifts.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gaius was motionless, his mind shifting through the unexpected revelation. Of all the possibilities he\u2019d considered, he\u2019d never once given thought to an outside force being able to penetrate this hellhole.</p><p>A gift. One he\u2019d have to use with great care.</p><p>\u201cThen close them,\u201d he offered the suggestion that she would be expecting. Anything else would immediately rouse her suspicions.</p> <p>She reached to grasp his arm, branding him with her touch. \u201cYou\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head, clenching his teeth against the blazing pain. \u201cMy only concern is for your welfare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour only concern is saving your own skin. Pathetic worm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I prove my loyalty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Abruptly releasing his arm, the Dark Lord turned her attention to the vast expanse of nothingness bathed in a sickly yellow glow, holding out her hand as she walked forward.</p><p>Gaius fell into step behind her. Why would she have sought him out if she didn\u2019t want him to play devoted slave? But he was careful not to brush against the shadowy figure that surrounded her.</p><p>The thing was . . . unnerving.</p><p>They moved in heavy silence, their steps sending up tiny clouds of choking dust. Absently, Gaius wondered if this desolate land had been lurking beneath the white mists, or if the Dark Lord\u2019s almost-transformation had blasted it to this current wasteland.</p><p>Not that it mattered. One was as bad as the other.</p><p>Without warning, the Dark Lord came to an abrupt halt, her outstretched hand clenching into a fist. \u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere\u201d looked exactly the same as \u201cthere,\u201d but Gaius\u2019s disinterest was shaken as he caught an unmistakable scent drift through the thick air.</p><p>\u201cVampires,\u201d he muttered in shock, stepping closer to the elusive smell. \u201cCould they be causing the disruption?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d she hissed in fury. \u201cVampires are no match for me. As you\u2019ve discovered.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced as her insult slid home. \u201cThen what is?\u201d</p><p>She dropped her hand, the halo around her seeming to fade to dull shadow.</p><p>\u201cThe Phoenix.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened in surprise. \u201cThe Goddess of Light?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRidiculous name.\u201d</p> <p>Gaius barely heard her muttered complaint. Over the centuries, he\u2019d listened to the Dark Lord\u2019s bitter complaints about the powerful spirit that kept him locked in his prison. But since the Dark Lord\u2019s resurrection into a new body, and with the threat of the looming transformation into the Gemini, Gaius had assumed that the Phoenix would go into hiding.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure, you idiot.\u201d A sudden wind whipped around Gaius as the Dark Lord struggled to leash her temper. \u201cDo you think I wouldn\u2019t recognize the bitch who stripped me of my powers and trapped me in this hell?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWhy would she be so close to the opening?\u201d</p><p>The crimson eyes flamed with an emotion that went beyond fury to mindless rage. \u201cShe\u2019s obviously arrogant enough to believe she can keep me trapped.\u201d</p><p>Gaius deliberately smoothed his expression to a bland mask. The Phoenix had the evil deity twitching.</p><p>So how did he take advantage of the unexpected gift?</p><p>Carefully, a voice warned in the back of his mind.</p><p>\u201cOr . . .\u201d He snapped his lips together, as if regretting what he was about to say.</p><p>As expected, the Dark Lord turned to stab him with a fiery glare. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Gaius grunted in pain as the Dark Lord grasped his chin in a grip that crushed his bones. \u201cTell me, leech.\u201d</p><p>He paused. He couldn\u2019t overplay his hand. A hint. A vague suggestion. A pretense he was trying to lead her in one direction so she would bolt in toward the opposite. Just like a spoiled child.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe they would bring the goddess so close unless they\u2019re convinced they could defeat you,\u201d he said as if the words were being pulled out of him. \u201cStyx is an arrogant son of a bitch, but he isn\u2019t the sort of leader to make empty gestures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefeat me?\u201d The pretty features that should never have been on the face of such an evil bitch flushed with ugly outrage. \u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>The agony of his shattered chin made it difficult to speak. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>The crimson eyes narrowed. \u201cI know what you\u2019re trying to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to trick me into closing the rift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly I am. My fate is now tied to yours.\u201d He said, his words holding enough truth to sound sincere. \u201cIf you\u2019re destroyed by the Goddess of Light, then my brothers will spend the rest of eternity making certain I regret my betrayals.\u201d</p><p>She released her crushing hold, the shadow surrounding her shifting in and out of focus. \u201cMy return can\u2019t be halted,\u201d she muttered, speaking more to herself than Gaius. \u201cNot now. I\u2019m too close.\u201d</p><p>Gaius narrowed his gaze at her stubborn insistence. His initial thought had been to keep her distracted long enough for the Goddess of Light to work her magic. Who knew? He might get lucky enough to slip away unnoticed.</p><p>Or at least be destroyed in the crossfire.</p><p>Now, he realized he had the perfect means to tilt the odds in . . .</p><p>Well, not his favor. But perhaps in the favor of the Phoenix.</p><p>He might have turned his back on the world, as well as his brothers, but he intended to do everything in his power to make sure the evil bitch standing in front of him was destroyed.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter when it happens?\u201d he asked with a small shrug. \u201cYour worshippers will understand that you dare not risk a direct confrontation with the goddess.\u201d</p><p>The nearby stump burst into flames as the Dark Lord\u2019s fury swirled around her. The first thing her minions learned was never to speak of her ignoble defeat at the hands of the Phoenix.</p><p>And they most certainly didn\u2019t imply that the Dark Lord might be terrified of another encounter.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I can or can\u2019t do,\u201d she said, the pressure of her terrible voice sending Gaius to his knees.</p><p>He bowed his head, his chin still aching and his flesh beginning to singe. \u201cForgive me, but wouldn\u2019t it be better to send your minions to battle her?\u201d he suggested softly. \u201cEventually, she\u2019ll be overwhelmed to the point you can defeat her.\u201d</p><p>The ground split open beside them, the stench of sulfur filling the air. \u201cAre you implying I can\u2019t defeat her?\u201d</p><p>He wisely kept his head lowered. \u201cShe did trap you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I am the Gemini,\u201d she raged, seeming to forget the transformation hadn\u2019t been completed. \u201cI am unstoppable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet your servants sacrifice themselves,\u201d he continued to provoke, pressing at her weakest point. Her arrogance. \u201cAfter the goddess is destroyed and you\u2019ve taken over the world, you can write the histories to speak of your glorious defeat of the Phoenix.\u201d He glanced up to witness the veins of crimson that crawled beneath the pale skin of the Dark Lord. As if her blood flowed with fire. \u201cWho will care if it\u2019s the truth or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will know.\u201d</p><p>With a sharp motion, the Dark Lord lifted her hand and pointed it toward a spot just over Gaius\u2019s head. An earthquake shook the ground beneath him, widening the split until Gaius was forced to scramble backward.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>The Dark Lord continued to allow her power to build until Gaius was certain he would be crushed by the sheer force.</p><p>\u201cWhen the goddess is destroyed it will be by my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Reaching down, the Dark Lord grabbed Gaius by the hair, holding on tight enough to warn she wasn\u2019t letting go. \u201cWe\u2019re going through, Gaius.\u201d</p><p>The heat of a thousand suns seemed to rush through him as he was jerked forward, shifting from one dimension to the next.</p><p>\u201cMerde.\u201d</p><p>At the rift</p><p>The cramped room in the basement of the abandoned warehouse had been made considerably larger by the simple process of knocking out walls and digging out the surrounding dirt so the warriors could position themselves for the upcoming battle.</p><p>And the battle was coming.</p><p>That was the one certain thing in a very uncertain world.</p><p>Despite the efforts of the Sylvermysts, as well as the exquisite Nefri, who had added her powers, the rift was widening with every passing minute, filling the air with the electric heaviness of a brewing thunderstorm.</p><p>Something was coming.</p><p>Something bad.</p><p>Standing on the fringes of the gathered crowd, Cassie ignored Caine\u2019s low grumbling to study the human female who was the chalice for the Goddess of Light.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t certain what she\u2019d expected. Maybe a statuesque Amazon with a flaming sword riding on a chariot.</p><p>Instead, Abby Barlow was a slender female with rich, honey curls that framed her gamine face. Only the shocking blue eyes revealed she was anything other than mortal.</p><p>Dante, her vampire mate, on the other hand, was exactly what she\u2019d expected. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wearing black biker boots, faded denims, and a black leather jacket, he had a pale, aristocratic face and silver eyes that contrasted sharply with the shoulder-length black hair. With his loop earrings and massive sword, he looked like a pirate just waiting for an excuse to pillage.</p><p>The couple was standing closest to the Sylvermysts as they held the rift shut, with Styx and Salvatore standing beside them. Viper and the Ravens were stoically hovering at the sides.</p><p>The rest of the room was consumed by an odd combination of vampires, Weres, curs, fairies, imps, and a female Shallot that Viper watched with a blatant possession.</p> <p>She had to be his mate.</p><p>Nothing else could explain that particular expression of exasperated concern.</p><p>The same expression was currently on Caine\u2019s face as he battled between the urge to toss Cassie over his shoulder and take her away from the danger and the certain knowledge she would simply return the second his back was turned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure that\u2019s the Phoenix?\u201d she asked, hoping for a distraction.</p><p>He narrowed his gaze, not fooled for a minute. \u201cSo they say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t look like a powerful goddess.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow, reaching to tuck a stray curl behind her ear. \u201cI could point out that you don\u2019t look like a prophet who holds the future of the world in your beautiful head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis empty head, you mean,\u201d she muttered, that cold ball of dread still lodged in the pit of her stomach. When she\u2019d discovered that Styx was planning to bring the Phoenix to the rift to provoke the Dark Lord into the world, she\u2019d insisted on coming along. Somehow she\u2019d hoped being near the action would jiggle loose whatever was blocking her visions. So far, however, her efforts had been a big bust. \u201cLet\u2019s hope that Abby\u2019s power hasn\u2019t gone on vacation when she needs it most.\u201d</p><p>Caine reached to wrap his arms around her as the ground trembled and the air filled with a choking heat. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he growled in her ear.</p><p>\u201cHiding won\u2019t protect me,\u201d she reminded him, allowing him to keep her tucked tightly against him although her gaze remained on the rift. \u201cBesides, if I have a vision we\u2019ll need to share it with the others. I can\u2019t do that locked in the cellars.\u201d</p><p>A growl rumbled in his chest. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I have to like it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she softly agreed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to like it.\u201d</p><p>The quakes intensified, buckling the ground beneath their feet and sending a shower of dust from the ceiling.</p><p>Whatever was coming was getting closer.</p><p>The demons around them tensed, and then as one they unsheathed, loaded, cocked, and aimed their various weapons as the air became too thick to breathe.</p><p>There was a moment, as if time was standing still.</p><p>Cassie pressed closer to Caine, taking comfort in his warm scent before she gently pulled out of his arms. The violence shimmering in the air would be calling to his wolf. She didn\u2019t want him hesitating to take his more powerful form because of her.</p><p>There were more tremors and then a collective cry as the Sylvermysts abruptly collapsed in unconscious heaps. There was the sound of cursing from a tall, dark-haired vampire who grabbed the wilting Nefri in his arms and carried her to the back of the room, as well as a cry from Jaelyn as she rushed forward to kneel next to her Sylvermyst prince.</p><p>In the midst of the chaos, Abby stood without flinching as a soft glow began to pulse around her.</p> <p>The Goddess of Light.</p><p>The vampires took a step back to avoid the spill of power, but they stood firmly at her side while the Weres shifted in an explosion of fang and fur, forming a half circle around the widening rift.</p><p>Cassie sensed the minute Caine took his wolf form, the prickles of his power racing over her skin. He towered beside her, angling so he would stand between her and the shit that was about to hit the fan.</p><p>She glanced around him at the warriors standing like a living barricade against the oncoming evil, abruptly reminded of her vision that had infuriated the Dark Lord.</p><p>The tides of chaos break upon an impenetrable wall.</p><p>They stood shoulder to shoulder, ancient enemies all brought together against one common goal.</p><p>But would it be enough?</p><p>Her vision had hinted at this moment, but not the outcome of the battle.</p><p>Perhaps because the outcome had yet to be decided.</p><p>Not the most comforting of thoughts, she wryly acknowledged, gagging on the sudden stench of smoldering sulfur.</p><p>The Dark Lord.</p><p>The thought barely had time to flash through her mind when a figure appeared in the rift and then stumbled forward. Cassie frowned at the sight of the naked male who tripped over the unconscious Sylvermysts, his dark hair falling forward to obscure his face. Then, as he awkwardly scrambled to his feet, she grimaced.</p><p>Gaius.</p><p>And looking distinctly worse for the wear.</p><p>The vampire holding Nefri made a sound of infuriated disbelief, but before anyone could move to capture the vampire traitor, there was a blast of crippling heat.</p><p>Throwing her arms over her face, Cassie missed the grand entrance of the Dark Lord, although she felt the power of the evil deity sizzling through the room. When she at last lowered her arms it was to discover the familiar female form with long, dark hair and a disturbingly sweet face complete with dimples.</p><p>But there had been changes since she\u2019d last seen the demented creature.</p><p>The cute sundress had been replaced by a flowing black robe and the eyes that had been a clear, innocent blue were now bottomless pits of crimson flames. As if they were the doorways to hell.</p><p>And they probably were.</p><p>Oh, and the peculiar outline of another shape flickered around her slender body.</p><p>Cassie tried to focus on the strange shadow, catching a hint of a lion head on top of a humanoid form before it flickered out of view.</p><p>Was that the Gemini?</p><p>Somehow she\u2019d assumed that it would become an actual part of the Dark Lord.</p><p>The initial shock wave of her entrance forced the front lines to stumble backward. All but Abby, who stood firm, the glow of the goddess flaring toward the evil intruder.</p><p>The Dark Lord hissed as the glow surrounded her, but when the strange . . . spirit, or whatever it was that flickered around her, stopped the light from touching her body, she tilted back her head to laugh with a creepy delight.</p><p>\u201cAt last.\u201d The crimson eyes flared. \u201cI\u2019ve waited for this day for endless centuries. Now you\u2019ll pay for keeping me trapped in that hell.\u201d Her dimpled smile was just . . . wrong. \u201cYou\u2019ll pay for each and every hour I suffered.\u201d</p><p>Regaining their footing, the gathered demons loosened their ammunition, sending a barrage of bullets, silver-tipped arrows, and daggers flying in the direction of the Dark Lord. The creature gave another laugh, brushing aside the lethal torrent with a wave of her slender hand.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be stopped,\u201d she threatened, her gaze never leaving Abby. \u201cNot this time.\u201d</p><p>She might have sounded like a cheesy blowhard if the rift hadn\u2019t chosen that moment to rip completely open, allowing the horde of nasty demons to spill out.</p><p>Cassie\u2019s heart squeezed in fear. Not at the sight of the hideous nightmares that crawled through the basement, but at the acceptance that the bloody battle was now inevitable.</p><p>They\u2019d been hurtling toward this moment for . . . Cassie grimaced. For longer than she\u2019d been alive.</p><p>Now there was no way to avoid the ugly fate.</p><p>As if able to read her mind, Styx held his massive sword in the air, his voice slicing through the thick air with a frigid blast. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>With a combination of shouts and growls, the vampires and Weres attacked the approaching demons, using fangs and claws to tear through the horde.</p><p>Offering her a warning glance to stay put, Caine launched his massive body at the nearest enemy, his snarls sending shivers down Cassie\u2019s spine. Unable to watch the slaughter, she turned her gaze back to the Dark Lord, who faced off against Abby.</p><p>Their battle was less bloody, but no less brutal as their energies clashed with shocking force.</p><p>Cassie unknowingly backed up until she hit the crumbling wall behind her. Through the dust and smoke, she watched the savage melee unfolding, her stomach clenching in horror.</p><p>The cloying scent of death was almost overwhelming, but for all the killing on both sides neither appeared to be winning the war.</p><p>They were too evenly matched.</p><p>It could be a long, bloody stalemate that would be the end of everything.</p><p>Oblivion.</p><p>The trumpet of doom sounded in her mind at the precise same time the world around her went white. Gasping, she dropped to her knees and pressed her hands to her forehead.</p><p>The chaos around her faded away to leave a lone image burning in the center of her brain.</p><p>Scales.</p><p>The golden scales of justice.</p><p>And on one of the flat plates was a small stone.</p><p>Cassie momentarily floundered, unable to decipher the vision. Dammit, she\u2019d been so desperate for a glimpse of the future.</p><p>Fate couldn\u2019t be so cruel to offer her that glimpse without the means to understand it.</p><p>Could it?</p><p>The vision remained, branding her synapses. But just as she was about to scream in frustration, the weight tilted. It was less than a millimeter. A breath of a dip by the plate with the stone. But it was suddenly as clear as if it was written in bold letters across the wall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What they needed was something to tip the balance.</p><p>No, not something.</p><p>Someone.</p> <p>Caine\u2019s warm, musky scent at last penetrated the white shrouding her mind, his lips brushing her ear as he tried to bring her back.</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d His fingers combed through her hair, his voice thick with concern. \u201cCassie, can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>She leaned against his chest, smelling the wolf still clinging to his naked skin. He\u2019d shifted back to human, but his beast was straining at the leash, maddened by his inability to reach her.</p><p>With an effort, she managed to force her eyes open, finding Caine kneeling beside her, his expression tight with concern.</p><p>\u201cLevet,\u201d she managed to croak.</p> <p>He scowled. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She shuddered as the sounds and smells of the raging battle came crashing back. It was close. Close enough she could taste the blood in the air.</p><p>Clinging to Caine, she squashed the panic threatening to overwhelm her.</p><p>\u201cWe need Levet.\u201d</p><p>Caine gave a puzzled shake of his head. \u201cThe gargoyle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you hit your head when you fell?\u201d</p><p>She made a sound of impatience that was lost among the screams. \u201cI had a vision.\u201d</p><p>Caine parted his lips, but before he could speak the body of a cur flew over their heads, slamming into the wall with a sickening thud.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he muttered, tugging her as far away from the carnage as was possible in the cramped space.</p><p>She reached up to grab his face, knowing with absolute certainty that she held the fate of the world in her hands.</p><p>\u201cKeep them away long enough for me to try and reach him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReach Levet?\u201d he muttered, still clearly baffled by her insistence that they needed the tiny demon.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s imperative, Caine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d He glanced around the gory melee, turning back with a helpless frown. \u201cHow? With this much power a cell phone will never work.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d already figured that one out. Which meant she only had one option.</p><p>\u201cAn act of desperation,\u201d she admitted wryly.</p><p>He studied her for a long moment, and then with that absolute belief in her that never failed to melt her heart, he leaned forward to brush her lips in a tender kiss.</p><p>\u201cThat works for me.\u201d</p><p>Love spilled through her as she wondered what magical fate had ever brought this Were into her life.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d she commanded, her voice gruff with worry.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>He stole another kiss before stepping back and shifting.</p><p>Cassie closed her eyes as he launched himself at an approaching demon, his fangs sinking into the creature\u2019s throat. Knowing that Caine was in danger was enough of a distraction without watching it in real time.</p><p>Instead, she allowed the image of Levet to form in her mind, sending him a silent plea to travel to the rift.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a clue if her message was actually reaching the gargoyle. Or even if they had the necessary time for him to arrive.</p><p>But knowing she would be all but worthless in the battle, she continued to do the only thing that might help. A fine sheet of sweat coated her skin as she focused on her mental image, the heat and chaos in the room beating against her senses.</p><p>With such confusion, it was nothing less than a miracle that she felt the stir of air at her side. Even then she wasn\u2019t sure what to expect when she opened her eyes.</p><p>Panic. Mayhem. Nightmares from the pits of hell.</p><p>Death and destruction.</p><p>All very real possibilities.</p><p>What she found instead was a tiny gargoyle stepping out of thin air, his tail stuck straight out and his wings quivering.</p><p>\u201cLevet,\u201d she breathed in shock, rising to her feet.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if she was more surprised that she\u2019d actually managed to reach him, or that he\u2019d managed to arrive so swiftly.</p><p>The gargoyle, however, seemed unaware of her presence, let alone the battle raging only a few feet away, as he glared at the tiny demon who appeared directly behind him.</p><p>\u201cYou . . . I . . .\u201d Wild-eyed, Levet pointed a claw toward the small female wearing a long white robe. \u201cMon Dieu . . . Do not ever do that again.\u201d</p><p>The female remained unruffled, her almond-shaped black eyes holding a vast power. \u201cYou said it was an emergency.\u201d</p><p>Levet shivered, still trembling from his hasty journey. \u201cOui.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve traveled by portal before, haven\u2019t you?\u201d the demon asked, her curiosity holding more than a hint of amusement.</p><p>Cassie shook her head, wondering if the bickering duo were unaware of the war that raged around them.</p><p>Difficult to believe.</p><p>But before she opened her mouth to point out their danger, Levet was continuing his tirade.</p><p>\u201cA portal is not the same as . . .\u201d He waved his hands as words failed him.</p><p>\u201cAs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs poofing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoofing? Hmmm.\u201d The female tapped a finger to her narrow chin, her calm a direct contrast to Levet\u2019s agitation. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s as good an explanation as any other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArggg.\u201d</p><p>Cassie stepped forward. She didn\u2019t understand the argument. Demons were, after all, as baffling as humans.</p><p>But enough was enough.</p><p>\u201cLevet,\u201d she said in firm tones.</p><p>On cue, the tiny gargoyle turned to offer her a bow. \u201cAh, ma ch\u00e9rie. I received your call.\u201d He straightened to regard her with a curious gaze. \u201cYou said you have need of me?\u201d</p><p>Cassie waved a hand toward the dozens of demons who were currently shredding one another into gory little ribbons. \u201cWe all have need of you.\u201d</p><p>Levet followed the direction of her hand, giving a sound of distress as he fully took in the violent chaos.</p><p>Just in front of them, Caine was methodically chewing through the neck of an orc, his back marred with bloody gashes from the creature\u2019s claws.</p><p>Toward the front of the shattered room, Styx and Salvatore laid waste to any creature stupid enough to get near their savage attacks, the growing pile of corpses surrounding them like a wall of death.</p><p>Moving with a fluid speed, Viper danced among the carnage, his sword so quick most of the demons never saw their brutal end coming.</p><p>Further on, Ariyal, the Prince of Sylvermysts, was spraying a volley of arrows into the spreading rift, while his vampire Hunter mate, Jaelyn, stood back to back with him, her sawed-off shotgun blowing large holes in the strange, troll-like monsters coated in scales with raven beaks.</p><p>There was even an elemental fey who was mated to Cezar, who was using her powers to leech out of the air the lethal heat that pulsed from the Dark Lord.</p><p>This was the fate they\u2019d all feared.</p><p>\u201cSacrebleu,\u201d Levet breathed. \u201cAs much as I wish to be of service, I fear I am no warrior. And my magic . . .\u201d He grimaced with a bone-deep regret. \u201cIt is not predictable enough to use in battle.\u201d</p><p>Cassie bent down so they were eye to eye, reaching to grasp his hands in a pleading grip. \u201cThat\u2019s not why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He blinked in confusion. \u201cIt is not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she grudgingly confessed. \u201cBut you were in my vision.\u201d</p><p>The gray eyes widened in fear. \u201cWhat was I doing?\u201d</p><p>She settled back on her heels, biting her lower lip as she realized how silly her explanation was going to sound.</p><p>\u201cTilting the scales.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScales?\u201d Levet scratched his stunted horn, clearly baffled. \u201cWhat scales?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose.\u201d</p><p>Cassie pointed her hand to the center of the room where the combatants had cleared a space for the two females who stood face-to-face.</p><p>Although they were nearly obscured by the shimmer of combating energies, there was no mistaking the Dark Lord with her deceptively girlish beauty and her shadowed aura, or Abby, who was bathed in a soft glow, her eyes as brilliant as sapphires.</p><p>\u201cAbby.\u201d The gargoyle gasped in distress as the Dark Lord lifted her hand and bolts of lightning shot toward the Phoenix, knocking her backward. Abby grimaced in pain, but with grim determination she forced herself to step forward, continuing to surround the Dark Lord in the power of the goddess. \u201cNon.\u201d</p><p>With a flutter of his wings, the gargoyle abruptly charged forward, using his small stature to dart between the legs of the demons who were too busy to take notice of him.</p><p>\u201cLevet . . . wait.\u201d Cassie straightened, her breath squeezing from her lungs at the fear she\u2019d just sent the precious little demon to his death. \u201cCrap, crap, crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fear.\u201d The female demon reached to pat Cassie on the back of her leg, the pulse of her power a tangible force. \u201cI will protect him.\u201d</p><p>Cassie glanced down at the unpredictable creature, not entirely reassured by her promise. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She flashed a smile filled with anticipation. And sharp teeth. Yow.</p><p>\u201cBecause I am not done playing with him yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them. . . .\u201d</p><p>Shakespeare\u2019s words ran through Levet\u2019s mind as he narrowly avoided a spear that nicked the top of his wing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d been convinced that nothing could be worse than to be condemned as a useless lump of stone and left to rot in Styx\u2019s garden.

Inevitable, even to immortals.</p><p>No, what he feared was failure.</p><p>He\u2019d always been the smallest, the weakest, and the least likely to become a hero.

He skidded to a halt at the edge of the energy field that surrounded Abby and the Dark Lord like a bubble, the electric prickles crawling over his skin as the evil deity sent another bolt of lightning into her slender opponent.</p> <p>\u201cAbby,\u201d he cried out, close enough to see the blackened burns that seared her fragile skin.</p><p>She turned her head, looking every inch the Phoenix with her brilliant blue eyes and fierce expression.</p><p>\u201cLevet.\u201d She frowned in bewilderment, then doubled over as another bolt struck her in her stomach. \u201cStay back,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cNon.\u201d</p><p>Darting forward, Levet abruptly found himself dangling off the ground as someone grabbed him by the horn and lifted him upward.</p><p>\u201cDammit, gargoyle,\u201d a familiar voice snarled.</p> <p>Levet was spun to meet a pair of furious silver eyes set in the face of a pirate.</p><p>Dante.</p><p>He wiggled, even knowing it was futile. Dante was like any other vampire.</p><p>Arrogant, annoyingly strong, and stubborn as a damned mule.</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>Naturally Dante ignored him, his expression so brittle that Levet knew it would take very little to shatter him.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time for your foolish bravado,\u201d he snapped. \u201cAbby\u2019s fighting for her life.\u201d His gaze compulsively shifted to where his mate was bravely ignoring her grievous wounds to straighten and send a pulse of light toward the Dark Lord. \u201cShe\u2019s fighting for all of us.\u201d</p><p>Levet grasped the vampire\u2019s wrist, knowing he was teetering on the edge as he watched his mate being brutalized.</p> <p>\u201cListen to me, Dante. I was a part of the vision.\u201d</p><p>He scowled, reluctantly returning his attention to the gargoyle dangling from his hand. \u201cWhat vision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie\u2019s vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe prophet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go, Dante,\u201d Levet softly demanded. \u201cAbby needs me.\u201d</p><p>The scowl remained. \u201cIf you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he interrupted, sensing the electricity building in the air. The Dark Lord was about to strike again, and there was no guarantee the Phoenix could survive another blow. \u201cI\u2019m here to help.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, he was lowered back to the ground, Dante\u2019s face white with fear. \u201cSave her,\u201d he pleaded.</p><p>Levet nodded, forgetting his own doubts as he turned to step through the shroud of energy.</p><p>It no longer mattered what his purpose was, so long as he faced it with his head held high and his wings undrooping.</p><p>That was surely the definition of a hero?</p><p>He took another step forward, his skin crawling at the volatile power that slammed into him.</p><p>Mon Dieu.</p><p>He staggered to a halt. How could Abby bear the crushing pain?</p><p>Suddenly sensing his presence, Abby turned to regard him with unearthly blue eyes. \u201cLevet?\u201d</p><p>Before he could reassure her that he was there to help, he was distracted by the lightning bolt that sizzled past his horns.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d the Dark Lord mocked, her eyes pits of crimson flame and her body surrounded by a black aura. \u201cHave you come to be squashed, little bug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d</p><p>His courage threatened to crumble. He was a little bug. A foolish little bug with delusions of grandeur.</p><p>Then, his glance skidded toward the battle that raged just beyond the bubble. He flinched at the sight of the warriors who fought. And those who\u2019d already fallen. They didn\u2019t care if he was tiny, or if his wings were too frilly, or his magic as fickle as a fairy whore. They were sacrificing everything to halt the dark tide. How could he do any less?</p><p>He stiffened his backbone. Hero, Levet. You\u2019re a hero, not a bug.</p><p>\u201cWell, gargoyle,\u201d the Dark Lord drawled. \u201cHas the cat gotten your tongue?\u201d</p><p>Levet tilted his chin. \u201cI have come to kill you.\u201d</p><p>The crimson eyes narrowed. \u201cIs this a joke?\u201d</p><p>Levet felt Abby place a hand on his wing, the warmth of the goddess surrounding him.</p><p>\u201cLevet . . . no. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of this.\u201d The Dark Lord launched another attack at Abby, driving her back several steps before turning back toward the quivering Levet. \u201cIf he wants to die, then who am I to deny his wish?\u201d</p><p>The lightning flashed toward him, and with a curse he leaped to the side, his tail twitching. Some hero, he wryly acknowledged, sensing Abby escalating the power of the goddess as he darted from yet another bolt.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t helping.</p><p>So what would?</p><p>As the question was rattling through his brain, he made another dodge, his gaze catching sight of the strange form that haloed the Dark Lord\u2019s slender body.</p><p>Although most of his skills were questionable, the one constant was his ability to see through illusion.</p><p>Any illusion.</p><p>Squatting to avoid the latest strike of lightning, he ignored the fact the Dark Lord was forced to turn her fury back toward Abby, who was draining the last of her power into the wicked bitch.</p><p>Instead, he kept his attention locked on the aura that flickered in and out of focus around the Dark Lord.</p><p>There was something strange about it.</p><p>It was like the spirit was attached to the Dark Lord . . . but not fully integrated.</p><p>Or perhaps not fully committed.</p><p>Either way, he suddenly knew that this was his one shot.</p><p>Staying low as the two powerful deities continued their private battle, Levet inched his way forward.</p><p>The heat and pain pounded against him, but he forced himself to put one foot in front of the other. The closer he was to the Dark Lord, the less chance his spell would backfire and hurt someone else.</p><p>Vampires were so testy about friendly fire.</p><p>A sickly smile curved his lips as he lifted his hands. This was it. Do or die.</p><p>Concentrating on the spirit hovering around the Dark Lord, he released the magic that was as ancient as the beginning of time.</p><p>At first there was nothing more than sparkles of color that danced over the silhouette of the Gemini. It was a pretty display, but it didn\u2019t even make the Dark Lord notice. Instead, she continued her ruthless attack on Abby, veins of crimson running beneath the pale ivory skin.</p><p>Stubbornly, Levet refused to concede defeat.</p><p>It was the Gemini protecting the Dark Lord.</p><p>Without that protection the bitch would be vulnerable to the Phoenix\u2019s attack.</p><p>He lifted his hands, but even as he was preparing to launch another spell, the sparkles began to sink into the dark aura. The darkness quivered, as if the pinpricks of light were causing it pain. Or injury.</p><p>Levet was hoping it was injury.</p><p>He released his second burst of magic. This time the sparkles struck directly into the aura, exploding like tiny firecrackers.</p><p>The scent of burned flesh mixed with the charred odor of sulfur and a foul stench of a rotting carcass.

Then, thankfully, he was tumbling into a waiting darkness.</p><p>His last thought wasn\u2019t of death or sacrifice or even the scent of Yannah that suddenly filled his senses.</p><p>It was that he\u2019d finally done it.</p> <p>He was a bona fide hero.</p><p>He hoped they\u2019d write a song.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Having inched her way toward the battling deities, Cassie was acutely aware of the moment the Dark Lord died.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just that the entire room came to a silent halt. Or that the blinding lightning was no longer flashing.</p> <p>Or even that the stench of sulfur was suddenly gone.</p><p>It was in the change in pressure that had been beating down on them. As if a terrible storm had passed over, leaving behind the fresh lightness of a spring day.</p><p>But she barely noticed as the evil creature was swallowed by a shimmering mist that obscured her from view. Her only thought was that Levet was lying motionless on the ground, his wings broken and his chest ripped open by the lightning strike.</p><p>\u201cLevet.\u201d Reaching his side, Cassie dropped to her knees, grasping his hand as she glared at the tiny female demon who appeared at her side. \u201cDammit, you promised to protect him.\u201d</p><p>The demon regarded her with an unwavering black gaze, her expression giving nothing away. \u201cI will take care of the gargoyle.\u201d</p><p>Cassie bit her lower lip. \u201cIs he . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d The female offered a mysterious smile as she glanced over Cassie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou should brace yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>There was the scent of anxious Were before she was pulled off her feet and hauled against a broad, naked chest.</p><p>\u201cCassie,\u201d Caine growled, his heart pounding beneath her ear. \u201cI told you to stay put.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder, heaving an exasperated sigh as she realized the demon had already disappeared with Levet.</p><p>For the female\u2019s sake, Cassie hoped she took good care of Levet.</p><p>Otherwise, she intended to . . . well, she didn\u2019t know what she would do, but it would be bad.</p><p>Really, really bad.</p> <p>\u201cCassie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d She turned back to bury her face in the neck of her mate, breathing deeply of his welcomed musk.</p><p>He released a shaky breath. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be the death of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see that in a vision?\u201d he teased, threading his fingers through her hair so he could tilt back her head and flash a smile that had melted a thousand hearts.</p><p>A thousand and one, she corrected as she lifted his hand to press it against the middle of her chest.</p><p>\u201cNo, here.\u201d</p><p>Lost in the wonder of one another, not to mention the realization they\u2019d survived the end of the world, they ignored the demons fleeing from their lost cause, swiftly pursued by vampires and Weres.</p><p>And even the unexpected sound of crying babies.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Styx and Salvatore came to a halt next to them that they were pulled out of their brief illusion of privacy.</p><p>The two kings were looking a little ragged around the edges. Styx was coated in blood with his hair hanging in a tangled curtain down his back, while Salvatore had managed to pull on a pair of sweats to cover his nudity, his body still healing from a number of wounds.</p><p>\u201cGod . . . damn,\u201d the Anasso muttered, his gaze shifting behind Cassie.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Caine rasped, setting Cassie aside as he straightened to face whatever new disaster was about to attack.</p><p>Cassie was slower to turn. She didn\u2019t want any more bad.</p><p>Not for a very long time.</p><p>At first her gaze lingered on a weary Abby, who was being held in Dante\u2019s lap as he stroked tender kisses over her pale face. She looked drained, but amazingly unharmed considering she\u2019d just battled the Dark Lord.</p><p>Eventually, she turned to see the vampire with the mohawk and fearsome beauty standing beside his half-Jinn mate, Laylah, as she held two babies in her arms.</p><p>Maluhia and his twin sister.</p><p>The babies created by the Dark Lord for his glorious resurrection who were now innocent children with the opportunity to follow their own destinies.</p><p>\u201cIs it over?\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cThe Dark Lord is dead,\u201d Styx said, pointing toward the singed spot on the floor where she\u2019d disintegrated beneath the power of the goddess.</p><p>\u201cReally, truly dead?\u201d Salvatore demanded.</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem.\u201d</p><p>They all turned to study the ancient vampire, but it was the King of Weres who spoke the words they were all thinking.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not filling me with warm fuzzies here, leech,\u201d he said. \u201cAre we safe or not?\u201d</p><p>Styx gave a slow shake of his head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. That kind of power . . .\u201d He grimaced. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t disappear.\u201d</p><p>Cassie understood what he meant.</p><p>At least vaguely.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t there a theory about black holes and the quandary of what happened to the energy that was sucked into them? If the universe refused to allow energy or information to be lost, then what about the power of a deity?</p><p>But at the moment, it was all too deep to process.</p><p>Thankfully, Caine felt the same way. With one fluid motion, he was scooping her off her feet and cradling her against his chest.</p><p>\u201cThat seems like something for kings to worry about, not us peasants,\u201d Caine assured them. He smiled down at her, a wicked promise in his blue eyes. \u201cAnd I have a long overdue honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care of her,\u201d Salvatore warned, his voice gruff.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Caine said. \u201cShe\u2019s the prophet . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the King of Weres interrupted. \u201cShe\u2019s a part of our family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily,\u201d Cassie murmured, a warmth flooding through her heart.</p><p>She\u2019d been alone for so long.</p><p>Now she had . . . everything.</p><p>Everything a woman could possibly desire.</p><p>\u201cWhether you like it or not,\u201d Salvatore warned.</p><p>\u201cWe like it very much,\u201d Cassie said, giving her mate a warning pinch.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Caine sent his king a warning frown. \u201cBut let\u2019s not plan any reunions for a century or two.\u201d</p><p>Clearly done with the conversation, Caine turned to make his way out of the bloody basement, holding her as if she were a precious treasure.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she abruptly demanded, ignoring her mate\u2019s sigh of resignation.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head to peer over his shoulder, meeting Styx\u2019s curious gaze.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one prophecy I had years ago that I nearly forgot.\u201d</p><p>The Anasso was instantly wary. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vampire who can read prophecies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s going to be important for the future of the vampires. Keep him safe.\u201d</p><p>Styx\u2019s large body stiffened in instant alarm. \u201cHe\u2019s in danger?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s all I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait . . .\u201d The vampire moved forward as Caine resumed his path to the door. \u201cI have questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s officially off duty,\u201d Caine growled, ignoring the chaos left behind them.</p><p>Cassie smiled, not at all bothered by his ruthless refusal to stop. She was more than ready to be just another female spending time alone with her mate.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she at last demanded as they left the warehouse and stepped into the moon-drenched night.</p><p>\u201cVegas, baby.\u201d His smile held a promise that sent her heart racing. \u201cVegas.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>It was nearly dawn when the last of the vampires left the battleground, seeking the protection of their lairs.</p><p>Cautiously, Gaius crawled from beneath the stone wall that had collapsed on him after he\u2019d been flung into it. A rather amazing stroke of luck, considering it\u2019d protected him from the ongoing battle.</p><p>And more importantly from Styx and his goon squad, who would no doubt have killed him on sight.</p><p>Not that he was entirely certain he was glad to have survived.</p><p>His slavery to the Dark Lord might have ended, but he was a traitor to the vampires. He would have to spend the rest of eternity trying to hide from their wrath.</p><p>He was a pariah with no place to go and no one he could turn to for help.</p><p>Lost in his bout of self-pity, Gaius rose to his feet and glanced down at his bruised and bloody body. He would have to find someplace to hide, but first he needed to feed.</p><p>Taking a step forward, he was brought to an abrupt halt as a voice whispered through his mind.</p><p>\u201cGaius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He gave a panicked shake of his head. It couldn\u2019t be the Dark Lord. The bitch was dead. He could feel it in his very soul. The one he\u2019d once sold.</p><p>The voice came again. \u201cHelp me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Get out of my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGaius, it\u2019s Dara.\u201d</p><p>He stilled, his hands curling into tight fists. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. You\u2019re a trick of the Dark Lord.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, Gaius,\u201d the voice reassured him. \u201cYour mistress is dead, but her death brought me here.\u201d</p><p>He frowned.

As he neared, a black shadow seemed to shift, coalescing into a slender female form covered by a plain white gown stretched on the hard ground. His step quickened and the darkness again swirled to reveal an oval, honey-tinted face that was framed by a curtain of straight, blue-black hair.</p><p>\u201cDara.\u201d Falling to his knees at her side, Gaius reached to stroke trembling fingers along the pure line of her jaw. \u201cHow is this possible?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot speak now.\u201d Her smile pierced his heart. \u201cWe must get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Gaius frowned. \u201cHow? It\u2019s almost dawn.\u201d</p><p>She reached a slender hand to touch the medallion that still hung around his neck. \u201cWith this.\u201d</p><p>Gaius pulled back.
