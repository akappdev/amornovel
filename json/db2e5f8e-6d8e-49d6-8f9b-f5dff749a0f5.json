The rodeo announcer\u2019s voice reverberated through the arena stands as he pumped up the crowd for the next event: steer wrestling.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t break nothin\u2019, but he shore loosened my jaw so\u2019s I tasted some dirt.\u201d</p><p>Another round of male laugher.</p><p>A baby-faced kid shoved a plug of tobacco in his cheek. \u201cI\u2019d rather have a bucker like him than the last one I had. Shoot. That bronc couldn\u2019ta tossed off a baby blanket.\u201d</p><p>Gemma jammed her hands in her jeans pockets and sauntered closer to prop a hip against the muddy tailgate. \u201cAfternoon, boys.\u201d</p><p>Immediately slouched postures straightened. A couple of the younger fellas even removed their hats. Aw. Their mommas would\u2019ve been proud at their show of respect.</p> <p>Still, it made Gemma feel...old.</p><p>Feel? Hell, she was old enough to be any one of these guys\u2019 mommas.</p><p>The wiry bronc buster named Jesse grinned at her. \u201cHey, Miz Jansen. You\u2019re lookin\u2019purty as a picture today.\u201d</p><p>The other young buckaroos nodded and gave her an appreciative appraisal. She didn\u2019t mind. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t seen you around the circuit for a while. Everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how it goes. Been busy takin\u2019 care of ranch business.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAin\u2019t doin\u2019 all the work alone, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to hear.\u201d Jesse frowned and scratched his chin with the back of his leather glove. \u201cCome to think of it... How come you ain\u2019t been supplyin\u2019 none of the animals this season?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been asking the same question. None of the promoters can give me a good answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me sayin\u2019 so, that sucks.\u201d His eyes gleamed. \u201cI\u2019d sure like a chance to ride that ornery bronc of yours again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarpaint. Man. That roan could buck off a man\u2019s whiskers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s itching to be rode. Maybe you\u2019ll get a shot later in the year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLookin\u2019 forward to it.\u201d He gifted her with another inspection from beneath the brim of his Stetson. \u201cSo you just wanderin\u2019 around, lookin\u2019 good, showin\u2019 up them baby bunnies who\u2019re trollin\u2019 for buckles?\u201d</p><p>What a charmer. She grinned. The kid\u2019s eyes were brown from being so full of shit.</p><p>\u201cNo. Actually, I\u2019m looking for Cash Big Crow. You seen him?\u201d</p><p>Jesse pointed to a stoop-shouldered man perched on the tailgate of a rusted-out International pickup. \u201cAsk Frank. He keeps tabs on all the stock handlers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She skirted the rigging bags and saddles, avoiding the gigantic potholes in the makeshift road.</p><p>When she reached the pickup, the old Indian man squinted against the cigarette smoke curling into his left eye. \u201cHelp ya, miss?\u201d</p><p>Miss. Right. She hadn\u2019t been called that in a coon\u2019s age. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m looking for Cash Big Crow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t the only one. Last I heard he was at the first aid station.\u201d</p><p>Gemma\u2019s stomach pitched. \u201cWas he hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t rightly know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She paused to let the two female trick riders by, all decked out in flowing purple regalia. Once she reached the tiny room beneath the bleachers serving as the first aid station, the only person inside was a bored looking EMT.</p><p>\u201cHas Cash Big Crow been in here?\u201d</p><p>The man lifted one pierced brow. \u201cYou\u2019re the second person to ask me that. No one\u2019s been in here for a coupla hours. Been a yawner today.\u201d He refocused on the girlie magazine on the exam table.</p><p>Damn. Where could Cash be? Hopefully he hadn\u2019t left.</p><p>Gemma cut through the contestant\u2019s area, steering clear of the motor home, which housed the rodeo headquarters. She\u2019d been in and out of that rig several times in a fruitless endeavor to convince rodeo promoters to give her a shot as a rough stock contractor.</p><p>As much as Westerners claimed gender bias or prejudice no longer had a foothold in the Western way of life, it simply wasn\u2019t true. After her husband Steve died, Gemma had gradually been shut out of supplying stock for nearly every rodeo on the circuit. She was beyond frustrated with the \u201cold boy\u201d system but she was too stubborn to quit.</p><p>In the meantime, her ranch needed attention and she couldn\u2019t concentrate on expanding her rodeo stock operation until she fixed the problems that paid the bills.</p><p>A bank of gray clouds floated overhead, covering the sun, sending dark shadows skittering across the chalky vanilla-colored dirt. She glanced at the paddock across from the arena and noticed the stocky cowboy leaning on the white metal corrals.</p><p>Her heart slammed. She hadn\u2019t seen him for almost a year, yet she\u2019d watched him often enough she\u2019d memorized how he looked from behind. A braid swung against his broad shoulders, the rest of his coal black hair remained hidden beneath a beat-up cowboy hat. Tight Wranglers showcased his tight ass. The toes of his boots pointed out, as he was a little bowlegged. She knew his face was a little worn, but handsome. When she was within twenty yards an anticipatory smile bloomed.</p><p>The smile died when a shout caused Cash to turn. A young woman launched herself straight into Cash\u2019s outstretched arms. Cash kissed the woman and spun her in a circle, causing a feminine squeal of delight.</p><p>Gemma froze, unable to slink away from the intimate exchange. Cash set down the hot chickie and squeezed her curvy body tightly against his. While she talked a blue streak, he tipped her head back, tenderly smoothing away a section of her long brown hair.</p><p>Gemma\u2019s lips tingled in remembrance of when Cash had touched her that way.</p><p>Reverently. Confidently. Sweetly.</p><p>She could\u2019ve had that. Could\u2019ve had him looking at her that way. Instead, he was grinning at the Indian princess like she\u2019d hung the moon and the stars.</p><p>There was no fool like an old fool. Gemma backed up, preparing to retreat. But a gust of wind ripped off the young woman\u2019s straw hat and blew it directly toward her.</p><p>Cash gave chase until he caught the hat ten feet from where Gemma stood. His gaze started at the scuffed toes of Gemma\u2019s dirty ropers and traveled up her body to lock on her eyes. He blinked. \u201cGemma? Is that really you?\u201d</p><p>Rather than snap off a smart answer, Gemma escaped. Cash shouted her name but she didn\u2019t slow down until she\u2019d reached the area where she\u2019d parked her horse trailer.</p><p>She zigzagged through the maze of silver and black steel until she found hers. Leaning her forehead against the heated metal, she fumbled for her keys.</p><p>Fool fool fool. Dammit. Why had she hoped Cash would wait around for her to get her head on straight? Especially after she\u2019d told him she didn\u2019t want to get involved with him at all? What had she expected? And why in the hell had she bolted like a spooked filly the second she\u2019d seen him? Lord. She was forty-eight years old, not eight.</p><p>Dry grass crunched behind her and she wheeled around.</p><p>Cash\u2019s luminous, coffee-colored eyes stared back at her. \u201cDammit, Gemma, I know you heard me yellin\u2019 at you. Why didn\u2019t you stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want to intrude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntrude on what?\u201d</p><p>She turned, shoving the key in the locked door. \u201cDon\u2019t tease me, Cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTease you? I know I ain\u2019t always the brightest bulb in the box, but what the devil are you talkin\u2019 \u2019bout? Intrude on what?\u201d He grabbed her shoulder and forced her to look at him.</p><p>\u201cYou and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Just then the gorgeous young Indian princess sidled in behind Cash. Silent. Watchful.</p><p>A stunning vision of youth and beauty. A sharp reminder of everything Gemma was not.</p><p>\u201cMe and who?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Her. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. I ain\u2019t seen you in almost a year so I wanna know why you were lookin\u2019 for me.\u201d</p><p>Gemma ground her teeth together.</p><p>\u201cIf you were so hell-bent on findin\u2019 me why\u2019d you race off without sayin\u2019 a word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause once I found you, I realized it was a bad time. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt you...and your girlfriend. Besides, I figured I\u2019d catch up with you later.\u201d</p><p>A sly smile lit up Cash\u2019s face. \u201cThen why am I the one who had to chase you down, eh?\u201d</p><p>Crap.</p><p>\u201cLemme tell you what I think.\u201d His breath tickled her ear as he whispered, \u201cI believe you took off because you\u2019re jealous.\u201d</p><p>Jealous? More like mortified. Gemma had half a mind to crawl under the horse trailer and hide until Cash and his jailbait buckle bunny disappeared. She managed a small snort of disgust. \u201cJealous? Not hardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You want an explanation for what you saw by the corrals?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr an introduction to my girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>The girlfriend gasped.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t owe me nothin\u2019, Cash. Just forget it.\u201d</p><p>Cash grabbed the young woman\u2019s hand, dragging her front and center. \u201cI\u2019d love to milk this jealous side of you for all it\u2019s worth, but I ain\u2019t that mean. Or that patient.</p><p>Gemma, meet my daughter, Macie Honeycutt. Macie, Gemma Jansen.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Relief swept through Gemma.</p><p>\u201cAh. She\u2019s the one you told me about,\u201d Macie said with a charming grin exactly like her father\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cDaughter?\u201d Gemma repeated.</p><p>Cash kept his gaze on hers. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t know you had any kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know about me, Gem.\u201d</p><p>A pointed silence thickened the air.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is fun... not,\u201d Macie said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMacie, darlin\u2019, I know you just pulled in and we\u2019ve got some catchin\u2019 up to do. But I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d run along for a bit and wait for me by the main entrance until after I have a private word with Miz Jansen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I hate being a third wheel anyway. But don\u2019t be surprised if I make a few new friends on my own.\u201d</p><p>He shot his daughter a warning look. \u201cStay away from them cowboys, Macie, I mean it.\u201d</p> <p>Macie rolled her eyes. \u201cYou wish. Later.\u201d She vanished around the corner.</p><p>They were alone.</p><p>\u201cYou finished with your snit?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a snit,\u201d Gemma retorted.</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Cash curled his big hands over her shoulders. \u201cSo, happy as I am to see you again, it pisses me off that you think I\u2019d be knockin\u2019 boots with a woman the same age as my daughter.\u201d</p> <p>The warmth of his touch sent tingles down the center of her body. \u201cFar as I know, the young bunnies hovering around an experienced cowboy like yourself could be exactly your type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. But I don\u2019t think you tracked me down just to chew my ass for who you suspect might\u2019ve been rockin\u2019 my horse trailer.\u201d His hands fell away. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you cut to the chase and tell me why you\u2019re really here, eh?\u201d</p><p>Gemma studied him. The regal bone structure in his face highlighted the intriguing crosshatch of facial lines, courtesy of the years he\u2019d spent working outdoors. When he smiled, the corners of his eyes crinkled and added to his rugged good looks.</p><p>\u201cI heard you quit rodeoin\u2019 fulltime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Who\u2019d you hear that from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby McKay.\u201d She paused. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I figured you\u2019d be chasing the gold buckle and silver spurs until you were a grizzled old man.\u201d</p><p>Cash shook his head. \u201cBetween seein\u2019 Mike Morgan\u2019s career endin\u2019 injury and Colby bein\u2019 damn lucky to be alive after getting stomped by a bull, I decided to quit while I still had a choice. In the last two years, most days I rode I felt like a grizzled old man anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019ve you been doin\u2019 to earn a living?\u201d</p><p>Color darkened his cheekbones and he raised his chin a notch. \u201cWhatever I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I spent the winter fixin\u2019 houses on the rez. Then I helped a buddy down by Hot Springs during calvin\u2019 season. Lately I\u2019ve been wranglin\u2019 rodeo stock for the contractors.</p><p>I ain\u2019t got a place of my own to maintain so I\u2019m flexible. I can go anywhere at the drop of a hat.\u201d</p> <p>Gemma overlooked his embarrassment. It was a point of pride for white-line cowboys to own a chunk of land, to have a place of their own to call home if the road to rodeo glory ever quit calling them. Now that she really thought about it, why hadn\u2019t Cash ever talked about why he didn\u2019t have a place of his own? Was that a conscious choice?</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you prefer to keep moving around rather than have a steady income?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reason I came here is to offer you a job. I had another foreman quit on me last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you ain\u2019t doin\u2019 everything by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of it. Carter McKay is helping me out this summer. But he\u2019s just part-time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter McKay? One of Colby\u2019s brothers?\u201d His eyebrows knit together. \u201cI don\u2019t know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the youngest. Been away at school for a number of years. He\u2019s a hard worker, but his heart ain\u2019t really in it. I need someone I can count on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think that someone is me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m asking. You know how to handle livestock. You know that ranching is hard work. And I could use an expert opinion on some of the young, untried broncs I\u2019m hopin\u2019 to get into the circuit. Not that those smug bastards calling themselves promoters are giving me a chance.\u201d</p><p>Cash frowned.</p><p>\u201cPlus, I\u2019ve discovered I need testosterone around. Things run smoother even if a man just stands there lookin\u2019 pretty with his mouth shut while I do all the negotiating.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her without speaking for the longest time.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t pretty, and I ain\u2019t interested in standin\u2019 around with my mouth shut. That ain\u2019t who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that you were.\u201d</p><p>Cash raised his eyebrows.</p><p>Two short horn blasts signaled the start of the wild horse race in the arena. \u201cAnyway, I can\u2019t afford to pay more than two hundred dollars per week. But you\u2019d get room and board. Including any horses you might want to stable. I assume you don\u2019t need a truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking seven days a week. No days off at least until late October and haying season ends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Ain\u2019t the first time something like this has been offered to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRecently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Was she already too late?</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course. I turned \u2019em down flat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t interested in their offers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo does anything I\u2019ve offered interest you?\u201d</p><p>Cash kicked a clod of manure under the trailer. \u201cDepends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn whether the only thing you\u2019re offerin\u2019 me is a job.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse jumped. \u201cWhat else would there be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma, you know what else I want. What I\u2019ve wanted since the first time I clapped eyes on you. And if bein\u2019 in your bed\u2014whether or not anyone else knows I\u2019m there\u2014</p><p>ain\u2019t part of the deal, then I\u2019ll have to pass.\u201d</p><p>No way to misinterpret that.</p><p>Lord. Was she prepared to let the past fade? She and Steve Jansen had been happily married for twenty-six years. She\u2019d been widowed for the last three. In recent months she\u2019d grown tired of being alone and in her heart she knew Steve wouldn\u2019t want her to mourn him forever.</p><p>But why did Cash want her? When he could have any woman? Young, or old, or in between? Was it a simple case of lust? She didn\u2019t kid herself she was an aging beauty queen. Neither was she a spring chicken.</p><p>What if the reality of sharing her body and her bed with Cash Big Crow didn\u2019t hold up to her fantasies? Worse, what if she disappointed him?</p><p>There was only one way to find out.</p><p>Gemma locked her gaze to his. \u201cJust as long as you know that bein\u2019 in my bed doesn\u2019t change the fact that I will be your boss outside of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Just as long as you know I will be the boss in the bedroom, no matter if you do write my paycheck.\u201d He angled his head until they were only a breath apart. \u201cTell me somethin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Being this close to Cash sent her senses into chaos. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat changed? Last summer when you and I fooled around a little, you stopped it cold.\u201d His brown eyes searched hers expectantly. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t ready to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor everything that bein\u2019 with me means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning what, Cash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t some mild-mannered gentleman rancher. I\u2019ve been called a savage. I have savage appetites. Think you can handle it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded with more confidence than she felt.</p><p>\u201cThen you know what to expect from me when that bedroom door closes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Um. No. Maybe you\u2019d better spell it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObedience. Trust.\u201d He skimmed a finger up her cheek. The casual touch held just enough of an erotic edge that she trembled. \u201cI heard you talkin\u2019 to Channing last summer.</p><p>I know there\u2019s a...wild streak inside you. I wanna be the man to tap into it. I wanna give you something he never did.\u201d</p><p>Her whole body heated as she remembered the heady feeling of surrendering all control in the name of pleasure. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Something primal glittered in his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2019bout time. I\u2019ve been waitin\u2019 for this day for two damn years.\u201d He hauled her against his body and settled his mouth over hers.</p><p>Gemma expected a hard, demanding kiss. But Cash merely pressed his lips to hers and held them there. One callused hand slid up her neck, his thumb tracked the pulse in the hollow of her throat, where her blood beat wildly. The other hand cupped her cheek.</p><p>His firm lips indulged in little nips of her trembling mouth. From corner to corner, from top to bottom, a leisurely, teasing glide.</p><p>\u201cLet me in,\u201d he whispered, seductively brushing his mouth back and forth against hers. \u201cKiss me back, Gem.\u201d</p><p>Her tongue darted out and traced the seam of his warm lips. Mmm. He tasted as tempting and hot as she\u2019d remembered.</p><p>Cash groaned, backing her into the trailer as the gentle kiss turned ravenous.</p><p>She latched onto his belt loops and held on for dear life.</p><p>Her head spun like a windmill. The way her skin vibrated, it seemed he was touching every inch of her bare flesh, yet his hands hadn\u2019t strayed. He took his own sweet time exploring her mouth. Gauging the change in her heart rate with just a flick of his thumb as the deep kiss became wetter. Hotter. As she became wetter and hotter.</p><p>Cash backed off in increments, muttering softly spoken words against her inflamed lips.</p><p>Good thing her spine rested against the camper or she might\u2019ve fallen face-first in the creeping Jenny vines covering the rocky ground. She blinked up at him.</p><p>His smile was half-cocky/half-sweet. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re ready for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re ready for a grumpy old widow set in her ways, whippersnapper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u201d</p><p>Cash\u2019s grin vanished and his eyes hardened. \u201cIs this gonna be an issue? Age is a number, Gem. I\u2019m thirty-eight. You\u2019re not. So what?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it matter if I was older than you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen it don\u2019t matter that you got a few years on me.\u201d He kissed her hotly, a drawn out seductive promise. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re sexy. Kinda remind me of Madonna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadonna the pop singer? But she\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same age as you.\u201d He squinted at her. \u201cYep, definitely. You\u2019re like Madonna in a cowgirl hat. And if I had my pick of any of the ladies\u2014including the material girl, I\u2019d still choose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot what a sweet-talker you are.\u201d She steered the conversation back to business.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading back to my ranch today. When can you be there to start?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn.\u201d He frowned and shuffled back a step. \u201cOne kiss and my mind is on a single track.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacie. We\u2019d planned to spend the summer traveling together. Since her momma died a coupla years back, she ain\u2019t got no one else. I can\u2019t just shove her aside, especially when I been doin\u2019 that to the poor kid her whole life.\u201d</p><p>Without conscious thought, she smoothed the guilt from his puckered brow. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to ignore her, Cash. She\u2019s welcome at my place too, if she wants to stay for awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t bother you that she\u2019ll know we\u2019re involved in more than a workin\u2019 relationship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should wonder if it\u2019d bother you. Think you might suffer from performance anxiety if you\u2019re trying to fulfill all my wicked sexual fantasies when your daughter is sleeping under the same roof?\u201d</p> <p>Cash shuddered. \u201cI\u2019m thinkin\u2019 I\u2019ll offer her my camper for the time being. And we\u2019ll park it away from the main house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan. Although, I\u2019m still gonna assign chores for her to earn her keep if she decides to stick around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem. She\u2019s an independent cuss; she ain\u2019t one to take charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike father like daughter, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. You won\u2019t regret trackin\u2019 me down.\u201d Cash rubbed his jaw along hers. He placed a soft kiss below her ear and growled, \u201cI\u2019ve half a mind to make you crawl inside the trailer and take off every stitch of clothing right now.\u201d</p><p>Warmth pooled between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cBut as I\u2019ve been itchin\u2019 to touch you forever, I ain\u2019t about to settle for a quick tumble. I wanna take my time. Make it last until the sun comes up. Make you come until the sun comes up.\u201d He leveled her with a hungry kiss. \u201cLet\u2019s get loaded, track down Macie and get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>Gemma was only too happy to oblige.</p> <p>Chapter Three</p><p>Macie Honeycutt muttered, \u201cWatch it, Tex,\u201d as another saddle almost clipped her in the head. It sucked being short. She ducked under the fence and detoured to the beer garden.</p><p>As she stood in line, she tried not to obsess about the situation with her dad. After hearing about her epically bad month, he insisted they meet up at a rodeo. Why? Far as she knew, he\u2019d given up chasing the gold-buckle dream last year.</p><p>So what was the first thing he\u2019d done after she\u2019d shown up in the middle of nowhere? He\u2019d ditched her!</p><p>Like that should surprise you, Macie Blue. You can\u2019t count on him. Cut your losses and run.</p><p>She closed her mind to her mother\u2019s phantom voice. The woman had been dead four years and she still had an opinion. Unfortunately, it was the same bad opinion of Cash Big Crow Macie had heard her entire life.</p><p>Macie\u2019s relationship with her father was tenuous at best. He hadn\u2019t been around when she\u2019d been growing up, though as she\u2019d gotten older, he\u2019d made a point to track her down.</p><p>So why did she have the perverse need to do exactly the opposite of what Daddy said? It\u2019d serve him right if she hooked up with a hot-tempered, good-looking cowboy, as it appeared he\u2019d done some hooking up of his own.</p><p>Yet, by the almost worshipful way he\u2019d talked about Gemma in the last few months, it didn\u2019t surprise Macie that Gemma looked like a former rodeo beauty queen who\u2019d horsewhip the shit out of you if you looked at her crossways. It\u2019d take a woman like that to tame her father.</p><p>The white-haired man behind the plywood partition interrupted her thoughts. \u201cWhat can I getcha, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBud Light. In a bottle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see some ID?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Macie whipped out her driver\u2019s license, waiting for the man to make a smarmy remark about her age or her ethnicity.</p><p>But the guy smiled, popped the top and slid the bottle across the counter. \u201cFour-fifty.\u201d</p><p>She passed him a five. \u201cKeep the change.\u201d She snagged a seat at the back table, propping up her feet on the spare chair to discourage the group of cowboys eyeing her like a chunk of prime sirloin.</p><p>How long did her dad expect her to cool her heels?</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter. Wasn\u2019t like she had anywhere else to go. Macie tugged her hat lower on her forehead and nursed the beer.</p><p>What a jumbled mess her life was. Two months ago she\u2019d caught her boyfriend two-timing her. She should\u2019ve known with a sissy name like Dante that he played for both teams. She should\u2019ve known since they\u2019d dated for, oh, two months and they hadn\u2019t had sex that he was, oh, gay.</p><p>Still, it\u2019d shocked her to walk in on him scoring with his racquetball partner, Dooce.</p><p>They\u2019d been so busy playing with each other\u2019s balls and making a \u201cracquet\u201d they hadn\u2019t noticed her.</p><p>Things went downhill from there. Her best friend Kat moved out of their apartment and in with her boyfriend. Two weeks after that, Macie\u2019d gotten canned from her waitressing job. The jerk-off customer deserved the pitcher of iced tea she\u2019d dumped in his lap after he\u2019d grabbed her ass\u2014even if management saw fit to punish her for the moron\u2019s happy hands. No wonder she preferred to work in the kitchen. Vegetables didn\u2019t talk back.</p><p>At her father\u2019s urging, and the looming expiration of her apartment lease, she\u2019d packed her few belongings into her Ford Escape and left Denver. Her options were unlimited. She was free, half-white and twenty-two. She could do as she damn well pleased.</p><p>The bottle stopped halfway to her mouth.</p><p>Mmm. Mmm. And she\u2019d do him in a heartbeat. He was the first guy who\u2019d tripped her trigger since the Dante debacle. She liked hot men. She liked hot sex. She really liked the hot man/hot sex combo.</p><p>Right. Like she\u2019d ever be bold enough to try anything kinky with any man, let alone a man who looked like him. She talked a good game but it\u2019d taken four trips to the adult toy store before she\u2019d finally bought a vibrator.</p><p>Whoo-ee. She wouldn\u2019t need a vibrator with him. This guy was pure hot sex on the hoof.</p><p>Her pulse skipped as the hunky man ambled into the beer garden. From a distance he was a yummy package; up close he was a gourmet meal. Tall and leanly muscular with sharply defined facial features. He had curly dark blond hair, liberally laced with streaks of brown and gold, long enough to brush his shirt collar. A little stubble on his square jaw made him look wild and sexy, like a roguish Viking raider. His mouth was drawn in a flat line. Ooh. A brooding bad boy. She wondered what color his eyes were. Blue? Green?</p><p>Hazel? Even wearing a scowl he was a head-turner.</p><p>As he waited for a beer, a couple of blondes took notice of him.</p><p>Slouched in her chair, Macie watched the scene unfold. The guy didn\u2019t notice the attention he was gathering from women of all ages, shapes and sizes within his radius. He drank his beer fast, leaving as quickly as he\u2019d arrived. The two blondes lingered a few minutes before they stalked him.</p><p>The poor bastard. Nothing was worse than buckle bunnies on the prowl for a \u201creal\u201d</p><p>cowboy. He wasn\u2019t sporting the obvious cowboy clothing, but he owned the attitude.</p><p>Macie finished her beer, and headed toward the contestant\u2019s gate. With any luck, her dad was done screwing around. When the wind caught her hat, she wadded it up and tossed it in the closest trashcan. She hated the cheap damn thing anyway.</p><p>Carter McKay perched on the split rail fence and longed to be anywhere besides the rodeo grounds. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t fit the rural surroundings. Hell, he fit outdoor arenas with dirt-packed floors and livestock sale barns better than he had the stuffy classrooms and snooty galleries he\u2019d been living around for the last eight years.</p><p>As the last McKay boy born and bred on the family ranch, he not only looked the part of a cowboy, he was a cowboy\u2014through and through. He just wasn\u2019t dumb enough to climb on a bull or ride a wild bronc for the thrill, or for any amount of money. Not that rodeo paid diddlysquat. Not that being an artist was the most stable occupation either.</p><p>Certainly his family didn\u2019t understand his chosen profession. Sure, pride shone in his parents\u2019 eyes when he\u2019d earned a Masters of Fine Arts\u2014yet, they hadn\u2019t known what to do with him.</p><p>Problem was there wasn\u2019t need for a painter at the McKay Ranch, unless that meant slapping a coat of Sherwin Williams on one of the three wooden barns. Even if he\u2019d wanted to join the family cattle business, between his father and his older brothers, Colby, Cord, Colt, and his cousins, Kade and Kane\u2014every aspect of their growing operation was under control.</p><p>So Carter was at loose ends. He\u2019d been on his own too long to live at home for longer than a week or two. Made him shudder to think of Mom and Dad dogging his every boot step. Or his smart-mouthed little sister, Keely, snickering and calling him a brooding \u201carteest\u201d. He\u2019d taken his revenge by using her favorite silk shirt to clean up his paintbrushes. Scary, how quickly he\u2019d reverted to juvenile behavior.</p><p>Luckily, Gemma Jansen, a family friend, needed a part-time ranch hand. He\u2019d signed on for the summer and relocated his art supplies, welding iron, and paltry possessions to a small trailer on her property with a huge barn he could use as a studio. An added bonus?</p><p>Her land was vastly different from the buttes and sage-dotted hills of the McKay Ranch and it gave him a wealth of new visual material. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For the past week he\u2019d been finishing sculptures for his gallery showing. A series of interconnected Western pieces, different styles, including clay pieces slated to become bronze statues, and welded metal works using rusted sections of discarded farm equipment. So far the only concrete images on canvas were landscapes done with oil paints.</p><p>Boring.</p><p>He needed inspiration, something new and different. The only way to find the passion that defined his quirky artistic style was to start at the source of all things Western: rodeo. The salt-of-the-earth people\u2014spectators, families of the cowboys and cowgirls, and the iron will of the competitors themselves. The livestock\u2014angry, slobbering bulls, high-strung broncs kicking at the metal chutes, the bellow of steers, the nervous tamping of hooves behind the gates. The low bellow of the steers and calves in the pens. The rich scents of sweat and leather, mud and manure, the choking heat and the constant buzz of insects, hay and linament, tobacco and beer. The excitement. If he could capture the hope and desperation, the heartache and the pride of these...things, all of which made up the true experience of rodeo, well, then, he\u2019d truly accomplish something spectacular.</p> <p>Carter chalked it up to karma when Gemma asked him to ride along to the one-day event in Buffalo, South Dakota. She\u2019d been vague about her reasons for the impromptu road trip and he hadn\u2019t pushed this issue. Their unspoken rule of, \u201cmind your own business\u201d was why he and Gemma hit it off.</p><p>Except the outing was proving to be a bust. He\u2019d seen nothing that\u2019d kicked his muse in the ass. He\u2019d rather be locked away carving a wax mold of the image that had been haunting him. Not of a breakaway horse or a defeated cowboy, but of a young woman with long, flowing hair the color of mahogany.</p><p>In his mind\u2019s eye her angular face captured the interesting juxtaposition of feminine ferocity. Her carriage was proud, yet hesitant. She was beautiful. Mysterious. Serene.</p><p>And he was fixated on creating her likeness down to the most minute detail. Tawny skin.</p><p>Delicate hands. A lush mouth with a confident, secretive smile.</p> <p>Yeah, he needed to quit sniffing turpentine and get out more often if he was obsessed with a figment of his imagination.</p><p>The two fluffy blonde buckle bunnies approaching him with a single-minded purpose weren\u2019t imaginary. He pasted on a good ol\u2019 boy grin, wondering if it looked as fake as it felt. \u201cLadies. Nice afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Blonde #1 giggled. \u201cI\u2019ll say. You done competing, cowboy?\u201d</p><p>No reason not to cut to the chase when everyone knew the score. Or rather, when everyone wanted to score.</p><p>\u201cNah. I ain\u2019t doin\u2019 much rodeoin\u2019 these days.\u201d</p><p>Blonde #2 leaned in. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad. Is it because you were hurt?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBusted up my knee bulldoggin\u2019.\u201d The incident with a breakaway calf happened during branding when he was ten years old. These women wouldn\u2019t ask specifics and he didn\u2019t offer. They wanted the illusion of a cowboy, not the reality. And he knew if any of his brothers were around, neither of these chicks would look at him twice.</p><p>Some of their admiration dimmed. Blonde #2 blatantly focused on the size and the engraving on his silver buckle. \u201cSeems a shame. So, what\u2019re you doin\u2019 now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d came Blonde #2\u2019s bored response. She tugged on Blonde #1\u2019s arm. \u201cCome on, Jen. Let\u2019s keep lookin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on. Even though he ain\u2019t rodeoin\u2019 no more, he\u2019s still a hottie. I wouldn\u2019t mind takin\u2019 him for a test ride.\u201d Blonde #1 winked at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a great smile. I bet you know how to use that mouth, doncha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aimin\u2019 to find out?\u201d</p><p>Blonde #2 scowled. \u201cHave at him. I\u2019ll meetcha by the truck in an hour,\u201d she said and disappeared.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Jen,\u201d Blonde #1 cooed and squeezed her curvy body between his widespread knees.</p> <p>\u201cCarter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Carter. You up for a wild, no-holds-barred rodeo?\u201d Her hands slid up the inside of his legs. She found the bulge beneath his zipper and stroked until his dick sprang to life.</p><p>Whoa. It\u2019d been a while since he\u2019d played this game and apparently speed rules had been enacted in the interim.</p><p>Jen nestled her breasts against his chest, leaning on the tips of her high-heeled boots to whisper in his ear. \u201cMmm. You are a big one.\u201d</p><p>Carter sucked in a harsh breath as she continued to work his cock through his jeans.</p><p>In public. He scooted back. \u201cUh. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet I can figure out what you want. \u2019Course, it\u2019ll take me more than eight seconds to make my guess.\u201d She giggled, \u201cBut that\u2019s okay. You\u2019ll appreciate that I am very thorough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah, maybe we should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is fun, talkin\u2019 about what makes you hot and bothered. What makes you horny.\u201d She dragged her tongue up the side of his neck. \u201cOoh. You\u2019re awful quiet. A shy one. Big and shy. My favorite kind.\u201d She tsk tsked. \u201cNow you know I\u2019m just gonna have to talk dirty to loosen you up, Bashful. So...are you thinking about me blowing you?</p><p>Sliding this big cock in and out of my mouth?\u201d</p><p>His tongue stuck to the back of his teeth. He got extremely hot under the collar. But the greedy part of his brain reminded him that he hadn\u2019t been laid in months and conjured up the image of her on her knees unfastening his jeans. Watching her eager lips open and swallow his dick to the root. Seeing his cock smeared with bubblegum pink lipstick as it tunneled in and out of her swollen mouth until he exploded inside that hot, wet cavern, and pulling out to watch his come dripping down her chin.</p><p>\u201cAh, yeah. That\u2019d be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better believe it\u2019d be very good.\u201d Her tongue swirled around the shell of his ear like she was licking the head of his cock. \u201cMe getting your cock good and wet. Your hands holding my hair as tightly as a bullrope. Your hips thrusting against my face like you was ridin\u2019 a bronc. Arching your back, keeping the strokes steady. Can\u2019t you see it?</p><p>Can\u2019t you almost feel it?\u201d</p><p>Carter couldn\u2019t make himself leave. And he sure as shit couldn\u2019t stop his sex from pulsing with eagerness. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She nipped his earlobe hard enough to draw blood. \u201cAh-ah-ah. I wouldn\u2019t let you come that fast, Bashful. I\u2019d back off. Use my teeth as you pulled your cock out. Then I\u2019d play with your balls. Suck them. Roll them over my tongue like hard candy. Mmm. I love candy. I\u2019d use my hand to build you back up. Slowly.\u201d</p><p>His cock throbbed as her fingernails repeatedly scraped the full length of it. He bit back a groan, not sure if it was one of dismay or encouragement.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d bring your cock back into my mouth and finish you off. I\u2019d swallow every hot drop until you had nothing left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesus.\u201d This chick\u2014was beginning to scare him.</p><p>\u201cDoes that sound good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do believe I\u2019ve left you tongue-tied, cowboy.\u201d Jen stepped back and licked her lips suggestively. \u201cSo what do you say we put that idle tongue of yours to better use?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Annoyance crossed her face at his less than enthusiastic response. \u201cI laid it all out for you. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>To escape, he thought even when his dick had other ideas.</p><p>A flash of sunlight drew his awareness to a figure in front of the arena. A woman with long, shiny hair the color of burnished mahogany.</p><p>For a second the woman faltered. She seemed to sense him staring at her. She turned.</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>Everything inside him went tight and still.</p><p>It was her, the image that\u2019d been haunting him. Right here. Flesh and bone. He could study her. Sketch her. God, he could touch her sun-warmed tawny skin. Mold her curvaceous body with his hands so he could immortalize her perfection in clay. In wood.</p><p>In steel.</p><p>Then she vanished into the crowd like an apparition.</p><p>Carter leapt off the fence and readjusted the softening bulge behind his zipper.</p><p>\u201cHey! Where you goin\u2019? I thought you were up for a rodeo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Gotta see a man about a horse.\u201d He raced after the woman and didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Macie made it halfway across the rodeo grounds when the fine hair on the back of her neck stood up. She glanced over at the paddock and saw her brooding bad boy with one of the bimbos standing between his wide-spread thighs. But he wasn\u2019t paying attention to sure-thing-blondie; he stared directly at her. Intensely. Intimately. Hungrily.</p><p>Something hot and elemental passed between them. When he started for her, she hustled through the throng of people. About thirty seconds later she was spun around and found herself gazing into the bluest eyes she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Sexy, brooding man said, \u201cIt is you.\u201d His rough hands framed her face. \u201cMy God.</p><p>You\u2019re exactly\u2014\u201d</p><p>Flustered, she knocked his mitts away. \u201cYou can\u2019t just grab any woman\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not any woman. I grabbed you because you\u2019ve been in my head for the last damn month and it\u2019s drivin\u2019 me crazy. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>Macie snorted. \u201cThat is the worst pick up line I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>Those blue, blue eyes narrowed. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a pick up line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing, because it sure as hell isn\u2019t working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook. Let\u2019s start over. I\u2019m an artist. And I\u2019d like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014to show me your etchings?\u201d She snickered.</p><p>\u201cHar har. I really am an artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? So was the last guy I was involved with. Been there, done that, have the tie-dyed T-shirt and the roach clip to prove it.

A little odd, a little flowery, but it fits you.\u201d</p><p>Macie frowned. \u201cWas that an insult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Anyway, Amazin\u2019 Macie. You from around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust passin\u2019 through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith who? By yourself?

Going where the road takes us.</p><p>Looking for work and adventure.\u201d Her brain urged her to walk away; her legs didn\u2019t listen. \u201cWhat about you? You from around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m on a day trip. I live in Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you\u2019re an artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your area of study?\u201d She held up her palm. \u201cAnd if you say female nudes, I\u2019m totally out of here.\u201d</p><p>A cagey grin curled his mouth, making him look oh-so-naughty. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you exactly what magic I can create with these hands if you let me buy you beer.\u201d</p><p>Hell yes. Then maybe you could give me a hands-on demonstration of your magical hands.</p><p>No. Bad, bad idea, Macie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d His strong grip around her forearm kept her from bolting. \u201cJust one beer.</p><p>It\u2019ll give me a chance to explain why I chased...\u201d A sound, half sigh/half groan rumbled from his chest. Then the blunt tip of his finger traced the outline of her face from her temple to her chin and down the curve of her throat. \u201cGoddamn. You are stunning. I want to paint you like this. Fire and interest warring in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it again,\u201d he growled. \u201cI wanna hear my name on your sweet lips as I\u2019m touchin\u2019 them.\u201d The rough pad of his thumb slowly swept her bottom lip. He stared into her eyes. \u201cSo soft. And warm. A perfect fit for mine.\u201d</p><p>The way he was looking at her made her feel like she\u2019d suddenly developed a case of sunstroke. No man ever acted like he wanted to crawl inside her head, mark her soul his and claim her body as his own.</p><p>You just met him. No one feels that. It\u2019s a trick.</p><p>\u201cCarter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay yes, Macie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay yes to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo everything I ask you.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach cartwheeled.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds crazy, we just met, but I know you. I want...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant what, Picasso?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playin\u2019 with fire, askin\u2019 me that question, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause my very explicit answer would make you blush like a virgin and run screamin\u2019 for the Black Hills.\u201d</p><p>Everything surrounding them\u2014sunlight, tinny music from the carnival, whoops from the grandstand, the sugary, greasy scent of fried Twinkies\u2014faded into the background.</p><p>Boldly, she said, \u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>Carter\u2019s shaking fingers smoothed a flyaway hair from her cheek. \u201cOh, I\u2019d try you.</p><p>I\u2019d test you. I see what your eyes are offerin\u2019 me, and I\u2019d take it all, without apology.\u201d</p><p>Totally out of your league with this man, Macie. Cut and run.</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d give that need, that passion, that obsession, that control, that lust\u2014right back to you. Times ten.\u201d</p><p>Pure sexual heat overloaded her circuits. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, oh. Not what you expected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that kind of fascination isn\u2019t usually aimed my direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStraightforward. I like that. I expected you to play coy.\u201d The back of his fingers continued to lightly caress her damp skin. \u201cI want to paint you, sculpt you. Do you in every medium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure that wasn\u2019t a line?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason we both ended up here today, Macie. Don\u2019t know why, but I ain\u2019t about to argue with fate. Or question my good fortune.\u201d</p><p>A hot tongue of desire licked along her veins.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your damn hand off my daughter.\u201d</p><p>Carter froze.</p><p>\u201cMove it or lose it, son,\u201d Cash ordered. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Macie snapped out of her sexual stupor. \u201cBack off, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell. Who is this joker?\u201d</p><p>Gemma said, \u201cCash, wait\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you to stay away from\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014you.\u201d Macie stomped over and came nose to nose with her father. \u201cWhich I did.</p><p>You can\u2019t blame me for not waiting around for you to ditch me.\u201d Again.</p><p>Cash\u2019s eyes and his voice softened. \u201cOh, honey-girl, I ain\u2019t gonna ditch you.\u201d He shot Carter a dark look. \u201cBut it appears you decided to ditch me with the first loser wannabe cowboy that comes along, eh?\u201d</p><p>Gemma cleared her throat.</p><p>Macie and Cash both swiveled to look at her.</p><p>\u201cCash Big Crow, meet Carter McKay. Carter, Cash is the new foreman I hired for the Bar 9 Ranch. You two will be working together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gotta be fuckin\u2019 kiddin\u2019 me,\u201d Carter muttered.</p><p>Macie frowned. Her dad had taken a job? What\u2019d happened to them hitting the road this summer?</p><p>\u201cMcKay?\u201d Cash repeated. \u201cYou\u2019re related to them slimeball McKays from up around Crook County?\u201d</p><p>Carter\u2019s gaze hardened.</p><p>\u201cCash! What a thing to say,\u201d Gemma chided. \u201cYou\u2019ve been friends with Colby McKay for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am friends with him, just as long as he and his wild brothers are far away from my only daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacie is an adult,\u201d Carter pointed out.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Gem.\u201d He threw his hands in the air. \u201cYou know the bad reputation them McKay boys have!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all due respect, sir, I\u2019m nothin\u2019 like my brothers.\u201d</p><p>Cash whirled on Carter. \u201cYeah? I ain\u2019t some dumb Indian. I traveled the rodeo circuit with Colby. I know what he\u2019s like\u2014like breeds like, so I ain\u2019t lettin\u2019 a McKay within two miles of Macie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s gonna be difficult, since we\u2019ll all be living together on the Bar 9 for the next few months,\u201d Gemma said dryly.</p><p>\u201cAll? Me too?\u201d Macie asked suspiciously. Her gaze darted from Gemma to her dad and back to Gemma.</p><p>Gemma nodded. \u201cYou are welcome to stay as long as you want. Cash said he\u2019d set up his camper for you. I\u2019ll warn you there might be some chores involved if you\u2019re living with me.\u201d</p><p>Macie\u2019s head spun. This was all happening way too fast; hooking up with her dad, him taking a new job on the spur of the moment, meeting the woman she suspected would be more than Dad\u2019s new boss, and trying to figure out what weird connection she and Carter shared, mostly whether it was real or wishful thinking on her part.</p><p>Her dad lowered his voice. \u201cTruth is, I need this job. But I want to spend time with you, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. Can we try it for awhile and see how it goes? If it don\u2019t work, we can go on as planned?\u201d</p><p>What other choice did she have? Besides, wouldn\u2019t this provide them with neutral ground? If trying to establish a father/daughter relationship wasn\u2019t working, would it be easier to place blame on outside forces? Such as the stress of a new job, or romantic relationships or an unfamiliar setting? She could leave and he wouldn\u2019t be forced to give up a good job opportunity. She briefly closed her eyes. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess it\u2019s unanimous,\u201d Carter said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be one big, happy family all summer.\u201d</p><p>Cash took a menacing step toward Carter. \u201cYou ain\u2019t part of the family. If I see you around I\u2019ll kick your sorry\u2014\u201d Gemma grabbed Cash\u2019s shirtsleeve and tugged him out of range.</p><p>While Gemma and Cash argued, Macie glanced at a grinning Carter. \u201cWhy\u2019re you smiling like that? He\u2019d like to scalp you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed. Your dad\u2019s a bit protective, huh?\u201d</p><p>It was a surprise to her.</p><p>Carter moved until he loomed over her. \u201cI am curious as to where he\u2019s keepin\u2019 your chastity belt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t think so when he realizes nothin\u2019 will keep me away from you this summer, Macie.\u201d The sexual heat in his eyes changed the color from sky blue to indigo.</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little sure of yourself, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. And I\u2019ve got a few belts and ropes to keep you right where I want you, in case you need a little convincin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Sweet, hot pleasure rippled through her.</p><p>Carter\u2019s warm, firm lips grazed her ear. \u201cI\u2019ll come to you tonight, okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best idea I\u2019ve had in a long time.

I was afraid if you knew I was lookin\u2019 for another fulltime foreman\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014that I\u2019d bail on you? Come on, Gemma, you know me better than that. I promised I\u2019d be here all summer. Despite the shitty opinion Cash has of the McKays, you know we always keep our word.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s really goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t take her eyes off the gray ribbon of bumpy road. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? It ain\u2019t like he\u2019s the only man for the job. Shoot, there\u2019s lots of guys around here more than qualified.\u201d</p><p>Gemma angled her chin from Carter\u2019s shrewd eyes so he couldn\u2019t see her blush.</p><p>\u201cHellfire and damnation. He is the only one you wanted, ain\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>She paused. \u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>Carter sighed. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna ask why.\u201d</p><p>She probably couldn\u2019t give him a good answer on that one even if he did ask.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know, what happens between the two of you after the barn door closes ain\u2019t my business. You don\u2019t hafta worry \u2019bout me blabbin\u2019 your private business to everyone or pokin\u2019 my nose in where it don\u2019t belong.\u201d</p><p>Gemma looked at him. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that goes both ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning, I won\u2019t stay away from Macie just because her father wants me to.\u201d</p> <p>Lord. He was just as bull-headed as the rest of his family. She waited, knowing he wasn\u2019t finished.</p><p>Carter drummed his fingers on his thigh. \u201cRemember last week when I was cleanin\u2019 stalls like the devil possessed my soul, and you asked me what the hell was wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>Gemma nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt was her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that possible? Didn\u2019t you just meet her today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. This is gonna sound dumb, but she\u2019s been in my head for the last month. This fuzzy image in my mind that\u2019s only partially there. Been drivin\u2019 me crazy, tryin\u2019 to capture her. I\u2019ve tried painting her, sketching, working with clay. When I saw her today?</p><p>Flesh and blood and real? At first I thought I\u2019d gone completely \u2019round the bend.\u201d</p><p>Gemma couldn\u2019t withhold a shiver. \u201cThat\u2019s some spooky serious shit, Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I know it. Normally I don\u2019t believe in that kinda karma and fate voodoo crap, but I ain\u2019t about to chalk it up to coincidence neither. Nor am I gonna let the new foreman chase me away from his daughter just \u2019cause he thinks he can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacie is an adult, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna matter to Cash,\u201d Gemma pointed out. \u201cHe still is her father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hard for me to believe. Jesus. How old was he when she was born? Like twelve?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cProbably more like sixteen. He made it sound like he hadn\u2019t been around much when she was growing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because he was too busy growin\u2019 up himself. Where\u2019s her mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead, from what I understand.\u201d</p><p>Carter whistled. \u201cHarsh. Anyway, from what I remember Colby tellin\u2019 me, Cash knows his stuff \u2019bout livestock. So I ain\u2019t gonna cause problems with him while we\u2019re workin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I expect him to do the same.\u201d Carter faced her again. \u201cThe only person with the power to tell me to get lost is Macie, agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. But I ain\u2019t gonna get in the middle of this.\u201d Gemma figured she\u2019d have her hands full dealing with her situation with Cash. She turned down the gravel road leading to the trailer on the outskirts of her property. \u201cI think it\u2019s best if I show Cash the ropes for evening chores, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI reckon.\u201d</p><p>She circled the barn so the front end of her truck was pointed to the road. \u201cCan I ask you one more favor?\u201d</p><p>Carter\u2019s hand froze on the door handle. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you give us\u2014me, Cash, and Macie\u2014a night to settle in? Macie\u2019s agreed to stay in Cash\u2019s camper, but I doubt he\u2019ll just dump her off.\u201d</p><p>For a second it appeared Carter would argue. He scrubbed the back of his neck and sighed. \u201cI guess. I have some new ideas to sketch. I\u2019d probably lose track of time anyway.\u201d He opened the door and hopped out. \u201cSee you bright and early, boss lady. Try and get some sleep.\u201d Carter grinned and slammed the door.</p><p>Sleep. Right. Cash seemed pretty anxious when they parted ways. The heat and promise in his eyes nearly burned her from the outside in.</p><p>Neither of them would be getting much sleep.</p><p>When Gemma ventured out of the house in the early evening, she noticed Cash had already parked his camper between the old wooden barn and the metal granary. The spot was perfect. It\u2019d keep the aluminum camper sheltered from the oppressive dry summer heat and it was set back far enough from the main house to offer them\u2014and Macie\u2014</p><p>privacy. The generator at the back of the camper hummed. She saw Cash carrying an armload of assorted items out of the camper, but no sign of Macie\u2019s car. Once Cash caught sight of her climbing in the truck loaded down with the horse trailer, he loped over.</p><p>\u201cWhere you parkin\u2019 that rig, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver behind the other barn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack \u2019er in and I\u2019ll unhitch the trailer.\u201d He frowned. \u201cWhy\u2019d you drag that thing along to Buffalo? It\u2019s empty, ain\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I stopped at a ranch outside of Haroldsville to look at a couple of mares to breed. Decided not to take them, but I needed the trailer just in case.\u201d</p><p>Cash\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cWhat was wrong with \u2019em?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019. The guy wanted too much money.\u201d It burned her ass the guy thought she was too stupid to know he\u2019d been trying to screw her over. But Gemma doubted Cash would understand she\u2019d been dealing with that mentality since Steve had died.</p><p>After he\u2019d unhitched the horse trailer, Cash wiped his brow with his forearm and stared at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re done with chores, I expect you show me where to put my stuff in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so we\u2019re clear. I will be sleepin\u2019 in your room, in your bed.\u201d</p><p>Yowza. Gemma nodded and proceeded to show him around, detailing what needed to be done in the morning. She finished the tour in record time. He dragged his duffel bag up the porch steps and dumped it on the kitchen table. Before she opened the door leading upstairs, Cash pressed her against the wall and kissed the holy hell out of her.</p><p>When she could breathe again, she tipped her head back and blinked at him. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint me to the shower, winyan. I\u2019ll not come to you the first time smellin\u2019 of a barnyard.\u201d</p><p>Feeling reckless, she nipped his chin and tugged the end of his braid. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind. The bathroom is the second door at the top of the stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re cleaning up, should I ask Macie to supper tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. We stopped outside of Canyon River and grabbed a burger. She said after she settled in she was goin\u2019 right to bed. Been a long day on the road for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine.\u201d</p><p>Cash shouldered the bag and gave her a gorgeous smile. \u201cDon\u2019t go nowhere, Gem.\u201d</p><p>Gemma stepped back and anxiously rubbed her hands over her bare arms as Cash disappeared up the stairs. Lord almighty. The man could melt her with just a look. Was she ready for this?</p><p>To make sure, she raced to the guest bath, quickly rinsed off the road grime and combed her hair. After she scrubbed her teeth, she changed into clean clothes, a low-cut tank top and a short skirt.</p><p>Dusk had fallen, sending purpled shadows across the yard and darkening the interior of the house. She sipped a beer and gazed out the kitchen window, reluctant to flip on the overhead lights. Talk about magnification of her wrinkles and her age, hell, magnification of all her flaws. Would candlelight make it too obvious she had plenty to hide?</p><p>The door creaked and she jumped. She heard the soft pad of feet across the linoleum.</p><p>The scent of sandalwood soap, toothpaste and warm male skin enveloped her. Heat from his body seared her back as he brushed damp, soft kisses over her bared shoulder. She trembled and nearly dropped the beer before she upended the remainder and gulped it down.</p><p>Cash chuckled by her ear. \u201cNervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. But that ain\u2019t gonna stop me.\u201d His teeth nipped on her earlobe and she shivered as he suckled the sting. \u201cYou expectin\u2019 anybody tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. C\u2019mere, sexy lady.\u201d Cash turned her into his arms and his soft lips nibbled up the side of her neck. \u201cI\u2019m dyin\u2019 to touch you.\u201d His finger traced the lace strap of her tank top. \u201cTake off your shirt.\u201d</p><p>Gemma pulled back and looked at him. \u201cRight here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here, right now.\u201d When she made no move to move, he frowned. \u201cThere a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides that we\u2019re in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. I thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. That\u2019s the problem. You\u2019re thinkin\u2019 too much.\u201d Cash walked to the door and locked it. Then he snagged a blue bandana off the counter. He folded it crossways in a long strip. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA blindfold. Then you won\u2019t know if you\u2019re in the kitchen, the living room or the bedroom. You\u2019ll be so busy feelin\u2019 what I\u2019m doin\u2019 to you that you won\u2019t have time to think. Now close your eyes and turn around.\u201d</p><p>Gemma knew his wasn\u2019t a request. If she refused he\u2019d take it as a sign she wasn\u2019t ready for this intimacy, and he\u2019d leave her house and her employ. But she was ready. It\u2019d taken her a full year to get to this point and she wasn\u2019t about to back down now. Blood pounded a warning in her head not to be stupid. She slowly spun toward the window.</p><p>The dense cloth covered her eyes and she felt a pinch in the middle of her skull as he tied it. He turned her back around. \u201cCan you see?\u201d</p><p>Gemma\u2019s heart rate kicked up as she opened her eyes to complete blackness. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019ll leave it on? You won\u2019t make me tie your hands too?\u201d</p><p>A picture formed in her mind of being trussed up, naked and at his every wicked whim. The thought made her absolutely dripping wet.</p><p>He chuckled again. \u201cFrom the flush on your cheeks I suspect you\u2019d like to be tied up.</p><p>I\u2019ll keep that in mind for another time.\u201d Rough palms skated down her arms. Callused, thick fingers threaded through hers. Cash pulled her forward a few steps and they stopped. \u201cStand still.\u201d</p><p>He released her hands. Then those same rough palms circled her ankles, slid up her shins, and over her knees. When Cash\u2019s fingers breached the hem of her denim skirt, he ran the tips across the top of her thighs several times before he tugged on the material.</p><p>\u201cOff. Now.\u201d</p><p>With shaking fingers, she shimmied the skirt down to the floor. As she stood clad in pale pink bikini panties, waiting for his reaction, she was grateful for the blindfold.</p><p>Cash\u2019s warm breath tickled her ear. \u201cNo wonder you hide such great legs. Wouldn\u2019t want to start a stampede among all them young bucks at the rodeo grounds, eh?\u201d</p><p>His sweet-talkin\u2019 made her sigh softly.</p><p>\u201cDamn, Gem, I can\u2019t wait to feel these thighs wrapped around me tight. So tight I can\u2019t breathe. Just lookin\u2019 at you is enough to make my heart stop and make my dick stand up and take notice.\u201d His mouth moved across her jaw in a sensual glide.</p><p>Automatically her lips parted for his tongue to sneak in and tangle with hers.</p><p>She moaned. He tasted sweet. Hot. One hundred percent hungry male. God. She\u2019d missed that scratchy feel of a man\u2019s beard rubbing against her cheek. Missed that insistent hard body crowding away her reason, just allowing her to feel feminine, not to think like a responsible ranch woman. The sensations seemed ten times stronger when she couldn\u2019t see and had to rely on other senses.</p><p>Cash continued kissing her, each movement of his velvety tongue deliberately provocative; a game of chase and retreat. Liquid pooled in her panties and she found herself pressing her legs together. Wanting him to catch a whiff of her arousal. Wanting his hand stroking her, his fingers using her wetness to plunge deep inside her.</p><p>Finally he retreated from her mouth. Soft puffs of air drifted over her temple. He clamped his hand around her hips and lifted her, eliciting a gasp when her butt and the back of her thighs connected with the cool metal rim of the kitchen table. \u201cWhoa. Cash, wait\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got you.\u201d He gently pushed her shoulders.</p><p>She resisted. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s other places I wanna kiss you, so lay back and let me show you where.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Gemma\u2019s token resistance evaporated. Her spine met the hard, flat surface of the table and her legs dangled off the edge.</p><p>Cash drew a blunt fingertip from her left hipbone to her right hipbone.</p><p>Her belly trembled and she arched.</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d His fingers hooked the outside of her panties and he whisked them off.</p><p>She heard him drop to his knees. Felt his rapid breathing on her inner thigh. Sensed him staring at her blood-engorged pussy. A blush started from her cheekbones and worked down the length of her body to her curled toes. Never had she felt so exposed.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even study his face and watch his eyes to see if what he saw turned him on.</p><p>She held her breath and herself rigid, wondering what he\u2019d do first. Tease her with his hot breath and barely there kisses? Whisper dirty talk? Work her into a frenzy with his fingers?</p><p>Gemma was totally unprepared for the thorough swipe of his hot tongue straight up her creamy slit. She gasped.</p><p>Cash dragged his mouth across the inside of her right thigh, muttering, \u201cDammit. I know I\u2019m supposed to take it slow, but Lord, winyan, you\u2019re already wet.\u201d He inhaled. \u201cI want to taste you. Bathe in you. Suck these pretty pink lips and lick you until I feel you come against my tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014\u201d The rest of her sentence was lost on a long wail as Cash did exactly what he described.</p><p>No slow build up and then teasing withdrawal. He widened her knees and settled his mouth on her throbbing sex. Licking and sucking, focusing all his attention on her clit.</p><p>Before she had time to brace herself, an orgasm rocked through her. Even as she lifted her hips for more, Cash sucked her clit harder, deeper, using his teeth and tongue until cries spilled from her throat.</p><p>As Gemma floated back to earth, a slight sense of embarrassment surfaced that she\u2019d been so quick on the trigger. She stifled the urge to giggle when Cash\u2019s lips zigzagged up her ticklish belly. Instead, she scrambled up on her elbows, to better see him, forgetting about the blindfold. As she sat completely upright and reached for the tie at the back of her head, Cash\u2019s fingers circled her wrist.</p><p>\u201cLeave it. We ain\u2019t close to done.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Cash scooted Gemma to the end of the table. \u201cI\u2019m doin\u2019 this all wrong, I should be takin\u2019 my time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already said that once. There\u2019s no hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not for you, but I ain\u2019t got a lotta patience left. This go around is gonna be short, to take the edge off, so to speak.\u201d Then he gently flipped her, so her stomach rested on the table and the white globes of her upthrust ass was the same level as his cock. She was pretty, and he also knew she was pretty much at his mercy. It humbled him, having this strong, fine woman at his command\u2014right where he wanted her. He tugged the drawstring on his sweatpants and they dropped to the floor. He kicked them under the table.</p><p>\u201cCash?\u201d Her voice was strangely subdued.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, hang on.\u201d He angled across her back, kissing the lovely curve of her neck as he reached for the box of condoms he\u2019d set on the table. He ripped a package open and rolled the latex down his stiff cock.</p><p>\u201cWait. I want to touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time. Been a long time for me, and you\u2019re so damn sexy.\u201d He noticed her body had tensed and he whispered kisses down her spine. \u201cCome on, sweets, spread your legs for me. Yeah. Just like that. Hold tight.\u201d</p><p>Gemma\u2019s arms stretched until her fingers curled around the opposite edge of the table.</p><p>Holding her hips with one hand, he aligned his cock and slid into her slick heat an inch at a time. He closed his eyes, savoring the moment he\u2019d been dreaming of for two long years.</p><p>When he was fully seated within her, she arched up. \u201cOh. That feels good. More.</p><p>Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He withdrew slowly and slammed home three times. \u201cHow \u2019bout like this?\u201d</p><p>She moaned. \u201cJust like that. The harder the better.\u201d</p><p>Cash glanced down. Damn, but it was sexy as hell, watching his dick tunneling in and out of her hot pussy. As he pounded into her, he snaked his hand around, placing the heel of his palm on the rise of her pubic bone. His middle finger found her clit and he stroked in time to his thrusts.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gemma hissed. She pushed back into him, meeting his increased pace, flexing her hips against his finger. \u201cFaster. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m gonna come again. Oh.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed her clit more rapidly and his balls drew up. Gemma gasped and he felt her clit pulse beneath his stroking finger as she came apart. Between her erotic cries and the supplicating way she was splayed before him, Cash didn\u2019t stand a chance of staving off his own orgasm. He threw back his head and groaned, lost to the greedy satisfaction of hot spurts shooting from the end of his cock, her slick walls spasming around his hardness, extending his orgasm until he felt woozy from the sheer blinding pleasure.</p><p>When the throbbing in his groin stopped, and the dots faded from his vision, he looked at her. Gemma\u2019s face was smashed into the side of the table, her cheek flushed with color and damp with sweat. A small, secret smile lifted the corner of her lips. A wave of tenderness swamped him and he leaned over to nuzzle her neck. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Gemma made an affirmative noise.</p><p>He pulled out. \u201cStay here and catch your breath, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>After disposing of the condom, he grabbed two more from the box and gently slapped her ass. \u201cRoll over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can move.\u201d</p><p>Cash fought a sense of unease. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cIn a good way. You wore out this old-timer, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>He slapped her ass again. Harder. When she made a squeak of pleasure, he grinned.</p><p>So Miz Gemma didn\u2019t mind his hand on her ass? Interesting. \u201cI don\u2019t ever wanna hear talk like that because next time there will be consequences.\u201d Flipping her over, he emphasized his point with a fiery, prolonged kiss. When he released her mouth, he whispered, \u201cWrap them sexy legs around me. Let\u2019s find someplace a little softer for round two, eh?\u201d</p><p>She sat up quickly. \u201cRound two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I warned you \u2019bout my savage appetites. Now that I\u2019ve got you naked.\u201d He planned to keep her that way. He wanted her so mindless, so occupied, that she wouldn\u2019t have time to think or have time for regrets.</p><p>Or to wish he was someone else.</p><p>Gemma yelped when he picked her up and carried her into the dark living room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cash plopped on the couch, keeping her straddled across his lap.</p><p>\u201cCan I take off the blindfold now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But let\u2019s get rid of the shirt. Lift.\u201d In one quick movement her tank top disappeared. He eyed the front closure on her pink bra. Well, well. This presented an intriguing opportunity. \u201cLean back and put your hands on my knees.\u201d</p><p>She did so without arguing.</p><p>Cash nibbled on her lips, not quite kissing her as he unhooked her bra. The cups split and he slid the straps over her shoulders and down to her wrists. Three quick twists and he lifted his foot to step on the thicker back strap, leaving her wrists trapped in the stretchy arm bands.</p><p>Gemma froze. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakin\u2019 sure you can\u2019t get away. I wanna take my time tasting these.\u201d He flicked his tongue across her nipple. \u201cAnd I know you\u2019re a little squirmy.\u201d He blew on the wet spot he\u2019d created and watched the coral-colored skin tighten into a pointed tip.</p><p>She jerked back.</p><p>\u201cSee? I gotcha right where I wantcha.\u201d His hands curved around her ribcage and he swept his thumbs back and forth across her beaded nipples. \u201cTell me what you like.\u201d</p><p>She arched into his hands and rolled her chest closer.</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Don\u2019t go shy on me. I\u2019ll do whatever you want, but you gotta tell me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuck them. Put your mouth on me, Cash. Please. It\u2019s been so long...\u201d</p><p>While drawing lazy circles on her left breast, he bent his head and latched onto her right nipple. Suckling deep and long until she whimpered and thrashed. He used his teeth and his tongue until he smelled her creaming again. Then he switched his attention to the left nipple and started the process all over. Slowly. His cock stirred as she ground her wet pussy into him and made sexy, needy moans.</p><p>But Cash wouldn\u2019t be rushed no matter how much she pleaded. He took his time, learning every nuance of her reactions. What made her sigh. What made her clench her thighs. What made her curse and gyrate her hips. As he licked a path up her neck, she shuddered and gooseflesh appeared beneath his tongue.</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no. Please. You\u2019re torturing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake the blindfold off. Untie my hands. I feel so helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Ain\u2019t it a bitch to have no control?\u201d He growled against her throat, \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve been feelin\u2019 since the first time I saw you. You\u2019ve had me all tied up in knots, Gem. Just thinkin\u2019 \u2019bout all the things I wanted to do to you. Now that you\u2019re right where I want you, I ain\u2019t inclined to let you go.\u201d</p><p>She buried her face in the curve where his collarbone met his neck, trilling her lips across his skin until he shivered. \u201cI\u2019ll make it worth your while. Lord knows there are other places on you I wanna kiss too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a specific place in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Need a hint?\u201d She blew in his ear.</p> <p>He smiled. \u201cWhy, Gemma Jansen. You offerin\u2019 to blow me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She scraped her teeth down the cord in his neck. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Cash took her mouth in a consuming kiss. After he broke away, he said,</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m dyin\u2019 to have those sweet lips wrapped around my cock, watchin\u2019 you takin\u2019 me deep in that hot mouth, feelin\u2019 your throat tighten on the head as you swallow every drop I give you, but it ain\u2019t gonna happen tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Because you\u2019re showin\u2019 me who\u2019s boss in the bedroom?\u201d</p><p>Her pouting attitude didn\u2019t help her cause. \u201cYep. I warned you I planned to be in charge. You agreed. That\u2019s all you need to remember.\u201d He reached for a condom package, ripped it open and rolled it down the length of his erection. \u201cScoot your knees closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can ride me, cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll even let you take the reins\u2014\u201d he nipped her chin, \u201c\u2014this time.\u201d</p><p>Gemma kept her balance, even though the bra straps stretched more tightly around her wrists as she maneuvered in position. She canted her hips and sank down on him.</p><p>The slick feel of her pussy tightening around his cock made him grind his teeth together to stop from howling his satisfaction like a beast. \u201cYou\u2019re so wet for me. Do you know how sexy that is? You bein\u2019 so slick and hot again?\u201d</p><p>She groaned softly in his ear.</p><p>He smoothed the hair from her cheek. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Resting her forehead to his, she said, \u201cKiss me while you\u2019re fucking me, Cash. I wanna be skin to skin and mouth to mouth with you when I come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever the lady wants.\u201d</p><p>This time was slower. Sweeter. More intimate, more like making love than straight up fucking. Keeping his mouth attached to hers, he shaped her luscious breasts with his hands, avoiding her pebbled nipples entirely. Contenting himself with tracing her lush contours, a teasing touch of his fingertips on the upper swell as his thumbs swept the side near her armpits, until she began to shake with increased desire. He caressed the strong muscles in her bare back and squeezed the delicious curve of her ass as she lifted and lowered on his cock. They sustained the languorous kiss until the very end when the thrusts grew shorter and faster.</p><p>Her chest was slick with sweat. As was his. When she bowed backward, changing the angle so he could thrust deeper, his thumb found her clit and he brought her to the brink, keeping her there, greedily watching the pleasure cross her face, until the pivotal moment, her internal muscles clamped down on his cock and he smashed his mouth back to hers, swallowing her cries as they sailed over the edge of insanity together.</p><p>While she slumped against him, catching her breath, Cash released her hands, rubbing them vigorously to return blood flow.</p><p>Gemma nuzzled his jaw, the coarse cotton of the blindfold catching on his cheek. \u201cI never imagined it could be this good again.\u201d</p><p>Part of him wanted to ask if she meant their second round of sex, or whether she meant with a man other than her late husband, but a larger part of Cash couldn\u2019t stand to hear the truth.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re quiet. You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Great. Just tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo round three, then?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of seeing...could you take this off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Can you stand up first? I\u2019m getting a cramp in my leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh sorry.\u201d</p><p>He was reluctant to remove the blindfold, though he did so, his gut clenched in fear at what he might see in her eyes. Or what she might recognize in his. Cash tenderly kissed her eyelids, her eyebrows, the corners of her eyes, the bridge of her nose, every part that\u2019d been covered by the cloth. She didn\u2019t melt into him, rather, held herself stiff.</p><p>With a sinking sensation, he whispered, \u201cI\u2019m gonna head upstairs.\u201d And he turned away so she couldn\u2019t see his face.</p><p>After he hit the bathroom he crawled in bed. A sick feeling settled in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>Was she staying away, wallowing in regret?</p><p>Eventually Gemma entered the room. He feigned sleep as she climbed between the cool cotton sheets. She didn\u2019t snuggle up to him. They stayed on their respective sides of the queen-sized bed, back to back. Cash had almost drifted off for real, when the bed creaked and he heard her get up. Her light footfalls stopped at the window.</p><p>He laid there in silence, in misery, pretending sleep as he listened to her soft sniffles.</p><p>Never a good sign to hear the woman you\u2019d just spent hours making love to, crying as if her heart was breaking.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Lord it was hot.</p><p>Macie wiped the sweat from her forehead with the inside of her arm and dropped the empty bucket near the water pump. A low groan drifted out from the barn. Weird. The door was ajar. Curious about the strange noise she heard, she stepped inside and immediately was plunged from bright sunshine into darkness. She picked her way through discarded tools littering the dirt floor, the scent of hay and feed and horseflesh overwhelming her senses. She rounded the corner by the last wooden stall and stopped.</p><p>Three men were crammed in the small space. Three men, naked, except for their cowboy hats and boots. She couldn\u2019t see their faces, but at the moment it wasn\u2019t their faces she was interested in.</p><p>They were all buck-ass naked. Oh, man, it\u2019d be a damn shame to cover up such glorious bodies under chaps, jeans and long-sleeved shirts. These hunky cowboys should be all nude, all the time.</p><p>Two men studied a man who was bound. His muscular arms were stretched above his head, his strong wrists tied together and hooked to a long rope. His feet were spread wide, though the tips of his boots scarcely touched the hay-strewn ground. His bulky thigh muscles were rigid from the strain. A single thin golden sunbeam blazed between the wooden slats, highlighting his sweat-coated skin.</p><p>Macie\u2019s eyes drank him in. Of the three, he was the most striking. Wide, defined shoulders. A hairless chest with sharply sculpted pectorals. His biceps bulged with corded muscles and thick veins. As her gaze swept down to his ribcage and his tapered waist, to the dent in his navel, the other two naked cowboys blocked her view of his groin.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>But she watched in fascination as the men murmured to him before each one latched onto a flat bronze nipple. The bound cowboy arched, but no sound emerged. The blond man suckling his right nipple reached down between the man\u2019s legs. Although Macie couldn\u2019t see specifics, by the way the bound cowboy bucked, and by the way the guy\u2019s hand moved up and down, she had a pretty good idea what was being done to him.</p><p>A fireball of heat blazed through her.</p><p>The dark-haired man on the left brought his fingers to the bound cowboy\u2019s mouth.</p><p>The bound man parted his lips and sucked the offered digits to the knuckles. The man withdrew his wet fingers and reached around the bound cowboy\u2019s hip, his arm dropping below the phantom belt line.</p><p>A stuttered breath left the bound cowboy\u2019s mouth and he jerked once before a low-pitched groan escaped. Sweat beaded his upper lip. More perspiration coated his golden skin. He twisted beneath the men\u2019s ministrations and the ropes, yet his cowboy hat remained in place, covering his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laughing, the two men abandoned the bound cowboy. The dark-haired man hooked his arm around the blond\u2019s neck and yanked him close. They fell on each other like long lost lovers. Hard male body slid against another hard male body. Cowboy hats hit the dirt as hungry mouths met in a ravenous kiss. The sounds of heavy breathing and of rough hands caressing even rougher skin echoed as the pungent musk of animals and sex hung in the air.</p><p>Macie\u2019s panties grew damp. She felt like a pervert but she couldn\u2019t make herself flee the sexy scene. There was something electrifying about three strong men lost in a taboo passion, no need to be gentle, doing to each other exactly what they\u2019d like done to them.</p><p>The dark-haired man fisted one hand in the blond\u2019s hair and the other around the blond\u2019s long cock. He forcefully stroked the thick length, yanking back the blond\u2019s head to savage his throat, muttering unintelligible words against his skin.</p><p>The blond moaned.</p><p>The dark-haired cowboy released his hold on the man\u2019s hair as his open mouth skated across his lover\u2019s upper torso, his tongue tracing the dips and valleys of the musculature. He suckled the pebbled tips of the blond\u2019s pale nipples, biting down hard enough to cause the blond to gasp. Then he scraped his fingers over the taut washboard abs, flicking the tip of his tongue around the belly ring and through the thick nest of light hair before he fell to his knees.</p><p>Macie chanced a peek at the bound cowboy. His cock twitched against his stomach as he watched the two men from beneath the brim of his hat. A part of it, yet apart from it. A strange sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vusurfaced.</p><p>\u201cOpen your mouth,\u201d the blond demanded, drawing Macie\u2019s attention back to the male couple.</p><p>Shaking his head, the dark-haired cowboy lifted the blond\u2019s cock and nuzzled his low-slung balls before his tongue darted out and licked them. Thoroughly. Then that long flickering tongue disappeared behind the tight sacs.</p><p>\u201cLick it. More. Get it wet. Yeah, push your tongue inside.\u201d He canted his hips.</p><p>\u201cDeeper. That\u2019s it. Fuck my ass with that greedy tongue. Stick it in as far as you can.\u201d</p><p>The dark-haired man\u2019s thick fingers pushed the inside of the blond\u2019s thighs as far apart as possible so he could bury his face beneath the blond\u2019s cock and balls. Wiggling his head as he dove deeper, he made wet, slurping sounds, sucking, moaning, grinding his hips and cock into the blond\u2019s shin.</p><p>The blond watched, wild-eyed as the man on his knees pulled back and brought the furry blond balls completely into his mouth again. \u201cLike that. Yeah. Use your teeth a little. Roll them together. Now suck them. Jesus, that\u2019s so good. I love to watch you.\u201d</p><p>After the dark-haired cowboy released the globes with an audible wet pop, the blond grabbed the brunette\u2019s head and rammed his rosy meat into his lover\u2019s mouth.</p><p>The dark-haired cowboy made a choking noise and backed off, releasing the cock until just the tip remained in his mouth.</p><p>The blond thrust his hips hard, keeping his hands clamped to his lover\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cDeeper. Come on. Take me all the way down that throat. Don\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t love it when I fuck your face.\u201d</p><p>The enthusiastic sucking sounds and the answering guttural demands mesmerized her. The blond would pull his wet cock out completely, circling the weeping purple head around the other man\u2019s swollen lips before plunging back in to the root.</p><p>Saliva dribbled down the dark-haired man\u2019s chin and neck. He kept up the frantic pace, digging his fingertips into his lover\u2019s hips with enough force to leave marks.</p><p>Making greedy, happy hums that seemed to heighten the blond\u2019s pleasure.</p><p>The unbearably erotic interlude didn\u2019t last long. The blond cowboy muttered, \u201cFuck, here it comes,\u201d as he clutched the man\u2019s dark hair, and tipped his chin down so every inch of his cock was lodged in the man\u2019s throat, his ass muscles flexing with every spurt.</p><p>Macie was surprised at their collective stillness as the dark-haired cowboy gruffly swallowed. She glanced over at the bound cowboy, who was fighting against his restraints, his cock still hard as a railroad spike, yet, telltale wetness spread across his belly.</p><p>The blond man stumbled back as the dark-haired cowboy rose to his feet. A sexy, secret smile, followed by a gentle touch of the blond\u2019s hands. Then they exchanged a sinuous full-body hug, cock to cock, their hands stroking, caressing sweaty, bared skin as they shared a hot, long soul kiss.</p> <p>Sweat trickled between her breasts and her nipples tingled as if they were touching her.</p><p>After they reluctantly broke apart, exchanging soft murmurs and soft laughter, they moved toward the bound cowboy as one unit.</p><p>\u201cSee what you\u2019ve been missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know you like to watch us,\u201d the blond said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve been sneaking in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for you we ain\u2019t done yet.\u201d They turned the bound man sideways and the dark-haired man disappeared into the shadows and returned with a sawhorse.</p><p>\u201cAnd lucky for you, we\u2019ll let you participate. Isn\u2019t that what you\u2019ve secretly hoped for, cowboy?\u201d The blond circled the bound cowboy and plucked up his forgotten hat.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been sucked off by a man?\u201d</p><p>The bound cowboy grunted, \u201cFuck no.\u201d</p><p>Both men laughed. Then the dark-haired one said, \u201cThen we\u2019ll make it memorable.</p><p>No one knows how to suck cock better than another man.\u201d He positioned the sawhorse close to the bound cowboy\u2019s thighs. Then he slapped the blond hard on the butt. \u201cYou know how I want it. Bend over and spread those ass cheeks. I wanna see every inch of that hole.\u201d</p><p>Where had she heard that before?</p><p>Without argument, the blond placed his chest on the sawhorse. His mouth was directly across from the bound cowboy\u2019s straining cock. He smiled wickedly and the bound cowboy stopped squirming and seemed to hold his breath.</p><p>The dark-haired man reached into his boot and pulled out a condom and rolled it on.</p><p>He moistened his fingers with his mouth, then traced them down the blond\u2019s crack and plunged them inside his ass.</p><p>The blond wiggled back. \u201cGive me your cock or your tongue, not your fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already tongued you, that\u2019ll have to do for lube. It\u2019s gonna be one hard ride.\u201d</p><p>The dark-haired cowboy lifted the ass in front of him higher, pulling apart the cheeks as his cock prodded the blond\u2019s dark hole. One thrust of his hips and his dick disappeared completely.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the blond hissed. \u201cHarder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. No matter how many times I do this to you, you\u2019re always so fucking tight.\u201d</p><p>Macie focused on the blond circling his hands around the bound man\u2019s ass, bringing that big, straining cock to his mouth and swallowing it in one greedy gulp.</p><p>As the dark-haired man\u2019s cock reamed the blond man\u2019s asshole, each hard thrust sent the blond man\u2019s mouth further down the length of the bound man\u2019s cock, until his nose was buried in dark pubic hair. Then he\u2019d release the cock slowly, and bring it fully back into his mouth, each hungry stroke increasing in speed and suction The scene looked as smooth as a choreographed dance. Like these cowboys had fucked each other well and often. The blond bobbed his head. Grunts burst from the bound cowboy as he began to pump his hips into the blond\u2019s face.</p><p>But the blond retreated and nuzzled the bound man\u2019s quivering belly. \u201cDo you want me to finish you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come in my mouth? In a man\u2019s mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, goddamn you, finish it.\u201d</p><p>With a loud slurp, the bound man\u2019s distended cock was once again buried between the blond\u2019s lips. Skin slapped skin. The sawhorse squeaked with the escalating thrusts.</p><p>The musky odor of sweat and sex and dirt permeated the air.</p><p>Macie was so worked up, she slid her hand down inside her underwear. She slicked up her finger with her own juices and frantically rubbed her swollen clit, aching for fast relief, sighing when the familiar throbbing began.</p><p>The dark-haired man panted, \u201cShit, Dooce, I can\u2019t hold back.\u201d</p><p>Dooce? Macie made a surprised noise. The dark-haired man looked over his shoulder briefly as he pounded his meat into Dooce\u2019s ass like a man possessed. At that point she realized the dark-haired man was her ex-boyfriend, Dante.</p><p>Dooce turned and glared at her. \u201cWhat are you doing here? He doesn\u2019t want you. No one wants you.\u201d</p><p>The bound cowboy finally looked up and his cowboy hat slid off his head.</p><p>Her heart stopped; the man was none other than Carter McKay.</p><p>Their eyes met and he said hoarsely, \u201cI want you, Macie, in ways no man ever has. I want to give you everything you\u2019ve ever wanted.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes at the heat in his eyes and the perfection of his quiet declaration.</p><p>She slumped against the chute, finding it soft as a pillow.</p><p>A pillow?</p><p>Macie\u2019s eyes flew open. She sat straight up and looked around. She wasn\u2019t in a darkened barn, but in a darkened camper.</p><p>Dammit. It was another dream, a variation on the dream she\u2019d been having the past two months. Except, it wasn\u2019t really a dream since the scenario was very close to the real one she\u2019d walked in on in Dante\u2019s apartment. Dante on his knees, Dooce jacking off as Dante fucked Dooce\u2019s ass like a madman. It\u2019d been rough, and raw, and unbelievably hot. She\u2019d stayed hidden in the shadows of the hallway, ashamed she\u2019d gotten off at the sight of Dante\u2019s sexual synchronicity with Dooce\u2014a synchronicity she and Dante had never experienced.</p><p>No wonder. She hadn\u2019t been born with a penis.</p><p>So why did her subconscious place Carter at that scene? Because he was an artist like Dante? Because she wondered if Carter was gay? The last two times she\u2019d experienced this dream, she was the one tied up and forced to watch the two men fuck like animals.</p><p>Was Carter\u2019s presence because she was afraid the situation with him would turn out the same as every other past relationship \u2014with her on the outside looking in?</p><p>A therapist would have a field day with that one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She glanced at the clock. The red numbers flashed five a.m. No use going back to sleep now\u2014the alarm would ring in another half hour anyway.</p><p>Macie cleaned up, dressed, and braided her hair before she hopped in her SUV and navigated her way to work.</p><p>Late yesterday afternoon, after she and her father finished their meal at the local diner, he\u2019d sped off to Gemma\u2019s ranch to set up the camper. She\u2019d sensed he needed to be alone with his thoughts and to gauge his new responsibilities without her chattering at him. So she\u2019d lingered in the booth, thinking of her best friend Kat, wondering how she\u2019d managed to be a third wheel again. Then she noticed the \u201chelp wanted\u201d sign by the cash register and asked the waitress about the opening.</p> <p>Velma\u2014the sixty-something owner of the Last Chance Diner\u2014needed a gal Friday to fill in part-time as a cook and waitress. The hours were sporadic, but the pay was decent for rural Wyoming. With Macie\u2019s experience in restaurants, Velma seemed genuinely happy to hire her on a simple handshake.</p><p>Macie was glad her first day would be spent in the kitchen. Between the bizarre dream, and her father ignoring her, beating eggs and dicing veggies would be a productive way to channel her frustrations.</p><p>Inside the restaurant, the rich scent of coffee caused her steps to quicken and she poured a mug before clocking in.</p><p>Velma grinned. \u201cAnother caffeine addict, huh?\u201d</p><p>Macie grunted.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve already had four cups so I\u2019ve shaken off the cobwebs and started the bacon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time do we open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix bells.\u201d Velma dumped two packages of frozen hashbrowns on the griddle.</p><p>\u201cMost of the early customers are construction workers. They like a big breakfast in a hurry. So I always have a bunch of potatoes and meat done ahead of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan.\u201d Macie donned an apron, lifted the metal press flattening the bacon to check on its doneness while downing her coffee. \u201cMostly egg specials?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Some with pancakes, most with toast. You have any problems making omelets?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope. But I didn\u2019t check to see if there\u2019s anything fancy on the menu like eggs benedict.\u201d</p><p>Velma poured her another cup of coffee. \u201cNo. No huevos rancheros either, no matter how much Diaz begs me to add \u2019em.\u201d She confided, \u201cDon\u2019t seem worth it since Diaz is the only Mexican around here. Though he threatens to bring his cousins up from Denver all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he asks me, I might just surprise him and whip up a plate.\u201d She added more oil to the sizzling potatoes. \u201cMost folks assume I\u2019m Mexican anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be rude and ask, but are you?\u201d</p><p>Macie smiled. \u201cNo. I\u2019m half Lakota Sioux.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. So the man with you last night? Is he your...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad. Cash Big Crow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe don\u2019t look old enough to have a daughter your age.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d fielded this question often enough it was second nature to her. \u201cHe was sixteen when he knocked up my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how that goes. I had my first kid when I was seventeen.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt happens. What\u2019s your dad doing around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the new foreman for Gemma Jansen\u2019s ranch.\u201d Macie froze. Maybe that wasn\u2019t supposed to be common knowledge.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Bout damn time Gemma hired somebody decent. She\u2019s been tryin\u2019 to do it all since Steve died. Be workin\u2019 herself into an early grave.\u201d Velma seemed ready to settle in for a long chat. \u201cDo you know Gemma very well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just met her yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems strange she didn\u2019t offer you a job on the Bar 9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth, Velma, I\u2019m not much interested in ranching. I\u2019m just tagging along with Dad for the summer, but I couldn\u2019t sit around and do nothing. I don\u2019t want to be accused of being lazy.\u201d Macie knew her father still struggled against that racial stereotype\u2014of being nothing more than a lazy, freeloading, boozing injun. An attitude she\u2019d run into a time or two herself.</p><p>Velma chuckled. \u201cYou ain\u2019t been here for more than twenty-fours hours, and you\u2019ve already got a job, so I think it\u2019s safe to say you ain\u2019t lazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Macie flipped the hashbrowns. \u201cJust so you know, I\u2019d much rather be back here than out front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get along just fine, Miss Macie, \u2019cause I\u2019ve had enough years of cookin\u2019 over this hot griddle. I do believe there\u2019s more grease in my veins than blood.\u201d</p><p>Macie laughed. \u201cMust be why you look so young, Miz Velma.\u201d</p><p>Velma snapped a dishtowel at her on the way to unlock the front door. \u201cYes sirree.</p><p>You and I are gonna get along just fine, squirt.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Gemma woke alone. She\u2019d gotten used to it in the last three years, but she still experienced a pang of disappointment.</p><p>Thank God Cash was conked out when she\u2019d come to bed. But in her restless state she couldn\u2019t sleep. When she\u2019d quietly crept out to stare out the window, the tears started.</p><p>Unwanted tears, both happy and sad, as she said goodbye to her past and hello to her future.</p><p>An odd thought occurred to her. Cash hadn\u2019t overheard her crying, had he?</p><p>Pointless to worry about now. She rolled her lazy ass out of bed, realizing she\u2019d overslept by a good hour. Did Cash think she acted the lady of the manor, lolling around between the sheets all day while he was out busting his ass?</p><p>Places were sore on her body that hadn\u2019t been sore in awhile, so she popped a couple of aspirin. She dressed in her usual attire of jeans, boots and a lightweight, long-sleeved cotton shirt to protect her skin from the blistering sun.</p><p>Cash wasn\u2019t in the kitchen. A single bowl and spoon rested in the dish rack beside the sink. No coffee was left warming; the pot was still sparkling clean. Well. Shoot. This wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d expected. Would\u2019ve been nice to share a cup before heading out to feed the cattle.</p><p>She stepped out onto the covered porch, shielding her eyes against the bright rays.</p><p>Cash\u2019s pickup wasn\u2019t parked in front where he\u2019d left it last night, and the ranch truck was in its usual spot. Then Gemma remembered Macie. After devoting last night to her, Cash was probably hanging out with his daughter.</p><p>Gemma didn\u2019t want to interfere, but she had a perverse need to make sure Cash was all right. He seemed a more contentious sort than to take off without telling her where he was going.</p><p>Are you speaking as his lover? Or as his boss?</p><p>She ignored the voices in her head as her strides ate up the distance to the camper.</p><p>She stopped between the outbuildings when she realized Macie\u2019s vehicle wasn\u2019t around either. What the heck?</p><p>As she debated on what to do next, Carter came barreling around the corner of the barn, scaring her half to death.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cWho? Macie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. Have you seen Cash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him headin\u2019 out to the west pasture with a load of hay in the back of his truck about an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Carter. Why weren\u2019t you with him?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed and he countered, \u201cWhy weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She should be beyond blushing at her age. Gemma sighed. \u201cEvidently I overslept.</p><p>Which means Cash is out there doing everything on his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let him. It is his responsibility now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat don\u2019t make me feel any less guilty. This is my place. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to turn over full operations to someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better at least try. What\u2019s the point of hirin\u2019 someone if you ain\u2019t gonna let him do the work?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened, then closed. She couldn\u2019t think of a rational rebuttal.</p><p>Tires thudded by the barn, sounding abnormally loud in the morning stillness. A drawn out squeak echoed as the gate was opened. An engine gunned and a screech bang followed.</p><p>Gemma hustled toward the sound. Her stomach did a little flip at seeing Cash.</p><p>He yelled, \u201cMornin\u2019, Gem.\u201d</p><p>Cash\u2019s smile died the second he saw Carter coming from the direction of Macie\u2019s camper. His neutral expression became a frown when Carter demanded, \u201cWhere\u2019s Macie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she would\u2019ve wanted you to know, McKay, she would\u2019ve told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ornery\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter,\u201d Gemma said sharply, \u201cenough.\u201d</p><p>Cash said, \u201cMaybe you oughta be doin\u2019 your job instead of worryin\u2019 \u2019bout my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least somebody is worried.\u201d Carter snorted. \u201cDid you see her last night? Or ignore her? I bet you don\u2019t even know where she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I do know where she is, and the chances of me tellin\u2019 you just dropped to zero, boy.\u201d</p><p>Good God. This was ridiculous. \u201cLook. I don\u2019t have time for this stupid male posturing. Carter, what did you get done this morning while Cash was tending the livestock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI moved the horses into the south pasture. I sprayed down the stalls and refilled the flytraps. Then I prepped Daisy\u2019s medicine. Didn\u2019t know if you wanted me to give it to her or if you wanted to do it. Then I took stock of the rest of the veterinary supplies and made a list for the next time someone goes to the feed store.\u201d</p><p>Cash seemed impressed. \u201cI noticed them flytraps were lookin\u2019 ratty last night.</p><p>Thanks for takin\u2019 care of it.\u201d He knocked his hat up a notch and addressed Gemma. \u201cThe stock tank out where the cattle are grazin\u2019 is bone dry. I came back to switch out trucks before I head back out to refill the water tanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that damn pump broken again? That\u2019s twice in the last month,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cI wondered. Thought boss lady could help me out. Show me how, or let me figure out the best way to prime the pump.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The double meaning in Cash\u2019s words caused Gemma\u2019s stomach to pitch again.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you notice if the salt licks are gone?\u201d Carter prompted. \u201c\u2019Cause it was damn close to nothin\u2019 the other day when I checked on \u2019em.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCompletely gone. I couldn\u2019t find replacements tablets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe keeps them in the cellar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll know where to look next time.\u201d Cash angled his chin at Carter. \u201cFar as I\u2019m concerned, you done everything I thought needed doin\u2019, so there ain\u2019t no reason for you to stick around today. I\u2019ll see you bright and early tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The two men stared at each other. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll go. Just as soon as you tell me where she is.\u201d</p><p>Cash laughed, a little harshly. \u201cIf Macie wants to contact you, she will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd when she does? What then?\u201d</p><p>Gemma stifled a groan at Carter\u2019s surety where he stood as far as Macie was concerned, after knowing her for one day.</p><p>\u201cIf she does contact you, I\u2019ll abide by her wishes. Until then, you\u2019ll abide by mine.</p><p>Stay away from her, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forgot one tiny detail. I don\u2019t think Macie wants to stay away from me.\u201d Carter retreated and loped to the barn. Before either of them said another word, Carter mounted his horse Deacon and galloped across the pasture, away from what probably would\u2019ve been an argument as heated as the day.</p><p>Cash swore.</p> <p>She tried to diffuse the situation. \u201cWhat happened to you this morning? I woke up and you were gone. Was I snoring or something and chased you off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You looked so peaceful I let you sleep in. I woke up early to hang out with my daughter, but she\u2019d already taken off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cIf I tell you, you gonna blab to McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But if he asks me, I ain\u2019t gonna lie.\u201d</p><p>Cash sighed. \u201cI called her cell when I couldn\u2019t find her this morning. Evidently she found work at the Last Chance Diner. She\u2019s cookin\u2019 first shift today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe already found work? I hope I\u2019m not the reason she felt the need to get a job when I told her she\u2019d have to earn her keep if she stayed here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Though your offer was mighty nice, ranch work ain\u2019t her thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGlad to hear I didn\u2019t chase her away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake more than that to scare either of us off.\u201d</p><p>Gemma stepped closer. She had an overwhelming compulsion to touch the smooth skin on his cheek, which was still damp from the exertion of early morning chores. She settled for curling her fingers around the window frame. \u201cIs everything all right? You seem...I don\u2019t know...different today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tryin\u2019 to get the lay of the land, so to speak. I don\u2019t want to disappoint my new boss lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 you\u2019ve done to me, or for me, has disappointed me so far, Cash.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cGood to hear. What do you say we get the rest of these morning chores done and head over to the diner for lunch? I\u2019d like to see my girl in action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. I\u2019ll grab the truck keys, and the salt, and meet you by the gate.\u201d</p><p>Something between them still didn\u2019t feel right. Rather than press the issue, she\u2019d see if it resolved itself \u2013 or if it was unfounded paranoia on her part.</p><p>Carter tried not to fume as his horse cruised across the pasture. Problem was, he suspected he was mostly mad at himself. He should\u2019ve trusted his gut feeling and gone to Macie like he\u2019d planned last night. From the looks of it, Cash and Gemma had been so wrapped up in each other Macie probably spent the night by herself.</p><p>How often had that happened to her? Was that the reason for her reserve?</p><p>It was a detached attitude, a purposeful distance he recognized. Hell, even his own family considered him aloof. Last night, in the long hours he\u2019d spent alone, he\u2019d attempted to draw Macie from memory. He\u2019d expected that seeing her in the flesh would lift the veil stifling his creativity. It\u2019d worked at first. By the time he\u2019d finished with the half-dozen or so sketches of her, none of them to his liking, it was nearly three in the morning. He crumpled them up and managed to nod off. His dreams weren\u2019t memorable, but on some level they\u2019d disturbed him enough to rouse him from a light slumber.</p><p>His sole desire when he awoke was to sculpt her. Dig his hands into clay and immortalize her, then cast her likeness in bronze. But again, rather than give his muse free rein, he literally had to rein in Gemma\u2019s horses.</p><p>Normally he loved working outdoors with animals. It gave him a chance to study their movements. The come-hither toss of a filly\u2019s head. The way the stallion\u2019s nostrils flared in response. The gleaming wetness of a horse\u2019s coat after a vigorous ride. How the constant Wyoming wind stirred their long manes as they galloped, so the same horse never looked the same way twice.</p><p>He figured Macie had as many different looks and moods. No wonder he was having a hard time capturing her likeness.</p><p>Carter checked on her first thing after he\u2019d arrived at the Bar 9 to find her camper empty and her car gone. Taking out his frustration by scooping manure had worked for a while. He knew it was a stupid move to take out the rest of his frustration on Cash. Then again, he suspected nothing he could\u2019ve said or done would\u2019ve convinced Cash to reveal Macie\u2019s whereabouts.</p><p>He grabbed a beer, a chunk of wood and his sharpest knife. Sometimes it helped clear his head to just have something in his hands to carve with no specific object in mind. Rather than secrete himself away in the barn, he plugged in his boom box and perched on the front stoop in the sunshine. A mixed CD of country tunes his sister Keely selected lightened his mood. As the wood shavings fell away, he thought of families, his family in particular.</p><p>His oldest brother Cord kept himself on the brink of exhaustion since his wife had divorced him and left their son Ky in his care nearly two years ago. Colby, the second of the five McKay boys, gave up his dream of pro rodeo after a life-threatening injury. Last year Colby had settled into married life with Channing, a woman who\u2019d softened his harsher edges. Between buying up every bit of available land around the McKay homestead, and chasing every rodeo queen within one hundred miles, his brother Colt made sure the McKay reputation for wild behavior remained intact. Although he and his older brother Cam were closest in age, since Cam had been stationed in Iraq, his visits to the ranch were infrequent. War had changed him. Cam was silent and serious; his infamous practical jokes non-existent.</p><p>How did his family see him? The quiet, laid back one? Young and stubborn? Cord and Colt bantered those words back and forth his entire life. Carter had no idea if anything he\u2019d accomplished put him on equal footing with the brothers he idolized.</p><p>Which was part of the reason he\u2019d jumped at the chance to work for Gemma. He wouldn\u2019t be underfoot and under scrutiny as he prepared for the art show with the potential to change his future.</p><p>Carter was relieved Gemma hired Cash Big Crow. Lately, taking care of the livestock sapped his energy and his creativity suffered. He\u2019d finished half the pieces needed for the art show. The ideas were there, but the drive wasn\u2019t. Now that time wouldn\u2019t be an issue, could he focus on completing projects? Or would meeting his beautifully haunting muse prove an even bigger distraction?</p><p>Just thinking about the sweet temptation of Macie...</p><p>The knife slipped and he swore. He wiped the blood on his jeans and dumped a splash of beer on the cut. Wasn\u2019t whiskey, but it seemed to do the trick. Disgusted the blob of wood in his hand was still a blob, Carter drained the beer and headed into the barn.</p><p>Muse or no muse, he needed to get back to work.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Dog-tired after a busy day at the diner, Macie crawled out of a cool shower and flopped on her tiny couch. Not two minutes later two raps sounded on the camper door.</p><p>She shouted, \u201cCome in,\u201d over the din of the air conditioner.</p><p>Maybe Carter deigned to stop by. Not that she\u2019d been holding her breath for his appearance last night, but she was a tiny bit disappointed he hadn\u2019t shown.</p><p>Typical man. The sweet words were no more than sweet lies, Macie.</p><p>Shut up, Mom.</p><p>The door opened and her father stepped inside.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hold back a smile. \u201cHey, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoka hey, Macie. What\u2019s up? Is this a bad time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He paused on the threshold, looking...nervous?</p><p>\u201cBet it\u2019s weird knockin\u2019 on your own door, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on in. I appreciate you letting me crash here. It would be uncomfortable staying in Gemma\u2019s house,\u201d she added hastily, \u201cnot that she\u2019s not nice or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. Plus, I imagine you\u2019re used to your independence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso true.\u201d Macie was glad he understood. \u201cYou want a beer?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou drinkin\u2019 my beer?\u201d</p><p>She grinned back. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to see it ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to waste.\u201d</p><p>Macie pulled two bottles from the small fridge. A pop hiss echoed as she twisted the caps off and handed him a cold one.</p><p>Her father slid into the bench seat of the folding table. She scooted in across from him.</p><p>\u201cSo how was your first day on the job as foreman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right I guess. Foreman\u2019s a fancy title considerin\u2019 I\u2019m the only one workin\u2019 for her. Gemma\u2019s runnin\u2019 less cattle than I assumed. There\u2019s more broken equipment than what I expected. Lucky thing I\u2019m a jack-of-all-trades, eh?\u201d He lifted his bottle in a mock toast.</p><p>Macie clinked her beer to his. \u201cVery lucky.\u201d</p><p>He sipped. She sipped.</p><p>\u201cSpeakin\u2019 of jobs. You found something pretty damn quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I wasn\u2019t planning to work, but when I saw the help wanted sign, it seemed like a sign. And I knew you\u2019d be busy and I didn\u2019t want to sit around taking up space, waiting for you to pay attention to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A lengthy pause hung in the air before he sighed. \u201dThat\u2019s how you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am a big girl. I\u2019m perfectly capable of seeing to my own needs and taking care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t goin\u2019 the way you wanted, is it?\u201d</p><p>She dropped her gaze to the bottle and her fingers picked at the soggy label. \u201cDad, nothing ever goes the way it\u2019s supposed to when it comes to us. Something always comes up and changes our plans. No biggie. I\u2019m used to it.\u201d</p><p>Silence hummed as loud as the air conditioning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>More silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always sayin\u2019 that to you, ain\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Macie shrugged.</p><p>After a while he laughed. \u201cWell, this is fun. I sure know how to kill a conversation.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t what I had in mind when I came here.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere as in, here in this camper? Or here as in, here on Gemma\u2019s ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth I guess.\u201d</p><p>With a drawn out sigh, Cash took off his hat. He tossed it on the seat beside him and scratched his head. \u201cMostly, I\u2019m here in the camper because I wanted to explain some things.\u201d His gaze caught hers. \u201cOr as your mother used to say to me, to give you an excuse on why I\u2019m disappointin\u2019 you once again.\u201d</p><p>She looked away, but she couldn\u2019t help but listen.</p><p>\u201cWhen I talked to you last week, hell, for the whole last couple of months, you sounded so down. I thought I could be the one to cheer you up for a change. That\u2019s why I invited you to hit the road with me. But the truth is, I didn\u2019t think beyond that, which has always been my downfall. I tend to live in the moment.\u201d He gestured to the inside of the camper. \u201cAs evidenced by my lack of foresight for my future. Since I ain\u2019t got much of anything. Hell, I still ain\u2019t got much to offer you, Macie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, you have every right to be pissed off. Why you bein\u2019 so nice to me? Here you are, in the wilds of Wyoming, stuck in a crappy camper, forcin\u2019 yourself to get a job, and probably feelin\u2019 ignored by the person who brung you here in the first place.\u201d He chugged his beer. \u201cAm I close to right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartially.\u201d She scraped the gummy reside from the glass bottle. \u201cBut I can\u2019t help being nice. It\u2019s the way I was raised.\u201d</p> <p>The way he went motionless, Macie knew he was thinking he hadn\u2019t had a hand in that either.</p><p>\u201cYou takin\u2019 the foreman\u2019s job did surprise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprised me too. Especially since other ranch folks have asked me to go to work for them, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they weren\u2019t her.\u201d Macie took a big drink. \u201cYou have been talkin\u2019 about her a lot for the last year. So what is it about her? Besides she\u2019s a hot lookin\u2019, tough actin\u2019 cowgirl with a big Ford truck?\u201d</p><p>He smiled slightly. \u201cShee. I could give you some bullshit answer, but the truth is, I don\u2019t know. Been askin\u2019 myself the same question. Why, after I\u2019d \u2019bout given up on her, that I\u2019d drop everything the minute she asked me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because she asked. She seems like the type of person who\u2019d prefer to do everything herself. Which I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, on a basic level if she has to ask, she really is in need of help. Your help alone, apparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He shot her a silly grin. \u201cInherited your smarts from your momma, that\u2019s for damn sure.\u201d</p><p>The ensuing silence wasn\u2019t uncomfortable for a change.</p><p>Macie finished her beer and pointed at his empty bottle. \u201cYou want another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m good. So tell me about your day flippin\u2019 cakes and bacon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always weird starting a new job. My first thought was, sleepy little diner in a sleepy little town. How busy can it be? Man, was I in for a rude awakening. Damn place is hoppin\u2019 for breakfast. I kept up.\u201d She smiled. \u201cBarely. Velma was happy, so that\u2019s all that mattered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t seem overly busy over the noon hour.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019d shocked her when he and Gemma strolled in for lunch. It\u2019d shocked her even more that her dad seemed...proud of her. For being a fast cook? Not that there was anything wrong with cooking in a greasy spoon, but for most parents, having their kid working in a diner wouldn\u2019t be a proud parent moment.</p><p>\u201cIt stayed steady. I think it creates a shorter lunch rush because people know Velma shuts down the grill at two and doesn\u2019t reopen until five. Day after tomorrow I\u2019ll be working the late shift. Waitressing. Ugh. Not my favorite.\u201d</p><p>When her dad didn\u2019t comment, and kept his face aimed at the table, Macie leaned forward and said, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou waitressing.\u201d Cash burst out laughing. \u201cI would\u2019ve loved to see you dumpin\u2019 cold tea on the guy grabbin\u2019 you. Least of what he deserved. I\u2019da clocked him.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched. \u201cWasn\u2019t funny at the time, but I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He glanced around the small space. \u201cYou\u2019re okay stayin\u2019 here in the travelin\u2019 tipi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kinda small. Kinda out of date. Probably not what you\u2019re used to, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure there isn\u2019t anything else you need?\u201d</p><p>Just time with you. \u201cNo, really, Dad, this is great. I like this place a lot better than my last apartment.\u201d There was something oddly comforting about living in a place he\u2019d lived, since they hadn\u2019t ever inhabited the same space. Oddly enough, it felt like home.</p><p>His frown lines deepened. He looked away.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just realized I ain\u2019t been to any of your apartments. Sweet Jesus. Talk about bein\u2019 a bad father\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. You had other things occupying your mind.\u201d Macie took a chance, reached for his hand and squeezed.</p><p>He squeezed back. \u201cThings change, honey-girl. I want things to change between us.</p><p>I\u2019ll try my damndest to make it so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Tomorrow night after I\u2019m done with chores, you wanna go ridin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing you can say, Dad, will ever get me on a bull.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cHorseback ridin\u2019, not bull ridin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Umm. Sure. I just hope I don\u2019t make a fool of myself in front of Gemma. It\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve been on a horse.\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cI thought maybe it could just be...you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>No, not really, a little voice reminded her, something will come up and he\u2019ll have to cancel.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>Macie told the voice to shut up. \u201cCool. I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a date.\u201d He wiggled his hat on his head and stood. \u201cYou need anything at all, just call my cell.\u201d</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t she just go up to the house and ask him in person? \u201cWhat are you and Gemma up to tonight?\u201d</p><p>When he glanced away quickly, she understood there were certain things she did not need to know about her father\u2014or how he and his boss spent their idle hours. \u201cNever mind. You don\u2019t have to answer that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma and I are goin\u2019 to check out a couple of buckin\u2019 horses over by Beulah.</p><p>We\u2019ll be back tonight, but it\u2019ll probably be late tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen drive safe and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped an arm around her shoulder, giving her a quick peck on the forehead.</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>The familiar scent of horses and leather and sun-baked cotton surrounded her. Maybe she\u2019d be doomed to disappointment, but Macie was happy her dad was at least trying to reach out to her. And she\u2019d be damned if she\u2019d slap his hand away.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Later that night another rumble of thunder rattled Macie\u2019s teeth. Lightning flashes seared her eyes. Wind gusts made the camper shake like an aluminum can. Rain pelted the steel siding.</p><p>The electricity had crapped out hours ago. She had no clue how the backup generator on the camper worked. Her cell phone was completely dead. She couldn\u2019t call her dad\u2014</p><p>not that she would\u2019ve ventured outside in a raging freakin\u2019 thunderstorm by herself even if she\u2019d had explicit instructions on how to fix the damn generator.</p><p>So Macie cowered in the dark, alone, completely freaked out and feeling stupid for being such a scaredy cat. God. She should be over this irrational fear of storms by now.</p><p>Still, she knew if her dad and Gemma were around, she would\u2019ve hightailed it into Gemma\u2019s house. As far as she knew, they hadn\u2019t made it home. She\u2019d like to think her father would\u2019ve checked on her to make sure she was all right.</p><p>He\u2019d sooner check on his horses and cows than on you.</p><p>Stop it. All of it\u2014the recriminations, the neediness, the overpowering fear.</p><p>Yet, her subconscious reminded her in every horror movie she\u2019d ever watched gruesome scenes took place during a thunderstorm\u2014when the female victim was alone.</p><p>Every noise spooked her. She\u2019d tried to block them out by singing \u201cRedneck Woman\u201d at the top of her lungs. Didn\u2019t help. When a crash sounded outside her window, she\u2019d managed not to scream, but panic kept her wide-awake.</p><p>The wind whistled and a new fear arose. Were there tornados in Wyoming? Here she was stuck in a small camper\u2014aka a tornado magnet. Gemma\u2019s house had a cellar. She\u2019d be safe there. Should she make a run for it? But...what if there were electrical wires on the ground? What if she stepped outside onto a live line? Was it worth it to take a chance she might be electrocuted? As she debated, the door to the camper blew open.</p><p>She screamed. She screamed even louder when she saw the hulking, dark figure blocking the doorway. Blindly she reached on the counter for a weapon\u2014hoping for a frying pan, a flyswatter, a can of nonstick cooking spray...anything. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMacie? Where are you?\u201d</p><p>She had to be hearing things. Why would he be here now?</p><p>The deep voice became louder. \u201cMacie? It\u2019s me. Carter. Carter McKay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCarter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Where are you?\u201d Ooof exploded from his lungs as she tackled him. She wrapped her arms around his neck and her legs clamped his waist like visegrips. She\u2019d didn\u2019t care he was sopping wet; she didn\u2019t care that she immediately burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cHey, now. Ssh. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here, darlin\u2019. I\u2019ve got you. Ssh. Take a deep breath.\u201d</p><p>He slammed the door shut with his foot, and walked sideways through the galley style kitchen. He cursed when his knee hit the edge of the mattress and they half-fell on the bed.</p><p>Macie clung to him.</p> <p>Carter shifted her body. He settled her on his lap, not attempting to disentangle the death grip her limbs had on him. His hands stroked her back, soothing her. He rested his chin on her head.</p><p>Her breath stuttered. She buried her face in his solid warmth. After she\u2019d regained some semblance of calm, she sighed.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleased as I am to have you in my arms, can I ask why you\u2019re actin\u2019 so...\u201d</p><p>Please, don\u2019t say childish.</p> <p>\u201c...skittish?\u201d</p><p>Although thankful he wasn\u2019t making fun of her, she couldn\u2019t find the guts to answer.</p><p>\u201cMacie?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t surprised he kept prodding her. But it was his gentle tone that made her whisper, \u201cBecause I hate storms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kinda guessed that.\u201d</p><p>Rain beat on the roof in the silence, mocking her fear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been terrified of them since I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cIt might help if you tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>Macie suspected he wouldn\u2019t quit pestering her until she told him the truth. \u201cWhen I was about four, I woke up in the middle of the night during a bad thunderstorm. We were living in a two-bedroom trailer in Texas. I went into my mom\u2019s room, only to find she wasn\u2019t there. So I crawled in her bed and waited for her. Scared out of my mind that someone had broken in and kidnapped her. I hid under a blanket, but I couldn\u2019t even cry because I thought maybe the bad guys would hear me and come back. The lightning was so close I remember the hair on my arms and the back of my neck standing straight up.</p><p>\u201cThen a hailstorm blew through and hailstones the size of baseballs pounded the roof, and beat on the side of the trailer hard enough the bedroom windows broke. Glass covered the floor. Everything was soaking wet from the rain. I remember it was so dark and I was alone and I couldn\u2019t move. For hours. It seemed like I spent a solid lifetime in that bed. Whenever it storms it reminds me of being helpless and alone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh. Macie, darlin\u2019, I\u2019m here. You\u2019re not alone now.\u201d Carter rocked her.</p><p>She released another shuddering sigh. \u201cMy mom never understood why I was afraid, so I\u2019ve never told anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, it seems kind of embarrassing not to have outgrown that childhood fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems perfectly justified to me. Besides, we all have fears we try to hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cEven me.\u201d</p><p>Macie lifted her head and peered in his eyes. \u201cYou know mine, it\u2019s only fair you tell me yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise you won\u2019t laugh?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Absentmindedly, he brushed the damp hair from her cheek. \u201cSee, I\u2019m way worse off than you because I have two. The first one is, I\u2019m petrified of dancin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of dancing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Did you have a cowgirl spurn you at a junior high dance or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll look like a fool. It is a bone-deep fear that keeps me far, far away from weddin\u2019 dances and the dance floor in honky-tonks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never two-stepped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow danced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, your high school prom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkipped it, but I went to the kegger afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d She fingered the collar on his T-shirt. \u201cNo woman in your life has tried to teach you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a lot of women in my life, Macie.\u201d He laughed softly. \u201cBesides my mom. And to further emasculate myself, I have a fear of monkeys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it stems from The Wizard of Oz and those damn flyin\u2019 monkeys. My brothers found out my fear and used to torture me, tyin\u2019 me to a chair and replayin\u2019 those scenes with the flyin\u2019 monkeys over and over. Same goes for Planet of the Apes. Then when I was older I read a short story about a possessed toy monkey\u2014you know the kind that you wind up and it plays the cymbals?\u2014this monkey had the power to make people kill and go crazy.\u201d He shuddered. \u201cNot cute and cuddly creatures. Hairy overgrown rats, that\u2019s what they are.\u201d</p><p>A crack of lightning flashed outside the window, followed by a booming crash of thunder; Macie jumped and hid her face against his chest.</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d</p><p>A couple of beats passed as rain pounded on the roof.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cI\u2019m better than I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad I\u2019m good for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re here. Or how you knew...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma called me to tell me she wasn\u2019t gonna spook the new horses and drag them through the storm. She and Cash would be stayin\u2019 overnight in Spearfish. I figured that meant you were here alone. When the electricity went off, I thought I\u2019d better check on you.\u201d</p><p>Gemma had called him? Not her dad? Rather than analyze that, she said, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Plus, I wanted to apologize for not showin\u2019 up last night.\u201d His thumb swept the top of her ear, causing gooseflesh to break out on her neck. \u201cGemma said you probably needed time to settle in. I should\u2019ve ignored her and listened to my gut and come here like I planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered what happened. I figured maybe it\u2019d all been\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014a line? What I said to you at the rodeo grounds wasn\u2019t a line, Macie. I\u2019ll keep tellin\u2019 you that until you believe it.\u201d His mouth grazed her temple. \u201cSo, you wanna pack your stuff and come home with me?\u201d</p><p>Macie didn\u2019t respond. Despite the fact Carter was being sweet and thoughtful, she didn\u2019t want to be away from everything familiar.</p><p>Right. Nothing about this situation was familiar. But it smacked of trouble to just let Carter swoop in and take care of her. She knew better than to rely on anyone besides herself.</p><p>\u201cMacie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I think I\u2019d rather stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it because you\u2019re afraid of leavin\u2019 and goin\u2019 out into the storm?\u201d He paused and leaned back to look at her. \u201cOr just afraid of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little of both.\u201d</p><p>Carter considered her for a moment. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t bring my toothbrush, so you\u2019ll have to share yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying here? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd miss my chance to show off my cowboy manners by helpin\u2019 a little lady in distress?\u201d Carter grinned. \u201cNot on your life, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m gonna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothin\u2019 else in mind for tonight, I swear.\u201d</p><p>Macie gave him a skeptical look.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean things won\u2019t change in a heartbeat after you\u2019re not lookin\u2019 at me like a scared rabbit.\u201d He traced her cheek with the back of his hand. \u201cFear is the last thing I wanna see in these beautiful brown eyes when I take you the first time.\u201d</p><p>Not make love to her. Take her. Despite her lingering fear of the storm, his words sent a thrill through her.</p><p>\u201cAlthough, I ain\u2019t chivalrous enough to sleep on the couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t bring a toothbrush, I don\u2019t suppose you brought pajamas either?\u201d</p><p>A slow smile lit his face. \u201cI\u2019ve never been overly fond of pajamas.\u201d</p><p>The thought of sleeping all night next to a naked Carter...Lord. You\u2019d think she was bone-cold from the sheer amount of shivers racking her body.</p><p>Lightning spiked nearby, accompanied by a deafening crack of thunder. She gasped and threw herself against him again.</p><p>\u201cHey. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>After she quit shaking, he stood. \u201cMaybe we should crawl in, pull the covers over our heads and try to forget about the storm.\u201d Carter peeled back the denim comforter and smoothed the rumpled sheet. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p><p>Macie heard rustling sounds as Carter stripped down to nothing.</p><p>The camper shook from another gust of wind. The covers were lifted, the bed dipped and a hot, hard male pressed against her.</p><p>Carter swore under his breath. \u201cDarlin\u2019, your skin is clammy and you\u2019re freezin\u2019.</p><p>Come here and let me warm you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cInnocent warmin\u2019 this time, Macie, I promise.\u201d His hands drifted up and down her back, and he tucked her against his chest.</p><p>She relaxed and let him calm her. She began to block out the sounds of the storm and synchronized her breathing to his.</p><p>After awhile he murmured, \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>Carter kept his caresses light, but constant. Another few minutes passed and he said,</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes your dad know what happened to you when you were a kid? About your mom leavin\u2019 you alone and your fear of storms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, why not? That same smarmy voice persisted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She ignored it. \u201cBecause he wasn\u2019t around much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? How come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom was older than my dad by ten years. When she found out she was pregnant, she thought he\u2019d be a lousy parent, so she did the mature thing and took off. I saw him maybe once a year. Seems pointless to tell him about this now, especially when he never knew some of the other crazy things my mom did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d keep me out of school so I could experience \u2018life lessons\u2019 not math lessons.</p><p>We lived all over the country. The year I turned twelve, Dad wanted me to spend summers on the reservation. My mom believed he\u2019d take me on the rodeo circuit; she refused to leave me with him. When I was old enough to contact him on my own, I did.</p><p>Right after my eighteenth birthday, Mom was diagnosed with liver cancer. She died quickly, which was a blessing for her. Her death immediately thrust me into the adult world, but truth was, growing up I was more the adult than Mom ever was, so it wasn\u2019t really that big of a change for me.\u201d</p><p>Talk about spilling your guts, Macie. She stiffened, full of self-recrimination for baring all of her pitiful past, and braced herself for his pity or for more questions.</p><p>But Carter said, \u201cThat flat out sucks,\u201d and his arms gathered her close as he kissed the top of her head. \u201cGet some sleep, sweet darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>And for the first time in hours, she thought sleep was a possibility.</p><p>Carter wanted to punch something, namely Macie\u2019s clueless father. As Macie curled into him, he thought back to his own childhood. It hadn\u2019t been perfect, but it\u2019d been damn near idyllic compared to hers.</p><p>He\u2019d never been a pawn between his parents, never worried about waking up scared and alone. A large part of that was because he\u2019d shared a room with Cam. And he had three other brothers down the hall.</p><p>Another bout of fury washed over him and he ground his teeth together. Jesus. Who was Cash Big Crow to warn him about staying away from Macie for her own good? It appeared Cash had stayed away from her plenty. It also appeared Cash didn\u2019t know squat about what was best for his daughter, or what she needed. Macie\u2019s combination of independence and neediness made perfect sense now.</p><p>Macie made a sexy, contented sound between a sigh and a moan, snuggling deeply against his chest. Carter held his breath and clenched his thighs together, trying\u2014and failing\u2014to fight off an erection.</p><p>This was so not the way he\u2019d envisioned the first night with Macie in his arms. But he\u2019d take what he could get. After another kiss on the top of her head, he closed his eyes and tried to sleep.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>A loud snort burst in Macie\u2019s ear, startling her. A hard male body spooned hers.</p><p>Strong, male arms snaked around her waist. A steady stream of air drifted over her temple.</p><p>Where was she?</p><p>Her father\u2019s camper. Then she remembered the storm and Carter showing up.</p><p>She was in bed with Carter McKay. Oh man. She squirmed. The arms tightened. And something nestled firmly against her ass tightened too.</p><p>Macie\u2019s pulse spiked.</p> <p>Carter groaned, but made no move to release her. Instead, his right hand swept her belly to span the area between her hipbones. Just the very tips of his work-roughened fingers stroked the skin where the top and bottom of her pjs left a gap.</p><p>The continual, sensuous, rhythmic touch heated her blood. Tingles raced over her flesh, from her neck to her thighs, sending a rush of moisture between her legs. A man\u2019s simple touch on her skin never caused this intense reaction.</p><p>She waited, expecting him to stir. Her mouth opened. Then closed. Did she really want to wake him? Did she really want him to stop touching her, whether it was conscious or not?</p><p>No.</p><p>His breathing didn\u2019t change even when his hand dipped beneath the stretchy waistband of her pajama bottoms. The tip of his long middle finger breached the curls on her mound, and slid right between her pussy lips.</p><p>And stopped.</p><p>Macie bit her tongue to keep from crying out. Before she chickened out, she widened her thighs slightly.</p><p>Immediately Carter\u2019s fingers slipped further down. Another soft groan rumbled from his throat as he found her wet. He rubbed his fingers through the juices gathering at her entrance and glided them back up.</p><p>At the first contact with her clit, she nearly shot straight up in bed.</p><p>He drew light circles, drawing out that elusive little nub of pleasure until she whimpered.</p><p>Then Carter\u2019s first two fingers slid back across her swollen sex and slipped inside her.</p><p>This time she couldn\u2019t help it; she gasped.</p><p>His husky voice whispered, \u201cThat\u2019s right, darlin\u2019, let me hear you.\u201d Carter scraped his teeth across the cord straining in the back of her neck. \u201cLet me make you feel good.\u201d</p><p>As his fingers moved in and out of her, the base of his palm pressed her clit, creating the perfect amount of friction. Her eyes nearly rolled back in her head from the burst of pleasure. Still, she was afraid to speak, fearing if she did, he would stop. Or she\u2019d wake up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be shy. You want this.\u201d His fingers plunged deep. \u201cI can\u2019t wait until it\u2019s my cock pushin\u2019 inside you. Hearin\u2019 my name as I make you come.\u201d</p><p>His words, coupled with his hot breath and kisses dampening her skin, made her pump her hips harder into his hand.</p><p>\u201cLet go. Let it happen.\u201d Carter curled his fingers and stroked the magic spot on the inside of her pussy. The heel of his hand ground into her clit and the combination set her off.</p><p>Macie turned her head and opened her mouth to cry out, only to have Carter\u2019s lips covering hers in a soul-stealing kiss. The pulses throbbed; inside her sex, outside under his hand, in her blood, in her head, in her mouth. The spasms multiplied in intensity with every searing stroke of his velvety tongue across hers.</p><p>Then he slowed and sweetened their first kiss as her orgasm ebbed to a faint, but steady throb.</p><p>Carter removed his hand, allowing a leisurely caress up the trembling center of her body. His damp lips drifted to her ear. \u201cGood mornin\u2019, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She felt so pliant she couldn\u2019t find the strength to stretch her arms. She murmured,</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a dream this time, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A soft kiss teased the nape of her neck. \u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018this time\u2019 mean? You been dreamin\u2019 about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you get cocky if I say yes?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled against her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m already cocky.\u201d He shifted his pelvis. The unabashed male hardness caused her belly to clench with want. \u201cIn more ways than one.\u201d</p><p>Carter rolled Macie flat on her back. Leaving his bare leg draped over hers and their dark gazes locked, he brought his fingers\u2014those long, clever fingers that had driven her over the edge\u2014to his mouth and sucked them clean.</p><p>This time Macie\u2019s pussy clenched, not her belly.</p><p>\u201cMmm. My favorite breakfast. But one sweet taste of you leaves me cravin\u2019 more, Macie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter\u2014\u201d</p><p>He fastened his mouth to hers and his hot tongue swept inside to thoroughly share her taste.</p><p>She clutched his shoulders, yanking his full body weight onto hers. Macie jammed her hands through his hair and arched her hips against his erection.</p><p>The kiss grew desperate. Hungry.</p><p>Carter rocked his pelvis from side to side, rebuilding her sharp ache of desire. She raked her nails down his naked back, gripping the firm butt cheeks to do a little grinding of her own.</p><p>He broke the kiss on a soft, frustrated moan. \u201cMacie.\u201d He whispered, \u201cTouch me.</p><p>I\u2019m dyin\u2019 to feel your hand around me.\u201d</p><p>Macie said, \u201cYes.\u201d Just as she reached between them, three thunderous raps sounded on the camper door.</p><p>Carter went absolutely rigid above her.</p><p>\u201cMacie?\u201d was shouted outside the window.</p><p>\u201cShit. It\u2019s my dad.\u201d She tried to shove Carter aside, but he wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cOkay, don\u2019t panic. We\u2019ll pretend we were sleeping.\u201d</p><p>The lust cleared from his blue eyes. \u201cWhy? There was nothin\u2019 wrong with what we were doin\u2019, when we both wanted to do it. Besides, you are an adult and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and he\u2019s still my father. Catching us sleeping is a lot better than catching us dry humping, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d Carter jerked the covers over both of them and spooned against her.</p><p>\u201cMacie? It\u2019s me. I\u2019m comin\u2019 in.\u201d A gleaming ray of sun cut through the camper walls and disappeared into shadow as the door shut.</p><p>Bootsteps thumped as loud as her heart.</p><p>\u201cHoney-girl? Sorry \u2019bout leavin\u2019 you alone last night. I tried callin\u2019 you...\u201d Then,</p><p>\u201cChrist Almighty, what in the hell are you doin\u2019 in my daughter\u2019s bed, McKay?\u201d</p><p>Macie and Carter both sat up. \u201cCarter came to check on me last night during the storm because the electricity was off. I asked him to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>Cash frowned. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you need to know, Dad.\u201d She watched his braid swing as he automatically retreated a step. \u201cDid you and Gemma run into any problems on your way back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Lots of trees are down. I think the electricity is still off, but I\u2019ll fire up the generator for the camper.\u201d He directed his glower to Carter. \u201cSoon as you\u2019re decent I need your help in the barn.\u201d With that, he left.</p><p>Macie slumped back in bed as Carter used her toothbrush at the tiny bathroom sink.</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother to glance in the mirror or comb his hair. She admitted the curls looked cute all mussed up from her fingers.</p><p>He faced her. \u201cDuty calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m lucky he won\u2019t line up all the shitty jobs for me, after findin\u2019 me in your bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t count on it.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cSo, when I\u2019m done with chores today, will you come to my place?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTo do what?

But the main reason I want you to come over is because I need you to pose for me.\u201d</p><p>Not the answer she\u2019d expected. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>Carter pulled on his jeans and she couldn\u2019t help but stare at his ripped abs.

I never kid when it comes to art.\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze flew to his. He\u2019d gone from playful to deadly serious. \u201cI suppose. I\u2019m not scheduled to work today anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork here on the Bar 9? That could be fun. You and me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not working here on the ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen where?\u201d</p><p>Would a polite look of distaste cross his face when he discovered she was just a cook? \u201cI took a job as a cook and a waitress at the Last Chance Diner.\u201d</p><p>Carter\u2019s eyebrows lifted again. \u201cWhen did you do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe day we met at the rodeo. Dad and I stopped for supper and I saw the help wanted sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. So are you any good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt what?\u201d</p><p>His hot gaze lingered on her mouth before a mischievous smiled curled his lips. \u201cAt cookin\u2019 of course, what did you think I meant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you blame me for being suspicious? Especially after all the innuendos dripping from your silver tongue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, those aren\u2019t innuendos, but the gospel truth. And I can\u2019t wait to show you all the tricks my silver tongue has in store for you.\u201d The tight black T-shirt went over his head, covering up his abs of steel. Dressed, he grinned and leaned over her. \u201cI\u2019ll be back as quick as I can. Be ready.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his lips across hers and vanished out the door.</p><p>Carter had to remind himself no matter what went on with Macie, Cash was still essentially his boss. Surprisingly enough, he and Cash worked well together\u2014albeit in complete silence. They unloaded the new mares and helped Gemma pick up the debris from the storm.</p> <p>The morning was muggy. The wisps of clouds didn\u2019t stifle the heat. Luckily the night\u2019s rainfall kept the dust to a minimum. With three of them working, it didn\u2019t take long to clean up the broken tree branches. By the time they finished, the electricity was back on.</p><p>After Gemma and Cash drove off to check cattle, Carter moved his truck from the ditch where he\u2019d been forced to leave it during the storm. Before he climbed out, Macie emerged from the camper, twirling her car keys in her hand. It pleased him to think she\u2019d been waiting for him.</p><p>He smiled and let his eyes roam over her. \u201cDarlin\u2019, you look\u2014\u201d good enough to eat</p><p>\u201c\u2014great.\u201d</p><p>Macie fussed with the straps on the long gauzy white dress. \u201cIs this all right? I didn\u2019t know what to wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze snapped to his. \u201cNo nudes. If this is where you tell me I\u2019m supposed to get naked\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll be workin\u2019 on portraits. Pen and ink or charcoal; I haven\u2019t decided which.</p><p>I\u2019ll wait to see how the light is today.\u201d She\u2019d look stunning in any light. As he studied the angles and lines of her beautiful face, that intriguing expression appeared again.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re staring at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet used to it, \u2019cause I\u2019ll be doin\u2019 it a lot.\u201d His comment seemed to make her more uncomfortable so he backtracked. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re ridin\u2019 with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow you in my car, that way I can leave when I want.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like it, but he managed a bland, \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>Carter\u2019s place was a couple of miles up the road\u2014shorter on horseback. Driving the potholed gravel road on autopilot, he imagined Macie riding bareback, a beaded buckskin dress sliding up her slender thighs, her curtain of silky hair flowing behind her as she rode wild and free across the Wyoming prairie.</p><p>The image froze in his mind. It would work as a still life as well as a medium-sized sculpture. He\u2019d need to capture the texture of the fringe and the beads, the smooth line of her leg, the flexing muscles of the racing horse and the proud set to her chin.</p><p>So intent was his brain on cataloging the minute details that he jumped when a loud knocking echoed next to his head. The fog lifted and he saw Macie frowning at him through the driver\u2019s side window. Carter glanced around. Whoa. He hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d stopped the pickup.</p><p>Carter offered her a guilty smile before he hopped out of the truck. \u201cSorry. I lose track of time when I get to thinkin\u2019. Come on. The studio is in the barn.\u201d</p><p>Macie trailed after him without comment.</p><p>He gathered his supplies and attempted to create professional distance. \u201cI want to take advantage of this light. So we\u2019ll start outside.\u201d He threaded the strap to his camera over his head and caught her staring at it.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to take pictures of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo once I\u2019m done posing for them I can leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically...yes.\u201d His eyes searched hers. \u201cBut I want you to stay. Will you?\u201d</p><p>After a moment she nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood. Grab that stool.\u201d By the time he\u2019d arranged her, gazing across the field comprised of red dirt, gray rocks and acres of sagebrush, he\u2019d entered the zone where everything boiled down to light and shadow. Nothing existed but curves, lines, and angles used to fill the blank white space on his sketchpad.</p><p>Carter expected her nervous chatter. But she may as well have been a statue. She didn\u2019t speak. She scarcely moved. A couple of times while she\u2019d been lost in thought he quietly snapped pictures. He\u2019d managed a good outline when her soft sigh drifted to him on the wind.</p><p>Absentmindedly he asked, \u201cNeed something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. To use the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the timer clipped to his bag and cursed. Three hours had passed.</p><p>\u201cSorry. We can take a break.\u201d</p><p>Macie slid off the stool and ambled toward him. Automatically he closed his sketchbook\u2014a move that wasn\u2019t lost on her.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI\u2019m beyond a break, Carter. I\u2019m tired. I think I\u2019m gonna head back to the ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a droll stare. \u201cWhat do you mean I \u2018can\u2019t\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you here. I\u2019m behind on this portion of the show. I told you earlier I need you to stick around and you agreed to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot indefinitely.\u201d</p><p>After witnessing her meltdown last night he knew it wouldn\u2019t take much to spook her, and he\u2019d never been particularly even-tempered. \u201cI\u2019m just askin\u2019 for today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I didn\u2019t realize you meant all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have.\u201d He stood. \u201cLook. How about if you take a nap while I finish up some other things in the barn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019ll be napping in your bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that be so bad?\u201d He couldn\u2019t look at her as he waited for her response. It\u2019d be just like him to screw this up from the get-go.</p><p>\u201cYes. No. I don\u2019t know. What am I doing here, Carter? Even you have to admit this whole situation is just plain...weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna admit any such thing. This feels right. I can\u2019t explain it but on some level you must feel it too or you wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d Vowing to keep it light and easy, he hefted the bag over his shoulder and gave her a cheeky grin. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll tuck you in.</p><p>Maybe after your nap you won\u2019t be such a cranky pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that a crack at my age, McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I promise you milk and cookies afterward will you stop pouting?\u201d</p><p>A frustrated noise left her throat. A swish of lace brushed his calf as Macie pushed past him.</p><p>He snagged her arm. \u201cHey. I was kiddin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t funny. Do you know how many people look at me and then treat me like I\u2019m twelve? I thought you were different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. Let me go.\u201d</p><p>Carter felt the air whomp from his lungs. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was bein\u2019 an ass. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. Just let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease what?\u201d Carter dropped his bag and crowded her against the trailer. \u201cPlease you? That I can do.\u201d She fought him until he cupped her face in his hands and kissed her.</p><p>Jesus. Her mouth was so warm and soft. Her opposition evaporated when his tongue breached her lips and slid inside. Lord almighty he loved the way she responded to him.</p><p>He allowed the kiss to stay just a shade shy of demanding. He kept his hands on her head, rather than making a play for the breasts he\u2019d been dying to touch.</p><p>Macie broke the kiss and his grasp. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he whispered against her lips.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have you blaming me because you didn\u2019t get any work done today.\u201d She ducked under his arm. \u201cI\u2019m sure I can find the bed on my own.\u201d</p><p>He watched as she scooted inside and slammed the door in his face.</p><p>Well, hell, she\u2019d certainly put him in his place. Maybe he didn\u2019t have to treat his muse with kid gloves after all.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>\u201cAll accounted for,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cWere you worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Some of the new mommas bolt with the herd during thunderstorms and leave their babies alone to fend for themselves. Usually I find at least one dead calf. Then I gotta listen to those mommas bawling in the pasture and calling for their baby. Never get used to that sad sound, so I\u2019m glad not to be dealing with that today. Got plenty of other stuff going on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cash punched the clutch and shifted. \u201cI\u2019d planned on cuttin\u2019 hay this afternoon, but it\u2019ll be too wet. Not that I\u2019m complainin\u2019 \u2019bout the moisture. It\u2019ll have to wait at least a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought about workin\u2019 with that two-year-old. Is he halter broke?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBarely. Ornery thing runs whenever he sees me with a halter. And I\u2019ve been so busy this year I haven\u2019t had time to work with him.\u201d She expected him to wince. Not training a horse was as bad as not taking proper care of one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d sure like to take a crack at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means.\u201d</p><p>Cash stopped the pickup and Gemma hopped out to open and close the gate. He parked in front of the house and sauntered back to where she waited by the water pump for the bucket to fill.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doin\u2019 today?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cThought I\u2019d clean the horse trailer. Why? Did you need me for something else?\u201d</p><p>She hoped he\u2019d say yes, that he needed her naked. Right now.</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m gonna round up that roan.\u201d He unlatched the door to the horse trailer, which housed the saddles, blankets, halters, bridles and other horse paraphernalia.</p><p>Whistling, he unhooked a blue nylon halter and draped it over his shoulder. \u201cSee you in a bit.\u201d</p><p>Hiding her disappointment, Gemma focused on sweeping and scrubbing. But while she was cleaning, she couldn\u2019t help but obsess on what had happened last night.</p><p>Or rather, what hadn\u2019t happened.</p> <p>Cash had been quiet on the drive to Beulah. They\u2019d left right after he\u2019d talked to Macie, and Gemma didn\u2019t know if that was the reason for his introspective mood. She didn\u2019t push, figuring if he wanted to talk to her about it he would.</p><p>Once they\u2019d arrived at the Nelson ranch to look at the bucking horses, Cash stepped up and handled every bit of the financial negotiations. The crusty old rancher even dropped his price by a couple of hundred bucks. Gemma knew she wouldn\u2019t have had the same results if she\u2019d come alone.</p><p>As Gemma was writing out the check, the man\u2019s wife came outside to warn them severe thunderstorms were headed their way. Several areas in Wyoming were already without power due to windstorms, and state Highway 23 was temporarily closed because of excessive hail.</p><p>Since the horses were essentially wild, they decided to wait out the storm and leave them in the pasture and come back in the morning. They hadn\u2019t planned to stay overnight and Gemma hadn\u2019t packed any household supplies in the living quarters of the horse trailer.</p><p>On the drive to Spearfish to find a motel, Cash tried to call Macie several times but got no answer. Gemma snuck in a call to Carter and explained the situation while Cash checked them into the room.</p><p>After a nearly silent dinner, they returned to the motel. Gemma\u2019s hopes sunk a little when she noticed two double beds. It didn\u2019t help matters Cash was glued to The Weather Channel. And Gemma knew better than to tell him not to worry about his daughter.</p><p>Telling him she\u2019d asked Carter to check on Macie would set him off big time.</p><p>Frustrated, Gemma flopped on the opposite bed. She woke up the next morning fully clothed.</p> <p>When Cash didn\u2019t offer up an explanation on why he hadn\u2019t touched her, the paranoid part of her psyche supplied reasons.</p><p>Regret.</p><p>Disappointment.</p><p>Disgust.</p><p>The situation between them didn\u2019t improve after they\u2019d loaded the horses and were on the road. Once again, Cash insisted on driving, leaving Gemma lost in thoughts she didn\u2019t want.</p><p>Finding Macie all right\u2014albeit with Carter in her bed\u2014seemed to alleviate some of the tension between them. Cash almost seemed normal while they were checking cows.</p><p>But what was normal with him? What was normal with them?</p><p>Forget it. He\u2019s doing what you hired him to do.</p><p>Gemma managed to block the past twenty-four hours from her brain. By the time she finished cleaning up, her shirt and boots were sopping wet and her jeans were damp. She needed a shower in a bad way. She dragged the bucket and brooms to the barn. Nothing happened when she tugged on the string to the light bulb. Probably the fuse blew in last night\u2019s storm.</p><p>The outer door opened and a sliver of light briefly permeated the darkness like a flash bulb.</p><p>\u201cGemma?\u201d Cash called. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the tack room. None of the lights seem to be working.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hear him come up behind her so she jumped when he placed his hands on her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou scared me.\u201d</p><p>Cash didn\u2019t answer. He didn\u2019t move either.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour shirt is wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. Don\u2019t stand too close. I probably smell bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou smell good to me.\u201d He inhaled deeply. \u201cReally good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything is bound to smell good when you\u2019ve been in the pen and around wild horses for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour shirt is wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe already established that.\u201d</p><p>His warm breath ruffled the hair by her ear. \u201cTake it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. Take off your shirt. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue with me. I think I\u2019d enjoy punishin\u2019 you too much today.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers froze around his when they breached the first snap. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would. Without apology and you\u2019ll take what I dish out without complaint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma.\u201d His voice was a low-pitched growl. \u201cI ain\u2019t jokin\u2019. Do what I tell you.\u201d</p><p>She tried a different tack. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather go inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Take. Off. The. Damn. Shirt. Now.\u201d</p><p>A kernel of excitement unfurled from the tips of her boots to the end of her ponytail.</p><p>Pop pop pop pop went the pearl snaps and the shirt hung open. She slipped it off her shoulders and Cash took it.</p><p>\u201cNow the bra.\u201d</p><p>The front clasp popped and the bra hit the dirt.</p><p>\u201cUnfasten your jeans.\u201d</p><p>Gemma tugged on the button on her Wranglers. The release of the zipper tine by tine sounded incredibly erotic in the heated stillness. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPull them down to your knees. Panties too.\u201d</p><p>She shimmied the denim to the tops of her boots.</p><p>\u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>Soon as she faced him his hands were on her breasts and his teeth closed over her left nipple. Her breath caught at the sensation of his hot mouth on her cool skin. Then he nipped the very tip as he kissed a path to her right breast. No sweet nuzzling; Cash suckled hard and deep. He lifted the globes together, and growled against her flesh as his hungry mouth moved back and forth. Licking. Biting. Sucking.</p><p>She almost came from the sexy feel of his tongue rasping over her nipples. Giving every inch the attention she craved until she was dizzy and wet with want.</p><p>Cash placed hot kisses up her throat. \u201cTouch yourself.\u201d</p><p>Flustered, she stuttered, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten yourself off when you haven\u2019t had a man to do it.\u201d His tongue slicked across her bottom lip. \u201cShow me how you make yourself come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. It\u2019s too dark. You can\u2019t see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t matter. I got a great imagination. I hear you breathin\u2019 fast. I feel your heart poundin\u2019 against my mouth. I smell that sweet cream. I know you want to get off, Gemma doll. Show me how your pretty pussy responds to your touch.\u201d</p><p>Cash rubbed his stubbled cheek along her jaw. \u201cWhile you finger yourself, I\u2019ll suck these tits deep and hard. I know I can make you moan, but wanna see if I can make you scream.\u201d</p><p>She had difficulty swallowing and she knew he heard it. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m feeling shy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t. You want to prove your wild side. Knowin\u2019 you\u2019re touchin\u2019 yourself will drive me insane. It excites you to drive me crazy with lust without even touchin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>He plucked her hand off his shoulder. Kissing her first two fingers delicately, he sucked them into his hot mouth.</p><p>A flash of heat speared between her legs.</p><p>Cash ran his tongue between the digits, getting them good and wet before he released them. \u201cShow me.\u201d He covered her hand with his, placing it between her shaking legs.</p><p>Gemma felt her wetness ease the way as four fingers pushed inside her. Her head fell back against the stalls as he helped move their joined hands in and out of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cLike that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually I just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI go straight for my clit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the fastest way to get me off.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cGreedy wench. Show me more. Show me everything.\u201d Cash bent his head and worked her nipples.</p><p>She thrust the fingers into her pussy twice before sliding them up to her mound. She centered the pad of her middle finger right over her clit and she rubbed. Not ever-widening circles. Not side to side. No teasing. Just up and down, directly over that needy nub. A moan escaped when she realized the added weight of his finger intensified the pressure.</p><p>Cash blew a stream of air across her wet nipples. \u201cFaster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d She thrust their joined fingers back inside her core, secretly loving the way he made her lead. Made her teach him what she liked.</p><p>She liked it all. If his labored breathing and the way his pelvis bumped her hip was any indication, he liked it all too.</p><p>Her middle finger returned to the aching spot. \u201cFaster would be good now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>She kept the strokes short and fast. So close. She was so damn close. The pressure built and she lost her mind when Cash sucked her nipple in perfect timing to the pulsating in her clit.</p><p>\u201cOh shit that feels so...\u201d An intense rush of pleasure overwhelmed her senses. The scent of his hot skin. The complete darkness. The sharp nip of his teeth. The wet lash of his tongue on the swell of her breast. The throbbing in her sex. The sensations were too potent, too raw. Almost there... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He knocked her hand away. Then his mouth was on hers and she heard a metallic clank as he unbuckled his belt, followed by the sound of his jeans sliding down his flanks.</p><p>Blindly she reached for the hardest part of him, but his fingers circled her wrist.</p><p>He ripped his mouth free. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m about two seconds away from coming. And I don\u2019t want to come in your hand.\u201d He put his mouth on the pulse pounding in her throat. \u201cAlthough, I want to fuck every part of you. Your hand. Your mouth. Your tits. Your ass. Say you\u2019ll let me do whatever I want.\u201d He hissed against her ear. \u201cSay it and I\u2019ll let you come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now I\u2019ll take this warm, tight pussy since it is wet and ready for me. Turn, bend over and grab the slats.\u201d</p><p>Gemma thought she couldn\u2019t get hotter. But his hot words and hot breath and the wicked hot things he planned to do to her blanked her mind to everything but sexual greed. She spun around and curled her fingers through the space separating the wooden boards of the stalls.</p><p>His boots nudged the inside of hers. \u201cWider.\u201d</p><p>She kicked her heels out as far as they would go with her jeans stuck around the middle of her calves.</p><p>He nuzzled the back of her head. \u201cYou trust me, sweets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll let me do whatever I want to you, right?\u201d</p><p>Her stomach swooped\u2014excitement laced with fear. \u201cAs long as it feels good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll feel good.\u201d He sank his teeth into the nape of her neck and gooseflesh broke out across her back. \u201cBut maybe not at first.\u201d</p><p>Before she could demand specifics, Cash\u2019s big, rough hand smoothed down her spine and over her butt. He slapped her ass. Hard. Twice.</p><p>She gasped.</p><p>He did it again on the other side. Smack smack.</p><p>\u201cCash!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d</p><p>Four more sharp smacks landed on each one of her butt cheeks. The sting morphed into a burning sensation that wasn\u2019t unpleasant...just a hot reminder of who was in charge.</p><p>\u201cCash?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love it when you say my name,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you like it.\u201d Whack whack whack whack. \u201cYou like it because you\u2019ve never had that bite of pain and you\u2019ve always wondered what it\u2019d be like, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Whack whack whack whack.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2014oh God. Don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me. You are drippin\u2019 wet, winyan.\u201d He inhaled. \u201cI can smell it.\u201d He spanked the same spot three times. And repeated on her left side. \u201cYou need a reminder that I ain\u2019t a gentleman, Gemma.\u201d</p><p>How had he known she craved a taste of kink? She moaned loudly when two hard slaps close to her anus made it clench.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d he asked, peppering her butt with little swats.</p><p>Her skin tingled and burned. She cried out even as her pussy wept for more. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The cheeks on her face and on her backside were enflamed.</p><p>He spanked her until every inch of her butt bore the mark of his hand.</p><p>His harsh breathing reverberated in the humid space as a lover\u2019s whisper. She felt his fingers circling her opening, spreading her wide for him, and finally the hot blunt tip of his cock was poised at her entrance.</p><p>Gemma held her breath for that first hard, deep thrust.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t expecting the icy cold water he dumped over her burning ass. She screamed.</p><p>And Cash slammed into her cunt to the hilt and began to ride her. His fingertips curved into her waist as he kept her in place to take his thrusts.</p><p>Water dripped down the outside of her thighs. Her juices coated the inside of her thighs. Her butt cheeks were on fire, yet chilled. She couldn\u2019t see him. She could scarcely suck air into her lungs that wasn\u2019t filled with his scent.</p><p>But she could feel him. Lord. There wasn\u2019t a single part of her body that wasn\u2019t intensely aware of every inch of him.</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself.\u201d His voice was little more than a hoarse rasp. \u201cCome when I\u2019m inside you. Take me there.\u201d</p><p>Although he was fucking her hard and she needed both hands for balance, she managed to reach between her legs long enough to coax another orgasm from her swollen clit, feeling her internal muscles clamp down on his cock.</p><p>He plunged into her three more times and stopped, letting loose a guttural groan as semen burst forth in hot spurts. She actually felt his heat. Her inner walls pulsed, keeping that supreme male hardness buried deep inside her.</p><p>After the sexual haze cleared from her mind, his legs twitched behind hers. Then his hot tongue zigzagged up her spine causing her to shiver anew.</p><p>\u201cSee? I think you smell good. You taste good too. Sorta like my own personal salt lick, eh?\u201d</p><p>Gemma was too stunned to speak.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>Cash pulled out and swore. \u201cShit. I forgot a condom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt I can get pregnant at my ripe old age.\u201d She pushed herself off the stall into an upright position. \u201cYou know I haven\u2019t been with anyone since Steve. I sort of missed the whole AIDS scare. What about you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cLast time I had sex without a condom was the summer Macie was conceived. That\u2019s why I ain\u2019t got any more kids, a case of the clap, or anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>Cash spun her and tugged her into his arms for a sweet, intense, exhaustive kiss.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d she murmured against his chest.</p><p>\u201cFor lettin\u2019 me be bold and bawdy. For bein\u2019 the hottest, sexiest winyan I\u2019ve ever put my hands on. You drive me wild, Gemma Jansen. There\u2019s a million things that need to be done around here and the only thing I can think about is doin\u2019 you. Over and over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sweet talker.\u201d Gemma kissed his Adam\u2019s apple. \u201cI\u2019m starved. Let\u2019s go inside and get cleaned up before we eat. Where are my clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares? I prefer you half-naked. Or all naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no matter what you prefer, I ain\u2019t struttin\u2019 across the yard wearing nothin\u2019 but my pants around my boots and a big-ass smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you ain\u2019t cryin\u2019 this time.\u201d</p><p>Gemma froze. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to pretend it didn\u2019t happen. I heard you that first night. Up in your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Even though part of me understands why you were bawlin\u2019, another part of me felt like you kicked me in the balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Don\u2019t mean that it changes the way it made me feel.\u201d He kissed her forehead and draped her shirt and bra around her neck. \u201cGet dressed. I\u2019ll meet you up at the house.\u201d And he was gone.</p><p>Cash was wrong. Gemma felt like crying all over again.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Macie woke up and didn\u2019t know where she was.</p><p>Seemed like that had happened to her a lot lately. Right. She was such a wild child.</p><p>She sat up and looked around. Ah. She was in Carter\u2019s trailer.</p><p>But where was Carter?</p><p>Out in that run-down barn he called a studio? She called out, \u201cCarter?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>As she stood and stretched, she squinted at the clock. Five thirty? She\u2019d slept for three hours? Dammit. Why hadn\u2019t Carter woken her up?</p><p>Macie remade the bed and noticed nothing else was out of place. No dirty clothes scattered across the carpet. No dog-eared skin magazines stacked on the nightstand. The ceiling fan was even dust-free.</p><p>Talk about being a neat freak.</p><p>She made a pit stop in the bathroom and wandered into the living area. Not the bachelor pad she expected with leather couches, a big screen TV and neon beer signs.</p><p>He\u2019d shoved an ugly green and orange plaid sofa beneath the windows. A brown corduroy recliner sporting several silver patches of duct tape was kitty-corner to the door.</p><p>The pressed wood coffee table didn\u2019t host a pile of remote controls. Or an empty beer can. Or a discarded newspaper. No personal objects covered the scarred surface.</p><p>The temporary feel to the place made her sad. Mostly because it reminded her of every place she\u2019d ever lived.</p><p>As she walked to the kitchen she realized the trailer wasn\u2019t completely devoid of decoration; an entire wall was devoted to pictures. Family pictures.</p><p>In the largest one, eight smiling faces stared back at her. The infamous McKay family. Five men, one girl and a couple who didn\u2019t look old enough to have so many kids. By looking at younger Carter, she realized the picture was several years old. She 93</p><p>scrutinized each person. All of the men were tall, with broad chests and shoulders. Three of the sons resembled their father: dark brown hair, rugged features and indigo eyes.</p><p>Carter and another brother looked more like their mother: curly, lighter hair made up of every shade from red to blond, eyes as blue as the Wyoming sky, and their bone structure ran more to chiseled than rugged. The only girl inherited the best from each of her parents: her father\u2019s dark hair and eyes and her mother\u2019s angular face and blindingly beautiful smile.</p><p>Macie inched closer to scrutinize the dozens of snapshots. A picture of a young Carter and his dad dressed in camouflage, sitting next to a dead buck. A photo of one brother on the back of an enormous bucking bull. Another pic of a man in Army fatigues, squinting into the desert sun. A studio picture of his sister in a formal pink ball gown. A McKay man holding a baby and grinning proudly at the camera. A shot of a two-year-old boy standing beside a Christmas tree wearing brand new cowboy boots and a diaper. A dark-haired brother waving from the seat of a John Deere tractor with jagged mountain peaks towering in the background. Carter wearing a cap and gown sandwiched between his parents. A photo of all five McKay sons mounted on horses.</p><p>There were more. The McKays fishing. The McKays hunting. The McKays working in the garden, the fields, the barn. The McKays kicking up their bootheels at a pig roast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The McKays gathered around a table piled high with food\u2014laughing, smiling, happy.</p><p>Normal pictures of a normal family with fond memories.</p><p>Something like jealousy twisted in Macie\u2019s gut. She didn\u2019t have any pictures like that. She had a few happy memories from her childhood, but no documentation.</p> <p>What would it be like to have that connection? To people? To a single place? To have a history?</p><p>Someone like Carter would never understand that even as she craved that kind of bond, the idea of permanence scared her to death.</p><p>As she studied the second row of pictures, her face burned like she\u2019d peeked into a forbidden window to the subject\u2019s soul. She knew without a doubt Carter had snapped these photos.</p><p>The first one was a close-up of his parents. His mother\u2019s hand rested on his father\u2019s weathered cheek. An intense love was apparent on their faces and they seemed unaware of anything but each other.</p><p>The second photo was of a dark-haired brother, wearing the duds of a rodeo cowboy.</p> <p>He hung on a metal fence watching the action in the arena, a far-away look in his eyes.</p><p>The next one was of the man with the baby, except he was alone, exhaustion lining his face as he threw a hay bale from the bed of a beat-up truck, oblivious to the beautiful pearly orange glow of the sunset behind him. The black and white picture of his sister showed her grinning in pigtail braids, not yet woman, not quite girl, innocence and deviltry mixed with an innate sensuality. The last snapshot was of the brother who was probably the source of the bad McKay reputation, given he had a gorgeous blonde stripper perched on each knee, a big cigar clamped between his teeth and a bottle of Jack Daniels in his hand.</p><p>No other pictures of the soldier. No intimate glimpses into Carter either. She wondered if any members of his family had such introspective pictures of him? Or did he hide behind his art? Use the camera and his sketch pad as a shield? Was there a deeper reason for the distance she glimpsed in him when others were around?</p><p>So what would the pictures he\u2019d taken of her reveal? Would her face, her heart, her soul, be an open book?</p><p>Did he intend to showcase her frailties and failings as part of his art? What would she do if he did? Although Carter claimed to know her, how much did she really know of him? She shoved the paranoid thoughts in the back of her mind.</p><p>Macie exited the trailer. The air was muggy and humid, heavy with the promise of rain. A light mist created banks of fog, hiding the beautiful landscape and the enormous sky. She\u2019d forgotten her shoes, so she picked her way to the barn across the pea-sized gravel, one barefooted step at a time. She stopped when she saw the barn door was ajar and she heard a strange noise from inside.</p> <p>D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.</p><p>Or a repeat of the sexy dream she\u2019d had of a trio of hot cowboys?</p><p>Dammit. The blurry line between reality and fantasy was making her nuts. To ensure she was fully awake, she pinched the inside of her forearm. Hard.</p><p>Damn that hurt. But at least she knew she wasn\u2019t dreaming. Macie took a deep breath and quietly slipped inside.</p><p>Artificial light shone in the main room from a large metal cone-shaped fixture. Soft, twangy music drifted from an unseen boom box. An explosion of art supplies\u2014jars, paints, brushes, jumbo rolls of paper, machinery, long pieces of wood, sticks\u2014covered every available flat surface. Carter might keep his living area immaculate, but his workspace resembled a pigsty. The irony wasn\u2019t lost on her, as the man had set up shop in a barn.</p><p>She allowed her gaze to focus on him. Good God. The man was nearly naked. A ratty cowboy hat on his head was about the extent of his attire. He\u2019d changed out of jeans and wore a stained pair of sweatpants hacked off above the knee. Few men looked better out of clothes than in them, and Carter McKay was one of those lucky men.</p><p>Lucky her. She swallowed the puddle of drool forming in her mouth.</p><p>Carter hadn\u2019t noticed her. He was working an enormous chunk of greenish clay, adding smaller blobs. She couldn\u2019t see his face, but she could hear him singing along with the radio. She smiled. Who would\u2019ve thought he could carry a tune? Keith Urban had nothing to worry about, but Velma might have a new contender for the open mic contest next Friday night.</p> <p>Macie was strangely content just to watch Carter, fascinated by his controlled body movements. The muscles in his shoulders bunched as he lifted his arms. As he pushed and pulled the clay, corded muscles popped up on his forearms. A thin line of sweat trickled down his spine and disappeared into his low-slung sweatpants. She wished she could see his hands. Those long, clever fingers smoothing and shaping, plunging deep.</p><p>Outside the mist morphed into a steady, soft rainfall. The clean scent of rain wafted through the open door, but did nothing to cool her off. Seemed nothing could make her take her eyes off him, either.</p><p>She\u2019d thought Carter was sexy when they\u2019d first met, but it was nothing compared to the way she felt when she looked at him now. Despite his overwhelming intensity, he was sweet and thoughtful and had a body made for pure sin. She wanted him. Wanted his clay-covered hands on her. Molding her breasts. Leaving a muddy trail down her belly.</p><p>Leaving moon-shaped clay marks from his fingernails digging into her hips. Seeing his big handprints on the inside of her thighs.</p><p>Tasting clay and passion on his lips. Scraping her nails down his sweat-coated back.</p><p>Clutching his ass. Watching lust fire in his eyes as he took everything she offered him.</p><p>Right then she knew she wouldn\u2019t deny him a damn thing.</p><p>Thunder cracked outside.</p><p>Macie gasped at the intrusion of reality into her little fantasy world.</p><p>Carter spun to glare at her. \u201cJesus, Macie, what are you doin\u2019 in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I woke up a little while ago\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you just snuck in to spy on me in my private studio?\u201d</p><p>His angry look doused her steamy thoughts. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what the hell\u2014\u201d He paced toward her, then back. \u201cFuck.\u201d Angrily he wiped his hands on a towel. \u201cNever mind. My own damn fault. Shoulda put a lock on that goddamn door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>The gentle rain changed to a torrential downpour. More thunder boomed. The wind howled and the door smacked shut.</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s okay. Hang on. Just let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>The last thing she saw before she fled was Carter flinging a sheet over the globs of clay and mysterious shape on the table.</p><p>Macie couldn\u2019t blame the way she trembled solely on the change in the weather. The change in Carter had a lot to do with it.</p><p>Stupid girl. Stupid to hope he\u2019d be different. When would she learn nothing ever changed for her when it came to her relationships with men?</p><p>Water splashed up to her ankles, as she couldn\u2019t avoid mud puddles. Had she left her keys in her car?</p><p>He\u2019d glared at her like a disobedient child.</p><p>A sharp rock tore at the skin on the bottom of her foot and she stumbled. She righted herself and kept limping along in the downpour. Why in the hell had she parked so far away?</p><p>Maybe it was a cosmic sign she should drive far away and never look back. Good plan.</p><p>\u201cMacie!\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t look back. He\u2019ll convince you to stay\u2014only temporarily\u2014and you need to keep running.</p><p>She\u2019d counted to ten when a hand landed on her shoulder and jerked her to a stop.</p><p>A BOOM of thunder nearly burst her eardrums.</p><p>She screamed.</p><p>Strong male arms wrapped her against a warm bare chest. \u201cHey. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Let me go.\u201d Being wet and mad made it easy for her to slither out of his grasp.</p><p>Her hair hung in her eyes, obscuring her vision, her dress was sopping wet and stuck to her calves like plastic wrap.</p><p>Still, Macie ran.</p><p>Until two steel bands immobilized her completely. She\u2019d only taken three steps that time.</p><p>\u201cMacie. Calm down.\u201d</p><p>She thrashed and shrieked.</p><p>He put his mouth directly on her ear. \u201cIt\u2019s me. Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who you are, dumbass, why do you think I\u2019m trying to get away?\u201d</p><p>Carter spun her to face him, keeping his hands gripping her upper arms. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t let me go. You\u2019re keeping me here against my will. I just want to go home.\u201d</p><p>The clouds rumbled and she went absolutely still.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re soakin\u2019 wet, scared out of your mind and in no shape to drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You need to take a deep breath and calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do!\u201d</p><p>The threat of thunder gave way to another loud boom and before the noise quit, Macie screamed again.</p><p>Carter cupped her face in his hands. \u201cLook at me. Jesus, Macie, you\u2019re scarin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re pissing me off. Let. Me. Go!\u201d She knocked his hands away, dodged sideways and ran.</p><p>This time she made it about ten steps when she heard\u2014 Riiiippppp. Carter had caught her by the back of her dress.</p><p>She whirled around, leading with her fists, losing her footing as she yelled, \u201cYou bastard.\u201d</p><p>He lunged for her as she slipped in the mud and they both fell to the soggy earth.</p><p>She scrambled to her hands and knees and tried to crawl away from him.</p><p>He snagged her ankle, rolled her on her back and pinned her to the ground.</p><p>Macie thrashed and bucked like a penned wild animal. She was scared by the storm, mad at Carter for treating her as callously as every other man in her life, but mostly mad at herself for acting like a child in the face of a thunderstorm. Again. Breathing hard, she closed her eyes and managed not to scream at another deafening roar of thunder.</p><p>Carter locked her wrists in one of his hands and pressed them above her head, while his hard body trapped hers.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Macie. Let me help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll help me if you let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this to me. First you snap\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled at you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She squirmed.</p><p>\u201cAnd now seein\u2019 you so upset, knowin\u2019 it\u2019s my fault.

She lost her will to fight when she witnessed the misery on his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an asshole sometimes.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019d never do anything to intentionally hurt you.

But I\u2019m so used to keepin\u2019 people away from my work until it\u2019s finished. I force everyone away from me when I\u2019m workin\u2019 because I\u2019m not always nice. When I saw you standin\u2019 there, starin\u2019 at my piece of shit work in progress... But it ain\u2019t your fault. Sorry I lashed out at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t staring at what you were working on, I was staring at you.\u201d Crap. That hadn\u2019t come out right. \u201cWhat I meant was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see in your eyes exactly what you meant.\u201d</p><p>The gray clouds above them clashed like cymbals. Before she had a chance to scream, Carter slanted his mouth over hers and kissed her.</p><p>And kissed her.</p><p>And kissed her some more, until he\u2019d thoroughly scrambled her brain to anything beyond the way he tasted and the sexy sounds he made as his mouth dominated hers.</p><p>\u201cMacie,\u201d he mumbled against her damp cheek. \u201cGod, Macie. Let me have you. All of you.\u201d He released her wrists and levered himself over her, trailing his lips down her throat. When he reached her chest, he yanked the stretchy bodice of her dress aside and his warm mouth engulfed her breast.</p><p>\u201cOh. Man. No fair,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Carter rolled to his side, taking her with him. Mud splattered his face. He flicked his tongue over the tip of her nipple while his other hand kneaded her left breast. \u201cGoddamn you\u2019re perfect. Just like I knew you\u2019d be.\u201d His gaze hooked hers. He vigorously sucked her left nipple through the wet fabric until she couldn\u2019t lie still but wiggled like a worm.</p> <p>\u201cCarter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you like this. Right now. Wet. Raw. Dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Oh. Yes.\u201d</p><p>He returned to her mouth, kissing her stupid. She felt him sliding her sodden, mud-caked dress up her trembling thighs. When it was bunched around her waist, he knelt between her legs. He pulled aside her thong and fingered her where she was slick.</p><p>\u201cLift up.\u201d He tapped her butt. In the split second she raised her hips, he grabbed her thighs to slide her closer to his torso and draped her knees over his shoulders.</p><p>Carter raised her ass high in his hands at an angle as he buried his face in her pussy.</p><p>\u201cOmigod.\u201d The only parts of her still touching the ground were her shoulder blades and the back of her head.</p><p>\u201cHold still. Jesus, let me have more than a taste before I drop you.\u201d He licked up her slit. Alternating the flat of his tongue with just the flickering tip. Then he fastened his mouth to her clit and began to suck. When her whole body shook, he slapped her ass and growled, \u201cHold still, goddammit. I\u2019ve been dyin\u2019 to get my mouth on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your mouth is so hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m already so close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Next time I\u2019ll make you wait. I might even tie you up and make you beg.</p><p>Lord, you are so warm and sweet...\u201d He suckled her pussy lips and scraped his teeth over her clit.</p><p>She gasped. \u201cOh. You\u2019re good at that.\u201d</p><p>He grunted but didn\u2019t stop licking. Sucking. Driving her to the brink of insanity.</p><p>Rain poured down on them. She\u2019d probably feel cold if her body wasn\u2019t on fire.</p><p>Heck, she was so hot her clothes were steaming.</p><p>The sky rumbled a warning.</p><p>For the first time in several minutes Macie realized they were out in the open in the thick of a thunder and rainstorm.</p><p>Carter sensed the moment she froze up. \u201cLook at me, not the sky. Think about how crazy it\u2019s makin\u2019 me to taste you. Think about how hard I\u2019m gonna fuck you right after you come all over my face. It\u2019s right there, darlin\u2019, take it.\u201d He did some different nibbling thing on her clit that made her hips buck like she was riding a wild bronc.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move his mouth when he growled at her, and the buzzing sensation of his lips on her clit set her off.</p><p>\u201cOh. Like that. Don\u2019t stop. Please. Yes!\u201d She screamed as the orgasm hit, as thunder exploded above her, reverberated inside her and she felt as if a thousand bolts of lightning struck her body.</p><p>Carter didn\u2019t remove his lips or his tongue or his hands from her throbbing sex until she twitched one last time. Her legs became boneless and slipped from his shoulders.</p><p>Hot, open-mouthed kisses seared the cool skin on her thighs, rousing her. Making her arch into his body and he kissed his way to her throat.</p><p>\u201cMacie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Carter. More. All. Give me all of you.\u201d</p><p>His breath tickled her ear. \u201cShit. I don\u2019t have a condom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInside.\u201d</p><p>Macie rolled and stood. She grabbed his hand and tugged until he was on his feet.</p><p>\u201cHurry. What the hell are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Carter stared at Macie, his eyes eating up the frantic, sexy look on her face as the little spitfire attempted to drag all two hundred pounds of him through the mud.</p><p>So she could fuck him.</p><p>Senseless.</p><p>Mindless.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>She\u2019d already blown his mind.</p><p>He grinned, hefted Macie over his shoulder amidst her surprised shrieks and raced to the trailer, his bare feet skidding through the muck.</p><p>Once he had the door open, he set her down and clamped his mouth over hers.</p><p>Ripping off the tattered, muddy remains of her flimsy cotton dress, he pushed her back toward his bed.</p><p>Then she was naked. She untied the drawstring on his sweatpants and then he was naked. He groaned and filled his hands with her tits. Her ass. Her hips. He pulled her hair back so he could ravage her throat without obstruction.</p><p>\u201cCondom,\u201d she said hoarsely.</p><p>Carter bit her shoulder, then followed a wayward rivulet of water between her breasts with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cCarter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Damn, you taste good everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need a condom.\u201d</p><p>His fingertip traced the upper swell of her breast, as he watched, transfixed by the color of her skin tone. \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty here. Delicate, but sexy. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m talented enough that will come through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre the condoms in the bathroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His dick stayed stuck against his belly and he grunted with pain as he bent forward and placed his mouth against the hollow of her throat. \u201cI want to kiss every spot where I can see your pulse poundin\u2019. I know where my favorite spot to feel throbbing against my tongue is.\u201d</p><p>Macie grabbed his hair and yanked his head back to meet the fire flashing in her eyes. \u201cFind. A. Condom. Right. Now.\u201d</p><p>Carter rubbed his cheek over her mouth to hide his laugh. He kissed her. Very softly.</p><p>Very sweetly. He kissed her mostly to hear her frustrated groan rumbling over his lips because she wanted more.</p><p>Without warning, he intensified the kiss, heating her up so she squirmed and rubbed her mound over his thigh. He sucked on her tongue, then sank his teeth into her full bottom lip. When she gasped at the hint of pain, he licked the warm, wet cavern of her mouth like he\u2019d licked her pussy. Grinding his cock into the cradle of her thighs, he reached for the unopened box of condoms on the dresser and tore the plastic packaging off with shaking fingers.</p><p>She broke away to drag kisses down his chest. \u201cYou have the most lickable pecs and abs and you haven\u2019t let me touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo whatever you want. You don\u2019t even hafta ask.\u201d</p><p>He hissed when the very tip of her tongue lapped circles around his nipple. His cock jerked, reminding him of the box he was crushing in his hand. Damn factories, over packaging everything. He used his teeth to rip the seal on the cardboard box and had extracted a single foil-wrapped condom, when a hot, wet hungry mouth enclosed his dick.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Macie, give me a heart attack why doncha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me\u2014\u201d she sucked him deep and didn\u2019t release him until he yelped,</p><p>\u201c\u2014to stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Yes. Jesus, woman, wait!\u201d Carter lifted her off her knees and gently tossed her on the bed.</p><p>He already had the condom on as he settled between her legs. He spread her thighs wide to watch the alignment of his cock and he slammed to the root on the first push.</p><p>She bowed and gasped his name.</p><p>Carter closed his eyes briefly to savor being buried in his sweet, sexy, fierce Macie.</p><p>His body urged him on\u2014hell, he wanted to fuck her raw. But they\u2019d only have one first time, and he wouldn\u2019t blow it for either of them because of sexual greed\u2014hers or his.</p><p>\u201cCarter?\u201d</p><p>He let his body shadow hers as he looked into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay? You stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect. You\u2019re beautiful.\u201d He brushed his lips across her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re my beautiful, perfect muse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I don\u2019t need sweet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it ain\u2019t gonna be sweet. Give me your hands.\u201d</p><p>Macie smoothed her palms down his arms to his wrists. He threaded their fingers together and slid their joined hands up above her head.</p><p>Her breath caught as she bore his full weight and he pressed her deeper into the mattress.</p><p>Carter kissed her, grinding his pelvis side to side over her clit, feeling cocky about the way her pussy muscles clenched to keep his hardened sex inside her. Then he released her hands and curled her fingers around the metal bars on the headboard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He whispered, \u201cHang on, darlin\u2019,\u201d and pulled completely out and plunged back in to the hilt.</p><p>Carter fucked her hard. Too hard to kiss her. Too hard for this turbulent mating to last very long.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t seem to mind. Her sexy whimpering moans filled his ears. He told her how good she felt. Wet. Tight. How many different ways he planned to fuck her. He\u2019d never been good at dirty talk in bed but it drove her crazy.</p><p>She arched off the bed, clamped her hands on his ass and cried out as she came again. Sending him right along behind her.</p><p>He pumped harder. Deeper. He wanted to rip off the condom and feel her slick walls bathed in his come. He wanted to watch his seed dripping down her leg, knowing he\u2019d put it there.</p><p>He\u2019d never felt so...possessive.</p><p>Carter groaned when the pulsing in his cock didn\u2019t stop. It\u2019d been a long time since he\u2019d had sex, but no sex had ever been like this.</p><p>He came so goddamn hard he swore a blood vessel burst in his brain. He came so goddamn hard he swore he actually came twice. He collapsed on her. Not lightly either.</p><p>Macie sighed.</p><p>Neither one made an attempt to move and break their connection.</p><p>Thunder cracked outside the trailer and Macie didn\u2019t freeze up.</p><p>He smiled against her temple. Looks like he had figured out a cure for her fear of thunderstorms after all.</p><p>Carter pushed up on his elbows to kiss her. He couldn\u2019t get enough of the feel of her mouth welcoming his. He flustered her with the lazy, sweet kiss. He whispered,</p><p>\u201cAmazin\u2019 Macie. I had no idea how true that was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter. You\u2019re squishing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t exactly a featherweight and you are a little slip of a thing.\u201d He pulled out and rolled to his side. He reached for a box of tissues and got rid of the condom. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I snapped at you, but that\u2019s sort of a lie because it did lead to you endin\u2019 up tangled in my sheets. I\u2019m damn glad you\u2019re in my bed.\u201d</p><p>Macie smiled. \u201cMud and all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMud and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo regrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that I hurt your feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made up for it with hot sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, really?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut with you I\u2019d even take lukewarm sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot. I\u2019d settle for cool sex. Yeah. Lots of cool, kinky sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I meant, Macie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this isn\u2019t just about sex?\u201d</p><p>Not on your life, kitten. Carter flopped back on a pillow and strove to keep things light. \u201cFine. It ain\u2019t all about sex. If you insist, I\u2019ll let you cook and clean for me. All summer. Whenever the urge strikes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll strike you, you jackass.\u201d She pounced on him and held a pillow over his face.</p><p>He tore the pillow away and kissed her until she couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cNo fair,\u201d she panted. \u201cYour kisses distract me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll\u2019s fair, since just lookin\u2019 at you distracts me, my sweet darlin\u2019.\u201d He dragged his fingers up and down her spine and she practically purred. \u201cStay with me tonight, Macie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Or won\u2019t? Disappointed, he said, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not cooking for you either. However, I will let you wash my back in the shower.\u201d She yawned. \u201cLater. When I\u2019m not so tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>After a minute he said, \u201cHey. The rain stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh. Stop yapping. I\u2019m trying to sleep so I can get to those wickedly explicit dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of dreams? Am I in them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of? What the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re one of the sexy cowboys in my dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of? As in plural?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Block it out. Ah hell. He couldn\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose in your wicked dreams you and these sexy cowboys are just sittin\u2019 around playin\u2019 pinochle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose we are.\u201d</p><p>Carter paused and twirled a section of her hair around his index finger. \u201cSometime will you tell me what you are doin\u2019 with these cowboys in your dreams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather show you. But we\u2019d need a third player in our game...of pinochle. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve got a hot guy friend who\u2019s up for a rodeo?\u201d</p><p>Hell yeah, his buddy Jack would totally be up for that. \u201cLord, you\u2019re killin\u2019 me, woman, teasin\u2019 me \u2019bout your fantasies. You are gonna share those details, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I\u2019m too tired to do the fantasy justice right now. Maybe we can act out some of the...more challenging parts later. I vaguely remember a scene with ropes.\u201d</p><p>An image of a sexy, saucy Macie naked, at his mercy, blindfolded, tied up spread-eagled on his bed, every red-gold inch exposed and bound for his pleasure alone...yeah, his dick stirred with interest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remind you as a ranch kid I\u2019m wicked good with ropes.\u201d He squeezed her ass.</p><p>\u201cYou already know I\u2019m good with my hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThinking about your talented hands isn\u2019t lulling me to sleep, Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m countin\u2019 on.\u201d</p><p>Macie tried to scoot away from him.</p><p>He laughed and nestled her against his body again. \u201cI\u2019ll behave. For now. Sweet dreams, sweet darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>After a while she murmured, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m forgetting something important I\u2019m supposed to be doing.\u201d</p><p>You are doing it, Carter thought. Rather than answer her, he kissed the top of her head and drifted away.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Cash sipped his beer and stared out across the field beyond the barn. The rain had quit a few hours ago. The gloomy gray clouds cleared and the pink rays of the setting sun reflected on the tan grasses as a golden orange. It would\u2019ve been a perfect evening for a horseback ride.</p><p>Except Macie hadn\u2019t shown up.</p><p>Was it intentional on her part? He\u2019d disappointed her so many times that she\u2019d decided to give him a taste of his own medicine? It was no less than what he deserved.</p><p>Yet, it seemed out of character for her. Macie had always been forthright even when she was a little girl. If she\u2019d changed her mind, she would\u2019ve come right out and told him.</p><p>Would it feel worse if she\u2019d just plain forgotten about their plans? No. The worst thing would be if Macie had blown him off because she\u2019d gotten a better offer.</p><p>From that damn Carter McKay.</p><p>He\u2019d felt so guilty last night after he and Gemma hit the road, when he realized not only had he left Macie alone in a strange place, he hadn\u2019t even asked her if she\u2019d wanted to ride along with them to Beulah. Then, when he\u2019d heard about the nasty storms rolling across Wyoming, it\u2019d made him stir-crazy not being able to reach her, especially after calling her for hours.</p><p>So he had to sit in a motel room twiddling his thumbs, wondering if his daughter was all right, letting that goddamn guilt gnaw through him. Keeping Gemma at arm\u2019s length so she wouldn\u2019t see how badly he\u2019d fucked up again.</p><p>It should\u2019ve pleased him to learn that Carter McKay had the wherewithal to check on Macie. Instead, it burned his ass. Oh, not because he\u2019d found Carter in his daughter\u2019s bed early this morning, but because he should\u2019ve been there for her, her father, not some heart breakin\u2019 wild goddamn cowboy.</p><p>Yeah. He was some great man. He could drown in the sea of regret of all the things he hadn\u2019t done for his daughter. Hell, he\u2019d been trying, bobbing along, swimming, mostly sinking, in that cesspool of remorse for a dozen years. He\u2019d spent a few years shame-faced and shit-faced. Compacting his bad behavior with bad decisions. He\u2019d spent a few more years wallowing in sex with any woman who\u2019d crossed his path. All the while he cursed his bad luck and Macie\u2019s mother. Blaming everyone but himself for his lack of parenting skills.</p><p>He\u2019d finally wised up.</p><p>Cash supposed it\u2019d make a more interesting story if he credited the change in himself to a vision, or because he\u2019d received ancient wise words from a Lakota holy man. But the truth was, when Macie turned sixteen\u2014the same age he was when he\u2019d fathered her, the same age his father had been when he\u2019d fathered him\u2014he realized not only wasn\u2019t he ready to be a grandfather, he\u2019d never learned how to be a father.</p><p>That was just plain fucking sad. At that point, Cash knew he had to change and be the one to break the ugly cycle.</p><p>Luckily, Macie had her head screwed on straight, no thanks to him. She was a bright, kind, sweet, funny, beautiful young woman.</p><p>A young woman. He couldn\u2019t help but think of her as a child. Cash took another swallow of beer. Was it because he hadn\u2019t been around during her childhood and he\u2019d always see her as kid? Or did all parents see their offspring that way? Macie was mature and wise in so many ways...yet in others...she seemed so damn young.</p><p>So were you.</p><p>At her age, he\u2019d had a six-year-old child, not a six-year-old car. The autumn Cash turned twenty-two, he\u2019d won his first championship gold buckle and his first big payout.</p><p>That same fall, Macie would\u2019ve entered first grade. He didn\u2019t even know the name of her elementary school. Or where she\u2019d lived. A brief memory of her sweet face and big brown eyes flashed in his mind. Had she cried and gripped her mother\u2019s hand? Did she think of him and wonder for the millionth time why her daddy wasn\u2019t around?</p><p>God. How did he ask Macie any of this shit without sounding like a dolt? Without reminding her of all he\u2019d never been to her?</p><p>Would they ever figure out this father/daughter relationship? When it appeared they\u2019d both find excuses to let it remain the same fucked up way it\u2019d been for years?</p><p>\u201cCash?\u201d</p><p>He jumped at the sound of Gemma\u2019s voice behind him.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not.

I checked.\u201d He set aside the empty bottle and sighed. \u201cGo ahead and remind me she\u2019s an adult.\u201d</p><p>Gemma didn\u2019t say a word.</p> <p>The sweet, low tones of mourning doves rose and fell in the early twilight. A bull roared in the north pasture. The humid air seemed to amplify the normal sounds and every breath he sucked into his lungs was heavy. Oppressive.</p><p>Cash took off his cowboy hat and hung it on the metal railing so he could rub the knot at the base of his skull.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a headache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably from tension. Want me to rub your neck?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I like touching you, Cash. It doesn\u2019t always have to lead to the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Gemma\u2019s sweetness soothed him somewhat.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Scoot down on the next step and lean back.\u201d Once she\u2019d settled him between her thighs, she asked, \u201cCan I unbraid your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could claim a too-tight braid as the source of your headache, but the truth is, I\u2019ve been dying to get it loose so I can run my hands through it. Been afraid to ask you if I could.\u201d</p><p>Cash looked at her over his shoulder. \u201cWhy? Do I scare you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this about what happened in the barn?\u201d</p> <p>Her cheeks flushed and she dropped her gaze. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a real convincin\u2019 no, Gem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I like everything you do to me. But that\u2019s why...oh, never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want equal time to do things to you.\u201d</p><p>That was all? He relaxed. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m listenin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far this relationship has been pretty one-sided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been two days, Gemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Seems longer, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Cash didn\u2019t know how to take that comment so he let it go.</p><p>Gemma loosened his hair and massaged his scalp, derailing his train of thought. He groaned with appreciation at her magic touch.</p><p>She dug her thumbs into the base of his neck.</p><p>\u201cGod that feels good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other things I can do to you that will feel this good. Or better.\u201d</p><p>His cock perked up. \u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, I don\u2019t wanna give you a play-by-play, Cash. I\u2019m more of a doer than a talker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat a fact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotta remind you of a fact, sweets. You agreed to let me be in charge when it comes to sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think that meant all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers quit kneading.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Cash faced her. \u201cIf you ain\u2019t enjoyin\u2019 bein\u2019 with me, just say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? That\u2019s not what this is about. You\u2019re just like Steve, taking everything so personal to the point we can\u2019t talk about it.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other. It was the first time she\u2019d brought up her husband\u2019s name in front of him. It didn\u2019t feel as awkward as he imagined it would. Maybe it was a good reminder to him that they both had a past.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you oughta explain that comment.\u201d</p><p>A gust of wind caught Cash\u2019s unbound hair and it lashed Gemma in the face. Before he could yank it back into a ponytail, she grabbed a handful and pulled him close. \u201cLet me take the lead once in awhile. That don\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing anything wrong, it just lets me be on the giving end. Much as I like being on the receiving end, sometimes I just need to know you don\u2019t mind when I\u2019m aggressive and I don\u2019t want to wait for you to take charge.\u201d</p><p>Cash watched her eyes. She had no idea how much her confession meant to him. He hadn\u2019t been kidding when he\u2019d warned her of his savage appetites, or of his secret taste for a little kink. So, not only hadn\u2019t he scared her off, she was letting him know she might even go him one better.</p><p>He whispered, \u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>Gemma slammed her lips to his. After ravaging his mouth, she jerked his head back by the hair and sank her teeth into the skin above his collarbone.</p><p>And sucked like a vampire. He knew she\u2019d left a mark and he didn\u2019t give a damn.</p><p>Her show of force made his dick hard even when it softened his heart.</p><p>She licked the stinging spot. \u201cI like to bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind when my cock is near those sharp teeth.\u201d</p><p>Gemma laughed softly. \u201cLet me finish your neck rub. No teeth, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Cash relaxed into her once again.</p><p>\u201cTell me about Macie\u2019s mom. And how Macie came to be.\u201d When he stiffened, she chided, \u201cYou had to expect I\u2019d ask sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019d think I\u2019d be used to it by now.\u201d</p><p>He wished he had another beer. \u201cMacie\u2019s mom, Jorgen Honeycutt, came to Pine Ridge on some kind of mission trip one summer. She embodied a gypsy, which appealed to a kid like me, bein\u2019s I was stuck on the rez. Probably for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixteen. I lied and told her I was eighteen. When she mentioned she\u2019d just graduated, I figured her to be twenty-two. Later, I found out she\u2019d meant from grad school, which made her twenty-six.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna lie. Jorgen was blonde, beautiful, rich, sexy and I talked my way into her bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet in your teens you were one of those cocky, slow-eyed, good-lookin\u2019 Indian cowboys, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Me and Jorgen had nothin\u2019 in common. She wanted to be with a \u2018real\u2019 Indian cowboy. We screwed around that summer and I knocked her up. Wasn\u2019t a doubt the kid was mine as we were together all the time. She wouldn\u2019t consider an abortion.\u201d Cash still winced when he thought about how hard he\u2019d argued for that option.</p><p>Gemma kissed the top of his head. \u201cSucks that sometimes those things from the past can still hurt us even when we didn\u2019t make that choice.\u201d</p><p>Soothed by her again, he continued. \u201cJorgen had some family money, and wanderingfeet so she took off. Called me six months later to tell me I was a father. I didn\u2019t see Macie for the first time until she was two.</p><p>\u201cI was such a bastard, Gem. I didn\u2019t care. Thought I\u2019d skated by easy \u2019cause I didn\u2019t have to pay child support. Jorgen would call me, drunk usually, and tell me about my child. I dreaded those damn phone calls.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t interested in bein\u2019 a father until my friends started havin\u2019 kids. I suppose Macie was about eight when I began to see her once a year. We had fun together, but it wasn\u2019t any kind of relationship. Mostly because Jorgen made sure she had all the control.</p><p>She\u2019d decide when I could talk to Macie. Or see her. They moved all over the damn place so I had no choice. I never knew where they were, which drove me nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like your lack of a relationship with your daughter is entirely your fault, Cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not. I don\u2019t remember how it happened, but the year Macie turned twelve she called me. We talked for hours. I realized I wanted to get to know my child so I asked Jorgen if Macie could spend the summer with me on the rez.\u201d</p><p>Gemma gently worked his left shoulder muscle in silence.</p><p>\u201cJorgen refused. I was travelin\u2019 the rodeo circuit so it was easier for me to get to wherever Macie was. I went hundreds of miles out of my way to see my girl whenever I could.\u201d</p><p>Cash took a break, not sure if he was doing the right thing telling Gemma all this nasty shit about himself.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Macie like her mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn some ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I suspect she\u2019s got itchy feet. Macie doesn\u2019t seem inclined to put down roots anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she gets that from you. You\u2019ve traveled around plenty yourself, Cash.\u201d</p><p>He grunted.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe she doesn\u2019t know how to settle down because no one has shown her,\u201d</p><p>Gemma offered.</p><p>\u201cTrue. But it ain\u2019t like she\u2019s gonna learn it from me. I should be happy that she\u2019s like Jorgen in that material things don\u2019t mean nothin\u2019 to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said Jorgen was rich.\u201d</p><p>Cash laughed without humor. \u201cEvery white person seems rich to a rez kid who\u2019s livin\u2019 ten or twelve to a house and dependin\u2019 on government commodities to eat. She had enough money to get by, and that\u2019s more than I ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t tell me what Jorgen was like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds stupid, but Jorgen was the type who collected life experiences and checked them off her life list and moved on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a list of things she wanted to accomplish. Live in Europe. Check. Get a graduate degree. Check. Live on the rez with indigenous people. Check. Have a child.</p><p>Check. Live in the desert. Check. Live in the mountains. Check. Live by the ocean.</p><p>Check. Work in a cowboy bar. Check. Work in a casino. Check. Work on a cruise ship.</p><p>Check. She went where she wanted to go, did what she wanted to do and didn\u2019t care about anybody else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncluding Macie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect that\u2019s the case. Macie doesn\u2019t wanna talk about her childhood too much. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s to spare my feelin\u2019s \u2019cause I wasn\u2019t around or because they ain\u2019t the best memories for her.\u201d Thinking about poor little Macie fending for herself made his gut clench and his heart hurt. \u201cI know Jorgen loved Macie, as much as Jorgen could love anyone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you love Jorgen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, you were so young when all that happened. I\u2019m surprised you never married and had more kids.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter the shit I\u2019ve told you, you think I\u2019d subject a kid to havin\u2019 me as a father?\u201d Or a woman who\u2019d want me as a husband. He didn\u2019t say it, he just shifted his weight on the hard cement. \u201cWhat about you and Steve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never had kids. On purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would\u2019ve welcomed a baby. Just didn\u2019t happen. And Steve was old-fashioned.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want fertility tests to figure out the problem. Nor did he warm to the idea of adoption. I know some folks look at me with pity because I\u2019m childless. But you can\u2019t miss what you\u2019ve never had.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue. What would you do if you ended up pregnant now?\u201d</p><p>Gemma choked. \u201cWhat? Lord, Cash, I\u2019m forty-eight\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t been through menopause yet, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Have the symptoms, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t matter. My unci had her last baby when she was fifty-one. She thought it was menopause. So, I guess that means we\u2019d better make sure we\u2019re usin\u2019 condoms, much as I hate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate it too but I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d</p> <p>Darkness had fallen. The yard light clicked on. Pretty soon bugs would be out in full force. Cash was tired of talking. Spilling his guts hadn\u2019t alleviated the ache in his heart or his head. Gemma seemed to sense his mood change.</p><p>She smoothed his hair away from his face. \u201cHow\u2019s your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to keep going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Thanks for the offer though. I think I might just pop a couple aspirin and crawl in bed.\u201d He stood and grabbed his empty beer bottle. \u201cProbably be best if I slept in the guest bedroom tonight so I don\u2019t disturb you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not necessary\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night, Gem.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look back. He couldn\u2019t take her look of pity.</p> <p>And he knew she wasn\u2019t ready to see what he couldn\u2019t hide in his eyes.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Headlights swept the windows above the sink. Water splashed in the mud puddles and the red taillights disappeared.</p><p>Macie was back.</p><p>Gemma didn\u2019t move from the kitchen table where she\u2019d been working on the ranch books. She glanced at the clock. Cash had been in bed for two hours. She\u2019d resisted checking on him, more worried she\u2019d find him awake and avoiding her than sleeping off his headache.</p><p>Things had taken a strange turn today. Not only because he\u2019d fucked her senseless in the barn, but because he\u2019d opened up to her. She suspected he was filled with regret about showing her that tender side of himself and the guilt he carried.</p><p>Did Macie know? Did she care?</p><p>How did Gemma reconcile wanting to be with Cash outside of the workday, when she knew he felt guilty that he wasn\u2019t spending that time with his daughter?</p><p>She jumped at the four solid knocks on the glass window of the screen door. She said, \u201cCome in,\u201d and Macie slipped inside and hesitated by the wall.</p><p>\u201cHey, Gemma. How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She glanced at the doorway to the living room. \u201cUmm. Is my dad around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But he had a bad headache and he\u2019s in bed.\u201d</p><p>Macie\u2019s eyes filled with concern. \u201cIs he all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d Gemma expected Macie to say a quick goodbye and disappear back to the camper. It surprised her when Macie pulled out a chair and plopped down.</p><p>\u201cIs he mad at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he be mad at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he and I were supposed to go horseback riding tonight. I fell asleep at Carter\u2019s. When I woke up it was already dark.\u201d</p><p>Ah. No wonder Cash acted so melancholy. \u201cHe didn\u2019t act like he was mad. Maybe a little disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap. I never meant...I just lost track of time.\u201d Macie sighed. \u201cStory of my life.</p><p>Story of our life actually. Seems like our plans are always interrupted.\u201d</p><p>Macie left her as good an opening as any to broach the subject. \u201cDoes it bother you that your dad is here working for me rather than hitting the backroads with you? That was your plan, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019d never put any stock into it beyond getting to hang out with him. We talk on the phone at least once a week, but it\u2019s not the same. It\u2019s been a rough year for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRealizing he\u2019s too old to rodeo fulltime. Having to take shit jobs just to make ends meet.\u201d She shot Gemma a sheepish look. \u201cNo offense intended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken.\u201d Gemma sipped her cold coffee. \u201cWhat about you? Are you taking a shit job just to hang out here?\u201d</p><p>Macie grinned. \u201cNo. I was thrilled to find work in a restaurant. Mucking out stalls would be my idea of a shit job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou working a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see. I think Velma is testing me. Or punishing me. I\u2019m waitressing some. I\u2019d rather be in the kitchen.\u201d She pointed to Gemma\u2019s cup. \u201cGot any more coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the pot.\u201d</p><p>She stood. \u201cYou want a reheat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Gemma watched while Macie made herself completely at home. It was weird to think this beautiful young woman was Cash\u2019s daughter. It was probably equally weird for Macie to sit down with her father\u2019s boss.</p><p>And her father\u2019s lover.</p><p>Yeah. They weren\u2019t ready to go there yet.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re doing some modeling for Carter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. He\u2019s been pretty mum on what it\u2019ll turn out like.\u201d</p><p>Gemma frowned at Macie\u2019s baggy black sweats. \u201cThose seem a little informal for the kind of art Carter does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say there was an incident with my clothes today, and Carter lent me these.\u201d Casually, Macie said, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool you\u2019re letting Carter live here this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt works, since he\u2019s willing to help me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince he was about ten. Technically, that\u2019s how long I\u2019ve known the whole McKay clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s his family like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis folks are nice. His brothers are sweet-talkin\u2019 hell raisers. The youngest, his sister Keely? She\u2019s hell on horseback. They\u2019re a close bunch. All the boys except for Cam live around the McKay ranch.\u201d She blew on her coffee and looked at Macie.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust curious. Dad doesn\u2019t seem to have a high opinion of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does. He just don\u2019t like the fact Carter is sniffin\u2019 around you.\u201d</p><p>When Macie didn\u2019t respond, Gemma said, \u201cYou thought of how to break it to your dad you\u2019re doin\u2019 more than posin\u2019 for Carter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But wearing Carter\u2019s clothes and the love bites on your neck might tip him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap.\u201d</p><p>Gemma waited and hid a smile behind her cup.</p><p>\u201cI know I just met him, but he\u2019s so...intense. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s feeding me lines about his art or what. And I sure don\u2019t want my dad to say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014I told you so?\u201d Gemma supplied.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want Dad to think I\u2019m a fool. Especially when I\u2019ve yet to see a single thing Carter has drawn or painted or sculpted or whatever he does with clay. And I\u2019m not just talking about when he\u2019s supposedly using me as a subject. Wouldn\u2019t you think he\u2019d have something that he made where he lives?\u201d</p><p>Gemma set down her cup and stood. \u201cFollow me. I want to show you something.\u201d In the living room she unhooked an 8 X 10 frame from the wall next to the china cabinet and passed it to Macie. \u201cCarter drew that for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly cow. It\u2019s beautiful. This was your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She let her gaze skim over the pencil and charcoal portrait of Steve. \u201cCarter gave that to me about a year after Steve died. Somehow he managed to capture not only Steve\u2019s personality, but his soul.\u201d</p><p>After a solid minute passed, Macie slowly raised her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of, Gemma. That he\u2019ll see too much.\u201d</p><p>Gemma\u2019s heart lurched. Macie was so like Cash in so many ways. \u201cI wish I knew what to say to that, Macie, but I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Thanks for not spewing a buncha bullshit. I\u2019d rather have the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>Once they were back in the kitchen, Macie glanced at the papers strewn across the table and said, \u201cIt\u2019s late. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t. Honestly? I was glad for the company. You do know you\u2019re welcome here\u2014both in the house and on the ranch. If I hadn\u2019t made that clear, I meant to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I should go.\u201d Macie stopped and turned around. \u201cIf my dad wakes up will you tell him I was here and I\u2019ll see him tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night, Gemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night.\u201d</p><p>Gemma watched the flashlight bobbing across the yard. Only when the lights in the camper were flicked off and she knew Macie was safe did she head for bed.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>\u201cMedium-well. Baked potato with sour cream and a side of...what is the vegetable tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCreamed corn.\u201d</p><p>The man scowled. \u201cDisgusting. Give me the salad with Thousand Island dressing.</p><p>On the side. No onions. No tomatoes. No carrots. Light on the bacon bits and cheese. No croutons.\u201d</p><p>Macie expected him to say \u201clight on the lettuce\u201d. She waited for more instructions and the customer stared at her like she was an idiot. She pasted on a smile. \u201cGot it. Your salad will be right out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The diner was busy enough for the next hour she didn\u2019t have time to wish she was slaving over a hot grill instead of bringing Clem, a regular with a sweet tooth and a toothless smile, his tenth cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cOrder up, Macie,\u201d TJ yelled from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She tossed a sprig of parsley on top of the plate and delivered it to her customer. Hopefully he was her last customer of the night. She was ready to go home and knock back a beer or six.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Velma asked as she dumped two ladles of French dressing on a bowl of iceberg lettuce.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just cranky.\u201d And horny. Which made her even more cranky. She was never horny. Or she\u2019d never been until Carter McKay sent her hormones into overdrive.</p><p>Why were her hormones causing problems now? Simply because it\u2019d been a week since she\u2019d seen or heard from Carter?</p><p>Yeah, she knew he was working. Although, she hadn\u2019t heard that from him directly, but from Gemma. Luckily her father hadn\u2019t chimed in about Carter\u2019s absence a couple of days after finding him in her bed. Evidently there hadn\u2019t been any projects around the Bar 9 that required Carter\u2019s help either. Which meant her dad had plenty of time to spend with her. Which was great. They\u2019d gone horseback riding twice, and she\u2019d spent her free mornings watching him work with Gemma\u2019s horses.</p><p>So why was she so cranky?</p> <p>Instead of taking out her frustrations on customers, Macie snuck into the kitchen and chopped celery and green peppers for the Western-style potato salad for tomorrow\u2019s lunch special. Dicing onions always made her cry. She\u2019d leave that task for the morning.</p><p>Unless she needed another reason to hide out in the kitchen. And cry.</p><p>She\u2019d restocked the dry goods and was rolling silverware when the wind chimes clanked behind her, signaling more customers.</p><p>Macie groaned. \u201cVelma, can you take the next table? I forgot to\u2014\u201d drink all the cooking sherry in the pantry, \u201c\u2014check the apples for worms\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014don\u2019t worry, I got it handled. Mmm. Mmm. Lord, I wouldn\u2019t mind handling him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d Macie heard the spritz spritz of Velma\u2019s breath spray and then Velma cooed, \u201cHowdy there, sugar. Why don\u2019t you rest them fine legs, sit and take a load off?\u201d</p><p>Sugar? Macie turned and saw Carter standing in the middle of the diner. Ignoring Velma, ignoring everyone, just staring at her.</p><p>Still feeling cranky, she demanded, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Without a word, without taking his eyes off hers, Carter stalked behind the counter.</p><p>When he stood in front of her, he curled his hands around her head and slanted his mouth over hers. He kissed her like she was air, like she was food, like she was everything.</p><p>Damn him.</p><p>The diner was dead quiet except for the sound of heavy breathing. Hers mostly.</p><p>Carter pulled back scarcely a millimeter and whispered, \u201cThat is what I\u2019m doinghere. Oh. And this is why I\u2019m here too.\u201d He kissed her again. Like she was naked.</p> <p>\u201cCan I get some more coffee back here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush up, Clem,\u201d Velma snapped. \u201cThis is better than the dinner theater down in Lingle.\u201d</p><p>But Clem\u2019s whiny voice brought Macie back to reality. She retreated from Carter\u2019s irresistible kisses.</p><p>He crowded her again. \u201cI want to talk to you. I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down. You\u2019re not supposed to be back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay with me,\u201d Velma said cheerily.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not helping. He already thinks rules don\u2019t apply to him.\u201d</p><p>Carter grinned.</p><p>Macie pointed at the counter. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you something fierce, Macie. Don\u2019t be mad at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw. See? The man is here to apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of it, Velma.\u201d</p><p>Macie snagged the coffee pot and dodged Carter\u2019s wandering hands. When she returned from refilling Clem\u2019s cup, Carter was seated safely behind the counter studying the menu.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s good?\u201d</p><p>Velma answered, \u201cWell, the New York strip is on special. But you oughta try the chicken breast in lemon vodka sauce. It\u2019ll knock your boots off. It\u2019s Macie\u2019s recipe.\u201d</p><p>Carter shot Macie a sly smile. \u201cIs that the secret sauce you used to poach my eggs the other mornin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Velma choked on her coffee.</p><p>Macie sputtered, \u201cB-but I never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014have time to cook for me when we roll out of bed, so I sure appreciate it when you do, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She leaned over the counter. \u201cI am so going to kick your ass, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Carter scooted closer so they were practically nose to nose. \u201cDid you say kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you smug bast\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips to hers once. Twice. Then he whispered, \u201cPlay nice, or I\u2019ll be forced to show you what I do to naughty girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack off, or I\u2019ll be forced to show you how the bucket of rocky mountain oysters in the cooler came to be earlier this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>Clem waved her down and Macie headed to the cash register. She chatted with Clem, ignoring Velma and Carter\u2019s whispers and laughter. Only after Velma had taken Carter\u2019s order and disappeared into the kitchen, did she return to the counter where Carter sat, watching her like a hawk.</p><p>\u201cAre you really mad at me?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>She fiddled with the water pitcher. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. So. When do you get off?\u201d</p><p>Whenever I think of you.</p><p>Dammit. Her stupid hormones were a menace. No. This stupid man was a menace to her normally well-behaved hormones.</p><p>\u201cMacie?\u201d</p><p>She refocused. \u201cUmm. In about an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. I\u2019ll hang around and wait for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother. I\u2019m sure you have plenty of other things to do.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou are mad.\u201d</p><p>Before she could deny it, Velma burst through the swinging doors holding a gigantic ice cream concoction decorated with whipped cream and two cherries. \u201cHere\u2019s your root beer float, hon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtra whipped cream, just like you asked.\u201d</p><p>Carter smirked at Macie. \u201cYou know how much I like sweet, thick cream.\u201d</p><p>Heat flashed between her legs. Bad, bad hormones.</p><p>No. Bad, bad man.</p><p>\u201cThis is pure artistry, Miz Velma. Mmm. Mmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would know.\u201d Velma cocked her head at Macie. \u201cCarter here is an artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he says.\u201d</p><p>The spoon stopped halfway to Carter\u2019s mouth. His blue eyes went as cold as the ice cream in his float. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>Macie addressed her comments to Velma. \u201cHe tells me he\u2019s an artist, and says he\u2019s</p><p>\u2018working\u2019 but the truth is, I\u2019ve never seen a damn thing he\u2019s supposedly created.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cSo I\u2019m just wondering if his whole \u2018I\u2019m an artist line\u2019 is just that.\u201d Macie locked her gaze to Carter\u2019s. \u201cA line. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have onions to chop.\u201d</p><p>She half-expected Carter to sneak in after her offering all sorts of sweet-talkingexcuses, or for Velma to butt in, but no one bothered her. The knife thwacked into the acrylic cutting board, cleaving the onion in two. Her tears fell unchecked until she swiped them away with her shirtsleeve. Stupid onions always made her cry.</p><p>What she\u2019d said to Carter was true and it bugged the crap out of her that he hadn\u2019t shown her a single thing he\u2019d drawn or molded or carved. Him calling her his beautiful muse in that sexy, low voice of his while he fucked her unconscious didn\u2019t count. It didn\u2019t count when he whispered promises about immortalizing her likeness in clay either.</p><p>She wanted to see actual, physical proof. Of something.</p><p>Macie frowned. Was that why he\u2019d freaked out when he caught her in his studio?</p><p>Because he didn\u2019t want her to find out he wasn\u2019t working? Maybe he was blocked. She\u2019d heard artists got blocked just like writers. Maybe that\u2019s why he claimed he needed a muse. She\u2019d be even more skeptical of his motives if she hadn\u2019t seen the stunning portrait Carter created of Gemma\u2019s husband.</p><p>But he\u2019d drawn that one years ago. What had he been doing recently?</p><p>Irritating the hell out of her damn hormones.</p><p>She put the situation out of her mind as she cleaned up and changed clothes. When she returned up front, she wasn\u2019t surprised Carter wasn\u2019t waiting for her, but his absence did cause her a tiny pang of disappointment.</p><p>Velma said, \u201cYou ready to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Before Velma hit the lights, she said, \u201cHe left something for you on the counter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a look.\u201d</p><p>Macie spied a cheap placemat on the spot where Carter had eaten. She picked it up and stared in disbelief.</p><p>It was a pencil drawing of her. A close-up. Specifically of her brooding, in the diner\u2019s kitchen, her face half hidden in shadow as she gazed longingly at something beyond the white edge of the paper.</p><p>Her eyes met Velma\u2019s. \u201cDo I really look like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Lost.</p><p>Velma shuffled over and peered at the drawing. \u201cWell, you do look sad in this picture. But you\u2019ve been kinda mopin\u2019 around the last week, so I think it\u2019s a pretty accurate depiction of your mood. No denyin\u2019 the man has talent. That\u2019s for damn sure.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Macie and smiled. \u201cNo denyin\u2019 the man also has it bad for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. Swallow your pride, squirt. He might\u2019ve hurt your feelin\u2019s over something this week, but remember: He came lookin\u2019 for you tonight.\u201d Velma patted her cheek. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMake sure the door is locked when you leave, eh?\u201d</p><p>Macie rolled up the picture and carefully inserted it in a cardboard paper towel tube so it wouldn\u2019t get crushed in her backpack. She slammed the back door and rounded the side of the brick building, her guilty footsteps loud in the gravel and the muted night air.</p><p>She was so lost in thought that she didn\u2019t notice him until she\u2019d reached her vehicle.</p><p>Carter lounged against the passenger door, his cowboy hat pushed back off his forehead. His arms were folded over his broad chest; his legs were crossed at his ankles.</p> <p>If she hadn\u2019t focused on his eyes, she\u2019d bristle at his defensive posture. But there wasn\u2019t a defensive, macho, self-righteous glint there\u2014just wariness.</p><p>Or was it hope?</p><p>What if was she projecting what was in her eyes into his?</p><p>Did it matter?</p><p>No.</p> <p>\u201cHe came lookin\u2019 for you tonight.\u201d</p><p>She set her backpack on the ground and launched herself at him before she ruined the moment with what-ifs.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Carter caught her with a grunt that morphed into a laugh after she squeezed him tight and knocked his hat off.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey. What\u2019s all this?\u201d</p><p>She scattered kisses on his face. \u201cMy way of saying I missed you, dumbass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh. By all means, darlin\u2019, keep up with the sweet-talkin\u2019. I\u2019m hopin\u2019 it\u2019ll lead to dirty talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for drawing me that picture. Sorry I was a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApology accepted. Just so you know...I have been workin\u2019. Time got away from me and before I knew it, I realized I hadn\u2019t seen the real you in a week.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back to look at him. \u201cThe real me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been paintin\u2019 pictures of you. But retouching you on canvas ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 like touchin\u2019 you in the flesh.\u201d His frustrated growl was a balm to her pride. \u201cJesus, Macie, enough talkin\u2019. Kiss me already.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth trapped his. She forced her tongue between his warm lips and poured herself into him. A hot, drawn-out opened-mouthed kiss that left her wet with need, and had him grinding his hard cock into the soft notch between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cThe things you do to me make me think of all the nasty things I wanna do to you.\u201d</p><p>Carter scraped his teeth down her throat. \u201cI ain\u2019t feelin\u2019 very gentlemanly. I want to fuck you right fuckin\u2019 now. I don\u2019t think I can wait until we find the closest bed.\u201d He growled,</p> <p>\u201cHow daring are you feelin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot very. But you make me want to be daring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s music to my ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Ever done it on the hood of a car?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never done it in a car. She imagined hot metal on her back; hot man on her front. Whoo-ee. She could be down with that. \u201cDo you have a condom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet darlin\u2019, I\u2019ve got a whole pocketful.\u201d</p><p>Chills broke out across every inch of her flesh as he nibbled her neck. She moaned.</p><p>Loudly. \u201cLike that, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Your mouth feels like liquid fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny. That\u2019s the way my cock feels too.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Macie pushed away. \u201cYou gonna take off your pants before the crotch catches fire? Before you get in my car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so Miz Daring decides we\u2019re doin\u2019 this in the car, as opposed to against it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me.\u201d Carter kept his eyes on hers as he kicked off his boots and shucked off his Wranglers. His cock bobbed against his bellybutton and he grinned at her wide-eyed expression. \u201cCommando all the way for you, darlin\u2019. Your turn. Strip.\u201d</p><p>Macie had changed out of her ugly polyester uniform before clocking out, but she hoped her skin didn\u2019t reek like grease. In a flash her denim shorts and her panties were at her feet and her T-shirt dangled from the hood.</p><p>\u201cBra too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. You still have your shirt on.\u201d</p><p>Carter tugged and the pearl snaps gave way, showing just a sliver of his golden flesh from his collar to where the hem brushed his balls.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow. \u201cEnough? I thought you wanted me to take it off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to make it too easy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I wanna test you, see how good you are at removing my bra in the dark, in the car, while I\u2019m bouncing on your lap. You might get a little flustered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou issuin\u2019 me a challenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I get if I pass your challenge?\u201d</p><p>Just say it. Be daring. But it sounded too crude, a little slutty, and a lot naughty in her head no matter how she phrased it.</p><p>\u201cMacie? What do I get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Carter\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWe\u2019re talkin\u2019 whatever I want sexually, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I want something you ain\u2019t never given another man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it would be yours to take.\u201d</p><p>The air between them turned thick with need.</p><p>\u201cRemember you said that. Get in the fuckin\u2019 car, before I throw you on the goddamn ground and fuck you in the gravel and weeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already done that once.\u201d</p><p>He growled.</p><p>\u201cSlip on a condom, cowboy, slide your fine butt in the seat and wait for me. I need to get something out of the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Crickets chirped in the darkness but she scarcely heard them over the blood rushing in her ears. The weight of the car shifted as Carter climbed inside. Macie grabbed the case from under the seat and skirted the front end. She hesitated when she saw the raw, hungry look on Carter\u2019s face through the windshield.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me come out there and get you,\u201d he warned.</p><p>Before she lost her nerve, she crawled on his lap. As she set the case on the driver\u2019s seat, her knee smacked into his groin.</p><p>He sucked in a sharp breath. Then, \u201cJesus-Christ-Almighty-Oh-holy-mother-of-god-oh-fuck-oh-shit-oh- goddamn that hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry sorry sorry. I\u2019m didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Carter, oh, what can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a sec, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He expelled a slow breath.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormally I\u2019d say after rackin\u2019 me you need to get on your knees and kiss my poor abused boys and make \u2019em all better, but there ain\u2019t enough room in here for you to do</p><p>\u2019em justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you take a rain check?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah.\u201d Carter nestled her soft thighs along the outside of his muscular legs.</p><p>\u201cGimme this mouth.\u201d His talented lips toyed with hers as he danced his callused fingertips up and down her spine.</p><p>Then he really kissed her. A full body kiss. A carnal thrusting of his tongue, his mouth gliding back and forth to find the best angle to take the soul kiss even deeper.</p><p>Wetter. Hotter. His hips pressed up, his cock searching for her feminine heat. Nimble fingers unhooked her bra and tugged the satiny straps down her arms.</p><p>Hey. Wait a minute.</p><p>Macie eased back to look at him. Glare at him really.</p><p>An extremely cocky grin spread across his sexy face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t challenge me, darlin\u2019, you can\u2019t win.\u201d He fastened his teeth to the spot on her neck that made her melt. \u201cI know what I want. I\u2019ll let you think on when you\u2019re prepared to give it up to me, \u2019cause I won it fair and square. But for now...tell me what\u2019s in the box.\u201d</p><p>Her hands were flat against his chest, her fingers flexing into the rippling muscles.</p><p>God. He was so strong. So smooth. So perfect. She leaned forward, buried her nose against his collarbone and inhaled. \u201cYou smell so damn good. All the time. Your scent drives me out of my freakin\u2019 mind. I want to lick every bulge and vein and line from your neck on down to your hipbones. And then I want to do it all over again so I can double-check that I didn\u2019t miss any good spots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me touch you, Carter, please.\u201d</p><p>The heat in the car made his pecs slick with sweat. The constant stroking of her thumbs over his nipples made the tips rock hard. His belly muscles quivered beneath her fingertips.</p><p>But Carter wasn\u2019t about to be distracted. He thrust a hand through her hair and tugged her head back so he could peer in her eyes. \u201cYou can suck and lick me to your heart\u2019s content later. Right now I wanna know: What\u2019s in the goddamn box?\u201d</p><p>She nipped his chin. \u201cYou taste like whipped cream here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacie,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cFine. My vibrator.\u201d</p><p>He froze. \u201cYou have a vibrator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve never been able to count on a man for anything, so I take care of all matters myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep your vibrator in the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safer than keeping it in my dad\u2019s camper where he could find it. Plus, it\u2019s portable. Which is handy for us right about now. So, do you want to use it on me? Or should I use it on you first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist Almighty. I may not survive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToughen up, tough guy. Or are you scared? I thought you were daring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah. I ain\u2019t skeered \u2019a nuthin\u2019. Hand it over.\u201d</p><p>Macie reached for it and slapped the soft purple plastic phallus in his palm. \u201cNeed instructions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Carter grinned and turned it to high. Over the constant buzzing noise, he said, \u201cSpread your legs and hold on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou started it. Lean closer. I wanna suck your tits while I\u2019m doing...this.\u201d</p><p>He slid the vibrator right between her pussy lips and left it there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Macie shrieked.</p><p>Then he shaped and squeezed her left breast, sucking her right nipple until it felt like her whole breast was in his hot mouth. He sucked and groaned against her skin while he let the vibrator rest directly on her clit.</p><p>She\u2019d be lucky if she lasted a minute.</p><p>Or thirty seconds.</p><p>She gyrated her hips, arching her spine, wanting him to suck her harder until her nipple hit the back of his throat.</p><p>Carter moved his mouth and the vibrator away.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t stop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.

Before she could find her sanity, Carter\u2019s mouth was on hers and he\u2019d impaled her, even as her pussy still throbbed from the tail end of her orgasm.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Macie. You are so wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your fault. The way you touch me, the way you look at me. You make me wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t complainin\u2019, knowin\u2019 I can heat you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh GOD that feels good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome again for me. I like watchin\u2019 you come.\u201d</p><p>Another orgasm ruptured inside her.</p><p>Carter rammed in and out, each thrust deeper. Harder. Prolonging her climax until she couldn\u2019t breathe and white dots appeared in front of her eyes.</p> <p>The sound of skin slapping on skin drifted far away. Was she having an out of body experience? Or was this just another damn dream?</p><p>Pinch yourself.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t move. Her arms shook. Her legs were numb. She was sweating. She was on fire. Goosebumps broke out across her flesh. She was chilled to the bone. Her head was full of white fluffy cotton and then everything was fading to black.</p><p>All movement quit. Even the sweet stroking of Carter\u2019s velvety tongue against hers.</p><p>He broke the kiss completely. She tried to chase his mouth for more of his intoxicating taste, but ended up smacking her face into his chin.</p><p>\u201cMacie? Darlin\u2019? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna pass out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Hold on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.

Move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hold me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, we need to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. It\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>\u201cJust give me...a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake however long you need.\u201d</p><p>Finally, sanity began to reassert itself. After her head quit spinning, Macie became aware of several things. Carter\u2019s cock was still rock hard, still seated fully inside her. His skin was damp. His short, broken breaths stirred her hair. His pulse pounded against her chest. His body was going haywire with the need to finish this frenzied mating, yet, he held her in utter stillness.</p><p>With gentleness. With protection. With...care.</p><p>Crap. That felt a whole lot scarier than passing out.</p><p>This man was so dangerous to her heart.</p><p>Slowly she lifted her head. Smiled at him. \u201cWhoa. That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve nearly passed out from an orgasm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo orgasms. That\u2019s the first time my spectacular love makin\u2019 has nearly caused a woman to pass out.\u201d He kissed her clammy forehead and whispered, \u201cYou really okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But can we take it slow from here on out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to quit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to quit.\u201d She rubbed her cheek against the stubble on his jaw. \u201cI want you to finish the rest of your spectacular love makin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmartass.\u201d</p><p>Still, he didn\u2019t budge. For what seemed like an hour.</p><p>Macie sighed. \u201cYou afraid to ride the horse that threw you, Daring McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She slid her hands down to his shoulders, dug her nails in and lifted until only the very tip of his cock remained inside her. \u201cI\u2019ll hurt you. I\u2019ll make it hurt so good.\u201d Then she lowered back down.</p><p>\u201cMacie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dare you, Carter.\u201d She locked her gaze on his wild blue eyes as she rode him.</p><p>\u201cFuck me. I won\u2019t break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a crazy woman. Fine. You win. I ain\u2019t got a lot of willpower left anyway.\u201d</p><p>He cradled her face in his hands and kissed her with such gentleness, she wanted to weep.</p><p>They created a steady, slow rhythm. The windows fogged over. The air was heavy, a sultry scent of sex and moist heat.</p><p>Macie felt her need for release rebuild, but Carter didn\u2019t hurry to get her there like he did before.</p><p>He reached between them. Shifted his position slightly. Then his wide, hot palms slid down around her back until he had a butt cheek in each hand. His fingers squeezed her ass as he steadily pumped into her pussy. His thumbs swept closer and closer to her butt crack.</p><p>Just the pad of his thumb brushed the tightly puckered opening. She went rigid.</p><p>Several seconds passed before he did it again. The third time his thumb stayed right there, and drew wet circles over that sensitive knot of nerves.</p><p>Carter placed his mouth on her ear. \u201cI want you here.\u201d</p><p>Macie swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cEver had a man in your ass, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He growled. \u201cThat\u2019ll make me the first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I fuck you here,\u201d he slipped just the tip of his thumb past the muscled ring and her breath hitched, \u201cit\u2019ll be without a condom. So you can feel me comin\u2019 inside you.</p><p>Heatin\u2019 you up where no other man has ever been before.\u201d</p><p>Her head began to buzz again.</p><p>Wait. The buzzing sound got louder. Then she felt it. Carter pressed the pointed end of the vibrator against her anus. She couldn\u2019t help it; she clenched.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax. This piece of plastic ain\u2019t gonna be the first thing you feel up this virgin ass.</p><p>I\u2019m just messin\u2019 around. Primin\u2019 the pump, so to speak. How does that feel? Raunchy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirty girl. I like you dirty. Raunchy. Nasty. My dirty raunchy nasty muse.\u201d</p><p>He managed to hold the vibrator against her even as he thrust into her pussy with steady sure strokes.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cShit. That buzzin\u2019 feels good on my balls. No wonder you like that damn thing so much and have it handy. Hang tight. Christ, Macie. I never thought I\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>He bucked, grunted and started to come.</p><p>Macie canted her hips, grinding her clit against his pubic bone. He pumped hard and accidentally pushed the vibrator in a bit further, just deep enough to send a shock wave of pleasure cascading through her and setting off her third orgasm.</p><p>Utterly spent, she slumped against him as he slumped against the seat.</p><p>Neither one spoke for a long time.</p><p>Finally, she said, \u201cMaybe I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you can break me.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cOr maybe, you\u2019ll be the one to break me, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She shook off the sense of unease. \u201cI need to get some sleep, Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome home with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said sleep. We don\u2019t seem to do a whole lot of that when we\u2019re in a bed. Or in an SUV, apparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I let you go home tonight, will you come by when you\u2019re done workingtomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Dad said something about taking me riding after supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat don\u2019t take all damn night, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause I gotta burn some brush piles. I\u2019d sure like to study your face in the firelight.</p><p>I\u2019ll bet the shadows and angles and color are amazin\u2019 on your bone structure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if I come by to see you, you\u2019d be working?\u201d</p><p>He paused and she sensed his struggle to say the right thing.</p><p>\u201cCarter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d be workin\u2019. But it doesn\u2019t seem like work when you\u2019re the subject.\u201d He slapped her butt. \u201cYou need to get on home. We\u2019ll talk more about this tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>They dressed separately and silently. He kissed her hastily and she watched his red taillights disappear down the gravel road.</p><p>Why did she feel the overwhelming urge to cry?</p><p>Macie blamed it on the damn hormones and headed home.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>\u201cYou so totally did not nail her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Montana?\u201d Carter said skeptically.</p><p>\u201cNo, Miss Rodeo Montana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Maybe a rodeo goat named Montana, but a rodeo queen? Come on, Colt, you\u2019re full of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I ain\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when did you polish Miss Montana\u2019s crown, stud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast weekend. After the Jackson County Rodeo dance.\u201d</p><p>Dance. Never catch him at a damn dance. Carter dabbed cerulean on the canvas and dragged his brush through it before he shifted the receiver. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Elk City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where your dreams are takin\u2019 place now? Elk City?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshole. No. I was in Kane\u2019s horse trailer in Elk City, Montana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. So Kane was there when you rode Miss Montana hard and put her up wet? He can back you up on this tall tale?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. I borrowed his horse trailer last weekend because we were bringin\u2019 that mare home from Missoula.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it don\u2019t count if no one saw you with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCord saw me with her. He can back me up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCord.\u201d Carter paused. \u201cAs in our brother Cord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know any other Cord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but now I know you\u2019re lyin\u2019. Cord doesn\u2019t go nowhere, especially a dance where there\u2019s wicked women who can lead him into temptation away from his beloved ranch.\u201d</p><p>Colt laughed. \u201cTrue. But Dad sent him with me to get the horse. We stopped for the night, saw a street dance goin\u2019 on and decided we\u2019d have a beer and check it out. A couple hours later me and Mindy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMindy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMindy Sue LaRue, Miss Rodeo Montana. She rode me like a Pony Express rider.</p><p>Shoot, we rocked the horse trailer so hard we busted an axle.\u201d</p><p>Carter snorted.</p><p>\u201cWe did it two times before she bailed. Cord walked in as she was walkin\u2019 out. Then he asked me if her tits were implants. I was surprised he\u2019d noticed them. Though, I gotta admit they were pretty hard to miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. I take it back. You did nail her. Congrats.\u201d Carter wiped another streak of blue across the top. \u201cSo were they fake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Who cares? They were just the way I like \u2019em: big and round and bouncy and then they were gone.\u201d</p> <p>Carter laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, bro? Getting any in that godforsaken part of Wyoming?\u201d</p><p>Carter glanced down at the canvas. A serene Macie stared at him from the back of a dappled gray mare. Definitely not the image of his wild Macie from last night. With her sexy legs clamped around his waist, his hat sliding off her head, him swallowing her cries as she came from him fucking her against the wall. Man. She\u2019d hardly made it inside the trailer and he was on her. In her.</p><p>The last three weeks had pretty much gone along those lines. She\u2019d work. He\u2019d work. They\u2019d hook up a couple of times a week to fuck like animals. Then she\u2019d go home and he\u2019d go to bed. Alone.</p><p>The ideal set-up, right? No promises. No hurt feelings. Just lots of hot sweaty sex.</p><p>He was fucking sick and tired of...well, just fucking and didn\u2019t know what the hell to do about it. The first week he and Macie spent together seemed different. Real. Like something special. Now they didn\u2019t talk. They didn\u2019t fight. They didn\u2019t tease each other, or get to know each other, or even eat a damn meal together. They just screwed and that was the extent of it.</p><p>He scowled at the shitty picture on the easel, and resisted shredding it to ribbons with his exacto knife. Even his attempts at art were a screwed up mess. Nothing was working in his life.</p><p>\u201cCarter? You still there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? Since there ain\u2019t no women around...who\u2019s your favorite sheep this week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>A soft rustling filled the phone lines, followed by a heavy pause. Then he heard,</p><p>\u201c...Carter, why? Really? I ain\u2019t surprised. He is kinda rude. Self-centered too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you talkin\u2019 to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom. She says you haven\u2019t called her lately. And you don\u2019t answer your cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Do NOT hand the phone to Mom, Colt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? There\u2019s been no problems with the phone line to Gemma\u2019s house as far as I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, fuckface. I mean it. I don\u2019t want to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s cool. We were done anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt, you fuckin\u2019 loser, don\u2019t you dare pass me off to... Hey, Ma.\u201d Colt was dead the next time he saw him. Dead and buried. With a boot up his ass.</p><p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t my long lost son, Carter West McKay. Why don\u2019t you get the excuses on why you haven\u2019t called me out of the way first thing?\u201d</p><p>Carter heard Colt laughing. He closed his eyes. He really did feel guilty. Especially since his mother was one of the few people he could really talk to. Yeah. Like his brothers didn\u2019t tease him enough for being a momma\u2019s boy.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m a terrible son. I know how much you hate it when you don\u2019t hear from any of us, me in particular. Would it help my cause if I took you out for supper, tossed in some flowers and rubbed your feet when I get back to the ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like a recitation than an actual apology but I suppose that\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>Carter smiled. He\u2019d still be groveling if his dad were near the phone. If Carolyn McKay was unhappy, Carson McKay knocked heads together to get answers as to why his beloved wasn\u2019t beaming rainbows. Those heads mainly belonged to him and his brothers since they were the usual source of her angst.</p><p>\u201cSo...how are things? You about done with the pieces for your show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I\u2019m pluggin\u2019 away. Day by day. Seems to be getting harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to your agent about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma working you too much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, she hired a foreman about a month back and so I\u2019m not doin\u2019 a whole lot of work for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d she hire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash Big Crow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Colby\u2019s friend?\u201d Surprise laced her voice. \u201cI wonder if he knows about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. How is Colby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy. And before you steer the conversation away from asking more about you, I\u2019ll give you the rundown on the rest of the McKays: Keely is running wild. Cord is working too hard, as usual. Ky is growing like a weed. Cam won\u2019t be home for Thanksgiving again. Keely is driving your father insane. And Channing is turning out to be quite the little gardener. Am I missing anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I mention Keely was making him crazy?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cOnce or twice. So, how are you, Ma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are all a bunch of sweet-talkin\u2019 boys, just like your father. Lord. It\u2019s a wonder I don\u2019t have a dozen grandchildren spread across a dozen counties. I\u2019m fine. I miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m two hours away. I\u2019m closer than I was when I lived in Colorado.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hoped you\u2019d been around more now that you\u2019re done with school.\u201d</p><p>Carter didn\u2019t know what to say to that. Mostly because he didn\u2019t know what would happen after he finished the art show.</p><p>A door slammed in the background. \u201cOkay, I shooed Colt out so we can talk freely.</p><p>Honey, what\u2019s wrong? And don\u2019t say nothin\u2019, \u2019cause I can tell something is bothering you.\u201d</p><p>No sense lying to her or himself. \u201cI\u2019m in a rut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your art? Afraid I won\u2019t be much help with that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ma. In a rut with a woman.\u201d</p><p>Silence. \u201cOh. Do I know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I met her this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere. She\u2019s Cash\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord, son, she isn\u2019t underage? When I remember what we went through with Keely when she lied about her age to that bull rider from Oklahoma...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacie is twenty-two. Why would you think she was underage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Cash isn\u2019t much older than Cord.\u201d Pause. \u201cCash has a daughter that old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, fatherhood visited him early. Anyway, Macie and I are spendin\u2019 time together, it\u2019s just lately...it\u2019s hard to explain. It\u2019s different than it was at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really like this girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she make you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen she\u2019s not makin\u2019 me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume you\u2019re knockin\u2019 boots with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh pooh. If I can listen to Colt brag about bagging a rodeo queen ad nauseam, I can listen to anything.\u201d</p><p>True.</p><p>\u201cSo the boot scootin\u2019 is...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a problem, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s all there is.\u201d</p><p>Another moment of silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still waitin\u2019 for your sage advice,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cHold your horses. I\u2019m thinking.\u201d Then, \u201cHave you and Macie spent much time with her father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash? No. He hates my guts.\u201d</p><p>His mom laughed. \u201cI imagine he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal nice that you\u2019re takin\u2019 his side, Ma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. How important is family to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have anyone besides Cash so I don\u2019t think she has a frame of reference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. There\u2019s your answer.\u201d</p><p>Carter scowled at the phone. \u201cWhere? I missed something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She isn\u2019t used to making connections on any level. Show her how. Good sex is a good start. But every girl needs a little romance. Make her feel special. Do something for her no one else has. Your job as a man is to show her you appreciate her brain as well as her body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe I\u2019m havin\u2019 this conversation with my mother.\u201d</p><p>She laughed again. \u201cYou are so na\u00efve when it comes to what I know and what I\u2019ve done. I was young once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this where you warn me to be careful because Macie is so young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung? At twenty-two? Please. At that age I had a two-year-old son, I was pregnant again, I had a ranch to help run and your brawlin\u2019 father to deal with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But I will caution you not to confuse her age with her experience. There is a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime. Love you, darlin\u2019 boy. If I don\u2019t hear from you soon, I\u2019m sending Keely to live with you for the rest of the summer, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s just plain mean.\u201d But he hung up with his first real smile in days. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Romance, huh?

What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we were cleaning out the big barn on Colby\u2019s folks place last week and I saw Colby has all this bull ridin\u2019 stuff, which he\u2019ll never use again. Round about that time Amy Jo Foster and a couple of her young male admirers pulled up. Those boys are hardcore rodeo kids, and when they saw the mechanical bull? They immediately wanted Colby to give them bull ridin\u2019 lessons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Lord. He didn\u2019t, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body will that man ever get on another bull. Anyway, Colby has an attachment to that stuff and he won\u2019t sell it outright, so we wondered if Cash might be interested in teaching some of these boys how to ride bulls. Since Cash is one of the few who wouldn\u2019t feed them full of crap about how great it is chasing the rodeo dream. And he was a good rider. The bonus is they are willing to pay. Good money, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. There isn\u2019t a true rodeo school around here, and I think these boys would like a taste of it before they pony up any money and head off to California or Florida or Texas for one of the real schools.\u201d</p> <p>Gemma began to pace. How could she keep Cash away from an opportunity like that? She\u2019d been watching him with Macie and he had more patience than she\u2019d imagined. He would be a great teacher.</p><p>\u201cGemma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry. So you\u2019d want him there at the McKay place teachin\u2019 these kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no. I want the bull ridin\u2019 paraphernalia as far away from Colby as I can get it. I thought maybe since you have an extra empty barn and extra corrals that we could give\u2014</p><p>lend\u2014the equipment to you, and Cash could set it up there. Then we could start funneling kids his direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t speak for Cash, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019d consider it. You want me to talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the other thing.\u201d Channing\u2019s voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cColby doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m calling you. He wanted to talk to Cash about it first before we contacted you.</p><p>Some stupid male pride thing. But since the Bar 9 is your ranch, I figured you should be the first to know. I didn\u2019t want you to be caught off guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus, if you do say yes, Colby and I will personally deliver the equipment, and we\u2019ll need a place to stay, so you will get to see me. And then we can drink whiskey into the wee hours, and you can tell me all about the hot monkey sex you\u2019re having with that very sexy Indian man.\u201d</p><p>Gemma laughed. \u201cFor that, I\u2019m all in. When would you be comin\u2019 by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext week at the earliest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know when to get the guest room ready.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>\u201cDad. I\u2019m never gonna get this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I suck. See? I totally missed again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just takes practice.\u201d He peered at the unmarked orange circle. \u201cI think live targets would\u2019ve been easier. I know I\u2019m a better shot with them.\u201d</p><p>Macie gave him a sardonic look. \u201cShot a lot of people, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a man in Reno. Just to watch him die.\u201d</p><p>Macie laughed. \u201cCame by your name honestly, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Cash grinned. He loved the sound of her laughter. \u201cCome on. You can do this, honey-girl. Try again.\u201d He watched as she lifted the gun. He studied her form and her stance. Her aim. She jerked her arm before she pulled the trigger and the bullet went high into the field behind the hay bale.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I know what you\u2019re doin\u2019 wrong.\u201d He stood behind her as she flipped the safety back on and kept the gun pointed at the target. Then his arms came around her and he repositioned her slightly. \u201cKeep your elbows loose. Like this. Straight-armin\u2019 it is makin\u2019 you flinch at the last second, which is jerkin\u2019 the muzzle higher, which is why you\u2019re seein\u2019 puffs of dust behind the bale, instead of makin\u2019 holes in the target. Try again. Look through the sights. Keep your eye on that center dot. This time, don\u2019t think about it, just empty the clip.\u201d</p><p>Macie inhaled a deep breath. She flicked the safety off. Moved her finger from the barrel to the trigger and pulled in rapid succession: pop pop pop pop pop\u2014followed by an empty click as the slide kicked back. Methodically she thumbed the safety, ejected the empty magazine into her palm and lowered the gun by her thigh.</p><p>Just like he\u2019d taught her. Might\u2019ve been silly, but Cash had a proud parent moment.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been around to experience many of them in Macie\u2019s life, so he swore he\u2019d soak up even the littlest ones whenever given the chance.</p><p>She ran up to the target, whooped and turned around to beam at him. \u201cI hit two!</p><p>Dead center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we shoot some more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d Her eyes danced. \u201cWhat other guns do you have hidden in your truck?</p><p>Rifles? Shotguns? Bazookas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettle down, Annie Oakley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to shoot something besides this little plinker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Walther P22 is plenty for you to handle right now.\u201d Cash scratched his chin.</p><p>\u201cAlthough, next time I might let you try the Colt revolver. It\u2019s heavier, with a little more kick, but since you\u2019re shootin\u2019 high, you might have better luck with something that weighs more.\u201d</p><p>Macie opened the box of bullets and started loading clips. \u201cHow do you know so much about guns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen around them all my life. Wasn\u2019t a lot to do for fun on the rez. My tunkasila used to take me shootin\u2019 when I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that word mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t speak Lakota very often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remember a whole helluva lot. It\u2019s a use it or lose it thing. I never spoke it fluently anyway, though I mostly understood what my tunkasila said to me. \u2019Course, purposely misunderstandin\u2019 him or my unci, my grandmother, worked to my advantage on occasion too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what sucks? I don\u2019t know anything about your\u2014our\u2014family. Mom didn\u2019t tell me stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t wanna believe it, but that\u2019s probably a good thing you don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about that side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t pretty and it ain\u2019t happy.\u201d</p><p>Slide click slide click echoed as she slipped bullets in the steel clip. \u201cSo? I still deserve to know. And I\u2019m gonna be a total pain in the butt until you talk to me about it.\u201d</p><p>Cash directed his gaze away from her. \u201cMacie, it ain\u2019t like the Big Crow family has anything to be proud of in recent years. We\u2019re not like some of them families, keepingwith Lakota traditions. Talkin\u2019 \u2019bout our glorious past. I never much cared about my Indian heritage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much wrong I don\u2019t even know where to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart with your parents.\u201d</p><p>When he hesitated, she used a sad, doe-eyed look that would net her anything she wanted. He\u2019d\u2019ve been putty if she\u2019d done that as a little girl.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. My mom died from alcohol poisoning when I was nine. My dad ended up in the state pen long before that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen where\u2019d you live when you were growin\u2019 up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith my mom\u2019s parents until I lit out on my own.\u201d Right after he found out about Jorgen\u2019s pregnancy. There was a proud moment in his life, running from his responsibilities.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your dad when he got out of jail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDied in a drunk drivin\u2019 accident.\u201d</p><p>Thick, uncomfortable silence weighted the air.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re like me, basically alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019d always heard Indians had big families. You don\u2019t have brothers or sisters, aunts, uncles and a billion cousins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only have one brother, Levon. And he\u2019s repeatin\u2019 the family history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the pen on narcotics charges. Long story.\u201d</p><p>The lift in her eyebrow reminded him of Gemma for some odd reason. \u201cHave some place to be that you can\u2019t tell me now?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to tell you now. Or ever.</p><p>Cash sighed. \u201cLong story short: I felt sorry for him after his wife kicked him out, so while I was off rodeoin\u2019, I let him live on the ranch our grandparents deeded to me.</p><p>Stupid son of a bitch was makin\u2019 meth in the barn. So when the DEA caught him, the state of South Dakota confiscated the ranch and sold it at auction to pay legal fees, and the hazardous waste clean up bill, and the back property taxes. Nothin\u2019 I could do. I lost the only thing that was ever really mine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI had no idea.\u201d She studied his face. \u201cWhen did that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour years ago.\u201d Cash finally found the guts to look at his daughter. Comprehension dawned in her big brown eyes, before those same beautiful, wise eyes filled with tears.</p><p>Shit. He\u2019d never dealt well with tears.</p> <p>\u201cOh Dad. That was right around the time mom died, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you had enough shit to deal with, Macie, without me addin\u2019 to it. I\u2019ve never given you anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>Macie threw herself at him, wrapping her arms around his neck and sobbed like her heart was breaking.</p> <p>Cash held her tightly, offering her comfort she\u2019d never sought from him. Soothing her. Holding her. His child. Feeling like a total selfish prick because on some level, he was happy, happy, that she\u2019d turned to him for something.</p><p>Macie\u2019s cries slowed to the occasional hiccupping stutter. Still she didn\u2019t release her grip on him. He had the good sense not to let go of her either.</p><p>Finally he murmured, \u201cBetter, honey-girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I hate this. I\u2019ve always hated it.\u201d</p><p>Cash\u2019s stomach plummeted to the toes of his cowboy boots. \u201cHate what? Me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I hate that I don\u2019t know you. Hate that it\u2019s so goddamn awkward to get to know you. I want everything to be butterflies and rainbows in my life, just once. I want us to finally make that connection and be, I don\u2019t know, like a real family. Instead of polite strangers.\u201d</p> <p>She started crying again and this time, he cried silently right along with her. Holding the best mistake he\u2019d ever made.</p><p>\u201cYou probably think I\u2019m a bawl baby, huh?\u201d she asked after a time.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought I\u2019d be so happy to be wearin\u2019 your tears on my shirt.\u201d He squeezed her hard and kissed the top of her head. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna make this work, Macie. We\u2019re gonna be a family, \u2019cause Lord knows, we both need one.\u201d</p><p>She nodded against his chest. Still making no move to leave him.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever get married and have another family?\u201d</p><p>That question surprised him for the second time. \u201cI guess I never found a woman who would put up with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am too. I\u2019m set in my ways, Macie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy way or the highway, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about when you were younger? Before you got so set in your ways?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured there was no rush. That I\u2019d have plenty of time to settle down when I was older.\u201d Cash didn\u2019t want to muddy the waters and discuss his relationship with Gemma and all that he wanted from her now that he\u2019d found a woman who would put up with his wicked ways. \u201cThe same holds true for you too. You\u2019re young. I\u2019m sure there are things you wanna do. Travel. See the world.\u201d</p><p>Macie snorted.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom was the gypsy type, not me.\u201d</p><p>Cash leaned back to look at her. \u201cYou want to settle down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>He kept his tone casual. \u201cWith Carter McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I like it here because you\u2019re here, Dad. But if you\u2019re talking about me and him?</p><p>I don\u2019t know. Probably wouldn\u2019t work anyway.\u201d</p><p>Cash wanted to tell her it probably wouldn\u2019t and encourage her to nip the relationship in the bud. But he bit his tongue and listened.</p><p>\u201cHe and I are so different. He\u2019s smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you. You passed your GED when you were fourteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah. He\u2019s got a Masters of Fine Art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all. He has ties to the land and to his family and I don\u2019t know what that\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he messin\u2019 with your head? Tellin\u2019 you what you have and what you\u2019ve accomplished in your life isn\u2019t good enough? Makin\u2019 promises that you know he ain\u2019t gonna keep?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed and he recognized that challenging look: He\u2019d seen it staring back at him in the mirror. It gave him a spark of pride that she did have something of him in her after all.</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you about this? Rationally? Or are you gonna run off half-cocked?\u201d</p><p>Cash grimaced and pointed to the four clips on the tailgate. \u201cHalf-cocked? I\u2019m fully loaded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiddin\u2019. I ain\u2019t gonna shoot him.\u201d Yet. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like he runs hot and cold. He treats me like I\u2019m everything and then the next day, it\u2019s like I don\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She smiled and wiped the tears from her face. \u201cNever mind. I\u2019m babbling.</p><p>It\u2019s my stupid hormones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you realize it ain\u2019t you, and it is his fault for how he\u2019s makin\u2019 you feel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep it to myself.\u201d</p><p>Cash opened his mouth. Shut it.</p><p>\u201cBut thanks. So when we\u2019re done cleaning up, you want to come and try a piece of caramel apple pie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith whipped cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any in the camper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma has some in the fridge. I\u2019ll grab it and be right back.\u201d</p><p>Shooting guns and having pie with his daughter. It was turning out to be a damn fine day.</p><p>Three hours later Cash\u2019s cell phone rang while he filled water tanks in the south pasture.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash? It\u2019s Colby McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby, you old dog. How\u2019s it goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. How\u2019s Channing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs beautiful and docile as ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be the day. She\u2019s got you pussy whipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but I ain\u2019t complainin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t let you. So, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever thought about teachin\u2019 bull ridin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Talk about from out of left field. But he and Colby never had time for small talk.</p><p>\u201cNo, but you\u2019ve caught my interest.\u201d He listened as Colby gave him a brief rundown.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll take a crack at it. I probably oughta clear it with Gem first. But I don\u2019t see it bein\u2019 a problem with her. Those boys interested in anything else? Bronc or bareback ridin\u2019? \u2019Cause she has some rough stock she\u2019d like to test out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure them boys would love anything you throw at \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur kinda kids, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Though, I don\u2019t think they make \u2019em as tough as us anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe always thought we were way tougher than we actually were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo lie there. We\u2019ll see you next week sometime. I\u2019ll give you a jingle before we head your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t comin\u2019 here to take home your brother Carter, by chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter? No. Why? He causin\u2019 problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that boy breaks my daughter\u2019s heart, I\u2019ll be sendin\u2019 him home to the McKay Ranch in a casket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Sounds like we have a lot of catchin\u2019 up to do, Cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd some splittin\u2019 up to do. I\u2019m inclined to start with his fool head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang tight. If I pass along what you just said, the whole McKay family will be there in two hours with horses and ropes\u2014not necessarily for him. So, I\u2019m gonna ask you not to kill him just yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough, but no guarantees.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>\u201cCash? You want another beer?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been sitting in the darkened living room for over an hour. He shoved aside his thoughts about his conversation with Macie and focused on Gemma. \u201cNah. I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty quiet tonight. Everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, everything would be great if you\u2019d come over here and give me a little sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d She sauntered over and plopped herself on his lap. \u201cI was beginning to feel neglected.\u201d She kissed his throat. \u201cLonely.\u201d She kissed his chin. \u201cHorny.\u201d She kissed his mouth in that sexy teasing way that gave him an instant erection. \u201cVery, very horny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard about you horny widow types. Always thinkin\u2019 \u2019bout...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me, horny Widow Jansen. What\u2019s that gleam in your eye mean for me tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so damn dark in here I\u2019m surprised you can even see my eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShee. It\u2019s my Indian scout night vision. Wait. I\u2019m getting something else from that vision. I\u2019m sensin\u2019 you want to\u2014\u201d he let his tongue dip into her ear, \u201c\u2014blow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are good. Let\u2019s go upstairs where I can spread you out on the bed and work you over real good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m comfy right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the rule about arguin\u2019 with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood answer.\u201d Cash trailed his lips along the long, tasty line of her neck.</p><p>\u201cUnbuckle my britches and put your hands on me, Gem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wear your jeans so damn tight I won\u2019t be able to get them\u2014or you\u2014off unless you stand up and take \u2019em off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever makes it easier for you.\u201d Cash put her back on her feet and stood beside her. Gemma kissed him while she unbuckled his belt. She kissed him as she unbuttoned and unzipped him. She kept kissing him as she shimmied his jeans and boxers to his knees. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anticipation made him crazy. Waiting for her cool, strong hand to circle his cock.</p><p>Followed by her hot, wet mouth and wicked little tongue.</p><p>\u201cCash? Up against the bookcase.\u201d</p><p>Zero argument from him. He shuffled sideways until his ass met cold wood. She dropped to her knees.</p><p>\u201cSpread those legs wider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2019m.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, see here, cowboy. I won\u2019t have you knocking off my knickknacks on the bookshelves. You\u2019re gonna have to hold still. No buckin\u2019 your hips. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can move someplace sturdier. Maybe we oughta do this by a wall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gemma slapped his thigh.</p><p>Shit. That was sexy, her taking charge and acting all bossy. His dick jerked against his belly.</p><p>\u201cI will stop if you don\u2019t obey me, Cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll obey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood boy. Hands by your sides.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his fists by his clenched thighs.</p><p>She nuzzled the hair covering his sac. \u201cHow is it you smell so...sweet right here?</p><p>When you\u2019re all hard, tough male?\u201d Her hand slipped up the inside of his leg. Then she cupped his balls and rolled them between her clever fingers.</p><p>Cash didn\u2019t move, but his cock twitched again.</p><p>Gemma sucked both balls into her mouth and made an, \u201cMmm. Mmm. Mmm,\u201d</p><p>noise. Her tongue flicked over the globes, between, and she sucked again. The very tip of her wet finger lazily stroked the sensitive strip of skin behind his sac. Then it slowly slipped back to the puckered hole. Drawing ever-deeper circles into that sensitive knot of nerves. One push and her finger breached the tightly muscled ring and was inside his back channel.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit I shouldn\u2019t like that but I do.\u201d</p><p>She made another, \u201cMmm,\u201d vibrating noise with his balls in her mouth as she pumped her finger and stroked another hot spot deep inside his ass.</p><p>He groaned.</p> <p>By the time she released his nuts, they were drawn up tight against the base of his cock, hard as walnuts. She zigzagged the tip of her tongue up the vein throbbing in the center of his cock. Warm, wet flicks bathed the head. She stroked his interior walls and her finger thrust hard one last time before it slid out. Then she moved his shaft aside with her chin so she could nuzzle his groin.</p><p>\u201cI love, love, love the way you smell. I\u2019ve barely started tasting you and my panties are already soaked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma\u2014\u201d</p><p>She slapped his other thigh. \u201cAre you supposed to be talking?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, but he knew she couldn\u2019t see him in the inky blackness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of talking too. Especially when my mouth can do things to you, and to this bad boy, that will make you my love slave. Forever.\u201d</p><p>His heart shot into his throat as she deep-throated him.</p><p>Man. He\u2019d never get used to that silky wet heat. A cool rush of air. Another warm wave as she pulled his cock in deep again. And again.</p><p>Fuck. It was like being in heaven and hell. He never wanted that sublime sucking to end as much as he couldn\u2019t wait until he reached the glorious end.</p><p>He felt Gemma\u2019s hands clamped around his hips. Her thumbs stroked his hipbones, in a gentle erotic arc, an opposite sensation of the hard and fast and\u2014Christ almighty\u2014</p><p>wet, wet, wet feel of her mouth bobbing on the entire rigid length. And the occasional scrape of her teeth as she released his cock an inch at a time, the little tease.</p><p>She slowed her rapid strokes to suckle just the knob. Her lips tightened around the head of his cock and that nasty, sexy tongue flicked his glans until his legs threatened to give out. He bumped his groin into her face, urging her to take in more of him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you about trying to bang your hips closer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you do know the magic word,\u201d she murmured against his abdomen. Once again she sucked and licked and drove him to the brink, then retreated to lap at the crease of his thigh. \u201cYou taste all musky and yummy here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma, doll, please. Finish me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love making you squirm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, you\u2019re good at it too. But I can\u2019t stand much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come in my mouth this time.\u201d</p><p>When she\u2019d given him head in the past month, he\u2019d always pulled out at the moment of truth and come on her tits or her belly or in her pussy.</p><p>Thinking of his cock pumping his seed over her tongue and feeling her swallowing part of him seemed more intimate that the act itself. He usually avoided that portion of blowjobs and the women he\u2019d been with hadn\u2019t cared.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>\u201cCash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But I\u2019m gonna need to put my hands on your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want.\u201d Then her greedy lips parted and she took him in all the way.</p><p>He grabbed her hair. \u201cOpen wider.\u201d</p><p>She did.</p><p>\u201cGet me wet with that hot fuckin\u2019 mouth.\u201d</p><p>She made slurping sounds and sexy moans as his cock tunneled in and out.</p><p>\u201cSuck harder, JESUS, just like that. Fuck, Gemma. I\u2019m close. Tilt your head. Hold on.\u201d He shoved the last couple inches until he felt the tip of his cock hit her soft palette.</p><p>He roared as his balls lifted, and streams of come poured down her throat as he kept her firmly in place and pumped his pelvis.</p><p>Even through the dull roar in his ears Cash heard Gemma gulping. After the last spasm, she slowly released him from the haven that was her mouth.</p><p>She stood and pushed him back, because he lost the ability to stand.</p><p>Maybe his knees were buckling in shame.</p><p>Yeah. Bet her late husband never grabbed her by the hair and fucked her face like a savage beast. He didn\u2019t know what the hell had gotten into him.</p><p>The tangy lemony scent of her shampoo drifted up. He kissed the top of her head then reached down and yanked up his pants.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you hop up on the couch and let me return the favor, eh?\u201d</p><p>Without responding, Gemma took his hand and led him through the darkened house and upstairs to her bedroom.</p><p>He braced himself, expecting she\u2019d turn on the lights. Had she noticed that every time they\u2019d made love, no matter the position, no matter the time of day, it\u2019d been dark?</p><p>Or she\u2019d worn the blindfold?</p><p>Yes. But so far she hadn\u2019t mentioned it.</p><p>He heard the click of the door shutting.</p><p>She said, \u201cTake off your clothes and lay on the bed. Facing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d He stripped. \u201cYou have some kinda wicked games planned, Gem?\u201d</p><p>No answer. Then her nakedness pressed him into the mattress. She was warm. Soft.</p><p>Willing. She smelled like heaven and her body felt like sin. Her lips sought his and she kissed him with tenderness that set his alarm bells ringing.</p><p>\u201cHey. What do you say we get this party started?\u201d He slapped her butt. \u201cSlide on up here and let me taste that pussy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I know you didn\u2019t get off when you were blowin\u2019 my mind. You too tired or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Cash. I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd luckily I\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her cheek over his bare chest. \u201cI love the way you touch me. I love how you push me to the limit. I love how you\u2019ve bulldozed through whatever sexual boundaries I might\u2019ve thought I had. I love every single thing we\u2019ve done together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t always have to bawdy. Sometimes it can be...sweet.\u201d</p><p>He froze.</p><p>\u201cLet me show you sweet. Let me make love to you. No lights. No sex toys. No games. No dirty talk. Just you and me and the potential of what it can be between us, Cash.\u201d</p><p>For once, he wished he could see her face. He reached for her anyway. \u201cIs this because you need sweetness tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gemma\u2019s lips clung to his after she kissed him. \u201cIt\u2019s because you do.\u201d</p><p>Her words undid him. Because he couldn\u2019t speak, Cash surrendered to her, in body, mind and soul. The night was the sweetest he\u2019d ever known.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>Carter McKay wasn\u2019t feeling very sweet at all.</p><p>The night was so dark it was like swimming in an inkwell. Only a half moon remained. Clouds obscured it and the stars. So much for his plan to take Macie for a romantic horseback ride.</p><p>He reined Deacon to a stop beside Gemma\u2019s barn. Then he dismounted, removed the saddle, blanket and bridle, and led his horse into the last stall. He shoveled a bucketful of oats in the trough and stepped from the dim barn outside into the warm night air with a nearly moonless sky.</p><p>Instead of working on plan B and deciding which sweet, romantic words to use on Macie, he found himself irritated he had to be thinking of that kind of shit at all. Why was he sneaking in on horseback? Why couldn\u2019t he just drive his damn truck right up to Macie\u2019s door? Who cared what her father thought?</p><p>Evidently Macie did. Which meant he had to care too.</p><p>Dammit. Carter glanced at Gemma\u2019s house. Pitch black. He walked toward the faint light glowing from Macie\u2019s camper and put his boot on the pullout step. Should he have brought flowers? A bottle of wine? She probably wouldn\u2019t consider a handful of rainbow-colored condoms and a bottle of lube very damn romantic.</p><p>He rapped on the door. The music inside ended abruptly. A curtain fluttered and the door swung outward.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s me. Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter?\u201d</p><p>Was that disappointment in her voice?</p><p>She peered behind him, squinting at the darkness. \u201cWhat are you doing here?</p><p>Where\u2019s your truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t drive. I rode my horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Do you want to come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten how cramped it was in her camper. Especially since they were avoiding touching. He sat on the bench next to the foldout kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cHow are the projects going? Sculptures this week, right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Carter looked at her. Really looked at her. And was struck dumb by his stupidity and pride. He couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d grumbled about having to romance her. She was beautiful and sweet and funny; he was the luckiest guy on the planet for getting a chance to woo her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI miss you, Macie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her hand flew to her throat. A nervous gesture? From stand-offish Macie?</p><p>\u201cI miss you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCarter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt bears repeatin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Talk to her. Ask her questions. Show her you\u2019re interested in her mind, not just her body.</p> <p>\u201cSo what were you doin\u2019 before I barged in?\u201d</p><p>She pointed to the tin on the table next to him. \u201cI was just about to have a piece of pie. You hungry?\u201d</p><p>For you. I want to savor you. I want to devour you.</p><p>\u201cCarter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? It\u2019s a new recipe and I have whipped cream. Not fresh, it\u2019s the canned kind\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you even been listenin\u2019 to me, Macie?\u201d He stood and crowded her against the small refrigerator imbedded in the wall. \u201cI said I miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can that be? It\u2019s only been two days since we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014fucked? Yeah, I know. But it\u2019s been a couple of weeks since we talked. Really sat down and talked. Or fought. Or did anything but fuck like wild rabbits then disappear into our separate little hidey holes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to be such a disappointment to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere ain\u2019t a single goddamn thing about you that disappoints me, that\u2019s what I\u2019m tryin\u2019 to tell you. I miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here scowling at me?\u201d She held up a hand and he automatically stepped back. \u201cBesides the \u2018missing me\u2019 thing you keep bringing up?\u201d</p><p>Carter smiled. \u201cBecause I wanted to see you. Can we just hang out and talk? Act like a normal couple?\u201d</p><p>Her hazel eyes turned shrewd. \u201cAre we a couple?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re a couple. A normal couple, doin\u2019 normal couple things. Talkin\u2019 an\u2019 shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Macie cocked her head. \u201cA normal couple would sit down and have pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen dish it up, darlin\u2019. Extra whipped cream on mine.\u201d</p><p>Once they were seated across from one another, Carter took a bite. He groaned.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best pie I\u2019ve ever tasted.\u201d Another quick bite elicited another heartfelt groan of delight. \u201cMy mother would wash my mouth out for sayin\u2019 that to anybody but her.\u201d</p><p>Macie finally smiled at him. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Where\u2019d you learn to cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelf-taught out of self-preservation.\u201d</p><p>Another bite of ambrosia. He moaned again. \u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom didn\u2019t cook. I needed to eat. My first job was in a restaurant. I like to experiment with food. I\u2019d still rather cook than waitress, but the money is better waiting tables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver thought about goin\u2019 to cookin\u2019 school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow and again, but I wasn\u2019t the best student. I don\u2019t want to study in a specific area like French, Italian, European or vegetarian dishes. Being a fulltime sous chef would be boring. Same goes for a pastry chef. Or a baker. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d do well with people telling me what I don\u2019t know, or telling me what to do all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? I\u2019m shocked.\u201d</p><p>She swatted at him. \u201cPlus, I like mixing it up and doing it all myself. I\u2019ve heard some of those specialized schools suck the creativity right out of you.\u201d She gave him a sheepish look. \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about the kind of stuff you do. Art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s true there too. The instructors make you learn how to do it the \u2018right\u2019 way so you can eventually do it your own way.\u201d He shoveled in the last chunk of flaky crust and chewed slowly, drawing out the taste. \u201cThen when you do the kind of art that makes you happy, no one thinks it\u2019s real art. It gets called \u2018folk\u2019 or \u2018rural\u2019 or something that belittles it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery damn day.\u201d Whoa. He\u2019d finished his dessert in record time. He looked over at her full plate; she\u2019d scarcely eaten a bite. Shrugging, he helped himself to a taste of her pie. \u201cThen there\u2019s the whole all \u2018artists are gay\u2019 mentality. I\u2019m constantly getting hit on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever in a million years would I look at you and peg you as gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I\u2019m the perfect foil, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last guy I dated? He was an artist and I found out in a rude fashion he was gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? If anyone could turn a man from the dark side, it\u2019d be you.\u201d He scooped in two more heaping forkfuls of caramelly goodness and sighed. \u201cA couple of the bolder ones thought I was playin\u2019 hard to get, so they tried to convert me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d that go for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the one guy from New York is probably still pickin\u2019 up his teeth.\u201d Carter plucked up the last chunk of pie from Macie\u2019s plate, rammed it in his mouth with a happy little moan.</p><p>He froze. Lord. Was he smacking? Would it be bad manners to lick the plate?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Would it be rude to offer to lick her?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Focus. Romance. Normal couple things.</p><p>He licked the tines on his fork. \u201cI don\u2019t have nothin\u2019 against gays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter.\u201d</p><p>He dabbed up every single sugared crumb of the delicious piecrust from the pie tin, sucking the sweetness of the apple filling from the pad of his thumb, lost in thought.</p><p>\u201cAlthough, I think it would\u2019ve killed Dad to have a gay son. I\u2019m pretty sure he developed an ulcer when I switched my major from ag to art. My brothers joked about it\u2014until I told them how much I get paid for a sculpture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s feast or famine in the art world. I could bomb and be broke as easily as I could be touted as the next best thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know how this show\u2019ll go over. It\u2019s a mix of styles. There\u2019s some pressure from my agent and I need it to do well financially so I\u2019ll have options. The thought of spongin\u2019 off my folks indefinitely...Don\u2019t get me wrong. I love them. I love the rest of my family and where I grew up.\u201d He brooded and fiddled with his utensil.</p><p>Thinking about this stuff made him crazy. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go far, Wyoming is in my blood, but there\u2019s no place for me on the home place if I\u2019m not ranchin\u2019. I\u2019ve always been a bit of a loner and it appeals to me to be on my own. Even if no one understands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter. Shut up.\u201d</p><p>He froze again. Had he been yappin\u2019 like an unwanted dog? He shot her a covert glance.</p><p>And lust kicked him right in the balls.</p><p>\u201cMacie. Darlin\u2019, don\u2019t look at me like that. We\u2019re supposed to be hangin\u2019 out.</p><p>Talkin\u2019. Actin\u2019 like a normal couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck being normal. I\u2019d rather have you fucking me.\u201d She lunged across the table.</p><p>The pie plates skidded and crashed to the floor. He barely caught the can of whipped cream before it rolled off the table.</p><p>Macie smashed her mouth to his and he fell into heaven.</p><p>Yeah. Fuck normal.</p><p>He scooted from the bench and took the four short steps to the bedroom with her clinging to him like a vine. Kissing her. Lord. It\u2019d been a lifetime since he\u2019d kissed her.</p><p>They half-landed on the bed. She ripped open his shirt and scraped her nails down his torso to his belt buckle.</p><p>Buttons flew as he tugged on the lapels of her pajama top.</p><p>\u201cHurry. Did you bring condoms?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. He\u2019d seem like a selfish prick whether he said yes or no. Add in the tiny bottle of lube...</p><p>No use hiding them now. He tossed the whole shootin\u2019 match by the pile of floral pillows.</p><p>Macie demanded, \u201cLose the jeans.\u201d</p><p>Why was she always in such a damn hurry? He still had his boots on. She jammed her hands in his boxers and grabbed his dick. \u201cHey, hey. Let\u2019s start at the bottom and work our way up. I gotta get rid of these shitkickers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you leave the damn boots on as long as the damn pants come off.</p><p>Now.\u201d Macie pulled his lips to hers as her fingers worked his Wranglers down his legs.</p><p>Carter realized the rut they\u2019d fallen into wasn\u2019t entirely his fault. In fact, she\u2019d taken the lead when it came to sex in the last few weeks. She\u2019d decided where (his place usually) and when (right after work) and how long (only long enough for both of them to get off).</p><p>Well, he was taking charge tonight. Taking what she\u2019d promised him. Taking what would be his alone.</p><p>Screw romance. She\u2019d had him tied up in knots for weeks. It was time for him to return the favor.</p><p>He gradually broke the frantic kiss. \u201cNot so fast. There ain\u2019t room in here for both of us to strip. Get naked. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>While Carter doffed his clothes, his gaze swept the kitchen/living area for an item he could use. He spied the frayed nylon rope poking out of Cash\u2019s rigging bag.</p><p>Perfect. Tied up. Heh heh.</p><p>He grabbed the rope and the can of whipped cream.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Carter asked.</p><p>\u201cReady, willing and able, cowboy, come on in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember you said that, darlin\u2019.\u201d He set the can on the floor out of sight, but let the rope dangle in his hand as he stepped in front of her. His gaze took her in; she was stunning. Macie lay sideways on the bed, her head propped on her palm. Her glossy mahogany hair pooled on the white sheet by her shoulder. The sexy position emphasized the feminine bend in her waist, the womanly curves of her hip and belly. The tips of her breasts were hardened and her chest rose and fell with her rapid breathing. Her eyes.</p><p>Man. Her eyes were black with desire. Until they noticed the item in his hand, then a flash of fear showed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it look like?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA rope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be right. Stretch out across the bed and put your wrists together above your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were beyond games, Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue with me. Just do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. Defiantly. Warily.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t kiddin\u2019, Macie. My way or no way.\u201d</p><p>Something shifted in her eyes and she nodded. She rolled on her back, knocked the pillows aside and pressed her palms to the paneled wall.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Carter climbed on the bed and straddled her pelvis, ignoring the questions in her eyes as he bound her. After he was satisfied she couldn\u2019t get loose, he knelt between her widespread thighs. He snatched the pillows and said, \u201cLift,\u201d so he could slide them beneath her ass.</p><p>Then he dragged the tips of his fingers, oh-so-slowly, over the sensitive skin on the inside of her arms, until his palms rested on her ribs. \u201cThe rope will burn your wrists if you wiggle too much, so my advice is to stay still. No matter what I do to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut off her protest with a scorching kiss. As his mouth moved on hers, he touched her. Everywhere. Memorizing her from the beautiful curve in her neck to the hidden curves beneath her breasts. He contented himself by playing with her nipples for as long as he liked, since she was helpless to rush him. Pinching. Pulling. Drawing soft circles around the areola until it disappeared into a tempting tip. He stroked her silky hair, bunching it in his fist, rubbing it on his face, releasing the minty scent of her shampoo.</p><p>Caressing her flat belly with his whole hand. Teasing her belly button with his thumb.</p><p>Arcing the ragged edges of his knuckles over the delicate skin between her hipbones, feeling her abdomen quiver as she whimpered in his mouth.</p><p>He slid his lips to her ear and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m makin\u2019 you wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to touch you where you\u2019re wet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Please.\u201d</p><p>Carter nuzzled the sweet spot below her jaw. \u201cYou want my fingers? Or my mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mouth. Please. Put your mouth on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. But you gotta do one thing for me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes and keep \u2019em closed.\u201d</p><p>She did.</p><p>He licked a line straight down her torso. He reached for the can of whipped cream on the floor, distracting her by keeping his tongue busy on her clit.</p><p>She moaned, muffling the sound of him thumbing the cap and shaking the can. He rested the long white plastic tip against her opening, then pushed it in and depressed the nozzle, filling her hot pussy with cold whipped cream.</p><p>Macie screamed and jerked upright.</p><p>Carter placed his hand on her chest and pushed her flat as he began to lap and suck and eat every drop of cream\u2014hers and the sweet white stuff from the can\u2014from every hidden crevice. He jammed his tongue in her cunt as far as it would go. Licking her deepest recesses, wiggling his tongue inside her until she moaned again.</p><p>She came in a wet rush, bucking and moaning.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t close to done.</p><p>He lifted her hips higher, burying his sticky face in her essence. Drowning in her.</p><p>Feeding his need by losing himself in hers. His fingers spread her wide, opening every part of her sex to him completely. He let his greedy tongue travel from her small puckered hole up through her engorged pussy lips and back down. Over and over. Faster and faster. While rimming her anus with his thumb, he latched onto her clit and sucked relentlessly until she came again.</p><p>After the last spasm became a faint throb against his lips, he rubbed his face on her thighs and her belly, marking her as his. He lowered her hips, stretching himself over her supine form. Her body was hot and soft against his coarser skin, and she smelled so damn tempting. He unearthed the bottle of lube and bent to taste her hard nipples, murmuring,</p><p>\u201cFlip onto your stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sass me, Macie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. I can\u2019t really move with you on top of me.\u201d</p><p>He rolled her flat, and then hiked her butt into the air. Carter studied her position, not as an artist, but as a man. Gauging if his lover was ready for him, for something new.</p><p>Macie\u2019s flushed cheek rested on the bed between her outstretched arms. Her knees were wider apart than her hips, creating a solid foundation to take his thrusts. Man, what a pretty picture she made.</p><p>His heart hammered as he squeezed lube onto his fingers and moved in behind her, bending forward to lick a path from her tailbone, up her spine, to the base of her skull.</p><p>Carter closed his eyes and buried his face in her mint-scented hair, tasting the sweat on her skin. Seeping himself in the taste, the feel, the scent of her.</p><p>Macie shuddered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m takin\u2019 what you told me I could have.\u201d He fingered the little rosette. \u201cPlunging my cock into a place no man has been. Makin\u2019 this ass mine.\u201d He sank his teeth into her nape the same time his slick fingers breached her anus.</p><p>Her whole body stiffened up and her breath caught.</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d Carter nuzzled the curve of her shoulder. \u201cIt might hurt at first. But don\u2019t fight me, let me all the way in. Don\u2019t clench.\u201d He pumped his fingers in and out of her hole, getting her ready to accept more. To take it all. \u201cIt feels dirty, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaunchy, nasty, and wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you still want it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl. I\u2019ve got plenty of lube, but no guarantee I can fuck you slow once I\u2019m buried balls deep in this sweet untried ass, understand?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and appeared to nod.</p><p>\u201cNo condom either, remember? I\u2019m clean. I want you to feel the heat when I come inside you. Sweet darlin\u2019, I wanna make this good for you.\u201d He whispered, \u201cSo good.</p><p>Will you let me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Carter squirted lube on his hand, making a fist as he coated his cock. He slicked up her hole, squeezing gel inside that dark entrance. His hands shook. Sweat dripped into his eye. He blinked it back as he spread her ass cheeks and placed the tip of his cock at the virgin opening. \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty here. Every part of you is so beautiful. I wish you could see...\u201d</p><p>He held back and tried to level his breathing and his anticipation. Concentrating on the sexy line in the reverse arch of her spine. Inhaling the sweet aroma of the whipping cream laced with the scent of her juices. An underlying hint of apples and caramel and sugar. A faint whiff of his own musk.</p><p>Macie gyrated her hips and pushed back. \u201cJust do it.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t need to ask him twice. One solid push and he was past that ring of muscle and buried in that tight, tight, hot channel.</p><p>His head fell back in awe at how damn good it felt.</p><p>\u201cShit. That hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreathe, darlin\u2019. Come on. It\u2019ll feel good if you let me move.\u201d More sweat tracked his chest as he waited for her to calm down.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Go slow.\u201d</p><p>Carter eased completely out. She sucked in a harsh breath as he slid back in. And out. And in. And out. Slow.</p><p>Faster faster faster. Ream her. Grind into her hard and deep. Show her who\u2019s in charge.</p><p>She whimpered.</p><p>\u201cChrist on a crutch this feels so goddamn good it\u2019s killin\u2019 me. I gotta go just a little faster. Shit. Hang on.\u201d In. Out. In. Out. Hot, wet and tight as he sank in to the root. A hot suctioning pull as he withdrew slowly until that ring of muscles clenched around his glans.</p><p>\u201cCarter. Please. Hold on a second.\u201d</p><p>His stomach jumped and he froze with just the plump head of his cock in her ass.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I changed my mind. Don\u2019t go slow. Don\u2019t hold back. Fuck me. Fuck me hard.</p><p>Make me burn. Make me scream. Make me yours.\u201d Macie drove back and impaled herself on his cock.</p><p>Carter slapped her ass and let loose the animal inside him. He shuttled in and out of her ass, ramming harder and harder. Loving the way she accepted this harsher edge of lust, of him. Gripping her hips to keep her in place. Leaving finger-shaped bruises on her beautiful tawny skin. Stretching her to take every inch of him. Marking her. Owning her.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes. The pillow...is rubbing my...clit. Faster. Faster, damn you!\u201d</p><p>He went a little insane at her sexy pleas and reamed her, rode her hard. Lost his mind in her heat, increasing the friction on her clit, rushing her toward the climax she was chasing.</p><p>Macie shrieked.</p><p>The sensations\u2014hot, tight, slick, coupled with her orgasm\u2014were too much. He arched, plunged his cock as deep as it would go and stopped, blowing his seed inside her with a hoarse shout as her muscles clamped down and milked him dry.</p><p>Carter stayed still, humbled, spent, and breathless in body and soul.</p><p>He slumped across her sweat-covered back, keeping that intimate, heady connection as long as possible. When he could function again, he scattered kisses over her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou drive me out of my fuckin\u2019 mind with wantin\u2019 you, Macie. I can\u2019t hold back nothin\u2019. I want every damn thing with you, want to give you everything you\u2019ve ever wanted. I have since the moment I met you.\u201d</p><p>She went absolutely rigid beneath him.</p><p>\u201cWhat, sweet darlin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t feel my arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d He sat up, memorizing the sweet way those muscles yielded to his cock as he eased out. Then he gently rolled her over and undid the ropes. She was breathing hard and her eyes were squeezed shut. He brushed soft kisses across her mouth and over the red marks on her wrists. \u201cBe right back.\u201d He cleaned himself up and brought back a warm washrag to do the same for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Macie was still sprawled on her back. Using tender, soft strokes, he wiped her belly and thighs. Rinsed, and cleaned the stickiness from between her legs. Then he crawled in bed beside her, giving her no choice but to let him hold her.</p><p>Carter knew her silence was an attempt to put distance between them. Not a chance in hell of that happening. He kissed the top of her head. \u201cSo, I guess me fuckin\u2019 you in the ass tonight went beyond normal couple stuff, huh?\u201d</p><p>Macie burst out laughing. \u201cYou are a dumbass, McKay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love it when you sweet talk me, Amazin\u2019 Macie.\u201d He growled, \u201cThat was the hottest sex I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas pretty hot on my end too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight be a little sore. But it was worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. I\u2019d never do anything to hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d be the first.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and breathed her in. \u201cWhat changed earlier tonight? We were talkin\u2019, getting along just fine with our clothes on and then, wham, you were on me like a bear on honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was watching you eat my pie. You tried to be polite and savor it, but in the end, you devoured every bite. Then went back for seconds. You moaned, smacked your lips and would\u2019ve licked the plate clean if your momma\u2019s good manners hadn\u2019t been so ingrained in you.\u201d</p><p>Carter chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYou flat out enjoyed it to the fullest extent.\u201d She paused. \u201cThat\u2019s the way you make me feel sometimes, Carter. Like you wanna be all polite and gentlemanly, but in truth, you\u2019d rather swallow me whole. And you don\u2019t give a damn whether or not I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA little. But when I saw that side of you tonight, I didn\u2019t think. I just reacted.\u201d</p><p>And it didn\u2019t scare her? \u201cWell, it might not be the best side of me, but it is there. And you\u2019re the first one who\u2019s seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to be your first at something, too.\u201d She snuggled into him. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep. But I am gonna wake you up and make love to you later. A couple of times maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember the sore comment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be gentle.\u201d His hands swept down her lithe, pliant body, curled against his.</p><p>\u201cYou never know, I may even be sweet and romantic.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p> <p>A week later, Gemma said, \u201cMacie, can I talk to you for a sec?\u201d</p><p>Macie stood and wiped the dirt from the bunch of leaves. \u201cAm I in trouble? I saw the patches of mint and just started picking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019d forgotten all about this part of the garden.\u201d Gemma leaned on the fence and peered at the wild tangle of vegetation. \u201cSeemed pointless to plant a garden after Steve died. No reason to can vegetables for one. Looks like the herbs have taken over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of sage in Wyoming, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>Gemma chuckled.</p><p>An awkward pause lingered as the sun beat down on them and the gnats swarmed.</p><p>Macie wiped sweat from her brow and slapped away the bugs. \u201cSo, what did you need, Gemma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp. Colby and Channing McKay will be here tomorrow morning. Cash and I are headed over to Meeteetse to look at a couple of bulls tonight and won\u2019t be back until late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat needs done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house is cleaned and ready, but I haven\u2019t had time to cook anything.\u201d</p><p>Macie relaxed. Cooking, she could handle. Cleaning the barns? Yuck. \u201cYou have a menu planned?\u201d</p><p>Gemma shook her head. \u201cBut the freezer and the pantry are both full so there\u2019s plenty of food to choose from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I be working around dietary restrictions? Is Channing a vegetarian or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I think it\u2019s illegal to be a vegetarian in Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at Gemma\u2019s teasing tone. Things were getting easier between them. It was an odd balancing act, with Gemma being her dad\u2019s boss and lover\u2014Macie was never sure when one role was more predominant for him or for her. And Gemma made a point not to intrude on time Macie spent with her dad. So they were both careful not to offend or overextend themselves or their opinions.</p><p>\u201cSo you won\u2019t mind helping out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Might not be politically correct not to aspire to be a world-class chef, but I like to cook. I like to cook for lots of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes one of us. How are things going at the diner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat stinks. Unless you like havin\u2019 time on your hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I like to stay busy, though I do have more time to try out recipes when I\u2019m not flipping burgers. Sitting around drives me crazy.\u201d She shot Gemma a sideways glance as they started toward the house. \u201cWould it be all right if I weeded that garden spot? Clem promised me a few tomato and pepper plants. I\u2019d like to try my hand at gardening.\u201d</p><p>Gemma didn\u2019t hide her shock. \u201cYou\u2019ve never had a garden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom and I didn\u2019t stay in one place very long. Certainly not long enough to see the fruits of my labors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do whatever you want, Macie. I want you to think of this as your home for as long as you\u2019re here, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have time to come up to the house right now and hash this cooking business out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you gonna do with the mint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDry it. Maybe sprinkle some in a batch of brownies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? You\u2019re creative. I never would\u2019ve thought of that.\u201d</p><p>An engine revved in the machine shed, then sputtered and died. Metal clanged on metal.</p><p>Gemma frowned. \u201cDamn old tractor. Something\u2019s always broken around here. I wish your dad would just forget about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance. I never knew that Dad loves to tinker with engines. My Escape is running like a champ now, thanks to him. He has some kind of magic hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll second that,\u201d Gemma muttered. Then she stopped in her tracks and looked up, her mouth open in shock.</p><p>Macie laughed. \u201cNot touching that one, Gemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFoot in mouth disease runs in my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter\u2019s too. So the McKays are descending on us. What is his brother Colby like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharming. Candid. Generous. He and Channing are great. You\u2019ll like them.\u201d</p><p>But will they like me? Rather than dwell on that, or if Carter was going to present them as the couple he insisted they were, she focused on the jobs at hand. Inside the kitchen, Macie made lists and took notes of where assorted pots and utensils were kept.</p><p>Gemma said, \u201cI know it\u2019s only a little after noon, but do you want a beer? I sure could use one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPull up a chair.\u201d</p><p>They sat at the table, drinking in silence. Finally Macie said, \u201cWhy are you looking at bulls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor breeding bucking bulls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce everything is squared away on the Bar 9, are you gonna try to get back into the stock contractor business?\u201d</p><p>Gemma looked surprised that Macie remembered. \u201cGood question. That\u2019s what I\u2019d planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m doin\u2019 it only because it\u2019s what Steve would\u2019ve wanted. Being a contractor is a lot of work and a lot of travel. Which wasn\u2019t so bad right after Steve died, when I didn\u2019t wanna be alone here, where every damn thing reminded me of him and the hole in my life.</p><p>\u201cIt was fun for a couple of years. Getting to know the cowboys and their families.</p><p>Changing things up from town to town, a different rodeo every week. It felt like an extended family, appealing thought to me since I\u2019m low on family.\u201d</p><p>Macie bit back me too and listened.</p><p>Gemma cleared the huskiness from her throat. \u201cBut then things went downhill fast.</p><p>Mike Morgan had a career-ending injury courtesy of one of my steers. Colby was almost killed by a bull in Cheyenne. Some of the other cowboys I\u2019d been friends with for years dropped out \u2019cause they couldn\u2019t make a living rodeoin\u2019. After I quit seeing Cash around the circuit, I realized he was a big part of why I\u2019d liked it so much in the first place.\u201d</p><p>After that personal admission, Macie waited in vain for a look of dismay to cross Gemma\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cIt was my damn pride that kept me away from him. That and fear.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cAnd my age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma, you\u2019re hardly teetering toward the grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart of me knows that. The other part, the skeptical part that looks in the mirror every morning? That part sees wrinkles, gray hair, and luggage under my eyes, and seems to have the upper hand, calling me an old hag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgeism sucks on either end.\u201d</p><p>Gemma gave her a thoughtful look. \u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re too old to do what really makes you happy; everyone thinks I\u2019m too young to know my own mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never thought of you that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes one of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe made mistakes when he was young and wants to make damn sure I don\u2019t repeat them. Although I appreciate the fact he wants to protect me, I am an adult. Sometimes I feel like I never was a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash keeps reminding me age is only a number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. But that means I\u2019m a very old twenty-two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that make me? A very young forty-eight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Macie winked. \u201cWhy, we\u2019re practically the same age.\u201d</p><p>Gemma grinned and clinked her bottle to Macie\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ll drink to that.\u201d</p><p>Her dad walked in as she swallowed the toast. \u201cMy two favorite ladies.\u201d He kissed the top of Macie\u2019s head, then stood behind Gemma and squeezed her shoulders. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For some reason Macie was pleased he\u2019d acknowledged her first.</p><p>\u201cWhatcha ladies doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCelebrating Macie volunteering to pull my ass out of the fire. She\u2019s gonna cook up a storm today before the McKays arrive tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? Honey-girl, that\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo biggie.\u201d Though it was, because she could see how happy it made him.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna wow them with your special caramel apple pie, eh?\u201d He frowned. \u201cHey, didja ever bring back that can of whipped cream you borrowed?\u201d</p><p>Macie choked on her beer, and waved off her father as he started toward her with a worried look on his face.</p><p>Gemma\u2019s eyes narrowed, then widened with comprehension. She hid a grin behind her beer bottle.</p> <p>\u201cYou ready, sweets?\u201d Cash said to Gemma. \u201cWe need to hit the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon as I hit the bathroom.\u201d Gemma stood and smiled at Macie. \u201cThanks again for helping out. I enjoy talking with you. Don\u2019t be a stranger.\u201d She disappeared up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay here alone tonight?\u201d her dad asked. \u201cLast time we left there was a storm\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Carter comin\u2019 over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p> <p>He fiddled with his cowboy hat. \u201cCall him. I\u2019d feel better if he was around.\u201d</p><p>Macie lifted her eyebrows. Dad wanted Carter here? That was a first. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, because I want him to check the cattle before supper. He needs to take care of what\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>Right. The cattle. Instead of that horses-and-cows-and-everything-else-are-more-important-than-me sinking sensation, she knew her dad had meant her. She was important. Macie hid a teary smile and turned away.</p><p>Later that night, Macie was exhausted when Carter barged into Gemma\u2019s kitchen.</p><p>After he kissed her thoroughly, he said, \u201cCome on. I want to show you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t it wait until tomorrow? I\u2019m tired and I have to be up early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be worth your while, I promise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen will you tuck me in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I\u2019ll even let you sleep tonight.\u201d</p><p>They weren\u2019t getting a lot of sleep the nights they were together. If she\u2019d thought the man was dynamic in bed before the whipped cream incident. Whew. It was nothing compared to the stamina with which he made love to her at every opportunity. Just a few hours back he\u2019d wrestled her to the floor in Gemma\u2019s living room and screwed her silly.</p><p>She still couldn\u2019t figure out what\u2019d changed him. In addition to the smokin\u2019 hot sex, they talked into the wee hours. And laughed, Lord, they\u2019d laughed until they cried. They had pillow fights and water wars. They\u2019d crawl in bed and feed each other ice cream. Or snuggle up by the campfire. Sometimes they played cards, although neither of them knew how to play pinochle. They were truly acting like a couple.</p><p>Macie couldn\u2019t remember ever being so happy. Or exhausted.</p><p>She sighed.</p><p>\u201cPlease? Come on, darlin\u2019, be daring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But you better not be taking me snipe hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. Close your eyes.\u201d He slipped something soft over her head. Everything went dark.</p><p>\u201cA blindfold? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see. Trust me.\u201d He clasped her hand in his and led her outside. \u201cIt\u2019s just a short drive.\u201d He helped her into his truck. They rode down the gravel road in silence.</p><p>Macie was a little unnerved, not knowing where they were or what they were doing.</p><p>They walked a ways and stopped.</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d She heard a rustling noise and then Carter picked her up and laid her on something soft flat on the ground.</p><p>\u201cCarter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh. Don\u2019t be scared. I\u2019m here. Keep your eyes closed until I tell you to open them.\u201d He nibbled around the edges of her lips as he slid off the blindfold. One last sweet kiss and he moved away.</p><p>She felt him lay down beside her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, darlin\u2019, you can open them now.\u201d</p><p>Macie blinked her eyes open and stared at the sky above her, which was a magnificent swath of pitch black, punctuated with silver stars. Stars so big she could almost reach out and touch them. Stars bursting with light so bright it was as if she were part of the Milky Way.</p><p>\u201cOmigod. It is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d That wasn\u2019t a lie. She was absolutely floored.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no moon tonight and no clouds. No streetlights or air pollution to diffuse the pure blackness of the sky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it always like this in Wyoming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Maybe once or twice every couple of years. I\u2019ve seen it in the summer when it\u2019s hot as hell, and in the dead of winter when it\u2019s ice cold. I have to admit I like layingon a blanket much better than bein\u2019 wrapped up in a parka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Thank you for sharing this, it\u2019s spectacular.\u201d</p><p>Carter reached for her hand. He swept his thumb over her wrist; he always had to be touching her. It wasn\u2019t annoying; it was soothing, and becoming a familiar and welcome quirk.</p><p>They stargazed in awestruck silence. She had no idea how much time passed. Her mind blanked to everything the majesty stretched out before them and the sweetness of the man laying beside her.</p><p>She blinked and Carter was above her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring you out here to have my wicked way with you, believe it or not.\u201d</p><p>He ran his fingers down the line of her jaw and she shivered.</p><p>\u201cBut I want you. I want to make love to you like this. With starlight on your face.</p><p>With warm sage-scented night air around us and a soft blanket below us. No one around for miles. Just you and me, Macie. As alone as we\u2019ve ever been.\u201d</p><p>They undressed each other slowly and rolled over the blanket, skin to skin.</p><p>Exchanging soft kisses, gentle caresses. A whispered word, a low moan. No hurry. The sexual heat between them simmered, rather than boiled.</p><p>In the breathtaking moment beneath the shimmering stars when Carter slipped inside her body, Macie also felt him slip into her heart.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>Colby and Channing McKay arrived with four pickup loads of bull riding equipment and half the population of Crook County, Wyoming.</p><p>Or so it seemed to Gemma.</p><p>Happy as she was to see wild child Keely McKay, her quiet friend/nemesis Amy Jo Foster, four teenage boys, and a dog named Shithead, Gemma wondered if she and Channing would get a chance to talk privately. Lord knew she needed it.</p><p>She wanted to know if she was acting like an old fool because she\u2019d fallen head over heels in love with Cash Big Crow.</p><p>Macie had overtaken the kitchen and shooed her out. Cash loitered in the paddock setting up the mechanical bull, while Colby and two teenage boys tied one of the practice barrels between two trees. The other boys were hauling more stuff out of the vehicles and carrying it into the barn. Keely and Amy Jo were arguing while they dragged piles of brush for the evening bonfire.</p><p>Where there were cowboys, there were campfires.</p><p>Didn\u2019t take long for the heated argument between the girls to reach her ears.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t let you, Keely, and it\u2019ll just piss him off if you ask him, so drop it.\u201d</p><p>Gemma\u2019s brows lifted. Sweet Amy Jo cursed now? Didn\u2019t take long for Keely McKay to corrupt her.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you acting like my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m trying to keep you from getting killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuh-lease. Do you know how many times I\u2019ve watched\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatching isn\u2019t the same thing as participating.\u201d</p><p>Keely let loose a sultry laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to tell you for months, but do you listen to me? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not talking about... that kind of stuff. We\u2019re talking about you wanting to climb on that stupid mechanical bull. Colby won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I can sweet talk Cash.\u201d</p><p>Amy Jo released a disgusted sigh.</p><p>\u201cOr Carter would let me do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. Carter won\u2019t let you get away with half the shit that Colby does. So give it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t let me try it, I\u2019ll sneak out on my own and do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no you won\u2019t. I\u2019ll tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are supposed to be my friend and back me up on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am your friend. And if you wind up dead, who will I room with in Denver? We already paid the deposit. We\u2019re finally gonna whoop it up, away from\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it goin\u2019, girls?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>Amy Jo gasped and whirled around guiltily.</p><p>Keely jumped. \u201cWhat are you doin\u2019 sneakin\u2019 up on us, Gemma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeein\u2019 if you were up to no good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s always up to no good,\u201d Amy Jo grumbled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I know it.\u201d Gemma smiled. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but overhear you talkin\u2019. You two movin\u2019 someplace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. We\u2019re getting the hell out of Dodge and starting massage therapy school in Denver in September.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a temporary move,\u201d Amy Jo amended. \u201cThe school has an accelerated program, so we\u2019ll be living there for a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of you? Together? In an apartment? With no supervision? Sounds like a disaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like an episode of Sex in the City: Wild Wyoming Women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve seen the look on Dad\u2019s face when I told him I wanted to open a massage parlor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, Keely.\u201d</p><p>Keely smiled cheekily. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. We were just talkin\u2019 about a...man versus woman situation. Men always havin\u2019 the upper hand, tellin\u2019 us what we can and can\u2019t do. You think you could ask Cash if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And if I see you anywhere around that mechanical bull, Miz McKay, I\u2019ll tell your dad what I saw you doin\u2019 in Cheyenne last year. That oughta get you grounded, oh, for life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGrounded?

I\u2019ll shut up now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. Besides, that thing is not one of them wussy bulls they use in cowboy bars and charge you five bucks to try. That one of Colby\u2019s is a nasty piece of machinery and the closest to getting on the back of a real bull. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold ya so,\u201d Amy Jo said.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try to stay out of trouble and see if Cash\u2019s daughter needs any help in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name\u2019s Macie, right?\u201d Amy Jo inquired politely. \u201cShe seems nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seems young.\u201d Keely demanded, \u201cHey, are you using her as free slave labor just because she\u2019s too young to know better and because Cash is working for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s a professional cook and she\u2019s older than you, smarty.\u201d Gemma debated on mentioning Macie\u2019s relationship with Carter, but Keely would find out soon enough.</p><p>\u201cNo way. How old is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-two.\u201d</p><p>Keely and Amy Jo exchanged a look. And a grin. Then they ran to the house.</p><p>Gemma yelled, \u201cNo askin\u2019 her to buy you guys booze. You ain\u2019t old enough to drink!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am. Let\u2019s get shitfaced.\u201d</p> <p>Gemma turned and smiled at Channing. \u201cMacie\u2019s camper is empty and I know she\u2019s got beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d</p><p>Once they each had a cold one, Gemma said, \u201cMarried life agrees with you, Mrs.</p><p>McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it ever. Colby makes me ecstatically happy. I thank my lucky stars every day that we found each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should. How you getting along with the McKays?\u201d</p><p>Channing swigged her beer. \u201cGreat. Carolyn is awesome. Don\u2019t see much of Cord or Colt. You know what Keely is like. Carson would like me more if I was knocked up. And before you ask, no, I\u2019m not pregnant, and since we\u2019ve been married less than a year, no, we aren\u2019t actively trying to populate the world with more wild McKay boys.\u201d She smirked. \u201cWe are practicing a lot though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome things never change.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpeaking of pregnant...how is it that I never knew Cash had a daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knew.\u201d Gemma shared what she\u2019d learned. \u201cSo, he\u2019s workin\u2019 for me, but he\u2019s also tryin\u2019 to have a relationship with Macie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good kid. Hard worker. Sweet, but not a pushover. Wise beyond her years.\u201d</p><p>Gemma shot Channing a sly look. \u201cAnd she\u2019s doin\u2019 some serious practicin\u2019 with your brother-in-law Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Though they pretty much keep to themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby is so going to pay for not telling me that bit of family gossip.\u201d She paused.</p><p>\u201cCash doesn\u2019t have a problem with Carter and Macie doing the nasty right under his nose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a big problem with it. Not a lot he can do; they\u2019re both adults.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. So, tell me about you and Cash doing the nasty. He finally wear you down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I finally swallowed my pride and tracked him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Gemma downed her Coors. \u201cAnd I am so in love with that man it\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Bout damn time you realized that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it didn\u2019t start out that way. I\u2019ve always liked him even when that weird connection between us scared me to death. When he agreed to take over the Bar 9</p><p>foreman duties with certain personal stipulations, I didn\u2019t know what to expect. Cash has always been a loner. He\u2019s set in his ways. He can be a little ornery. A little distant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow why does that sound so familiar? Hmm. Do I know anyone else who fits that description?\u201d</p><p>Gemma swatted at Channing. \u201cSmarty pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he introduced me to Macie and I saw a side of him that broke my heart. He feels so much emotion, the only way he can contain it is to fall back on what he knows and act the part of a stoic Indian. But again, when he\u2019s with me, whether we\u2019re workingor playin\u2019, he lets his guard down, and I see the true Cash Big Crow. The great, humble man who\u2019s been knocked around by life, who\u2019s learning from his mistakes and is still standing proud and tall. He wants to be a better father, a better worker, a better lover, a better man. He ain\u2019t got no quit in him, Channing. And it makes me love him even more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know how you feel?\u201d</p><p>Gemma shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You aren\u2019t still worried about your age difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why haven\u2019t you told him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated. There\u2019s Macie and his guilt about her. He works for me. And I don\u2019t want to do anything that will put a damper on the sex that absolutely blows my fucking mind.\u201d</p><p>Channing leaned forward. \u201cDish the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hot and spontaneous and fun.\u201d She hesitated and blurted, \u201cAnd dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDark like kinky dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo dark as in: we always have sex in complete darkness. Or he makes me wear a blindfold. I\u2019ve never seen his body completely nude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. So I have to wonder: Is it a shyness thing?\u201d</p><p>A calculating look entered Channing\u2019s eyes. \u201cI doubt it. Those circuit cowboys are used to stripping down to their underwear in a whole room full of strangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat don\u2019t make me feel better, Channing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I wonder: Is he weirded out by my body? I sag in spots. Maybe he\u2019s noticed the pockets of fat and wrinkles, but he\u2019s okay touching it if he doesn\u2019t have to see it?\u201d</p><p>Channing choked. \u201cThat\u2019s the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard you say, Gemma Jansen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t think it was ridiculous if was you in the damn dark all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere has to be a reason he insists on darkness. He\u2019s not burned or physically scarred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome weird secret tribal tattoos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it has to be emotional. Maybe a woman laughed at him once and he swore he\u2019d keep all sexual activity hidden in the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe ain\u2019t got nothin\u2019 to be ashamed of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a different kind of Indian thing?\u201d</p><p>Gemma\u2019s beer stopped halfway to her mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot. Then I\u2019m out of ideas. But I think you need to force the issue so you can tell him how you feel. Being in luuurrrrve and all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. He\u2019s only been here two months and I\u2019m gonna confess my love for him?</p><p>He\u2019d hit the South Dakota state line in record time.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cGive him a little credit. And yourself too. He probably feels exactly the same way.\u201d</p><p>A bunch of male whoops echoed from the yard.</p><p>\u201cSounds like the mechanical bull is functioning.\u201d</p><p>Channing scrambled to her feet. \u201cI better make sure Colby isn\u2019t showing those boys how it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>At the paddock, Gemma sidled up to Macie. \u201cYou sick of cookin\u2019 yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Thanks for sending Keely and Amy Jo in to help me.\u201d She gave Gemma a mocking sideways glance. \u201cI managed to accomplish absolutely nothing, but I sure had fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You deserve fun. I\u2019d forgotten Keely was close to your age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever Carter\u2019s mentioned her he makes her sound about twelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Carter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo clue. I thought he\u2019d be here by now.\u201d Macie sighed. \u201cHe tends to lose track of time when he\u2019s working. That\u2019s all he\u2019s been doing lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny idea on how his pieces are coming? I know last time I talked to him he was a little behind schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter sort of mumbles about it when I ask. I\u2019ve never seen a single finished piece.</p><p>Yesterday he was disassembling an old tractor for parts for some kind of sculpture. Said he needed to weld so he shooed me home.\u201d</p><p>Gemma sensed a problem but opted not to press Macie to talk about it.</p><p>They focused their attention on the men standing next to the mechanical bull. Colby explained something, complete with hand gestures. A round of laughter broke out. Then Cash stepped up; the crowd stepped back.</p><p>\u201cYou ever seen your dad ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of times. I know he\u2019s pretty good but I still think he\u2019s crazy for doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen.\u201d</p><p>When Cash climbed on the back of the machine, Gemma\u2019s stomach clenched. Colby turned the machine on high. Barely two seconds passed before Cash was on his ass on the ground.</p><p>Macie gasped.</p><p>\u201cEasy, hon. He\u2019s fine. Just watch.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough. Cash stood, put his hat on his head and climbed back on. He nodded at Colby. Four seconds later Cash was on his hands and knees in the dirt. A minute later he was back on the bull.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna keep doing it, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Macie said. \u201cHe\u2019ll keep doing it until he gets it right, or until he figures out what he\u2019s been doing wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI reckon. He don\u2019t know the meaning of the word quit. When it comes to anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. It makes me hopeful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too, Macie. Me too.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>Firelight skittered across the ground, cutting through the shadows. Wood crackled, sending a shower of orange sparks skyward. The air was temperate, reminiscent of bathwater. His family was here. The food was good. The beer was cold. The soft twang of Western music drifted in the background. Nights didn\u2019t get any better than this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So what was wrong with him?</p><p>Loneliness?</p><p>Invisibility?</p> <p>Hell if he could pinpoint it.</p><p>Somehow Carter managed to keep his sour mood hidden from the rowdy bunch. He smiled and listened to the conversations. He was part of the crowd, but set apart. No one seemed to notice his detachment. Not even Macie.</p><p>Especially not since she\u2019d gotten so chummy with his little sister and Amy Jo Foster.</p><p>Lord, the three of them yapped like a pack of poodles.</p><p>It just served to remind him about the gap between him and Macie. Not necessarily their ages, but...</p> <p>But what? But nothing. You\u2019re looking for excuses because you\u2019re pissed off she\u2019s not sitting by your side like a well-trained poodle. You\u2019re pissed off she\u2019s paying more attention to your family than to you.</p><p>Like that should be a big fuckin\u2019 surprise in his life. He\u2019d always been the McKay in the background. How many times had he heard: Who\u2019s that one again? What\u2019s his name?</p><p>I don\u2019t remember him. He\u2019s so quiet.</p><p>Carter wasn\u2019t a rancher or a rodeo star or a special ops soldier or the county stud or the baby girl. Eight years away at school hadn\u2019t helped him stand out in the McKay family and ensured his spot at the bottom of the McKay pecking order.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as if he burned to be the center of attention tonight or any other night. But between Colby regaling the greenhorns with his rodeo exploits, Gemma chatting up a storm with Channing, Cash scowling at him, Macie ignoring him, he felt the urge to get really really drunk.</p><p>Damn, he wished his buddy Jack was here. Jack wouldn\u2019t put up with this shit attitude. Jack\u2019s motto was: \u201cBe a man. Find some pussy, get fucked up, pick some fights and pass out.\u201d Jack swore the only way to get out of a funk was to suffer through a debilitating day-long hangover. \u201cFeelin\u2019 like shit makes you appreciate the shit you\u2019ve got,\u201d was Jack\u2019s other mantra.</p> <p>Man. He\u2019d welcome an ass kicking from Jack. Feeling sorry for himself was an indication he\u2019d spent too much time alone. Might make him a pussy, but he realized he missed his pal. It\u2019d been a couple of months since they\u2019d talked, longer since they\u2019d hung out. After spending damn near three years together in graduate school, they\u2019d parted ways after graduation. Work had taken them in different directions.</p><p>Work. That\u2019s what he should be doing anyway. Maybe he was just feeling guilty for leaving stuff undone. It\u2019d be best all around if he slipped away and returned to work.</p><p>Not that anyone believed being an artist was work. His family hinted that Carter the</p><p>\u201carteest\u201d sat around staring into space, waiting for inspiration to strike him. Then he\u2019d paint furiously, finish the piece and wait for another visit from the muse.</p><p>Right-o.</p><p>He wished that damn elusive muse would hurry up; he was sweating this deadline big time. It didn\u2019t help his time management issues that he\u2019d taken two fairly substantial commissions, on the sly, strictly for the money. Yeah, he\u2019d justified it by telling himself it was still art, his art, and he had a truck payment to make. Hopefully the next time the muse visited she\u2019d bring him a bucketful of cash. That\u2019d inspire the hell out of him.</p><p>Macie giggled. Carter\u2019s head snapped up and his gut clenched from the potency of her smile. When had he seen her so happy? Was his tendency to brood wearing off on her? Or had she been drawn to him because she had that same dark intensity and she understood it? Neither of them could be accused of a happy-go-lucky personality. Except when they were together.</p><p>When was the last time he\u2019d witnessed that side of her?</p> <p>She\u2019d acted pretty damn playful that night in the car when she\u2019d whipped out her vibrator.</p><p>Not helping, thinking about what you want but can\u2019t have right now.</p><p>Carter eased out of the lawn chair and snagged a beer from the cooler. He kept his back to the fire and stared off into the darkness. Bits of conversations floated to him.</p><p>Gemma said, \u201cI did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used to flirt with him shamelessly, Gem. I saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Trevor? Lord, Cash, you need glasses.\u201d</p><p>Keely piped in, \u201cTrevor Glanzer is a total hottie. I flirt with him every chance I get.</p><p>I\u2019d do him in a heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>Choking sounds came from where Channing sat.</p><p>Amy Jo said, \u201cKeely! Omigod I can\u2019t believe you said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s true. I think every woman here would take a crack at him, am I right, ladies?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cFine. You\u2019re all lying to yourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely, I\u2019m havin\u2019 Dad tie you up in the chicken coop when we get home,\u201d Colby said dryly.</p><p>\u201cHe tried once, said it was for my own good to save me from myself. Didn\u2019t work.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have made sure I know my way around ropes if he\u2019d intended to use them on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d save you,\u201d one of the greenhorns said. \u201cAin\u2019t nothin\u2019 wrong with speakin\u2019 your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Marky-mark, you are sweeter than ten pounds of sugar,\u201d Keely cooed. \u201cYou remember you said that to me when I look you up in a few years, when you\u2019re a world-famous bull rider, fendin\u2019 off all them hot buckle bunnies. You probably won\u2019t have the time of day for a little ol\u2019 country cowgirl like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw shoot, Keely, that\u2019d never happen.\u201d</p><p>Carter snorted. Keely the cowboy conqueror had struck again.</p><p>He heard the cooler lid open and slam shut. Macie sidled up to him. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awful quiet tonight.\u201d</p><p>He grunted.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Laughter erupted behind them. Conversations rose and fell.</p><p>Carter looked up at the sky. \u201cHard to believe it was just last night we were layin\u2019 on a blanket lookin\u2019 at the stars.\u201d He drained his beer. \u201cSeems a lifetime ago.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on his arm.</p><p>He faced her. There was that punch in his gut again. \u201cYou look beautiful by firelight, Macie. So goddamn beautiful you make me ache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want so much to...shit. I can\u2019t be here right now.\u201d He spun on his heel and pitched his beer bottle in the trashcan.</p><p>He said, \u201cSee ya\u2019ll tomorrow,\u201d and half-heard the shouted goodbyes as he let dust devils and bad memories chase him home.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>Feeling stung by Carter\u2019s behavior, Macie returned to her chair by the fire, anxiety replacing her earlier relaxation.</p><p>The discussions among the group were less raucous. The four bull rider wannabes stumbled to their tent on the other side of the house. People were starting to yawn. The campfire burned to a pile of red embers.</p><p>Suddenly Colby grabbed Channing\u2019s hand and jerked her to her feet. \u201cWe\u2019re goin\u2019 to bed. \u2019Night.\u201d</p><p>Keely snickered. \u201cDidja notice he didn\u2019t say they were going to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that,\u201d Colby shouted over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well remember we can all hear you. Keep it down tonight, Tarzan and Jane.</p><p>Those two, I swear. Everyone in three counties knows when they\u2019re doin\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that too, Keely McKay,\u201d he barked again. \u201cGet your smart butt in the camper before I whip it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But I will remind you I am an adult.\u201d Keely and Amy Jo argued all the way to the horse trailer.</p><p>Cash and Gemma doused the fire, said goodnight and disappeared into the house.</p><p>Macie remained outside alone, but she wasn\u2019t tired. She tilted her head and studied the night sky. It was as beautiful as always, something she\u2019d taken for granted. She knew she\u2019d never look at the stars the same.</p><p>Carter. It\u2019d surprised her he hadn\u2019t shown up right away to welcome his family. She hadn\u2019t seen him until supper. Even then he hadn\u2019t said much. He drifted into the background. No one seemed to notice his withdrawn behavior.</p><p>Unless...that was his normal behavior with his family. The distant one. The quiet one.</p><p>Now that she thought about it, it was kind of weird, Carter living on Gemma\u2019s ranch, when the McKays owned tens of thousands of acres. Surely they could\u2019ve found someplace for him to live and work. He had family there. Roots there.</p><p>But were those roots strangling him?</p><p>His words, I\u2019m nothing like my brothers, echoed in the back of her mind .</p><p>Along with, there\u2019s no place for me on the home place.</p><p>Even with all his family surrounding him, having a shared history, and a constant connection, did Carter suffer from the same sense of displacement she did?</p><p>She never felt displaced when she was with him. She suspected he felt the same. But she hadn\u2019t really been with him tonight, not like she\u2019d wanted. Not like he\u2019d wanted, apparently, since he\u2019d left.</p><p>Macie climbed in her car and drove to his place.</p><p>The lights were off in his trailer, a glow spilled through the cracks in the wooden slats of the barn.</p><p>He was working. Big surprise. He was always working.</p><p>Well, the time had come for a little play.</p><p>Rather than sneak inside his sanctuary, she shouted, \u201cCarter?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\u201cCarter, are you in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Yeah. Can I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Shit. Hang on. Just a second.\u201d Unfamiliar shuffling, creaking, and crashing noises sounded, followed by, \u201cIt\u2019s clear. You can come in now.\u201d</p><p>Macie skirted piles in the darkened walkway and didn\u2019t look up until she\u2019d reached the main portion of the barn.</p><p>When she saw Carter, her heart skipped a beat. He looked so...raw. A powerful male, his sweaty chest bared. Ripped sweatpants hanging from his hips, drawing her attention to his ripped abs. His hair was damp and curlier than normal. His lips were full, a little pouty, his jaw rigid, and his eyes...his eyes.</p><p>Lord God almighty his eyes were absolutely savage.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think straight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy are you here, Macie?\u201d</p><p>The guarded look on his face said he expected her to say I\u2019m here for hot sex, baby cakes, strip.</p><p>And seeing him standing there, all tough and masculine and yummy\u2014it was tempting to be flip and reduce this... need to be here for him tonight into nothing more than a physical act. But at some point in the last few days, things between them had gone beyond physical. So, she simply said, \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>The energy drink in his hand stopped halfway to his mouth. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you.\u201d She took a step toward him. \u201cSurprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Look. I know you were upset tonight. I don\u2019t know why, and I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t notice until right before you left.\u201d Another step. \u201cBut I\u2019m here now, in case you want to talk about it or something.\u201d</p><p>Carter\u2019s eyes devoured her. Then he threw the drink can over his shoulder and charged. A hand dove into her hair and his mouth slammed down on hers. Hot. Hungry.</p><p>Greedy. Achingly familiar.</p><p>During the consuming kiss, Carter\u2019s body was plastered against hers, yet as he ate at her mouth, his fingertips softly caressed her face.</p><p>She moved her lips a fraction of an inch. \u201cCarter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done kissing you.\u201d And he absolutely destroyed her with the ferocity of his need. Finally, he gentled his kiss. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you left early. I thought you\u2019d be happy that your family was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. But I know my place in the McKay clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>Carter rubbed his cheek along her hairline. \u201cI\u2019m the quiet one.\u201d</p><p>She considered that. \u201cI\u2019m the last person who knows anything about family dynamics. But I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not the quiet one with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never have to guess how you feel. Granted, I don\u2019t always like it, but you don\u2019t hold back anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the first time anyone has ever said that to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. So tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>Carter sighed. \u201cWhen I\u2019m with you, I feel like I\u2019m really me. I don\u2019t have anything to prove. You just let me be who I am. That\u2019s not always the case with my family. And tonight, maybe it was childish, but I hated that I couldn\u2019t show them...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShow them who I am when I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? A bossy sexual deviant?\u201d</p><p>She felt him smile against her temple. \u201cMaybe. But I couldn\u2019t. Then I got really selfish and didn\u2019t want to share you with them either. You\u2019re mine, and I know even sayin\u2019 that is just plain wrong.\u201d</p><p>Wrong or not, his words sent a thrill through her. \u201cSince they\u2019re not here, how about if you show me instead? Remind me of who I am when I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf my bossy sexual deviance?\u201d</p><p>She brushed her lips over his collarbone, tasting sweat and mineral spirits on his hot skin. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want. I didn\u2019t come here for sex, Carter. I just wanted to be here if you needed me.\u201d</p><p>His hoarse laugh vibrated on the top of her head. \u201cOh, I need you, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. You\u2019re not here for my sexual deviance, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am if that\u2019s what you need from me tonight.\u201d She placed another tender kiss on his pec. \u201cShow me who you are with me. I\u2019m yours tonight to do or be whatever you want. You already know I can\u2019t say no to you. I don\u2019t want to say no. When I\u2019m with you, I feel like I\u2019m really me too. Tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>Carter sought her mouth, kissing her, toying with her lips. Then his breath tickled her ear. \u201cWhat I want? Well, I don\u2019t want to talk; I want to feel. You. Me. Us. Nothing matters beyond what we are together. I want your mouth on me, Macie. I want to see my cock slippin\u2019 between these sweet, sweet lips. I want to wrap my hands in your hair and feel you suckin\u2019 me deep, suckin\u2019 me hard. And when I can\u2019t stand how good it feels, when I\u2019m about to explode, I wanna come on your tits.\u201d</p><p>A flood of moisture burst in her panties. \u201cOh wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou rethinkin\u2019 that \u2018whatever\u2019 comment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Macie placed her hands on his head. She looked directly into his eyes and repeated, \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Carter growled.</p><p>In one fast movement she yanked her camisole tank up until disappeared over her head. Her shorts hit the dirt and she was buck-assed naked before him.</p><p>Macie licked her way down his torso, stopping to taste his belly button as she slid his sweatpants to his ankles. She dropped to her knees and gripped his muscular ass. She let her tongue tease his plump cockhead, until his cock jerked and clear fluid leaked out. She lapped at it like candy.</p><p>Carter rifled his fingers through her hair and sighed.</p><p>She opened wide and sucked that delicious male hardness halfway. Released it, and sucked it all the way in.</p><p>A strangled groan echoed above her.</p><p>She took her cue from Carter on how fast he needed her mouth moving. If he started to thrust his hips into her face, she increased the pace. She lost herself in his clean, salty taste. The erotic pull of that hard silken skin over her tongue and lips. The slick feel of her saliva coating his shaft and the excess running down to glaze her face and neck. His heady masculine scent enveloped her in a musky cloud of need as she reveled in this closeness. The tantalizing sounds of his unrestrained pleasure as she gave him this intimate kiss.</p><p>\u201cMacie. You have no idea how fuckin\u2019 fantastic it feels.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. Carter\u2019s neck was arched; his head thrown back in abandon.</p><p>Those blue eyes were squeezed shut and he was slack-jawed. The muscles in his stomach quivered as his chest rose and fell rapidly. His arms shook from the effort to hold her head gently.</p><p>He was stunningly beautiful lost in passion. She\u2019d never seen anything so powerful.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt so powerful.</p><p>Macie was wet everywhere, her mouth, her chin, her neck. Especially between her thighs.</p><p>Carter pumped a little faster. She increased the suction. He groaned, pulled out completely and fisted his hand around his cock, keeping one hand tightly clutching her hair. \u201cAh. Shit. Yes. There it is.\u201d</p><p>She watched as white spurts arced in the air and splashed on her chest. Warm at first, then the fluid cooled as it slid down her sweat-coated skin. She looked up at Carter, who was watching everything with heavy lidded eyes: his hand slowly pumping his spent cock, his come splattering on her breasts and dripping off her nipples.</p><p>Macie licked her chafed lips.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d He sidestepped her, and she heard clanking, fabric rustling. Then from behind her he said: \u201cLay back. I put a blanket down.\u201d</p><p>Macie\u2019s heart raced as he propped himself on his elbow next to her. The lust-filled look in his eyes hadn\u2019t dimmed one iota. \u201cCarter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh, sweet darlin\u2019. Whatever I want, remember? And right now I want to paint you.\u201d A small brush appeared and he swirled it through the sticky spots he\u2019d left on her chest. \u201cI\u2019ve been paintin\u2019 you a lot. But never like this. Because this time, I\u2019m paintingyou with me.\u201d</p><p>The soft bristles and his sexy words sent shivers racing over her bared flesh.</p><p>Carter zigzagged the paintbrush through the wetness around her nipples and down her belly. Straight to her clit. He flicked the brush over the distended nub and she gasped at the ticklish sensation. He swept the bristles side to side over her slit, inserting the brush a few inches to make circles inside her pussy.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m on you.\u201d He kissed her. \u201cAnd in you.\u201d He used the brush to paint two lines on his chest over his heart. \u201cNow you\u2019re on me.\u201d He brought the paintbrush to her eye level and traced his lips with the wetness, before sucking the tip into his mouth. \u201cAnd in me.\u201d</p><p>When she gasped again, he smashed his mouth to hers, rubbing her lips against his.</p><p>He whispered, \u201cTaste us, taste what we are together,\u201d before plunging his tongue between her teeth.</p><p>Macie had never been so hot in her life. She jerked on Carter\u2019s shoulders and attempted to roll him on top of her. He crashed into a table and open jars and tubes of paint rained down around them. Blue splotted her chest. Yellow on her arm. Black on her shoulder. In trying to wipe it away, Carter smeared it more thoroughly into her skin.</p><p>Cursing, he grabbed random tubes and squeezed, his fingers leaving random trails of color on her body.</p><p>She threw her arms above her head. \u201cPut your hands on me. I need\u2014\u201d</p><p>Then his paint-coated hands were tracking the hypersensitive skin from her wrists down to her armpits, making her skin a mass of gooseflesh.</p><p>She writhed and arched beneath him, whimpering, craving this side of him, knowing this was who he was to her.</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d Carter\u2019s hands plumped her breasts and his thumbs swept her nipples.</p><p>\u201cYes. More.\u201d</p><p>His sticky palms raced over her ribs, smearing blue paint across her belly. His mouth was busy on her throat.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I want...Carter. I\u2019m on fire. I need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014to come. I know, darlin\u2019, I\u2019m there.\u201d Hands covered in black paint slapped the inside of her thighs and pushed them out. He buried his face in her pussy and ate at her like he\u2019d eaten the pie.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes!\u201d Macie grabbed his head and ground her throbbing sex into his face.</p><p>When she started to come, Carter kept her clit captive between his teeth and flicked his tongue back and forth until she screamed.</p><p>Rough fingers scraped the outside of her calves while the pleasure receptors in her brain detonated. His hot breath burned her ear. \u201cI want to fuck you from behind. Get on your hands and knees.\u201d</p><p>She vaguely heard the crackle of a condom package.</p><p>Somehow she flopped to her belly. Carter jacked her hips in the air and slammed into her. It didn\u2019t matter as she was so wet and so ready to take him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He fucked her hard. Not fast. Methodically. Each stroke deep. When she knew he was close, she gyrated her hips. He leaned over her back and hissed, \u201cThis is my art show. You will not rush me. You will stay still and taking every fuckin\u2019 stroke I give you, Macie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter\u2014\u201d</p><p>He whacked her butt.</p> <p>She whimpered.</p><p>He smacked his hand into her behind again. Harder.</p><p>She whimpered louder.</p><p>\u201cInterestin\u2019. I think you like it. Next time maybe I\u2019ll spank this ass good and red before I fuck it.\u201d</p><p>Why didn\u2019t the thought of that absolutely humiliate her?</p> <p>Because he could do any damn thing he pleased to her body and she\u2019d ask for more.</p><p>It gave her a sense of security because she knew he\u2019d never ask for\u2014or take from her\u2014</p><p>what she wasn\u2019t willing to offer.</p><p>\u201cIf I had a bottle or a candle or a dildo I\u2019d slide it in your ass. Let you feel being fucked both places at once. By me. Would you like that, dirty girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Carter dug his fingers into her hips and came with a snarl, her name on his lips.</p> <p>Macie\u2019s orgasm exploded on the heels of his, her greedy vaginal walls keeping him buried deep as he pulsed and throbbed and lost his fucking mind in her heat and passion.</p><p>They fell to the ground, Carter on top of her and inside her. Breathing heavily.</p><p>Her cheek was pressed into the canvas. She cracked one eye open and noticed yellow and blue streaks. \u201cWhoa. How much paint is on my arm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as other places.\u201d</p><p>How had she not noticed? Right. She\u2019d been a little distracted by his mouth on her clit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re covered in it. Sorry, I got a little carried away. It was just so damn sexy, getting to use my hands to paint you. To spread colors on your beautiful curves, especially since I can\u2019t seem to get them to look right on canvas.\u201d He sighed. \u201cLord, woman, you just fulfilled my top fantasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Remember that when it comes time to fill mine, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean cowboys?\u201d</p> <p>She changed the subject. \u201cThe paint washes off, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. It\u2019s oil paint. We\u2019ll have to use turpentine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my darlin\u2019, oh my darlin\u2019, oh my darlin\u2019, turpentine...\u201d</p><p>He snickered. \u201cYou\u2019re singin\u2019? I think the paint fumes have affected your brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would know all about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMean,\u201d Carter whispered against the nape of her neck. \u201cYou are mean as a snake sometimes, Amazin\u2019 Macie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just told me I fulfilled your ultimate fantasy and now you\u2019re calling me mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. You\u2019ve blown my mind to the point I ain\u2019t thinkin\u2019 straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you could think straight long enough to get your dick out of me before the paint fuses it there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, sugar pie, honey bun, would that be so bad?\u201d His tongue swiped the shell of her ear and she trembled. \u201cI seem to remember a certain hot Indian chick beggin\u2019 me to put that dick in that very spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery ungentlemanly of you to bring it up, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He pulled out and rested his head in the middle of her back. \u201cStay with me tonight. I want you sleepin\u2019 in my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothin\u2019. You said I could have whatever I want, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She muttered, \u201cI knew that statement would come around to bite me in the ass.\u201d</p><p>He slithered down and chomped her left butt cheek.</p><p>\u201cCarter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t give a man ideas, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d get the idea to get off of me. Soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you promise you\u2019ll stay with me.\u201d</p><p>It made her heart hitch to hear the pride battling with the need in his voice. \u201cOkay. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He stood and helped her to her feet. Carter spun her into his arms for a long, sweet kiss and a bone-crushing hug. He rested his chin on the top of her head. \u201cThank you, Macie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor knowin\u2019 what I needed when I didn\u2019t know myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know you needed a blowjob?\u201d</p><p>Carter slapped her butt. \u201cI\u2019m not talkin\u2019 \u2019bout sex. I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about... Never mind.</p><p>Just forget it.\u201d</p><p>He tried to squirm away but Macie held fast. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for being flip. Tell me what you meant.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to mollify him. \u201cFor lettin\u2019 me show you my intensity. For seein\u2019 me.</p><p>The real me. You seem to know what I need. No one else ever has. No one has ever cared. You make me feel...whole.\u201d</p><p>They stayed locked together in a silence weighted with both spoken and unspoken words.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>\u201cNo. Keep yourself centered. That\u2019s it. Keep that free arm wavin\u2019 high. Use them spurs! You\u2019re off\u2014\u201d Shit.</p><p>And the kid hit the dirt with a loud grunt. The lanky boy stood and threw his cowboy hat in disgust. \u201cI ain\u2019t ever gonna get it.\u201d</p><p>Cash said, \u201cWalk it off, son. Take a coupla minutes to cool down then come back and try\u2019er again. That\u2019s the only way you\u2019re gonna get better.\u201d</p><p>The kid jammed his hat back on his head and limped off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty good with these kids, Cash.\u201d</p><p>He angled his head to look at Colby, who\u2019d hopped up on the fence. \u201cYou sound surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Speaking of kids...how come I didn\u2019t know you had one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSubtle as a freight train, ain\u2019t ya?\u201d</p><p>Colby shrugged. \u201cIt fits, since I\u2019m more than a little steamed at you. Why didn\u2019t you tell me about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone. Trevor found out a couple of years ago when Macie came to see me rodeo. He hit on her; I hit him. He\u2019s kept his mouth shut since then. He\u2019s good at keepin\u2019 secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say,\u201d Colby muttered. \u201cSo are you. We traveled together for what? Three years?</p><p>And you never once mentioned her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you blame me? With the way she looks and the way you went through women?</p><p>I didn\u2019t want her nowhere near McKay cowboys or the rodeo circuit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t workin\u2019 out so well for you, now, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cSo what is goin\u2019 on between your beautiful daughter and my brother Carter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s paintin\u2019 her or some damn thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it ain\u2019t like I\u2019m gonna ask either of them for particulars. They are spendingtime together, whatever that means. I just know something he did upset her last week.</p><p>And that upset me. You had the misfortune of callin\u2019 me right after I got done talkin\u2019 to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I ain\u2019t talked to Carter about it, but I do know he\u2019s a good guy. He\u2019s way more a gentleman than the rest of us. Educated. He\u2019s laid back. I doubt he\u2019s playin\u2019 her, he just ain\u2019t that type.\u201d</p><p>Cash snorted.</p><p>\u201cBesides, does it really matter? They\u2019re both young. They ain\u2019t gonna settle down and set up housekeepin\u2019. This is probably just a summer fling. They\u2019ll fight and fuck and move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to make me feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I don\u2019t want your newfound parental instincts to cloud your judgment, Cash. Yes, Macie is your daughter, and you\u2019re lookin\u2019 out for her. Truth is, she and Carter are both adults and they gotta work out whatever is goin\u2019 on between them, themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically you\u2019re tellin\u2019 me to butt out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Cash believed Colby was right on some level. But it also made him wonder how well Colby knew his brother. Carter McKay wasn\u2019t the love \u2019em and leave \u2019em type, which was why Cash was so worried about Macie.</p><p>You can\u2019t have it both ways. You\u2019re afraid she\u2019ll settle down with him; yet, you\u2019re afraid he\u2019ll leave her high and dry.</p><p>No. Cash was afraid that no matter what happened with Carter, Macie would leave him.</p><p>\u201cSo as long as I left my subtlety at home, how\u2019s it goin\u2019 with you and Gemma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Colby sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried life has made you gossipy as an old hen, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. You and Gemma have been circlin\u2019 each other for damn near two years.</p><p>Now you\u2019re workin\u2019 on her ranch and sleepin\u2019 in her bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you sent her my direction because you knew I was lookin\u2019 for work, and I appreciate that. But that don\u2019t mean I\u2019ll be spillin\u2019 my guts to you or anyone about what happens behind closed doors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Then tell me what\u2019s happening with her stock contracting business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much dead. Appears no promoters wanna give her a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t because of what happened with Mike Morgan last summer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot entirely. The last guy she had helpin\u2019 bad-mouthed her to everyone in five states. Evidently he was pissed off she wasn\u2019t payin\u2019 him more. He took a job with one of the bigger stock contractors and even the little rodeos won\u2019t return her calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks. What\u2019re you doin\u2019 to help her get back in the game?\u201d</p><p>Cash scratched his chin. \u201cHonestly? Nothin\u2019. I don\u2019t know why she\u2019d want to travel when she\u2019s got this beautiful chunk of land to call home. Hell. I\u2019d never wanna leave here.\u201d</p><p>Colby nodded in understanding.</p><p>\u201cShe finally let me look at the books last month. Even during the busiest month last summer when she supplied stock for two rodeos a week, she was barely breakin\u2019 even. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Add in the fact she has to hire an overseer for the Bar 9 when she\u2019s gone, and she\u2019s flat out losin\u2019 money.

Let some other fool take on the headache of draggin\u2019 animals to rodeos all over the damn country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d come to the same realization right before she hired me. She wants to focus on buildin\u2019 a breedin\u2019 program, with both broncs and bulls. She\u2019s smart. She runs a damn fine operation and I\u2019m lucky to be a part of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s lucky to have you helpin\u2019 her, Cash. You know your shit and aren\u2019t gonna feed her full of none. Which was one of the reasons I recommended you.\u201d</p><p>Embarrassed by Colby\u2019s praise, Cash changed the subject. \u201cHow\u2019s your leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurts like a sonuvabitch most days.\u201d Colby gave Cash a cool look. \u201cYou repeat that to Channing and I\u2019ll kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>Cash laughed, mostly because he figured Channing already knew. \u201cI noticed her watchin\u2019 you like a hawk yesterday around that buckin\u2019 bull. She\u2019s afraid you\u2019re gonna get on and show us all how it\u2019s done, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well. She don\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t sell the whole shootin\u2019 match outright.\u201d Colby stared off into the distance. After a while he said, \u201cDo you miss it?\u201d</p> <p>Cash knew it meant all that went along with rodeoin\u2019 and being a professional rodeo cowboy. \u201cSometimes. I don\u2019t miss the bruises and the constant body aches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr all the boring hours spent in the truck on the road between events,\u201d Colby added.</p><p>\u201cOr the bad food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the bad draws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the low scores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the low payouts.\u201d</p> <p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cHell yeah, I miss it,\u201d Colby said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Now was as good a time as any for Cash to broach the subject he\u2019d been wrestling with all morning. With any luck it wouldn\u2019t tip Colby off. \u201cYou keep in touch with many of the guys on the circuit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wonderin\u2019 what Trevor\u2019s up to these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still chasin\u2019 the Finals dream. Though, he had a pretty serious fallin\u2019 out with his dad about it. I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t seen him this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe ain\u2019t been competin\u2019 in the rinky-dink rodeos I\u2019d been workin\u2019. You have his number? I accidentally tossed it. Thought I might give him a call. I need to ask him a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. This favor anything I can help with?\u201d</p> <p>He nearly choked. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Colby sat up taller and grinned from ear to ear. \u201cHey, shug, you lookin\u2019 for me?\u201d</p><p>Cash turned around and watched Channing crook her little finger at her husband.</p><p>Colby jumped off the fence like it\u2019d suddenly caught fire.</p><p>Cash grinned. Maybe someday soon, if he played his cards right, Gemma would look at him like that.</p><p>Gemma. Lord, thinking about the smokin\u2019 hot sex last night still made his dick hard.</p><p>He\u2019d figured once they\u2019d retired to their room, she\u2019d be too worn out to make love.</p><p>Or she\u2019d be worried about having sex with other people staying in the house.</p><p>Had he been wrong.</p><p>They\u2019d started messing around, and the need between them flared as hot and urgent as it always did. He\u2019d gone down on her\u2014man did he love going down on her, the sweet noises she made were music to his ears, but she\u2019d literally turned the tables on him. She\u2019d flipped around so she could suck his cock while he ate her pussy. He\u2019d never been especially fond of sixty-nine until last night when the law of averages caught up with them and they\u2019d actually come at the same time. Explosively. Feeling his cock throb hot spurts in her suctioning mouth while she came, undulating against his face... Well, he\u2019d have to rethink his position on that particular position.</p><p>But Gemma hadn\u2019t been satisfied. She wanted to make love face to face. With the lights on.</p><p>He\u2019d said no. She\u2019d insisted. When he offered a compromise of making love with her blindfolding him, she offered a new threat: One of these nights she\u2019d wait until he fell asleep, then she\u2019d hog-tie him, turn the lights on and fuck him exactly how she wanted.</p><p>For as long as she wanted. In the position she wanted. She haughtily informed him there wouldn\u2019t be a damn thing he could do about it.</p><p>Cash knew she\u2019d follow through with the threat. And he wasn\u2019t ready for her to see the truth of how he felt about her. So he pretended to laugh it off and waited until she fell asleep.</p><p>He snuck out of bed and cut an old T-shirt of Steve\u2019s into one long strip. Making sure the bottle of lube was nearby, he murmured instructions in her ear.</p><p>She didn\u2019t protest, just sleepily rolled to her stomach. As he bound her wrists behind her back, she woke up.</p><p>Spitting mad.</p><p>Her fury lasted about a minute until she felt his slippery thumb stroking her clit and his fingers snaking up inside her, bringing her to a fast orgasm. While she recovered, he hiked her hips in the air and squirted more lube on his fingers and his straining cock.</p><p>Gemma gasped when he squeezed a dollop on her anus.</p><p>\u201cCash\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he have you here?\u201d He inserted two fingers in her ass.</p><p>She sucked in a breath and released it on a moan, nodding.</p><p>\u201cGood. Then you\u2019ll know what to expect.\u201d He scissored his fingers inside that dark hole, stretching her to fit him. He angled over her arched spine to whisper in her ear.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t expect I\u2019d stay out of this gorgeous ass forever, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, this is the way I deal with threats, sweets, call it a pre-emptive strike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s hog-tied now, Gem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. Me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m gonna fuck you exactly where I want, and how I want, as long as I want, exactly as I\u2019ve fantasized and there ain\u2019t a damn thing you can do about it, is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He growled, \u201cIf I knew where your vibrator was I\u2019d shove it up your pussy while I ream this tight hole. You fantasize about having two men at once. Two men fucking you in every way imaginable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want that, Gemma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother time. Right now, I\u2019m gonna fuck you so hard that you remember who makes the decisions in the bedroom. I\u2019m gonna fuck and use this ass to the absolute limit and you\u2019re gonna love it, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Oh\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cash impaled her to the root on the first stroke. He reached between her thighs and rubbed her clit while he tunneled in and out of her ass. Faster. Harder. Each thrust had enough force to send her knees sliding toward the headboard. He wrapped his hands around her waist and jerked her back to the end of the bed and started over.</p><p>She smelled good. She felt good too. As much as he wanted to stay buried in that hot, tight channel, Cash couldn\u2019t hold back.</p><p>Neither could Gemma. She came, muffling her cries into the pillow as his cock pumped and jerked and finally shot his load high and hard into that hot, tight portal.</p><p>Gemma flopped to her stomach after he eased out of her. He was half afraid he\u2019d been too rough. But after he loosened the bindings and spooned against her, she murmured, \u201cI\u2019ll have to threaten you more often.\u201d</p><p>Two shouts sounded from the tent bringing Cash back to reality. The boys returned for their riding lessons and all thoughts beyond rodeo disappeared.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-nine</p><p>Later Cash was taking a breather, enjoying the serenity of the ranch when he heard footsteps behind him. When he turned to see his daughter approaching, his heart lightened. They hadn\u2019t spent much time together recently, and he was afraid it wouldn\u2019t take much to snap the tentative connection they\u2019d established.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoka hey, honey-girl.\u201d Poor thing looked tired. \u201cGemma finally parole you from kitchen duty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you cooking is not a chore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose it is different when you\u2019re good at it.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cIf I\u2019ve forgotten to tell you, the food\u2019s been mighty tasty the last coupla days. I know everyone\u2019s been talkingabout it. I\u2019m proud of you for pitchin\u2019 in.\u201d</p><p>Macie blushed. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>The scent of hot dirt permeated the air as they gazed across the paddock. A pair of crows circled the turquoise sky, their caw caw lost in the breeze blowing through the stand of cedar trees.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it is. I was just thinkin\u2019 the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t been riding for a couple of days.\u201d She picked at a loose chunk of wood on the fence. \u201cBut I suppose you\u2019re pretty busy, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too busy for you. Wanna go out right after supper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Is Gemma tired of me taking her horse all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s glad. Daisy needs the exercise and she\u2019s been swamped catchin\u2019 up on ranch paperwork.\u201d</p><p>A truck whizzed by on the gravel road, sending clouds of chalky dust across the rocky field.</p><p>Macie angled her chin toward the empty mechanical bull. \u201cWhat was the toss off rate today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighty-five percent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than the ninety-nine percent from yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. So how many times did you have to demonstrate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not all beat up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d But the truth was, all damn day he had been feeling some of those old aches and pains from previous rodeo injuries.</p><p>\u201cHuh. That gives you no excuse not to give me a personal demonstration on your bull ridin\u2019 expertise.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and teased, \u201cCome on, Dad. Show me how an old pro does it. Every time I saw you yesterday you were eatin\u2019 dirt.\u201d</p><p>Cash bit back a grin. \u201cThink your old man ain\u2019t got it in him anymore?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t appear you had it in you yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a new day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive bucks says you land on your butt before the buzzer sounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on, girlie.\u201d He strode toward the piece of equipment and whirled around to remind her, \u201cHit the switch when I nod my head. Then sit back and prepare to be awed.\u201d</p><p>Macie\u2019s laughter filled something inside him he hadn\u2019t realized was empty. He hopped on the machine and jerked on his riding glove. He wrapped the bull rope.</p> <p>Unwrapped it and rewrapped it.</p><p>\u201cAre you stalling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish. Get ready to pay up.\u201d Cash adjusted his hat over his eyes. Moved his hips from side to side. Threw his free arm up in the air and nodded.</p><p>The bull kicked on. It spun right; Cash readjusted his knees when the movement blew his feet out and up. The front end lifted, slamming him back, but he didn\u2019t fight it and stayed on. Another jumping right spin. Two hard lefts, one last buck and the eight seconds were history and he was still on.</p><p>He whooped and jumped off, surprised by how much he\u2019d wanted Macie to see him succeed.</p><p>She grinned as he approached. \u201cNice ridin\u2019, Dad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks. Pay up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you take a personal check?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Cash only.\u201d</p><p>She snickered. \u201cYou should have that tattooed somewhere.\u201d</p><p>A calf bawled in the distance.</p><p>Cash quietly tried to restore his breathing.</p><p>\u201cSo, can I sit on that thing?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI remember you tellin\u2019 me you\u2019d never ride a bull.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to ride it; I just want to know what it feels like to be on a big, bad bull substitute, which is the closest I will ever get to one of those nasty creatures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Come on.\u201d</p><p>Cash lifted her on the back of the apparatus. He showed her how to wrap the rope, how to spur, how the free arm was the key to achieving balance. He was happy she\u2019d taken an interest in something he\u2019d spent years of his life learning to perfect.</p><p>The lesson in bull riding was about over when he heard, \u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He turned and saw Carter storming toward them. The fence wasn\u2019t an impediment to the angry young man; he put one arm on the railing and jumped sideways over it.</p><p>\u201cGet off that thing right now, Macie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot fuckin\u2019 believe you put her on the back of a goddamn mechanical bull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait just a minute. I can explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain what?\u201d Carter shouted. \u201cHow damn dangerous it is? That\u2019s a little hard to explain to her when she\u2019s dead. Christ, she could\u2019ve broken her neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Cash, what were you thinkin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop right there, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t kiddin\u2019, Macie, get off that death trap or I\u2019ll drag you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t talk to her like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can talk to her any damn way I please since it appears I\u2019m the only one who cares about her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your mouth, McKay, and listen up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I\u2019d put my daughter in danger?\u201d Cash kept his hands clenched in fists by his sides in an effort not to take a swing at this self-righteous punk.</p><p>Carter didn\u2019t answer; he just glared with his hands curled on his hips, looking ready to do some swinging himself.</p><p>\u201cWell, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I think she\u2019d do whatever it took to get your attention, including puttingherself at risk by climbin\u2019 on the back of a bull.\u201d</p><p>Ugly silence hung in the air.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t got nothin\u2019 to say to that do you, \u2019cause you know it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, boy, you went too far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot nearly far enough. If you want to fight, bring it, old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit who you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Macie stepped between them. \u201cStop. Both of you.\u201d She whirled on Carter and snapped, \u201cWalk it off. I mean it, Carter.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>By that time Cash noticed they\u2019d drawn a crowd, including Gemma, Colby and Channing, Keely, Amy Jo and the boys he\u2019d been teaching. Great.</p><p>Cash turned and walked away.</p><p>Macie moved in front of him and grabbed his hand. \u201cThank you. I had fun. Don\u2019t listen to him.\u201d</p><p>Cash reached out and stroked his free hand down her soft hair. \u201cI wasn\u2019t. I\u2019d never do nothin\u2019 to hurt you, Macie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in case you\u2019re wonderin\u2019 \u2019bout some of the crap he was throwin\u2019 out, don\u2019t listen to him either. You do have my attention. You\u2019re smarter than to do something stupid to get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that too.\u201d Macie stood on her tiptoes and kissed his cheek. She whispered,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go double or nothing with you on that bet. Same time tomorrow. Bring your money.\u201d</p><p>Cash smiled as he watched her walk away from him...and from Carter McKay.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>\u201cDumbass. Get away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Talk. To. Me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Go.\u201d She slammed the camper door in his face and locked it. Then she cranked Dwight Yoakam to a million decibels, effectively cutting off all communication.</p><p>Damn. Carter kicked a dirt clod as he lumbered back to his pickup. How had everything gotten out of control? One second he\u2019d been striding across the yard, looking forward to seeing Macie\u2019s smiling face. Looking forward to showing his family what they were together. The next second he\u2019d seen her perched on the back of that bucking bull and his heart just...stopped. He didn\u2019t think; he just reacted.</p><p>Badly.</p><p>No shit. Now he\u2019d pissed off Macie and her father.</p><p>But he knew what he\u2019d said hadn\u2019t been totally out of line, merely bad timing. Macie was so eager for any kind of family connection, especially with Cash, Carter suspected she would do anything. Or listen to whatever free or bad advice her dad offered. Yeah, Carter could just hear that conversation:</p><p>Forget about McKay. He\u2019s proven he\u2019s an insensitive prick, just like the rest of the goddamn McKays. Besides, you\u2019re young. Don\u2019t make the same mistakes I did when I was young. There\u2019s no need for you to settle down. Or to settle for a hothead like him.</p><p>Then the son of a bitch would probably hand over the keys to his camper and encourage her to hit the road\u2014allowing Cash uninterrupted time with Gemma. If and when Macie returned, Carter McKay would be long gone. Which is exactly what Cash Big Crow wanted.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He could totally see that scenario happening, since he knew Macie had no intention of sticking around here beyond summer\u2019s end.</p><p>How could he make her stay?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t. Not today, anyway. His only other option was to skulk around her door like some...whipped dog. Begging for scraps of her attention.</p><p>Like that would work.</p><p>Or he could go home and work.</p><p>On pictures of her.</p><p>Great.</p><p>He wondered if his day could get any worse.</p><p>\u201cHey, bro, when did you turn into such a macho jerk? That was quite the display of testosterone.\u201d</p><p>Keely. Carter thunked his head on his hood. The universe fucking hated him today.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I wanted to prove I was a true McKay, asshole behavior and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that you mention it, you sorta were actin\u2019 like Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, Keely, just what I wanted to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt any rate, I brought you a beer.\u201d</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>She waggled a bottle of Bud Light at him. \u201cI thought you could use one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He popped the cap off and drank. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHidin\u2019 from the bull rider wannabes and lettin\u2019 Amy Jo deal with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeanin\u2019, you ditched her and you were sneakin\u2019 off to drink a beer and you were afraid I\u2019d caught you.\u201d</p><p>Keely grinned. \u201cI knew there was a reason you\u2019re my favorite brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFavorite. Right.\u201d Why wasn\u2019t he surprised his sister hadn\u2019t really come looking for him? No one else had either.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re acting like a shithead who deserves to be alone.</p><p>Keely blithely continued, \u201cBesides, Amy Jo will probably come barreling over to Macie\u2019s camper to listen to her rant and rave about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would Amy Jo care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe and Macie hit it off like gangbusters. And let\u2019s just say Amy Jo is well-versed on dealing with a hot-headed McKay male who can\u2019t see the forest for the trees.\u201d</p><p>Carter frowned. \u201cWho are you talkin\u2019 about? She got a thing for Colt?\u201d Lord help the girl if she did. Colt would charm her, bed her, and leave her. And feel no guilt about it whatsoever.</p><p>\u201cNo. Cord.\u201d</p><p>That was worse for poor sweet Amy Jo. Way worse.</p><p>\u201cSo, how long have you been with Macie?\u201d</p><p>He said nothing.</p><p>\u201cPuh-lease. Even before your he-man tactics today, your eyes devoured her while you were supposed to be eatin\u2019 supper last night. And I noticed this morning she had a streak of paint\u2014yellow umber to be exact, your favorite color to be even more exact\u2014on her neck. So, I figured you\u2019d been doin\u2019 a little finger painting after the bonfire.\u201d</p><p>Carter sighed.</p><p>Softly, Keely said, \u201cYou have it bad for her, don\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His head snapped up. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you didn\u2019t bother with niceties today. You were scared, you were pissed, and you didn\u2019t hide it from anyone, least of all her.\u201d</p><p>He clamped his teeth together.</p><p>\u201cYou work really hard at disguising your intense side, Carter. Almost everyone believes you are this calm, cool, laid-back kinda guy.\u201d She plucked the beer from him and drank. \u201cI\u2019ve spent more time with you than the rest of our brothers have, so you\u2019ve never fooled me. I know what you\u2019re really like. Macie knows that side of you too. Or, if she didn\u2019t, she got a taste of it today. But she knew before, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it hasn\u2019t scared her off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s exactly like you, which means she\u2019s perfect for you because she will make your life a living hell. Or heaven on earth. Depending on the day and your collective brooding moods.\u201d</p><p>Carter was stunned into silence by Keely\u2019s comments.</p> <p>\u201cSo, no matter what anyone tells you, bro, fight for her. She\u2019s worth it. And I\u2019ll lie through my teeth if you ever tell anybody I said this, but you are worth it too.\u201d She sauntered off and vanished in the copse of scrub oak trees.</p><p>He\u2019d underestimated his sister on many levels. When had she become so insightful?</p><p>Or had he automatically discounted her lack of understanding about anything important because of her age?</p><p>Was he doing the same thing with Macie?</p><p>Either way, Carter realized everything she\u2019d said was exactly on the nose.</p><p>He also realized Keely had taken off with his beer.</p> <p>Happy as Gemma had been to see Channing and Colby, she breathed a sigh of relief after the rowdy crew returned to Campbell County.</p><p>Cash and Carter hadn\u2019t come to a resolution after the blow up over Macie. Far as she knew, Carter hadn\u2019t been back to the Bar 9. Rather than ask Carter to help Cash with chores, it was easier all around if she did it.</p><p>Things hadn\u2019t returned to normal. Since the primary cook had quit at the diner, Macie warned them she\u2019d be working tons more hours. Gemma knew Cash worried about Macie, but she also knew something had changed significantly between father and daughter in the past few days. Not that Cash confided in her, he was determined to figure this out with Macie on his own. Still, she sensed an acceptance, which hadn\u2019t been there.</p><p>Like they\u2019d both let down their guards a little.</p><p>She wished Cash would let down his guard with her. From a purely professional standpoint, they worked well together. They\u2019d spent hours out in the field, fixing fence, tending cattle, watching for wildfires. She\u2019d learned why he didn\u2019t have a place to call his own, and it broke her heart. They\u2019d sat at the table after supper, mountains of paperwork strewn across the table as they discussed the pros and cons of various breeding programs.</p><p>When the stock contracting issue came up, he\u2019d bluntly told her to let it go and to focus on other areas of the cattle business. She\u2019d literally felt the weight of that burden leaving her soul.</p><p>Was that because it\u2019d been one of her final ties to her life with Steve? The Bar 9</p><p>might\u2019ve been Steve\u2019s when she\u2019d moved in years ago, but it was as much hers now as it\u2019d been his.</p> <p>The door between the upstairs and main floor slammed. Pine-scented aftershave wafted into the living room and she automatically smiled.</p><p>Cash plopped next to her on the couch, grabbed her hand and kissed her knuckles.</p><p>\u201cYou need help with the laundry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019ve got it covered. But thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes the ease with which he\u2019d inserted himself into her life astounded her. But times like these, it seemed Cash had always been here. Helping her. Loving her.</p><p>Whoa. She loved him. The jury was out on how he felt about her.</p><p>Why don\u2019t you ask him? What do you have to lose?</p><p>Him. She couldn\u2019t stand the thought of losing him. Ever. She\u2019d already waited a year to sort out her own feelings, now was willing to wait as long as it took until he was ready to sort out his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinkin\u2019 of surprisin\u2019 Macie and buyin\u2019 her a horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Is this some guilty throwback to \u2018Daddy, will you buy me a pony for my birthday?\u2019 portion of her life that you missed?\u201d</p><p>He nudged her with his shoulder. \u201cNo, smarty. She likes to ride. It\u2019d be good for her to learn to train a horse from the get-go. It might also be an incentive for her to stick around here at the end of the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings are going well between you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than I\u2019d hoped, which is why I don\u2019t want her to leave. Selfish, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you know she can\u2019t live in that camper indefinitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought once McKay left she could live in the trailer. It even has a barn.\u201d</p><p>So Cash had already written off Carter McKay. Gemma wasn\u2019t so sure Carter had cashed in his chips with Macie\u2014more like Carter was regrouping. She kept her opinion to herself. \u201cA barn, which would be perfect for her new horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He fiddled with the remote. \u201cBy the way, I heard from Trevor Glanzer today.</p><p>He\u2019s on his way through tomorrow night. Is it all right if he crashes here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But that\u2019s odd. He just called you out of the blue?\u201d</p><p>Cash aimed the remote. \u201cWanna see what\u2019s on TV tonight?\u201d</p><p>Gemma heaved a dramatic sigh. \u201cWe\u2019re watching TV? The romance has already worn off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we just veg? I\u2019m bushed, Gem. I know I passed out last night, but you plum wore me out two nights ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t the one with the sore ass, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplainin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d She smirked. \u201cOkay, not much. It was hot as hell, waking up tied up. You having your wicked way with me. Telling me precisely all the kinky things you planned\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t relaxin\u2019 me none.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnowing I couldn\u2019t make too much noise, even when your thrusts felt so good I wanted to scream. So hard I could feel your cock all the way in my throat\u2014\u201d</p><p>Groaning, Cash picked her up and tossed her over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakin\u2019 you to bed, winyan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you were too tired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for you I just got my second wind and a new rope to break in.\u201d He spanked her butt and she shrieked. \u201cKeep up that dirty talk and I\u2019ll have to try out the gag too.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-one</p><p>\u201cHey, squirt, when you\u2019re done in there can I talk to you?\u201d Velma said in front of the pass-through window.</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019ll cost you a beer, though.\u201d Macie tossed the metal-bristled scrub brush aside. She used a clean white towel to wipe down the grill and admired the sparkling surface before she shut the lights off in the kitchen and shuffled out front.</p><p>Velma sat at the counter with a ten-key calculator. Long curls of white tape spilled everywhere. Without looking up, she said, \u201cI put a six-pack of Bud in the small cooler.</p><p>Grab me one too, while you\u2019re at it.\u201d</p><p>Macie popped the tops on the cans and waited, thankful not to be on her feet. Man.</p><p>She was exhausted. She\u2019d been working split shifts the last two days. And with the way Velma was frowning, she figured it wasn\u2019t going to get better any time soon.</p><p>Why stay here? It\u2019s time to move on anyway. You don\u2019t owe anybody anything but yourself.</p><p>It\u2019d been a couple of weeks since her mom\u2019s advice made an appearance. She hadn\u2019t missed it.</p><p>Velma chugged half the beer. \u201cIt sucks that TJ up and quit. I don\u2019t know if he was threatened by you or what, but it\u2019s actually a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he be threatened by me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you are a damn good cook. And not just the usual diner fare. You\u2019re bringin\u2019 something new and fresh. Something classy.\u201d</p><p>Macie squirmed.</p><p>\u201cLocal folks who hardly ever came in have taken notice. And the changes ain\u2019t drivin\u2019 away my regular customers, which is a plus. The bottom line is my business has more than doubled in the last two months and I am attributing it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut hey, no pressure,\u201d Macie muttered and swigged her beer.</p><p>Velma stared at her thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are your future plans, Macie? Is the Last Chance Diner a blip on the roadmap to somewhere else?\u201d</p><p>Macie really squirmed.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t answer, Velma looked away and said softly, \u201cI\u2019m sure workin\u2019 in a greasy spoon in Wyoming ain\u2019t your life goal. Probably have loftier ambitions.\u201d</p><p>Macie placed her hand on Velma\u2019s arm. \u201cDon\u2019t. You\u2019ve built a great business here.</p><p>And as flattered as I am that you think I\u2019ve had something to do with business picking up in recent months, it still is your place, Velma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But you still didn\u2019t answer my question, squirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can. You knew I\u2019d only be around a few months. I do like working here better than anywhere else I\u2019ve punched a clock lately. But you should know I\u2019ve just never worked anywhere longer than four months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly? I get bored. Or I get fired. I\u2019ve never had a reason to stick around anyplace and put down roots or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your dad is here, ain\u2019t he? Things are workin\u2019 out with him at Gemma\u2019s place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre things workin\u2019 out between the two of you?\u201d</p><p>Macie smiled. \u201cBetter than I\u2019d hoped actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>The clock ticked. The walk-in freezer hummed.</p><p>Velma sighed. \u201cHow are things goin\u2019 with you and that good-lookin\u2019 artist feller?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her stomach pitched when she thought of Carter. She hadn\u2019t seen him since the day he\u2019d squared off with her father. Which was why laboring excessive hours at the diner hadn\u2019t bothered her. She needed distance and time to think about what\u2019d happened.</p><p>Contrary to what other people thought, she hadn\u2019t been mad at Carter for what he\u2019d done. She\u2019d been upset by the fact he\u2019d cared enough about her welfare to challenge her father. In front of everyone, his family, his friends. Carter had been worried about her getting hurt. Or dying.</p><p>Dying.</p> <p>She\u2019d never had a man worry about her for any reason, let alone for her personal safety. It was cool. It was weird.</p><p>It was confusing as hell.</p><p>So, Macie didn\u2019t know if she was supposed to throw herself at Carter in gratitude for his protective instincts. Or take her father\u2019s side for his.</p><p>Talk about riding the mental merry-go-round \u2019til it made her dizzy.</p><p>And that didn\u2019t even take into consideration the L-word.</p> <p>Macie was pretty sure she loved Carter. But how did she really know for sure? She had absolutely nothing in her life to gauge it by.</p><p>Loving her mother didn\u2019t count. Neither did the idea she was starting to love her dad.</p><p>The skeptic reminded her she\u2019d known Carter McKay for a little over two months.</p><p>How could she possibly love him?</p><p>Didn\u2019t love take time to build? Did she think she loved Carter because of the incredible sex? Because he understood her? Because he calmed her fears? Because he made her feel daring? Because he went out of his way to share silly and sweet things with her? Because he showed her sides of himself no one else knew? Because he thought she was beautiful and worthy of his art?</p><p>Or did she think she loved him strictly because he\u2019d paid attention to her? When he\u2019d made that same accusation to her father, it caused a ricochet effect, and the opposite reaction from what Carter probably expected. Instead of questioning her motives and actions regarding her dad, Macie questioned her motives and actions where Carter was concerned.</p> <p>Which always led back to the \u201cDo I love him?\u201d question. Or a scarier scenario: What would she do if Carter told her he loved her? What would he expect? That she\u2019d follow him while he lived his dream? What about her dreams? Would Carter be ready to make the same sacrifices for her?</p><p>The most troubling question? Was she prepared to give up the relationship she was establishing with her dad, for the ups and downs of romantic love? Would her father do the same thing for her?</p><p>\u201cMacie?\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped up and she looked at Velma. \u201cSorry. I\u2019ve had a lot on my mind lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine. Well, I don\u2019t want to add to that burden, but I\u2019m afraid I have no choice.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. Was Velma going to fire her?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that, squirt. It ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 bad. I\u2019ve been crunching some numbers, and I think I can afford to hire another part-time cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably thinking; how\u2019s that affect me? I\u2019m just gonna say this straight out: I want you to stay in Canyon River. Part of the reason\u2014well, most of it actually\u2014is pure selfishness on my part. I like you. I like what you\u2019ve done for this place on a number of levels. The other part is: I think you like it here\u2014at the diner and in Canyon River\u2014</p><p>and you need an excuse to put down roots. Or at least you need a reason to try to put down roots.\u201d Velma\u2019s eyes softened beneath her glasses. \u201cYou ain\u2019t never had what most of us have taken for granted. I know you\u2019re curious on whether it\u2019s worth it, or if it\u2019d be just another heartache. I look in those pretty hazel eyes and I see wisdom beyond your years.\u201d</p><p>Macie managed to swallow the last of her beer over the lump growing in her throat.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what I propose: I\u2019ll pay you a decent salary. You\u2019ll be the head cook, and we\u2019ll mix it up so you\u2019re working all shifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me working breakfast, lunch and dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sayin\u2019 it\u2019d be smart to sprinkle your good recipes and sunny personality around all the main meals. On my days off, I\u2019d want you out front doin\u2019 my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSchmoozing the regulars and belittling the help? I\u2019m so all over that.\u201d</p><p>Velma smiled. \u201cSee? We\u2019re on the same page. I think it\u2019s some kinda cosmic sign.</p><p>Besides, you are young enough that if after a year it don\u2019t work out, you can move on.</p><p>What do you have to lose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, apparently. But I need to think about it. Not just a couple of days, but a couple of weeks, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing. You\u2019ll still be workin\u2019 here while you\u2019re tryin\u2019 to make a decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And I\u2019d appreciate it if we could keep this between us. Just us. There\u2019s already a million pros and cons in my head. I don\u2019t need anyone else adding their opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it done. And remember, I always close down for ten days at the end of this month. Gives me time to regroup after the summer months and gear up for the fall.\u201d</p><p>As Macie drove back to the Bar 9, she knew Velma\u2019s offer complicated matters in her life, rather than providing a clear solution.</p><p>When she reached for the door handle to the camper, she noticed a piece of paper taped by the window. Her heart beat hard as she unrolled the scroll.</p><p>At the top was a sketch of a rodeo clown. Crying as a bull, which looked suspiciously like a caricature of her father, gored him in the butt. The words I\u2019M SORRY</p><p>took up the entire middle of the page. Below that, he\u2019d written: I miss you. Come see me when you get home, doesn\u2019t matter what time. We\u2019ll talk.</p><p>Do normal couple things. And have pie. A helping of humble pie for me, darlin\u2019 ~ C ~</p><p>Macie stared at the paper for the longest time. She whispered, \u201cCarter McKay, you are such a dumbass.\u201d And right then, she had no doubts that she was indeed, completely, madly in love with him.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-two</p><p>\u201cExcuse me. Is this the studio of famous Wyoming artist in residence, Carter</p><p>\u2018shoulda been a cowboy\u2019 McKay?\u201d</p><p>Carter spun around and grinned. \u201cJack! You bastard. \u2019Bout goddamn time you got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do realize I\u2019m not living in Denver anymore and I had to fly in? I\u2019ve been stuck in the rental car for five hours. Without satellite radio.\u201d He dropped his duffel bag and scowled. \u201cCan you please tell me why every single station around these parts plays nothing but that goat yodeling crap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, some of us like Western music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re a hick, so I expected that much from you.\u201d Jack stalked over and grabbed him in a bear hug. \u201cGood to see you, man, you look like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks.\u201d Carter gave Jack\u2014all six-foot-four, two hundred odd pounds of him\u2014a quick inspection. \u201cYou look a little tight-assed yourself. Wearin\u2019 pinstriped underwear under your pinstriped suits these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off. Where\u2019s the beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the cooler by the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. You care if we sit outside? I\u2019ve been cooped up all damn day. Need some of that fresh mountain air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I need a break anyway.\u201d</p><p>Once they\u2019d settled in lawn chairs with the cooler between them, and a cold beer in each hand, Jack sighed. \u201cSo where\u2019s the fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy was it so damn urgent I haul balls up here?\u201d</p><p>Carter didn\u2019t say anything for several minutes.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s anything less than you telling me you\u2019re dying, I\u2019m going to beat your sorry ass into the dirt, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Carter kept staring off into space, lost in the vast prairie and his guilty thoughts.</p><p>\u201cShit. I was kidding. You aren\u2019t dying, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d Recognition dawned on Jack\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s about a woman, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knock her up?\u201d</p><p>Carter tossed his beer can off to the side of his chair and cracked a fresh one.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He downed half the contents. \u201cI\u2019m crazy about her. So crazy about her in fact, that I want you to do something for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Be your best man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want you to fuck her.\u201d</p><p>Beer spewed out of Jack\u2019s mouth. \u201cJesus Christ, Carter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just blurt out something like that...dammit.\u201d</p><p>He waited.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what the hell to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple. Say yes. It ain\u2019t like we\u2019ve never had a threesome, Jack.\u201d</p><p>Jack stared at him. \u201cTrue. But it\u2019s been a few years and we were usually drunk. And neither of us gave a crap about the women who were bold enough to take us both on.</p><p>That last time, hell, we didn\u2019t even bother to learn her name.\u201d</p><p>Man. Had he really been that callous?</p><p>Yes. Maybe Carter was more like his wild brothers than he cared to admit.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s really going on here, McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou laugh and I\u2019ll kick your ass, former linebacker or not.\u201d Carter fiddled with the tab on the beer can. \u201cThis woman? I had impressions about her, almost like cognitive daydreams, before I ever met her. Drove me crazy, I kept tryin\u2019 to work her likeness into clay, and wood, or on paper. Nothin\u2019 worked. Then I actually, physically met her. Yeah. I was a little freaked out about it. And she\u2019s better in real life than in those dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like forever.\u201d</p><p>Jack frowned. \u201cShe a cowgirl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you ask that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always had a thing for sweet little country girls.\u201d Jack scowled again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t understand the attraction. And I can guarantee you\u2019ll never see me with a cowgirl. Never.\u201d</p><p>Carter kept drinking.</p><p>\u201cSo. Is she from around here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSort of. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s vague. What\u2019s she like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s...damn. She\u2019s everything. But she\u2019s also damn young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Jerry Lee Lewis young? Great balls of fire, you jonesin\u2019 for a thirteen-year-old girl, McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you fuckin\u2019 pervert. She\u2019s twenty-two.\u201d</p> <p>Jack looked at him. And laughed. Hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all of twenty-six. How does that make her young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It just does.\u201d Carter drained his beer and reached for another. Now, why in the hell hadn\u2019t he thought of that before now? Because most days he felt so much older than his chronological age?</p><p>\u201cSo let me get this straight: You called me, in a panic, dragged me to Wyoming, because you need me to fuck your new, young girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t that crude.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDetails, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Macie has this fantasy of bein\u2019 with more than one guy. She\u2019s told me she\u2019s had dreams about it. And I wanted to make her fantasy, her dream come true, since she made mine... Shit. I sound stupid. Like a fuckin\u2019 sap. Never mind.\u201d</p><p>Jack waited a beat. \u201cBecause she is your dream come true, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Carter didn\u2019t answer. He just drank steadily. Finally, he said, \u201cYeah. I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 she probably is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude. You are so totally fucked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes I am.\u201d He passed out another round of beer. \u201cSo will you do it?\u201d</p><p>Jack shrugged.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>No response.</p><p>\u201cSexy. Killer body.\u201d</p><p>Jack shrugged again.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very adventurous in bed.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow without comment.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I have an extra pair of boots and a hat around here somewhere. I can\u2019t see you fittin\u2019 into my chaps, but maybe that won\u2019t matter to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants me to dress up like a redneck? With shitkickers and a big belt buckle and a stupid hat and a syrupy \u2018Hey howdy, pretty little lady, can I ride you hard\u2019 drawl? Oh hell no.\u201d</p><p>Carter smiled. Spitefully. \u201cPretend you\u2019re a sophisticated city-boy all you want, Donohue. But we both know you\u2019re just a South Dakota plowboy with a fancy degree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsulting me isn\u2019t helping your cause, Carter.\u201d</p><p>Carter pretended not to notice when Jack changed the subject. He\u2019d let it go. For now.</p><p>As darkness fell, they caught up and talked about Jack\u2019s job with the architectural firm in Chicago and Carter\u2019s upcoming art show. More and more beer cans piled up by his chair. Why was he getting drunk?</p><p>Liquid courage, man. You didn\u2019t want to ask Jack for this favor because the thought of any man\u2014even your best buddy Jack\u2014ever touching Macie, makes you mad as a bucking bull. But you love her so goddamn much you\u2019ll do whatever Amazin\u2019 Macie wants to make her happy.</p><p>Love?</p><p>Her?</p><p>Whoa.</p><p>Did he love Macie?</p><p>He\u2019d have to close his eyes and think about that one.</p><p>\u201cHey, McKay. Wake up. A car just pulled in the drive.\u201d</p><p>Dammit, if he could just grasp these important thoughts that kept spinning inside in his brain...before they spun away.</p><p>Carter had company.</p><p>Macie tamped down her disappointment. She hesitated as she climbed out of her vehicle, studying the two forms in the lawn chairs in front of a dwindling campfire.</p><p>\u201cCarter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, shweet darlin\u2019, howsh\u2019s it hangin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Sexy, low male laughter drifted from the other lawn chair.</p><p>Macie took another couple of steps and noticed the beer cans. A whole lot of empty beer cans. Beside Carter.</p><p>The man stood and thrust his hand out. \u201cHi. You must be Macie. I\u2019m Jack Donohue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacksh\u2019s my beshtesht bud from college.\u201d</p><p>Macie looked up at the man. Good God, he was a god. Firelight glowed behind him, making him look as if he\u2019d been forged from steel. He was huge. Muscular. With a brawny chest, ripped biceps, big hands, and never-ending legs thick as tree trunks.</p><p>Longish coal-black hair framed his square face. He had a roguish smile boasting brilliant white teeth; a deep cleft in his chin, and eyes the color of green grass. Those same eyes were highly amused.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t she beautiful in firelight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is. Hang on. I\u2019ll get you a chair.\u201d Jack disappeared into the barn.</p><p>Whoo-ee. The beefcake was a gentleman to boot.</p><p>\u201cCome over here and give me shome shugar, shugar.\u201d</p><p>Macie skirted the fire and looked into Carter\u2019s face. He had a silly smile. And glassy eyes. She bit back a grin. He was unbelievably adorable. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. I misshed you, my shweet darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you too.\u201d She brushed the springy curls from his damp forehead. \u201cWhat are you celebrating?\u201d</p><p>Carter frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t remember. You probably.\u201d He cupped his hands around her face and brought her mouth to his for a deep, wet, beer-flavored kiss. Even drunk the man knew how to melt her with his kisses.</p><p>She gradually removed her lips from his. \u201cI won\u2019t stay, since you have company, but I wanted to tell you thanks for the apology and the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn apology for what? The pictures I\u2019m paintin\u2019 of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>From behind her Jack said, \u201cHe\u2019s babbling because he\u2019s been drinking for hours.</p><p>Hate to say it, but he probably won\u2019t remember you were even here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll remember.\u201d</p><p>Jack said nothing.</p><p>Carter\u2019s head drooped to his chest.</p><p>\u201cCarter?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019d better get him in the house before he passes out,\u201d Macie suggested.</p><p>\u201cIf you insist. Or we could just drag him into the barn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you claim you\u2019re a good friend of his?\u201d</p><p>Jack chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself, he would\u2019ve done the same thing to me had the situations been reversed. In fact, he has.\u201d</p><p>They tried to rouse the party animal but he wouldn\u2019t budge. Carter wasn\u2019t a small guy by any means, and Macie wouldn\u2019t have been able to move him by herself. Luckily for Carter, Jack was strong enough to carry him in a fireman\u2019s hold and deposit him on the sofa in the trailer.</p><p>Macie managed to get Carter\u2019s boots off before he started to snore. She stripped him down to his boxers, tucked a blanket around him. On her way outside, she noticed he\u2019d added a picture to his family collection. She peered at it and her breath caught. It was one he\u2019d taken of her the first day she\u2019d posed for him, a profile shot. The light turned her skin a stunning shade of red-gold. Her lips were parted, almost in a smirk. She looked mysterious and...beautiful. Was this the way he saw her? Would his paintings reflect the same mood? Shaking such crazy, hopeful thoughts from her head, she returned outside.</p><p>Jack sat by the fire. \u201cGot a minute before you need to take off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant a beer?\u201d</p><p>Macie wrinkled her nose.</p><p>Jack smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s Diet Pepsi in the cooler too, which is why I\u2019m not in the same sad shape as McKay.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed one and sat. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen him drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish I could say the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years. We met in Denver while we were in grad school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Are you an artist too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m an architect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter tells me you\u2019re posing for a couple of pieces for his art show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. I haven\u2019t actually seen anything yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nothing new. He\u2019s usually pretty secretive about his work.\u201d</p><p>Awkward silence followed. His eyes seemed to be following her closely too.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known him?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cSeems like forever, but since the beginning of summer.\u201d</p><p>Jack frowned.</p><p>Crickets chirped. The fire crackled. A gentle breeze blew. The uncomfortable quiet lingered.</p><p>\u201cCarter was right. You really are beautiful by firelight. I suspect you\u2019d even be more dangerously beautiful in the dark.\u201d</p><p>Macie froze.</p><p>\u201cHow serious are you about him?\u201d</p><p>Her heart beat faster. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust curious.\u201d Jack granted her body a visual examination that burned her skin hotter than the bonfire. \u201cJust wondering if it\u2019s an exclusive thing. Or if maybe you and I...\u201d</p><p>This guy was Carter\u2019s best friend? He was a total letch. Macie scrambled to her feet.</p><p>\u201cNo way. Not interested.\u201d She stomped to her SUV.</p><p>\u201cMacie. Wait. Sorry. I had to do that.\u201d</p><p>She whirled on him. \u201cDo what? Hit on me? When your friend is passed out not more than twenty feet away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Carter is head over heels for you. I\u2019ve never seen him like this and I had to make sure...Sit down and let me explain. I\u2019m not going to make a pass at you, okay?\u201d</p><p>She sat.</p><p>More sticky silence.</p><p>Macie said, \u201cSo, if I would\u2019ve jumped at the chance at, well, jumping you, would you have told him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a fucking heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>She waited.</p><p>\u201cCan I be blunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Jack. You\u2019ve been pretty subtle so far.\u201d</p><p>Jack grinned. \u201cYou bust his balls all the time, don\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Macie shrugged.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter called me in a panic yesterday. He\u2019s never done that. So, I changed my schedule, flew in, expecting to hear he\u2019s dying or something. But no. He sits me down, tells me about you, how crazy he is about you, and then he asks me...shit. I need another beer.\u201d He snagged one out of the cooler and drank.</p><p>Impatiently, she demanded, \u201cHe asked you what, Jack?\u201d</p><p>Jack locked his gaze to hers. \u201cHe asked me to be the third player in a threesome with you and him.\u201d</p><p>All the blood drained from Macie\u2019s face. \u201cOmigod. Why would he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said you have some fantasy about being with two guys at one time, or two cowboys or some m\u00e9nage thing. Anyway, he wanted to give you that fantasy, and he asked me here because, well, to be blunt again, he and I have done this type of thing before\u2014granted, it was a couple of years ago. But the bottom line is he asked me because he trusts me. And he trusts me with you. Which says a whole helluva lot to me, about how he feels about you.\u201d</p><p>Macie stared at Jack, absolutely dumbfounded.</p><p>When she made no effort to speak, Jack said, \u201cSo was McKay on crack, or what?</p><p>Did you, or did you not, tell him you had a fantasy like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI joked about it. After he and I met I had this bizarre dream that Freud would\u2019ve had a field day with, and Carter was in it. I didn\u2019t give him particulars, because it would\u2019ve weirded him out. And I was glad I\u2019d spared him the details after I found out about his slight homophobia.\u201d</p><p>Jack lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t tell him the gory details, I won\u2019t tell you. So it was probably stupid and childish, but I kept it going like a running gag. I never believed he\u2019d take me serious!\u201d</p><p>She gazed into the fire, feeling like an absolute idiot. \u201cAfter all we\u2019ve done, doesn\u2019t he know I don\u2019t need anyone else, I don\u2019t want anyone else, and I can\u2019t imagine being in bed with someone else when I\u2019m equally crazy about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it appears he doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Macie looked up and blushed. Crap. She\u2019d forgotten about Jack.</p><p>\u201cSo why don\u2019t you tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I will, just as soon as I kick his sorry butt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, I\u2019d like to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should teach him a lesson. Thank him in the morning for the most spectacular sex of my life, and the awesome threesome we had with you.\u201d She toed a beer can toward the fire. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight be good for him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t hurt him. Not on purpose.\u201d She sensed Jack\u2019s hesitation and her gaze zoomed to him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I give you some advice, Macie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter is a great guy. But his artistic nature sometimes causes him to do stupid things that make sense to him at the time.\u201d</p><p>Macie thought of Carter\u2019s over-the-top reaction to her sitting on the back of a mechanical bull. Yeah. That made sense.</p><p>\u201cHe eventually sees the error of his skewed thinking, but not right away. He wouldn\u2019t do anything to hurt you on purpose either...but accidentally?\u201d Jack shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019ll happen. More likely than not.\u201d</p><p>Even if she didn\u2019t understand what Jack meant, his words were a little disturbing.</p><p>She stood. \u201cI should go. Thanks for not hitting on me for real and for being a good friend to Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcKay is a lucky man. Make sure you send me an invitation to the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr an announcement for his funeral.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-three</p><p>Carter woke at two in the afternoon with a hellacious hangover.</p><p>Shit. What\u2019d happened last night?</p><p>He remembered Jack showing up. And drinking. Talking about seeing if Jack was up for a rodeo with Macie. More drinking.</p><p>Macie. She\u2019d been here.</p><p>What had gone down after that?</p><p>Carter lurched up on the couch. Goddamn, that hurt his head. He looked down. At least he was wearing his boxers.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>He stood. Ooh. That was worse than laying down. He stumbled past the guest bedroom and froze. The bed hadn\u2019t been slept in.</p><p>So where had Jack slept?</p><p>With Macie.</p><p>Not possible. Jack wouldn\u2019t...</p><p>Unless Carter gave him the okay. And he\u2019d bypassed \u201cokay\u201d and gone straight to</p><p>\u201cwhat are you waiting for?\u201d when he asked\u2014no\u2014 demanded that Jack fuck Macie.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>Carter shuffled to his bedroom. The sheets and the mattress pad were stripped and rolled in a ball. What the hell? Why?</p><p>Because they are damp and stained from being well used last night.</p><p>His gaze swept the room, searching for condom wrappers, used Kleenex, a bottle of lube.</p><p>Nothing. Except Macie\u2019s sweater hung off the dresser and the scent of her skin hung in the air.</p><p>He sat on the bed. Hard.</p><p>Images flashed in his mind like a movie on fast forward. Jack and Macie kissing.</p><p>Deeply. Hungrily. Jack unbuttoning Macie\u2019s shirt, feasting on her dark nipples. Macie arching her neck, moaning, demanding more. Macie shoving Jack\u2019s hand down her pants.</p><p>Jack tearing off her shorts, leaving her naked.</p><p>Jack falling to his knees as he kissed the sweet curve of her belly. And down, over the dark hair covering her mound and down, zeroing in on her pussy. Spreading her pouty lips wide to reach her clit. Sucking. Licking. Making Macie cry out in ecstasy. Jack stood and whispered in her ear while plunging three fingers in and out of her wet slit until she came screaming his name.</p><p>Macie stretched out on the bed, watching as Jack whipped off his jeans. Then Jack straddled her, burying his face in her sopping cunt as his cock rammed in and out of Macie\u2019s mouth. The slow easy rhythm built into a rush to the finish. Jack\u2019s hips pumped faster into her face. Macie ground her sex harder into his. They climaxed simultaneously.</p><p>Macie sucked him deep and swallowed, but some of Jack\u2019s come dribbled out the side of her mouth as she smiled. When Jack lifted his head, his face was shiny wet with her juices.</p><p>Jack flipped her on her belly and rammed his cock in her cunt as his fingers dallied with her asshole. After they\u2019d both come again, he lubed up Macie\u2019s tits and fucked her there, while Macie\u2019s vibrator was buried in her pussy.</p><p>She screamed Jack\u2019s name again as her orgasm hit and he came on her face.</p><p>Then Jack took her ass. Twice. First with his cock. Then with the vibrator as he gave it to Macie from behind.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t the end. Jack tenderly cleaned Macie up, kissing her. Caressing her.</p><p>Sweet-talking her. Making Macie purr beneath his roving hands. And when she was heated up again, he fucked her slowly, face-to-face, whispering in her ear. Making love to her mouth as his body made love to hers. Then they fell asleep curled in each other\u2019s arms, smiles of satisfaction on their faces.</p><p>No wonder the sheets were rolled up. Hell, they\u2019d probably worn holes in them and the mattress too.</p><p>But... Had he really seen that? Why hadn\u2019t they asked him to join in? After all, it was supposed to be a three-for-all.</p><p>No, three\u2019s a crowd.</p><p>The bottom line was: Carter couldn\u2019t remember and that made him an idiot and a loser.</p><p>The very bottom line? If the images were reality, not the blurred imaginings of an alcohol stupor, Jack Donohue was a dead man.</p><p>Cash had something up his sleeve.</p><p>Gemma couldn\u2019t put her finger on it, but he was acting...nervous. Which set her on edge. Cash was the most unflappable man she\u2019d known. Well, he was even-keeled outside of the bedroom, at any rate.</p><p>She still hadn\u2019t seen or heard from Carter McKay. Maybe should double-check to make sure Cash hadn\u2019t killed him for the stunt Carter pulled.</p><p>Macie hadn\u2019t been around so Gemma knew Cash\u2019s anxiety didn\u2019t have anything to do with his daughter.</p><p>Trevor? Why would seeing his old rodeo pal make him nervous? Hadn\u2019t Cash invited Trevor to stay at the Bar 9? Cash wasn\u2019t embarrassed to be working here, was he?</p><p>No. She noticed he\u2019d taken pride in whipping the ranch into shape.</p><p>So, that meant his edginess had something to do with her. Fear settled in her chest.</p><p>Was he leaving?</p><p>Don\u2019t be ridiculous. His daughter is here. He doesn\u2019t have anywhere else to go. He likes the Bar 9. He likes you.</p><p>If he liked her so much maybe he could make love to her just one time with the damn lights on?</p><p>Shit. She could mope around all afternoon. Or she could do any one of the fifty jobs waiting to be finished at the Bar 9.</p><p>Trevor said, \u201cI thought I\u2019d stop up and say hi to her first, get a bite to eat before I came back here to the ranch and...\u201d</p><p>Cash grunted. Part of him didn\u2019t want to think about it.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I told you it\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s a surprise she don\u2019t want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What if she says no?\u201d</p><p>Cash tipped his head back and studied Trevor. \u201cWill it bother you if she sends you packin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He thought about it and said, \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know this doesn\u2019t go beyond us, right?\u201d</p><p>Trevor sighed. \u201cI keep more damn secrets than you can shake a stick at, Cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then you know what to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe a sad day in my life when I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Carter didn\u2019t see Jack\u2019s rental car in the parking lot of the Last Chance Diner.</p><p>So who was the dark-haired guy Macie was chatting up at the counter?</p><p>Maybe Jack had left his car at Macie\u2019s camper. And had spent all day hanging out with her. Talking to her, doing normal couple shit he hadn\u2019t had time for lately.</p><p>Seething, Carter stormed inside.</p><p>The place was deserted. Good. Less witnesses for the bloodshed.</p><p>The dark-haired man had his hand on Macie\u2019s arm. She was smiling at him. Smiling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He couldn\u2019t wait to plow his fist into the bastard\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cGet your hand off her, Jack, or I\u2019ll break it so you never draw another goddamn thing.\u201d</p><p>Macie looked up at him, horrified. \u201cCarter?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStay out of this, Macie.

What the hell are you doin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlannin\u2019 on kickin\u2019 your butt as soon as I finish my pie. What is wrong with you, Carter? It ain\u2019t like you to pick fights.\u201d</p><p>Carter ignored the question and glanced at Macie. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I know? He\u2019s your friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause last night...\u201d Damn. Could he be wrong? Could he really be that paranoid?</p><p>Yes, when it came to Macie all rationality vanished.</p><p>Because he loved her.</p><p>Wildly.</p><p>Out-of-his-freakin\u2019-mind-all-or-nothing-kind-of-love.</p><p>Without taking his gaze from Macie, Carter said, \u201cTrevor. Step outside for a minute.\u201d</p><p>Trevor mumbled something and slipped out the door.</p><p>\u201cPlease fill in the fuzzy details.\u201d</p> <p>Macie\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cAfter you passed out, Jack passed on the real reason you\u2019d asked him here, and I passed on being any part of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I went Wahoo! and screwed his brains out while you were sacked out in the lawn chair.\u201d</p><p>The feeling of relief nearly buckled his knees. \u201cSo you didn\u2019t, I mean, you don\u2019t want that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA m\u00e9nage? I was kidding about multiple cowboys, Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not something I\u2019m interested in trying at this point in my life.\u201d Those all-knowing hazel eyes clouded. \u201cHey. Did you just call me your girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are my girl.\u201d My everything.</p><p>\u201cI am not a girl, Carter McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl, woman, whatever, you\u2019re mine and I was ready to kill my best friend for makin\u2019 a move on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for him.\u201d Carter stalked her, until her back was against the cement wall.</p><p>\u201cKiss me and make me all better, darlin\u2019. Your sweet, hot kisses heal my damn foolish pride.\u201d</p><p>Macie whispered, \u201cYou are such a dumbass,\u201d and lifted her lips to his for the sweetest kiss on the planet.</p><p>When Carter could feel his heart beating again, he picked Macie up and threw her over his shoulder. He yelled, \u201cVelma? Macie\u2019s takin\u2019 a sick day. She\u2019s feelin\u2019 a mite poorly.\u201d</p><p>Velma poked her head through the doorway and grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. Just make sure she\u2019s here tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be here bright and early with bells on.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cDefinitely better than dinner theater.\u201d</p><p>As Carter carted Macie outside, she said, \u201cTrevor? Umm. Tell my dad I won\u2019t be home tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll night,\u201d Carter added and tossed her in his truck.</p><p>Macie expected Carter to play grab-ass with her on the way to his place. But he was strangely subdued. He parked and looked at her.</p><p>\u201cStay here until I come getcha, okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. After ten minutes passed, she couldn\u2019t stand waiting any longer. She snuck inside the darkened trailer and heard him thumping around in his bedroom.</p><p>\u201cCarter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I don\u2019t listen very well.\u201d Macie paused in the doorway and watched him wrestling with a set of silky peach-colored sheets. Which, by the looks of it, were a size too small, which was probably the reason they wouldn\u2019t fit on the bed. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrewing this up, apparently.\u201d Disgusted, he tossed the sheets aside. \u201cI wanted it to be perfect.\u201d A sound, half sigh/half laugh, rumbled from his chest. He scrubbed his hands over the stubble on his face. \u201cBut there ain\u2019t moonlight, hell, it ain\u2019t even night. I don\u2019t have candles, or soft music, unless you count Faith Hill. No flowers. Or champagne. Now I can\u2019t even get the damn sheets on the bed. And to top it off, I have wicked hangover.</p><p>Some romantic setting, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you setting a scene? I don\u2019t need all that for you to seduce me.\u201d</p><p>Carter looked at her. Her breath stalled in her lungs. Those blue, blue eyes held everything she\u2019d ever wanted and he was looking at her. Offering it to her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about seduction. It\u2019s about love. I love you, Macie. Really, really love you and I\u2019ve never said that to another girl\u2014woman\u2014in my whole life. And I wanted it to be perfect when I told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>His words were cut off when she launched herself at him and kissed him. When Carter realized she was crying, he pulled back.</p><p>\u201cHey. What\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>Macie couldn\u2019t answer. She buried her face in his neck and sobbed. He hugged her tightly until she calmed down. She finally looked up at him. \u201cI really, really love you too, Carter, and I\u2019ve never said that to anyone either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could be a gentleman and tell you that you didn\u2019t have to say it back to me just</p><p>\u2019cause I said it first.\u201d He grinned. \u201cBut we both know I ain\u2019t really a gentleman and hot damn, am I ever glad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happens now?\u201d Do we ride off into the sunset together? Start picking out china patterns?</p><p>Romantic nonsense, Macie Blue.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out as we go.\u201d Carter pushed her on the bed and she squealed at the wicked, sweet, hot look of forever in his eyes. \u201cFor now, we\u2019ve got a free afternoon and a whole box of condoms. That\u2019s as good as any place to start.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-four</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here for what?\u201d Gemma knew her voice was a shade shy of hysterical.</p><p>Cash gazed at her coolly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pretend with me, Gem, I know you.</p><p>Heck, you told me you were interested in tryin\u2019 it just earlier this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were in bed! That doesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why it does count. Plus, I overheard you last summer, talkin\u2019 with Channing \u2019bout it, and how long your curiosity has been piqued. Trevor is here to satisfy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevor. You asked Trevor if he wanted to be part of a threesome? With me? And you?\u201d Gemma shook her head, even as her blood raced. \u201cCash, why would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you want it. And I want to give you something he never did.\u201d</p><p>He. Meaning her late husband, Steve.</p><p>Was this really happening? She and Steve talked about a threesome in vague generalities throughout their marriage, more along the lines of...a fantasy fuck. Gemma had a thing for country singer Chris Ledoux and Steve teased her that if the opportunity arose, he\u2019d watch Chris doin\u2019 her, then he\u2019d join in. Around that time in the conversation, Steve would explicitly detail what it\u2019d be like to see another man sliding his cock up Gemma\u2019s ass while he fucked her pussy. It made them both hot. Then they\u2019d head to bed, screw, and laugh it off afterward.</p><p>Except...Gemma had always wondered what it\u2019d feel like to have two sets of male hands on her. Two men\u2019s mouths kissing, licking, and teasing her hot spots. Two cocks filling her holes in a variety of ways. Her softer body sandwiched between strong, muscular, passionate masculine ones as they penetrated her. As they focused solely on her sexual pleasure.</p><p>She\u2019d never been dissatisfied in her sexual life with Steve. After he\u2019d died, her sex drive died too. She couldn\u2019t get beyond the grief to think about one man touching her, let alone two men.</p><p>Now that she\u2019d moved on, Cash more than satisfied her sexual desires; he understood them. Which is why he\u2019d gone to so much trouble to set this up. What might seem like bizarre, scandalous behavior to others was actually incredibly...sweet. A loving gesture from a man she suspected hadn\u2019t taken a lot of chances in his life to showcase his sweet, thoughtful side.</p><p>But Cash also realized in order for her to enjoy this fantasy, she\u2019d have to be comfortable with the third player. He\u2019d have to be a man she knew\u2014and was attracted to.</p><p>Trevor Glanzer fit the bill, a good-looking cowboy who\u2019d literally been trying to charm the pants off her for two years. The fact Trevor traveled here, willing to make both she and Cash happy, if only for one night, appealed to the wild woman in her. She\u2019d been too scared to take the opportunity when it\u2019d been offered to her in her younger years.</p><p>Well, she was older and wiser. No way was she letting the chance pass her by again.</p><p>A delicious shiver of anticipation rolled through her.</p><p>\u201cOkay. But three things first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo blindfold. Leave your hair unbraided. And the lights stay on.\u201d</p><p>A slow, sexy smile lit up Cash\u2019s face. \u201cWhatever you want, Gem, tonight is for you.</p><p>Trevor and I will be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter?\u201d</p><p>He softly kissed Macie\u2019s lips and tucked the covers under her chin. \u201cSsh. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut to the barn to work. I can\u2019t seem to get to sleep.\u201d He brushed his mouth over her forehead. \u201cSorry to wake you. Go back to sleep. You won\u2019t even know I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Okay. Love you.\u201d</p><p>Carter\u2019s heart nearly burst out of his chest. \u201cLove you too, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>He whistled as he headed outside. He knew exactly what his paintings had been missing these last few weeks. Risky, but he\u2019d toss the whole works he\u2019d already done and start over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No wonder artists talked about love being the best inspiration; it was true.</p><p>He could finally show the world what Macie meant to him. Who she was to him and who he was to her. How she looked at him with love. Love he\u2019d been searching for his entire adult life.</p><p>Trevor grinned at her. \u201cBeen waitin\u2019 for this day for a long time, precious Gem-stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, I am a little nervous, so be kind, okay?\u201d</p><p>Trevor moseyed over and cupped her face in his big hands. Warm, full lips pressed hers before his tongue snaked inside.</p><p>Gemma jumped when she felt Cash move in behind her. \u201cEasy.\u201d His fingers curled into her hips and he nuzzled his face in her hair.</p><p>Trevor licked and nipped at her mouth and pulled back with a sigh. \u201cKind? Huh-uh. I wanna fuck you like an animal. I\u2019m gonna show you the dark side of lust.\u201d His lips came down on hers and he leisurely unbuttoned her blouse. Cash peeled it down her trembling arms. Then Cash unhooked her bra and her breasts tumbled into Trevor\u2019s hands.</p><p>Gemma\u2019s head rested on Cash\u2019s shoulder, his long hair drifted across her bared skin in an erotic tease as Trevor tongued her nipples. Cash breathed heavily in her ear, slowly sliding his hands down to unsnap her jeans.</p><p>A flash of heat speared between her legs and she moaned.</p><p>\u201cI love the sound of a woman\u2019s pleasure. It\u2019s gonna be a long night. We aren\u2019t even to the good stuff yet,\u201d Trevor said, kissing a path to where her jeans gapped. He inhaled.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Love the smell of wet pussy. Help me take her jeans down, Cash.\u201d</p><p>Cash tugged and her pants slithered down her legs.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you warmed up.\u201d Trevor\u2019s first two fingers slipped over her mound and into her sex. Deep. He added another finger, wiggled and pumped, filling the room with the juicy sucking sound of her excitement.</p><p>Gemma widened her stance and tipped her neck to the side giving Cash better access.</p><p>Trevor withdrew his hand and finger-painted up her torso, following the line with his mouth. He wiped the wetness on her nipples and sucked it off, moaning his enjoyment.</p><p>\u201cCash, finger fuck her while I eat these delicious tits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladly.\u201d Cash ground his cock into her ass as his hand moved between her thighs.</p><p>He whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re wet. This is makin\u2019 you hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You wanna get off fast? Or have me draw it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFast. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d say that.\u201d He plunged three fingers inside her pussy, then brought those some three wet fingers up to her mound. He opened the hood of skin covering her clit with his two outside fingers, while the middle one stroked the small button. Tapped it.</p> <p>Rubbed it fast, the way he knew she liked it.</p><p>Between Trevor sucking and biting her nipples, and Cash\u2019s expert attention to her clit, she couldn\u2019t hold back. The pulsing started and she came with a startled gasp.</p><p>After the throbbing slowed, Gemma opened her eyes. Trevor grinned at her. \u201cGood warm up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat warm up.\u201d</p><p>His hand traced the lines of her collarbones and up the center of her throat. He brushed his fingers across her lips. \u201cOpen up. Suck your juices off my fingers.\u201d Then he slid all three into her mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s it. I wanna see you enjoying your sweet cream.\u201d</p><p>She sucked, tasting herself on Trevor\u2019s rough knuckles. She lapped at his fingers, trying to discern the salty taste of his skin from her musk.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sexy as hell.\u201d He eased them out and said, \u201cCash? Your turn.\u201d</p><p>Then Cash\u2019s fingers slipped inside her mouth. She licked his thick digits, rolling them over her eager tongue, removing all traces of her taste. Suddenly Cash pulled his fingers out and smashed his mouth to hers, vigorously sucking her own juices off her tongue. Bringing the flavor into his mouth and swallowing it.</p><p>Gemma\u2019s head swam in a burst of pleasure.</p><p>While Cash kissed her, Trevor licked a path up to her ear. He kneaded her breasts, plumping them together. He whispered, \u201cI want to fuck your tits. Grease them up and straddle your face so you can suck my balls while I\u2019m sliding my cock here.\u201d His finger demonstrated. \u201cIt\u2019ll be hard and fast. I\u2019d come all over your breasts and your belly. Then I\u2019d start all over again.\u201d</p><p>Gemma shivered from the erotic whispers in her ear and the kiss assaulting her mouth. She broke away with a gasp.</p><p>Trevor chuckled. \u201cI think she\u2019s ready for more. Want me to show you something fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash, strip. Both of you get on the bed.\u201d</p><p>As they disrobed and stood side by side, Gemma was amazed at how different Cash and Trevor\u2019s bodies were. The lighter tone of Trevor\u2019s skin compared to the reddish-golden hue of Cash\u2019s. The hair sprinkled on their thighs and arms, and the thick nest of curls between their legs. The sizes and shapes of their cocks\u2014not that she could complain on either front. Still, she felt a little distressed the first time she\u2019d seen Cash completely naked was in front of another man. But her distress was short-lived when four rough-skinned male hands caressed her everywhere.</p><p>\u201cOn your hands and knees, Gem-stone.\u201d Trevor paused and looked at Cash. \u201cYou sittin\u2019 on the fence this go-round or are you ridin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Cash smiled. A bit cockily. \u201cOh. I\u2019m ridin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Get on your knees at the head of the bed.\u201d</p><p>Gemma complied, trying to slow the beating of her heart and the slight fear laced with curiosity.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you gonna be?\u201d Cash said.</p><p>\u201cAt the foot.\u201d Trevor\u2019s callused fingers raked the sole of her foot. Then meandered up her calves and the backs of her thighs, tapping the inside of her legs for her to widen her stance. \u201cOr should I say, at the rear.\u201d</p><p>A long, wet tongue swiped up from Gemma\u2019s pussy to her anus. She gasped, turning to see Trevor standing behind her. He said, \u201cSuck him, while I suck you. I assume you ain\u2019t opposed to a little ass play, since I\u2019m gonna be in it soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Oh GOD.\u201d</p><p>Then Trevor was rimming her hole with his tongue, wiggling it inside, tickling the knot of nerves while his fingers delved into her wetness and slipped higher to masterfully stroke her clit.</p><p>Hands were on her head. Cash\u2019s cock was in her face. He growled, \u201cTake it all.\u201d</p><p>Gemma opened and sucked him to the root. He began to thrust into her throat. She closed her eyes and just let herself feel the hot, kinky, overwhelming sensations of animal lust, the taboo experiences she\u2019d only dared imagine.</p><p>Trevor canted her hips, licking and sucking everywhere between her thighs, making her wet and swollen with need.</p><p>Cash tugged on her hair and said, \u201cIt\u2019s fuckin\u2019 sexy watchin\u2019 my dick disappear into that hot mouth. Knowin\u2019 what he\u2019s doin\u2019 to you.\u201d</p><p>She hummed her response. The vibration sent Cash over the edge. His cock pulsed on her tongue, semen burst in her mouth and she swallowed as much as she could.</p><p>Trevor quit playing with her ass and concentrated his attention on her clit. The orgasm blindsided her\u2014fast, intense spasms. She moaned, rocking back onto Trevor\u2019s mouth. Even as the throbbing eased, she heard the rip of a condom package, and felt cool gel on her puckered opening.</p><p>He pressed her upper body to the mattress. \u201cDo you know how many times I\u2019ve jerked off, thinkin\u2019 about rammin\u2019 my cock up this perfect cowgirl ass?\u201d His fingers peeled her cheeks apart. The head of his cock brushed a slick circle around the entrance and pushed past the ring of muscles in one quick movement.</p><p>Gemma stiffened up.</p><p>\u201cJesus. You feel like heaven, Gem.\u201d Trevor pulled out an inch at a time and delved back in just as slowly. Over and over. Gently, but yet, knowing how far he could push for her maximum pleasure.</p><p>Cash scooted against the headboard. His hands slid under her to play with her nipples. He murmured, \u201cYou\u2019re fine. You look beautiful, all stretched out, with your ass in the air. Givin\u2019 him what all the cowboys on the circuit have been dreamin\u2019 \u2019bout.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head up and locked her gaze to Cash\u2019s. \u201cYou too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. I wanted to fuck you every way possible. Buried balls deep in your sassy little butt was high on my list of ways. But this?\u201d His gaze strayed to Trevor pounding into her ass. \u201cThis never...\u201d He closed his eyes and twisted her nipples, skating close to that edge of pain. \u201cTouch yourself. I wanna hear you come while he\u2019s fucking you.\u201d</p><p>Gemma didn\u2019t know if she could come again so soon. She found her clit and rubbed, concentrating on the feel of Cash\u2019s fingers. The clasp of her anus around Trevor\u2019s cock.</p><p>A small orgasm broke free and she held her breath.</p><p>Trevor said, \u201cI have a serious thing for ass-fuckin\u2019 but I ain\u2019t gonna last much longer. Damn. You are hot and tight and all slicked up. Feelin\u2019 those muscles clampingdown. Harder. Like that. Feels un-fucking-believable...shit. I\u2019m done.\u201d Four thrusts and Trevor threw back his head and was shuddering behind her.</p><p>Time slowed. The room was cool and humid. And quiet beneath the sounds of labored breathing. Trevor went to clean himself up and Gemma lifted her body up and looked at Cash.</p><p>His back rested against the headboard. The unbound black hair hung over his shoulders. His were legs spread in a V and his cock was soft against the mattress. He clutched a bottle of water. Without opening his eyes, he said, \u201cWant some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>As she drank a few drops spilled onto his smooth, hairless chest. She watched as the droplets slowly slid down the curved muscles of his pecs. Her tongue darted out and lapped. Mmm. Wet and salty.</p><p>\u201cGemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never get to see you,\u201d she whispered, lest Trevor hear. \u201cLet me look.\u201d His nipples were a deep brown, a complement to the reddish-tan skin surrounding them. Her fingers traced the puckered scars, old white ones and new pink ones, bisecting his ribs and upper abdomen. His lower belly had a slight pudge, which Gemma found unbelievably sexy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her thumbs swept across his narrow hipbones and his stomach trembled beneath her touch. More scars.</p><p>She ignored his crotch and her fingertips moved down, over the fresh bruises on his thighs. Even at this angle she could see Cash was bowlegged\u2014another endearing trait.</p><p>Knobby, scarred knees. Gouges marred his thin calves down to his ankles. She ended the sweeping caress at his long, narrow feet. Ugly feet. All cowboys, especially rodeo cowboys, had hideously mangled toes and callused feet. Gemma stroked all these spots hungrily, her eyes drinking him in. \u201cYou are all rugged beauty and strength, Cash. Every part is...so you. Why do you hide this from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma, you humble me. That\u2019s why\u2014\u201d</p><p>Trevor sauntered back in and rubbed his hands together. \u201cWho\u2019s up for a Gemma sandwich?\u201d</p><p>Right then, Gemma wanted the m\u00e9nage fantasy to end. It seemed...selfish now. Like one of those \u201clife experiences\u201d Macie\u2019s mother had been determined to check off. She\u2019d much prefer to make love with Cash, the man she loved, skin to skin, heart to heart, looking in his beautiful all-knowing eyes. That was her fantasy now. And she\u2019d fulfill it herself. As soon as possible.</p><p>But she\u2019d finish this for them both first.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Gemma said, leaning forward to kiss Cash. To touch him. To heat him back up. Didn\u2019t take much for his cock to stir in her hand.</p><p>Trevor trailed kisses down her spine. A warm, sweetness that caused gooseflesh to break out and her desire to return with a surprisingly bitter edge.</p><p>Cash\u2019s hard kiss belied the soft touches on the front of her body; her breasts, her stomach, between her legs. Trevor kissed and caressed her back, and was rubbing his hard cock against her butt crack.</p><p>The ache rebuilt. Her body tingled, inside and out. Her pussy was drenched, needy.</p><p>Already deliciously used. Her head spun and she wanted to know if the reality of two men buried inside her lived up to her years of imagination.</p><p>She retreated from the hunger of Cash\u2019s mouth and said, \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Trevor continued to touch her, his mouth moving across her lower back. \u201cOn the bed, or standin\u2019 up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStandin\u2019 up we\u2019ll both be able to get into you at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She stood alone, arms folded over her chest as condoms were rolled on.</p><p>Trevor stepped in front of her, smoothing his hands over her body, leaving sucking kisses on her neck as he lifted her right leg, placing her foot on the bed, forcing her wide stance. \u201cEasier access,\u201d he muttered against her chest.</p><p>Cash\u2019s hot body pressed into hers from behind and he licked the slope of her shoulder to her nape.</p><p>Hard hands groped and petted and caressed her everywhere. Two hot mouths kissing her skin. Trading off to kiss her mouth. The bite of teeth. The trill of warm lips. Heated breath. Licking tongues. The scent of sweat and salt and latex and need. Trevor\u2019s rigid cock slipped up her thigh. Cash tilted her hips, opening her cheeks, poising his cockhead at her entrance.</p><p>Then a hard thrust and they were both inside her. She gasped.</p> <p>Trevor withdrew and plunged in again. He waited, and Cash did the same.</p><p>Her ass was stretched, full, and then empty. Her cunt was trying to expel Trevor\u2019s cock and keep it in. She had no control. She began to panic.</p><p>Cash whispered, \u201cRelax. Let go. Just feel. This is a one-time-only deal. Let us fuck you. Feel us both in you. You\u2019re perfect, Gemma. Hot and tight. Beautiful. Sexy. Mine.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the side of her neck in the spot that drove her wild. Trevor followed suit, dragging his mouth on the opposite side of her throat.</p><p>In. Out. The pain of fullness gave way to pleasure and she lost herself in pure sensation of touch. Deep inside her. Fingers stroking her clit. Cash whispering in her ear.</p><p>He groaned and Trevor stopped moving, holding Gemma\u2019s hips while Cash thrust hard and climaxed. While Cash\u2019s head sagged on her shoulder, Trevor pumped his hips and took his own release.</p><p>With sweaty male bodies plastered to her, and two cocks inside her, Gemma had no choice but to stay still and wait for them to catch their breath.</p><p>Finally, Cash said, \u201cShe didn\u2019t come, Trev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe gotcha.\u201d</p><p>Trevor suckled her nipples, Cash\u2019s thumb flicked her clit and he sank his teeth into the curve of her neck, they both thrust hard at the same time.</p><p>That\u2019s all she needed. An orgasm rippled through her, her internal muscles clamped down, she felt the throbbing in her clit, her womb, her anus...everywhere.</p><p>After she stopped shaking, Trevor kissed her forehead. \u201cThanks, Gem-stone. I hope it\u2019s what you had in mind. I sure as hell had fun. You are one sexy woman.\u201d He pulled out of her body, and left the room.</p><p>Cash slowly eased out of her. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms over her chest and withheld a shiver. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it everything you imagined, sweets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It was. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll clean up in the downstairs bathroom and see to Trevor.\u201d He kissed the back of her head. \u201cI\u2019ll be up in a little bit. Don\u2019t wait up. I know you\u2019re probably tired.\u201d</p><p>Cash skirted her and she watched his firm naked perfect cowboy ass as he strode out the bedroom door.</p><p>Oh. She was tired all right. Sick and tired of whatever was going on with Cash.</p><p>She\u2019d get to the bottom of it. But to do it, she\u2019d have to be on top.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t you gonna stick around tonight?\u201d Cash asked Trevor.</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m wired. I might as well hit the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you headed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLivingston.\u201d</p><p>The bug zapper by the machine shed made a loud crackling noise.</p><p>Cash sighed. \u201cAm I supposed to thank you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my pleasure, Cash. But I gotta be honest, havin\u2019 a horndog reputation across five states ain\u2019t the best for my ego these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love it. You ain\u2019t the type for settlin\u2019 down.\u201d</p><p>A surprisingly wistful look crossed Trevor\u2019s face. \u201cYeah. Well. You never know about me. I might just disappear off the face of the earth someday and settle where no one can find me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat why you\u2019re goin\u2019 to Montana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m doin\u2019 some stupid thing for my dad. Don\u2019t want to get into it.\u201d Trevor shifted his weight against the pickup. \u201cMaybe it ain\u2019t none of my business, but did something happen between you and Gemma when we took that short break?\u201d</p><p>The muscles in Cash\u2019s gut tightened. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sensed a change in her. Kinda like she was wantin\u2019 to back out.\u201d</p><p>Cash didn\u2019t know what to say. He\u2019d felt it too. Part of him wanted to squirrel Gemma away, let her look her fill at him, and not let Trevor touch her again. But he\u2019d managed to keep focused on her pleasure, fulfilling her fantasy, not his sudden displeasure with the situation.</p><p>\u201cAt any rate, she didn\u2019t. I hope it won\u2019t be weird the next time we run into each other. You are gonna do right by her, ain\u2019t ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe got no problem havin\u2019 an instant family with Macie?\u201d</p><p>Lord, Cash could only hope they\u2019d be a family. A real family. All of them. \u201cDoesn\u2019t appear to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Give that sweet Macie a kiss from me.\u201d Trevor climbed in his truck. \u201cKeep in touch with me, you ol\u2019 ornery Indian. Miss your ugly mug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeakin\u2019 of keepin\u2019 in touch...you hear much from Edgard?\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s grin died. \u201cHaven\u2019t talked to him since he left last year.\u201d</p><p>After they\u2019d been roping and traveling partners for a couple of years? That was weird. With forced cheer, Cash said, \u201cHe\u2019s probably hooked up with some little senorita and is stayin\u2019 out of trouble, eh?\u201d</p><p>Trevor snorted and looked away. \u201cDoubtful. Take care.\u201d</p><p>Cash checked Macie\u2019s camper, even though he knew she wasn\u2019t there. He checked the horses before he headed inside. Yeah. He was stalling. He\u2019d be in a better place to deal with the aftermath of this tomorrow.</p><p>When he finally crawled into bed beside Gemma, she was already sound asleep.</p><p>Or so he thought.</p><p>Two hours later Cash woke up handcuffed to the headboard.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-five</p><p>A naked Gemma sat on Cash\u2019s chest looking sexy. Smug.</p><p>And a little mean.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI warned you. I want my wicked way with you, Cash. With the lights on. You wouldn\u2019t oblige me so I\u2019m takin\u2019 what I want, just like you would.\u201d</p><p>Stall stall stall. \u201cThe lights were on last night when Trevor was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNewsflash, cowboy. It\u2019s still night. And that doesn\u2019t count.\u201d She leaned forward, making her nipples within licking distance. \u201cI want to look in your eyes when I\u2019m making love to you. Would that be so bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash,\u201d she mocked.</p><p>Damn. He closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cheating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Do what you will. I\u2019m helpless anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so thrilled by the prospect of me touching you.\u201d</p><p>A beat passed. Nothing happened. Then he heard snip snip. Naturally, his curious eyes opened.</p><p>Gemma held a pair of scissors. Right next to his groin.</p><p>\u201cJesus. You\u2019re gonna castrate me?\u201d His frantic gaze zoomed to the corroded steel blades. \u201cWith rusty scissors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you rather I shut off the lights and did it in the dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax. I\u2019m cutting off your boxers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>She stroked him through the cotton material.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re lookin\u2019 to...release me, umm, there is a hole in the front for that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Every time she moved, those damn pretty tits swayed enticingly and he couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off them. Just a little closer...</p><p>Cash licked his lips.</p> <p>Her saucy smile disappeared. An all-knowing feminine look glinted in her eyes. \u201cBut guess what? I\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t care if you get off. You can watch me get off.\u201d She tossed the scissors to the floor and straddled his pelvis on her knees so his dick bumped into her ass.</p><p>Cash clenched his butt cheeks together.</p><p>Lord she looked beautiful. With her tousled blonde hair. Her pink lips swollen from their kisses. Tan lines criss-crossing her arms from slaving outdoors. The smattering of cinnamon-colored freckles across her chest. The curve of her ribs flaring into hips a man could sink his hands into. Her long legs, especially the strong muscles in her thighs from spending her life astride a horse. The bright red nail polish on her dainty feet\u2014about her only concession to her femininity. He loved every square inch of her. He stared hungrily at her.</p><p>Not that she was paying attention to him.</p><p>Gemma flattened her palms on her belly and slid them up her ribcage. She arched.</p> <p>Her fingers fluttered higher. Then those ivory breasts were cupped in her hands and she strummed the pink tips with her thumbs until they drew into hard tips. She moaned.</p><p>His hips lifted slightly.</p><p>\u201cThat feels good. Mmm. But do you know what would feel better?\u201d</p><p>My lips?</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d Watching his face, she sucked her fingers into mouth. \u201cMmm.\u201d She kept sucking, letting him get a flash of that naughty pink tongue.</p><p>Oh, he knew what damage that tongue could do. Bring a man to his knees with one wicked swipe.</p> <p>Gemma eased her wet fingers out of her mouth, smiled, then used them to twist her right nipple. The fingers of her other hand glided down her stomach to the thatch of golden curls. The tip of her middle finger dipped down into her slit. Played around with the opening to her pussy and her ass as she rocked her hips forward, letting him see everything, letting him how she pleasured herself. She pushed two fingers in deep.</p><p>His cock jerked hard.</p><p>Her moan was only slightly sexier than the moist sucking sounds of her fingers moving in and out of her pussy.</p><p>Then her fingers returned, glistening with her juices, to rub her clit.</p><p>Cash groaned. He couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away from this woman who held nothing back. In bed or out.</p><p>Her hips undulated, she said, \u201cOh, yes,\u201d as she touched herself like he wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>Screw that. He was here.</p><p>\u201cGemma. You\u2019re killin\u2019 me. You proved your point. Let me touch you.\u201d</p> <p>And then she was in his face. \u201cWhy should I? You won\u2019t let me touch you. In fact, I don\u2019t even get to see you naked. It\u2019s been nearly three months you\u2019ve spent in my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can touch me right now.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cSo I had to ask myself: Am I that disgusting that you can\u2019t stand to look at my body when you make love to me?\u201d</p><p>His jaw dropped. \u201cJesus. No!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it because I\u2019m too old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not the body, then is it my face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Christsake, no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it must be you.\u201d</p><p>His pulse pounded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not scarred, or tattooed, or ashamed of the size of your big dick either. So, why is it, Cash Big Crow, that it always has to be so damn dark between us?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI will leave you handcuffed here all night and all day if you don\u2019t answer. I might even stretch it out to two days. You know I don\u2019t make idle threats. Call this my pre-emptive strike.\u201d</p><p>He probably deserved that. \u201cGemma, sweets, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sweet-talkin\u2019, no bullshit. Tell me what in tarnation is goin\u2019 on with you and why we are always in the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want you to know. I don\u2019t want you to see...\u201d He squeezed his lids hard. But he knew it wouldn\u2019t do any good.</p><p>\u201cSee what? Please. Cash. Look. At. Me.\u201d</p><p>Cash opened his eyes. \u201cSee that I love you.\u201d</p><p>Gemma didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in love with you for two years. From the first moment I saw you at the Ardmore Rodeo. You were perfect; a horsewoman who loved the land, who loved her stock, who was loyal to her friends. A sexy cowgirl who was smart, and smart-mouthed and could hold her own with rodeo cowboys and queens alike. But you were still grievingfor your husband and it broke my goddamn heart. So I bided my time, actin\u2019 like your friend, when in fact, I\u2019ve been a lovesick fool for you for years, Gem, waitin\u2019 and hopingyou\u2019d notice me. Give me a chance.</p><p>\u201cLast year I thought you were finally gonna take a chance. But you weren\u2019t ready to move on. I didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d ever be ready. \u2019Bout killed me to let you go. But I did.</p><p>When you came to me, offerin\u2019 me a job, offerin\u2019 me the dream of bein\u2019 with you every day... I\u2019m such a selfish bastard. I knew if I didn\u2019t claim everything I wanted from you up front, you\u2019d give me scraps and I\u2019d probably take them. But I found my pride and demanded all or nothin\u2019. It floored me when you said yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have asked you, or said yes to you if I hadn\u2019t wanted you. All of you.\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cI\u2019m a little stubborn in case you hadn\u2019t noticed. But you aren\u2019t answering my question. Why the darkness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hid your eyes that first night because I didn\u2019t want you to regret bein\u2019 with me, especially when I sorta forced your hand. And I sure as hell didn\u2019t want you to look down at me when we were both naked for the first time, and remember back to the last time a man had made love to you, and wish I was Steve.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cThen I heard you cryin\u2019 afterward. It hurt like a son of a bitch. I didn\u2019t mean for it to go this far\u2014with the blindfold, the darkness, and the funky sexual positions. But I knew I\u2019d never be able to hide how I feel when I look in your eyes as I\u2019m lovin\u2019 you. I wanted to wait until there might be a chance it didn\u2019t scare you and...you might love me back some day.\u201d</p><p>Gemma opened her mouth.</p><p>\u201cLet me finish. Bein\u2019 naked, in body and soul, that\u2019s when I can\u2019t blame my goofy face every time I look at you, on the sun, or dirt, or gas fumes. That\u2019s when you can see that you are everything to me. It\u2019s like my fantasy come true, lettin\u2019 me touch your body, be a part of your life, givin\u2019 me a place to live, getting to do work I love. Acceptin\u2019 my daughter and my past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see all that in your eyes, Cash. But you were so busy hiding from me, that if you would\u2019ve bothered to look, you\u2019d see the same exact thing in mine.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard. \u201cI\u2019m thirty-eight years old and I\u2019ve never been in love. Made me wonder if I knew how to love.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother to hide his need or fear from her. \u201cWill you teach me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But you know more than you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncuff me. Gemma, let me hold you. Please.\u201d</p><p>Gemma unfastened the handcuffs. Cash rolled her to her back and crawled on top of her. He didn\u2019t move. He just gazed into her pale blue eyes, eyes shining with love. For him. Damn humbling.</p><p>\u201cCan I stay right here and look my fill, since I\u2019ve been denyin\u2019 myself the pleasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only pleasure you\u2019ve denied yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWill you give me the pleasure of becomin\u2019 my wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a bumpy road. Some people ain\u2019t gonna like the fact you married an Indian.</p><p>They\u2019ll think I married you to get my hands on your ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe joke\u2019s on them, because we both know you want to marry me to get your big red hands on my body.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou are one horny widowed lady.\u201d</p><p>She smacked his ass. Hard.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou will pay for that later. Dearly. Anyway, as for family issues that might be a problem once we\u2019re hitched. I have a grown daughter I\u2019m finally learningto be a father to after two decades. I\u2019d like to think the worst is behind Macie and me, but it might not be. Are you okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus, there is a difference in our ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell does that matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That none of the issues we\u2019ll be facin\u2019 as husband and wife will matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they matter, but will you at least let me say yes to marrying you before you start laying out all our future problems?\u201d</p><p>Cash froze. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say yes yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Ask me again.\u201d Gemma slid her arms around his neck. \u201cAsk me as you\u2019re making love to me. Lookin\u2019 in my eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever the lady wants. I\u2019m never turnin\u2019 the lights off again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe a little hard to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be a whole lot of sleepin\u2019 goin\u2019 on tonight.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-six</p><p>Two weeks later...</p><p>The dappled gray filly pranced inside the training arena. She\u2019d trot up to the fence, but the second Macie held her hand out to touch her, the high-spirited horse would whinny and race away.</p><p>\u201cPretty, ain\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGorgeous. She seems to have a mind of her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike all good fillies do.\u201d</p><p>Macie laughed. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>Pause.</p><p>\u201cYou can name her whatever you want since she\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine?\u201d</p><p>Her dad said, \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Hoofbeats faded as the horse galloped to the other side of the fence.</p><p>\u201cYou bought me a horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Macie squealed and threw her arms around his neck. \u201cOmigod, I think I\u2019m gonna cry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He squeezed back. \u201cShe\u2019s young, and you\u2019re gonna have to work with her a lot before you can ride her. But if you train her right from the start, she\u2019ll always mind you, and she won\u2019t let you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy first horse. Yay! I feel like an eight-year-old girl. Dad, thank you, thank you, thank you! I\u2019ll ride her, and pet her, and feed her, and take her for walks everyday, and she\u2019ll be my best friend...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are such a smarty-pants.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow cool is that? Pretty soon I\u2019ll be clip-clopping along on my very own horse, shootin\u2019 varmints with my new rifle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bought her a rifle too?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>They both turned around. Her dad\u2019s face lit up like the bug zapper. He wrapped his arm around Gemma\u2019s shoulders and kissed her temple. \u201cWell, yeah. She needed her own gun out here in the wild wild West.\u201d</p><p>Macie watched her father and Gemma mooning over each other. They were so deliriously happy; she didn\u2019t begrudge them a bit of it. It spilled onto her. And rather than his relationship with Gemma driving a wedge between her and her father, it seemed to strengthen their bond.</p><p>Happy. Were she and Carter happy?</p> <p>Despite the fact she and Carter lobbed the \u201cL\u201d word back and forth, things hadn\u2019t changed much in the last two weeks. He\u2019d locked himself in the barn to finish up the final pieces for his show and she\u2019d worked mega hours at the diner. They hadn\u2019t talked about what would happen after his show was over. They hadn\u2019t talked at all about her deciding to take Velma\u2019s offer to help run the diner. Carter had been so...obsessed with his work that he hadn\u2019t asked about hers. It shouldn\u2019t have bothered her, but it did.</p><p>It means your job in a small time diner isn\u2019t as important as his big art show.</p><p>Macie hoped with the diner closing for a little over a week they\u2019d get to eek out time.</p><p>If not, well, she did have a horse to train. She couldn\u2019t wait to tell him. After giving her father another hug, she drove to Carter\u2019s place.</p><p>Although his truck was there, he wasn\u2019t in the trailer. She hesitated at the barn door.</p><p>He was protective of his space and she never ventured in uninvited after that first day.</p> <p>She yelled, \u201cCarter?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cCarter? Are you in here?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>She slipped inside. It wasn\u2019t the same pigsty she\u2019d remembered from last time when he\u2019d given her the erotic painting lesson. No jars of mineral spirits or rolls of canvas, sections of thin boards or mysterious pieces of machinery covered the ground.</p><p>Damn dark in here though.</p><p>Macie reached for the light. Once her eyes adjusted, she found herself looking at paintings of herself. Everywhere. But not only was she buck-assed naked in the pictures, she was lost in the throes of passion. Or just looking lost. Each one focused on a different (naked!) part of her body. The disturbing part wasn\u2019t that the pictures were just...parts.</p><p>They were parts of a whole person. Of her. Showcasing her expressions. Her moods. Her secret thoughts. It was all there, on her face. Atop her naked body.</p> <p>Tears stung her eyes. This is what he\u2019d been creating? Pornographic images of her?</p><p>No wonder he\u2019d acted so secretive.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a prude. She\u2019d seen art exhibits with nudes. No doubt the pictures were excellent. But that was a catch-22 because she couldn\u2019t pretend it wasn\u2019t her plastered on canvas. Her heart, her soul and\u2014good heavens were those her thighs?\u2014spread wide for the world to see.</p><p>Surely he didn\u2019t plan on exhibiting these in his show. He couldn\u2019t be that thoughtless, could he?</p><p>The barn door opened. Macie stood her ground even when she wanted to flee.</p><p>Carter trudged in. He stopped and looked at her, then at the paintings she\u2019d seen, then back at her. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to see them like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen were you going to show me?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You were just going to spring these on me at your showing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach roiled. \u201cToo bad. You can\u2019t show them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot display those pictures of me, Carter. I won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me? It\u2019s a done deal. I have a show in two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPostpone it until you can make something else.\u201d</p><p>Carter laughed softly. \u201cRight. I don\u2019t have time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Macie. Be reasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReasonable? I\u2019m naked in them. What does me being naked have to do with Western art?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so people in the West don\u2019t get naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. Aren\u2019t there supposed to be sculptures of horses or cowboys riding through sagebrush?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already fulfilled those requirements in other mediums and other pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t need to show these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. What\u2019s the big deal? You agreed to pose for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like that! I told you no naked pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were kidding. You know, like you were kidding about wanting a cowboy m\u00e9nage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the same thing, Carter. I specifically said no nudes, several times, remember?\u201d</p><p>Carter frowned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never agree to this. Ever. Not even half-naked. Especially not...\u201d Completely exposed. Had he been gauging her facial expressions while they\u2019d been making love so he could reproduce them on canvas? Was that all she\u2019d been to him? A muse he could fuck and use?</p><p>He stared at her blandly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what? Show the world how much I love you? How much I love every part of you? That\u2019s what the pictures are, Macie. Love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not love. That is porn!\u201d</p><p>Carter sighed and raked his fingers through his curls. \u201cI was afraid this might happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That I\u2019d freak out about strangers seeing my bare body painted in every conceivable position?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that you wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Macie wanted to scream. Instead, she snapped, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t understand? Because I don\u2019t have a fucking Masters of Fine Arts that I can\u2019t see I\u2019m utterly naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop actin\u2019 like a child. It\u2019s art. It\u2019s my art. And to put it crudely, darlin\u2019, I don\u2019t give a shit if you like it or not. This collection of stylized portraitures are the best I\u2019ve ever done and I\u2019ll be damn proud to display them at the gallery.\u201d</p><p>Hollowness replaced her earlier joy. \u201cIs that all I am now? A collection of portraitures to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? You\u2019re confusin\u2019 you with the pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t a thing. These pictures are an extension of you. How can you not see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you not see how wrong this is?\u201d She swallowed with difficulty because her mouth was bone dry. \u201cPlease. I\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p><p>A muscle in his jaw flexed.</p><p>\u201cCarter. Please. Don\u2019t show them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacie. Stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t display these.\u201d</p><p>He looked away.</p><p>\u201cIf you loved me you wouldn\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>Carter\u2019s hard gaze boomeranged to hers. \u201cIf you loved me you wouldn\u2019t ask me not showcase my best work.\u201d</p><p>Macie wondered if he could hear her heart breaking in the silence. Without another word, she turned and walked out.</p><p>And this time, he didn\u2019t chase her down.</p><p>Luckily her father was gone when she returned to the Bar 9. She suspected the pictures\u2014or Carter McKay\u2014wouldn\u2019t live to see another day when he found out.</p><p>Just imagining her dad, or anyone else, looking at those paintings made her stomach hurt. She didn\u2019t remember ever feeling so alone. So helpless. So literally heartsick. Lord, she needed someone to talk to. Since her best pal Kat was hours away in Denver, she tracked down Gemma and poured out the whole story.</p><p>After the tears settled, Gemma assured her she hadn\u2019t acted like a child; Carter had stepped over the line. Besides soothing her and listening without judgment, Gemma didn\u2019t have any advice, beyond offering to run interference with Macie\u2019s dad if Macie needed to get away to think things through.</p><p>So with a week\u2019s vacation looming, rather than mope around the Bar 9, Macie packed her bags and did what she did best: ran.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-seven</p><p>Two days later</p><p>\u201cThe foundry in Gillette, Wyoming, called me, in Denver, to ask why you hadn\u2019t picked up your statues. They\u2019ve been sitting there two weeks? Which means they\u2019re not finished. And here\u2019s where, as your agent, I remind you of the major showing you have in less than two weeks.\u201d</p><p>Carter scowled. He knew better to answer his cell when his agent called and he was in such a vile mood.</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on, Carter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 I can\u2019t handle. Look. I was just on my way to Gillette\u2014\u201d a total lie, \u201c\u2014to pick them up. They won\u2019t need a lot of polishin\u2019 so they are essentially done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy advice is to get them on a truck as soon as possible. What else is the gallery waiting for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shipped the major pieces last month. I\u2019m finishin\u2019 up some portraits, but I ain\u2019t shippin\u2019 those directly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to hang them myself.\u201d</p><p>Buck swore. \u201cNo way. That was not in the contract. The gallery will have an absolute fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not get a say in how anything is exhibited, McKay, least of all paintings.</p><p>Your job was to finish the art work, theirs is to display it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get the contract changed. Ain\u2019t that your job?\u201d</p><p>Silence on the receiver. \u201cMy job is to look out for my client. Which I\u2019m doing, by telling you not to push the issue on this, because you are wrong. Get the paintings packed up. Either ship them by next Friday or I\u2019ll have the gallery send a truck for them. And the cost of that, my friend, will come out of your pocket, not mine.\u201d Buck hung up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Carter threw his cell phone against the wall. It cracked in two pieces and plastic shards scattered everywhere. Like he cared. Like anyone had called him.</p><p>Jesus. The last couple days had been a fucking nightmare. After his fight with Macie, he\u2019d needed a day to cool off. When he\u2019d swung by the diner around the time she usually clocked out, he saw the faded sign on the front door: Closed until further notice.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t she told him?</p> <p>Who said she didn\u2019t? Maybe you didn\u2019t hear because you haven\u2019t really listened to her in the past few weeks.</p><p>Talk about being a self-centered asshole. Dammit. This art show had sucked the life out of him. Had it sucked the soul and the conscience right out of him too?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Regardless. He needed to talk to her to set the record straight. To make her understand.</p><p>Carter didn\u2019t bother calling Macie\u2019s cell phone; he knew she wouldn\u2019t answer. He\u2019d called the Bar 9, in the guise of asking Gemma about Macie, but Gemma was curt with him. And vague.</p> <p>Why?</p><p>Because Macie was gone?</p><p>No. She wouldn\u2019t just leave without saying goodbye.</p><p>Would she?</p><p>Sure she would. Cash and Gemma were getting married soon. Summer was ending.</p><p>Macie couldn\u2019t live in the camper forever, and he knew she valued her independence too much to move into the main house. She probably felt like a third wheel. And with the diner closed, maybe she\u2019d figured it was time to hit the road.</p> <p>Or maybe someone encouraged her to hit the road.</p><p>Red rage built inside him. He wanted to hit something, but it sure as hell wasn\u2019t the road.</p><p>Carter burned rubber getting to the Bar 9.</p><p>Cash Big Crow was leaning on the fence when Carter\u2019s truck screeched to a stop.</p><p>He jumped from the cab. Four angry steps later he loomed over Macie\u2019s father.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t we been through this once before, McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf she wanted you to know, you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sent her away, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Cash faced him. \u201cDon\u2019t you come here, accusin\u2019 me of something, when you are the one who chased her away.\u201d</p><p>Carter took a threatening step closer. \u201cI did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019! It was a stupid misunderstandin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain it to me then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t my fault she freaked out about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>He paused and said nastily, \u201cIf she wanted you to know, you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you pull that smartass shit on me, son. I ain\u2019t in the mood. You came to me so you\u2019d better start talkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Macie saw a couple of the pictures I painted of her. She didn\u2019t like them, and then she forbid me from displaying them at the showing. I told her tough, they were goingup. It pissed her off and she stormed out. I ain\u2019t seen her since and I need to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>Cash glared at him. \u201cIt more than pissed her off. Accordin\u2019 to Gemma, Macie left here in tears.\u201d</p><p>Left? \u201cWhere\u2019d she go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me \u2019bout these pictures that upset her so badly.\u201d Comprehension dawned on Cash\u2019s face. His eyes filled with rage. \u201cOnly one kind of pictures that\u2019d make her cry.\u201d</p><p>Carter didn\u2019t look away.</p><p>\u201cYou painted nudie shots of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNudie? The correct term is nude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she consent to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe posed for me voluntarily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she didn\u2019t volunteer to pose for you naked, did she? That\u2019s why she\u2019s so goddamn upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see the big deal\u2014\u201d</p><p>Carter didn\u2019t see the punch Cash aimed at his jaw until it landed. He staggered back.</p><p>Rather than taking a swing, Carter rushed Cash and they hit the dirt in a tangle of flying fists.</p><p>Cash kneed him in the stomach. Carter rolled and his elbow connected with the side of Cash\u2019s head. Cash flipped over and ground Carter\u2019s face into the gravel. Carter reared up and head butted Cash in the jaw. That knocked Cash back and Carter followed up with a hard right jab to Cash\u2019s ribs. Cash kicked Carter\u2019s knee, knocking him flat before Cash pulled back and punched Carter square in the eye.</p><p>Grunts, sweat, dirt, blood fueled their rage. Neither one backed down. Seemed like the fight lasted an hour, but it\u2019d probably only been a minute when Gemma\u2019s voice boomed, \u201cBreak it up! Both of you!\u201d</p><p>Cash took advantage of Carter\u2019s distraction and threw a right cross that clacked Carter\u2019s teeth together. Blood burst from his lip. Enraged, Carter swung high, his fist grazing Cash\u2019s eyebrow.</p><p>Then they were both sputtering and soaking wet.</p><p>Gemma aimed the hose at them until they moved apart. Still coughing, spitting, bleeding, trying to find a way to get another lick in.</p><p>\u201cI said knock it off! Jesus. What is wrong with you two?\u201d</p><p>Cash glared through the blood dripping in his eye. Carter dabbed at his bloody mouth and swollen lip.</p><p>\u201cCarter, why are you here?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess, Macie.\u201d</p><p>He grunted.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you done enough damage to her without pounding on her father too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took the first swing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll take the last one, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash. Enough.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Gemma sighed. \u201cCarter. I think it\u2019s time you pack up your stuff and get back home.\u201d</p><p>Even through the throbbing in his ear, Carter knew she didn\u2019t mean home to the trailer. Why did the thought of leaving the Bar 9 make his head hurt worse and make it harder to breathe? \u201cYou ain\u2019t gonna let me explain, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to hear your excuses. You took advantage of Macie and I ain\u2019t gonna stand for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think. I love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a piss-poor way of showin\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, this is bullshit.\u201d Carter staggered to his feet. \u201cNone of you have even seen the damn pictures. They are a tribute to her. And you\u2019re\u2014\u201d he pointed at Cash,</p><p>\u201c\u2014actin\u2019 just as immature about this as she did. Yes, they are nudes. So what? Macie didn\u2019t get her way with me by forcin\u2019 my hand, so she ran away, like I suspect she always does. You\u2019re frustrated that she left you too, so you\u2019re takin\u2019 it out on me. I did nothingwrong but create beautiful art of the beautiful woman I love for the world to see.\u201d</p><p>Gemma helped Cash stand. She swiped the blood from his face and murmured in his ear.</p><p>Cash looked at Carter. \u201cYou\u2019re right, you aren\u2019t anything like your brothers. The McKays I know have honor.\u201d He limped up the porch steps.</p><p>Talk about a sucker punch.</p><p>\u201cCash shouldn\u2019t have taken a swing at you. But you shouldn\u2019t have expected any less from him either.\u201d</p><p>He waited.</p><p>\u201cMacie asked me to keep the truth from him on what you\u2019d done to make her leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she comin\u2019 back?\u201d</p><p>Gemma stared at him. \u201cWhat do you care? You got what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doin\u2019 this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? They\u2019re just pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen put them in your bedroom. Or in your studio. Not on a public wall in an art gallery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re good pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine they are. What you can\u2019t see, Carter, is that this isn\u2019t only about Macie being naked. Maybe we are hicks, and we don\u2019t understand your art, but we do understand that you do not exploit the person you love. Ever. You protect them. You go out of your way to shelter them, not to expose them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not love. You took everything she freely gave you and used it against her to make yourself look good. And then had the balls to make her feel small for questioning your right to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see by the stubborn set to your jaw that you\u2019re digging in your heels and won\u2019t listen to reason. And you think we\u2019re acting childish? Macie is hurting, Cash is hurting, hell, I\u2019m hurting. You\u2019re hurting everyone around you and the only one who thinks what you are doin\u2019 is right, is you.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother to clean up the trailer before you leave. I\u2019m givin\u2019 you two days to clear out.\u201d</p><p>Gemma turned on her heel and hustled in the house.</p><p>Carter stared at the slamming door, staggered by their accusations before he limped to his truck. Had he just lost everything he never thought he\u2019d find? To hell with Macie and her father, and Gemma too. Everyone in the whole fucking world could go straight to hell. No one understood him. No one ever had and it was apparent no one ever would.</p><p>He snagged the bottle of whiskey from the passenger seat and chugged a mouthful of liquid fire. Maybe he\u2019d discover the answers to his questions in the bottom of a bottle.</p><p>Four days later Carter was still half-drunk from his four-day bender.</p><p>He was sprawled on the floor in the barn contemplating studying the back of his eyelids when the door opened and a splinter of light gouged his retinas.</p><p>\u201cJesus, it stinks in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, like your barn don\u2019t stink, Cord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just sayin\u2019...\u201d</p><p>Bootsteps shuffled, kicking up dirt and hay dust.</p><p>\u201cChrist. He\u2019s what stinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink he\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoll him over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t touchin\u2019 him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt, you are such a pussy.\u201d</p><p>Carter grunted. \u201cI ain\u2019t dead.\u201d He managed to roll on his back. He opened his eyes and squinted. The McKay Posse\u2014Colby, Colt and Cord glared down at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you guys doin\u2019 here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThinkin\u2019 about killin\u2019 you now that we know you ain\u2019t worm food,\u201d Colby snapped off.</p><p>No mistaking it. His brothers were livid.</p><p>\u201cMa wouldn\u2019t let you.\u201d In the tense air Carter\u2019s voice sounded rusty as old nails.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t bet on it. She was worried sick. No one could reach you on your cell. Your agent called their house. Then your buddy Jack called. The last straw was when Gemma called mad as hell because you were supposed to have cleared out. Instead, she found you passed out in the barn. Ma was halfway down the driveway with the shotgun before Dad stopped her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Colt hunkered down. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky Keely distracted Dad while we were leavin\u2019 this mornin\u2019 and he ain\u2019t here. Jesus. What\u2019s wrong with your face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot into a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we sort of figured that,\u201d Cord said. \u201cWhy is Gemma throwin\u2019 you off the Bar 9?\u201d</p> <p>Carter slowly sat up. \u201cBecause Cash Big Crow looks about as bad as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took after Cash? I thought you had more brains than that, college boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took the first swing but I probably deserved it. Probably deserved way more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCord, grab his other arm,\u201d Colby said.</p><p>The two of them hauled Carter upright. Pain slammed into his head. Sorrow into his soul. How had he fallen so far so fast? This time last week he\u2019d been on top of the world.</p><p>Now everyone knew he\u2019d crashed and burned.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. You guys can go now. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got more important shit to do than babysit me for Mom.\u201d</p><p>Talk about sounding like a whiny prick. Carter shook off his brothers\u2019 hands and their help.</p><p>\u201cMom ain\u2019t the only reason we\u2019re here,\u201d Cord scoffed.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You might be a total shithead, but you\u2019re still a McKay. And you know we take care of our own, bro, no matter what,\u201d Colby said.</p><p>Carter bit back the urge to bawl. His brothers were pissed off and sporting the gruff attitude they\u2019d inherited from their father, but they were still here. If he\u2019d been wrong about them, what else had he been wrong about?</p><p>Everything.</p><p>Still, if they saw one grateful tear sliding down his bruised cheek, they\u2019d cheerfully punch him in the face and give him something to really cry about.</p><p>He sighed.</p> <p>\u201cJesus. Don\u2019t breathe on me,\u201d Colt complained. \u201cYou reek, Carter. How long\u2019s it been since you showered or changed your clothes?\u201d</p><p>Carter tipped his chin down and looked. Huh. He still had on the same bloodied shirt and dirty jeans he\u2019d worn when Cash handed him his ass. And he\u2019d worn it on for a couple of days before that when Macie walked out on him. \u201cProbably a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, that\u2019s just nasty.\u201d Colt walked to the other side of the barn.</p><p>\u201cYou been sittin\u2019 in here for four days mopin\u2019 over her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy workin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorkin\u2019 on two bottles of Jim Beam it looks like,\u201d Cord said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you judge me, asshole. If you knew the hell I\u2019ve been through\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cord\u2019s cruel laugh cut him off. \u201cYou don\u2019t wanna get into a pissin\u2019 match with me on that one, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop actin\u2019 like one and be a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Cord.

What of this artsy fartsy stuff are we haulin\u2019 back to the ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leavin\u2019 here. This is where I live now.\u201d</p><p>Colt\u2019s bootsteps stopped.</p><p>\u201cThe hell you are,\u201d Colby retorted. \u201cGemma\u2019s throwin\u2019 you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re helpin\u2019 her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need some distance and perspective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I need her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d Colt whistled. \u201cWho is she? Look at those tits. Them babies are definitely real. Man, I could suck on those nipples for hours. How come you\u2019re not doingmore raunchy pictures like\u2014\u201d</p><p>Carter stalked to where Colt stood, grabbed him by the shirtfront and shoved him hard. \u201cDon\u2019t you talk about her like that. Don\u2019t you fuckin\u2019 look at her like that or I will rip your fuckin\u2019 head off.\u201d</p><p>Colt shoved back. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t want no one lookin\u2019 at it, why\u2019d you paint it? You shouldn\u2019t have left it right there for everyone to see. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s the big deal?</p><p>Hadn\u2019t he posed that same question to Macie? And Cash? And Gemma?</p><p>The big deal was he didn\u2019t want anyone else looking at these pictures of Macie.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>The truth slammed into him like a Wyoming coal train.</p><p>Jesus Christ. How had he ever thought he could stand by and let other men ogle naked pictures of the woman he loved?</p><p>Then why had he painted them?</p><p>Because he could. Because he was cocky. Because he wanted everyone to know he\u2014Carter, the quiet, laid-back, invisible McKay\u2014was worthy of that kind of intense love from a woman like Macie.</p><p>It sickened him to think he\u2019d been so focused on showing the world and his family how special his art was, that he\u2019d lost sight of how special Macie was. How special what they had together was.</p><p>Carter\u2019s gaze connected with the picture. This was his Macie. How he saw her. It didn\u2019t matter that she was naked in body; she was naked in spirit too. She didn\u2019t show those sides of herself to everyone. Just to him. And he didn\u2019t want\u2014he had no right\u2014to share it. He didn\u2019t need to immortalize what she was on canvas when he could have the flesh and blood version looking back at him just like that every damn day.</p><p>He stumbled backward over an old milking stool and landed on his butt. He couldn\u2019t speak because he wanted to throw up.</p><p>\u201cCarter? You okay, bud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to get rid of them.\u201d</p><p>His brothers exchanged a look. Cord said, \u201cGet rid of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pictures of Macie.\u201d He pointed to a stack of frames against the far wall. \u201cThere are more like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were gonna be part of my show. The biggest part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fuckin\u2019 kiddin\u2019, right?\u201d</p><p>His bleary-eyed gaze zoomed to Colby. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Colby stared at him in silence for several seconds. \u201cThere are things between a man and woman that should stay private, and I ain\u2019t just talkin\u2019 about sex. Lines you don\u2019t cross. Stuff you don\u2019t share with nobody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get it until now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you figured it out before you put up them pictures. I see they didn\u2019t teach you everything in college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s stupid, but I\u2019m just so crazy in love with her I wanted everyone to know it. To see how lucky I am. To brag that this...perfect woman is mine. That she picked me.</p><p>That she loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you care that the whole world knows that?\u201d Colt said. \u201cJeez, Carter, the only important thing is you know.\u201d</p><p>Colby and Cord both gave Colt an odd look.</p><p>\u201cI-I have to get rid of them. Burn them. But I don\u2019t know if I can. Because it is her, lookin\u2019 at me, and it\u2019d be like I was destroyin\u2019 her or a part of her...\u201d</p><p>Cord\u2019s gaze hooked his. For once no accusation or condescension burned in his eyes.</p><p>Just compassion. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Carter nodded. \u201cThanks. I have to make this right. I don\u2019t even know where to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shower would be good,\u201d Colt suggested</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m thinking you need to eat a helping of crow.\u201d Colby grinned and smacked Carter on the back. Hard. \u201cA big helping of Big Crow.\u201d</p><p>Carter groaned. \u201cNo. Anything but that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at it this way, at least your face ain\u2019t gonna look any worse when he gets through with you this time.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-eight</p><p>Gemma sagged against Cash as they watched Carter McKay\u2019s pickup zip down the gravel road. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened around her but he said nothing for several minutes. Finally, he kissed the top of her head. \u201cI\u2019m glad Macie wasn\u2019t wrong in fallin\u2019 for him. I\u2019d hate to think...\u201d</p><p>She waited for a response that was a long time in coming. \u201cHate to think what?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cThat my daughter would believe all men she allowed in her life would let her down at some point. God knows I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash, you\u2019re working on changing that. Macie knows you\u2019re trying, that\u2019s why she\u2019s sticking around. Even before Carter showed up full of apologies, you and I both knew Macie wasn\u2019t goin\u2019 nowhere. She wants to be in your life. She wants to count on you. We both know that kinda trust ain\u2019t gonna happen overnight. Nothin\u2019 worthwhile ever does.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI hope they can work it out. My girl deserves a chance at happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of chances... I was a little surprised you didn\u2019t bust Carter\u2019s chops and gave him a second chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakes a big man to admit he was wrong. Takes a bigger man to apologize and swear to make it right. Besides, where would any of us be without second chances, eh?\u201d</p><p>Gemma knew the smartest thing she\u2019d done was taking a chance with her heart, and getting a second chance at love. \u201cEvery day you give me a new reason to love you, Cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still think I got the better end of the deal. You see the best in situations and people, not the worst. How you saw beyond a vagabond rodeo Indian cowboy with ties to nothingand no one\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gemma spun in his arms. \u201cI saw a good man with a good heart.

But we ain\u2019t used up yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God. The way I look at it, we have a good forty or fifty years left together.\u201d</p><p>He waggled his eyebrows beneath his Stetson. \u201cSo, purty boss lady, you wanna mess around a little before we start chores?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlways. But there is one thing I want to talk to you about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. I want to stop using condoms. I don\u2019t like the damn things.\u201d</p><p>Cash went utterly still before he leaned down and locked his gaze to hers. \u201cWhat are you sayin\u2019, Gem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I get pregnant, then I get pregnant. If I don\u2019t, it wasn\u2019t meant to be. I know I\u2019m old and the risks are huge, but I kinda feel like this might be a second chance for both of us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou humble me, winyan.\u201d He placed one hand on her belly and one on her heart.</p><p>He closed his eyes and pressed his forehead to hers. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too. Now take me to bed or I\u2019m gonna fire you for slacking on the job.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-nine</p><p>The next evening</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my last night here and I don\u2019t want to be a wallflower at some street dance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMacie, you promised. Come on, it\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun for who? I won\u2019t know anyone.\u201d A dance was the dead last place she\u2019d ever see Carter McKay. Not that she\u2019d be looking for him or anything.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know me.\u201d Amy Jo inserted her contact and blinked. \u201cKeely always ditches me at these things anyway, so it\u2019ll be nice for me not to sit by myself for a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you won\u2019t ditch me the second you catch sight of Cord McKay?</p><p>Especially when he sees you all tramped up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t look twice at me if I rode into town buck-ass nekkid on the back of a purple longhorn bull.\u201d Amy Jo snorted. \u201cThe only reason Cord would talk to me is to ask me if I\u2019d babysit Ky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019d ditch me in a heartbeat to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. As much as I love that little guy, my babysitting days are over. I\u2019m officially a college coed so I\u2019d better start acting like one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBeen watching Girls Gone Wild DVDs for some ideas, Miss Amy Jo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve been watching Keely McKay for years, which is better.\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re supposed to be calling me AJ, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mistake, AJ.\u201d Macie studied Amy Jo\u2014AJ\u2014as she applied eyeliner. AJ was dead wrong if she thought any man could overlook her. With her white-blonde hair, enormous gray eyes, pouty red lips, and long legs, she looked every inch a cool, sleek Scandinavian model\u2014not at all like the Wyoming cowgirl in pigtails and dirty jeans that Macie had met just last month.</p><p>AJ adjusted her black silk bustier. \u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>Macie glanced down at her white eyelet camisole shirt and faded jean skirt. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Oops we\u2019re gonna be late.\u201d Her smile seemed strained. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought I\u2019d drive so if I want to leave\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. You\u2019re riding with me. Or I can call Keely. You choose. But I believe she said something about making an entrance on a Harley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was just plain cold, AJ.\u201d</p><p>She spun the keys on her finger. \u201cThis is gonna be so great.\u201d</p><p>Macie froze. A strange feeling rippled through her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see. Let\u2019s go find us some cowboys to tame, girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Two blocks of Main Street were cordoned off. Macie and AJ wove through pickups and four-wheel drive vehicles lining the side street. Shouts sounded above the bass line of the Western song blasting from the loudspeakers.</p><p>Macie was having a hard time keeping up with AJ\u2019s long-legged strides, mostly because she was dragging her feet. She wanted to go home.</p><p>When she\u2019d left the Bar 9 last week, she had no destination in mind. She\u2019d ended up at Kat\u2019s apartment in Denver. While she\u2019d been wallowing in ice cream, margaritas and Kat\u2019s pierogis, Amy Jo Foster had called her. She and Keely McKay were headed for Denver to finalize a few last minute things and had a couple of questions on the metro-Denver area.</p><p>Neither Keely nor AJ asked why Macie was in Colorado instead of Wyoming.</p><p>Neither asked about Carter. Instead, they\u2019d spent a few days together. She showed them around the city. Tagged along while they picked out furnishings for their apartment.</p><p>When AJ heard about Macie\u2019s new horse, she asked her to hang out and ride horses at the Foster ranch. Macie admitted the week went by faster than she imagined. The days did anyway. The nights were long, and the only time she allowed herself to cry over Carter McKay.</p><p>Right now, she just wanted to hop in her Escape and drive back to Canyon River and try to rebuild her life. She missed her dad. She missed Gemma. She missed Velma and the diner. She missed the ranch. She missed Carter something fierce.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>Don\u2019t think of him. Think of how next week, he\u2019ll be plastering naked pictures of you in Jackson Hole.</p><p>It made her ache. She wasn\u2019t wrong about her ultimatum to Carter, but it\u2019d never hurt so bad to be right.</p><p>AJ stopped abruptly. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go to the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now.\u201d AJ started up the sidewalk to a small white building, with the words Community Center centered above the door. The windows were dark.</p><p>\u201cAJ, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone in there. The door is probably locked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah. Nothing is ever locked around here. Come on.\u201d</p><p>Macie followed her inside. The interior door creaked. The main room was pitch black so she followed the sound of AJ\u2019s high-heeled boots clicking on the tile. Then the lights were flipped on. She blinked.</p><p>And saw him.</p><p>She blinked again.</p><p>Carter McKay was still standing in front of her.</p><p>\u201cMacie. You\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She whirled around and saw AJ slipping out the door. Traitor. Her heart pounded like a bass drum when she faced him again.</p><p>Carter looked bad. Why did that made her feel good?</p><p>Why did her eyes drink him in like nectar anyway?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Macie waited, letting him know that a simple, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d or \u201cI missed you\u201d</p><p>wouldn\u2019t be enough this time.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d Her gaze zoomed across the scabs and bruises covering his face. \u201cLooks like someone put the hurt on you.\u201d</p><p>Carter rubbed his jaw. \u201cWell, your dad has a wicked right cross, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got into a fistfight with my dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. And he still didn\u2019t knock any sense into me.\u201d</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t her father told her that he and Carter exchanged blows? \u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks about the same as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast week. When I came lookin\u2019 for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come looking for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was gonna demand you quit bein\u2019 so stupid and childish and fall in line with my way of thinkin\u2019. Then Cash told me you were gone, and I figured you were gone for good. And I...completely lost it, Macie. I lost my ever-lovin\u2019 mind.</p><p>\u201cI accused him of stuff; he accused me of stuff. It was ugly. In retrospect it was one of the most embarrassin\u2019 moments of my life. Although, at the time I was mad as hell and bleedin\u2019 inside and out, and I thought you were all wrong.\u201d Carter took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cTurns out I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>She waited.</p><p>\u201cBut I was hurt by you, too. Not only by your leavin\u2019, but because I wanted you to like the pictures. There was no ulterior motive when I started paintin\u2019 you. I really did create them from my heart. And I was so damn excited from a professional perspective that I\u2019d captured the pure essence of you. I was so busy pattin\u2019 myself on the back, tellingmyself you\u2019d come around and see the pictures the way I did...that I lost sight of the fact I\u2019d lost you.\u201d</p><p>Macie didn\u2019t move outwardly, yet inwardly a small kernel of hope grew.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather have the real you than just a half dozen static images of you lookin\u2019 at me like you used to. After I sobered up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSobered up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I kinda went on a bender after you left, and your dad and I rolled around in the dirt, and then Gemma kicked me off the Bar 9. My life was pretty much shit. My brothers showed up and showed me the error of my ways. Not with their fists for once, which my body is thankin\u2019 them for profusely. Turns out I was wrong about them too.\u201d</p><p>Carter finally looked her in the eye. \u201cI destroyed the pictures, Macie. Not because you wanted me to. Because the thought of anyone ever seein\u2019 you like that, not only naked, but with your heart and soul wide open tears my heart and soul clean out of my body. The right to share that or show it doesn\u2019t belong to anyone but you. I hope I haven\u2019t destroyed my chances with ever getting to see it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your art show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill happening in three days. Turns out I have more than enough pieces without the pictures of you.\u201d</p><p>They stayed in place, watching one another.</p><p>\u201cMacie. Talk to me. I love you.\u201d</p><p>She studied him. \u201cWhy do you love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you loved me, but why?\u201d</p><p>Carter stared at her, taken aback.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re brave.\u201d When she opened her mouth to protest, he held up his hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bring up your fear of storms, darlin\u2019. I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about you bein\u2019 brave when it comes to livin\u2019 your life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fighter. It\u2019d be easy for you to say, \u2018My father neglected me my entire childhood, so screw him.\u2019 Instead you\u2019re here, fightin\u2019 to have a real relationship with him.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re accepting. You don\u2019t try to change people. You accept your dad for who he is now. And his feelin\u2019s for Gemma never made you seriously question his feelin\u2019s for you. Mostly, the accepting thing gets to me because you get me, the real me and accept me for who I am. You\u2019ve taught me to accept myself. I\u2019ve never thought I was worthy of the kind of love you\u2019ve given me. And I want to spend the rest of my life lovin\u2019 you, givin\u2019 it back, times ten.\u201d</p><p>When she still didn\u2019t say anything he added, \u201cAnd because you make the best goddamn pie I\u2019ve ever tasted.\u201d</p> <p>Macie had never been so scared or so hopeful or so paralyzed by emotion in her life.</p><p>Carter began to walk toward her. \u201cBe brave, Macie. Fight for me. Love me. Accept what I\u2019m offerin\u2019 you. Take a chance on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter\u2014\u201d He seemed upset she hadn\u2019t thrown herself into his arms. She put one hand on his chest, stopping him.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d His eyes searched her face. \u201cOh, my sweet darlin\u2019, why do you have that horrified look?\u201d</p><p>She whispered, \u201cBecause the person you described? That\u2019s not me. I\u2019m not brave.</p> <p>The thought of putting down roots scares me to death. Most of my life I\u2019ve run instead of staying to fight because I\u2019ve never had anything worth fighting for. I accept you, the real you, but will you accept me? The real me? The unsure, fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants person I feel like inside everyday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacie. Didn\u2019t I just tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me, Carter McKay. I don\u2019t have huge ambitions besides living my life happy. I like working in a diner. I don\u2019t aspire be a polished woman hanging off your arm at big, fancy art shows.\u201d</p><p>Those blue, blue eyes flared anger. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, did I ever say I wanted or expected anything from you besides what you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I say, \u2018Macie, go to cookin\u2019 school\u2019 or \u2018Study this book on the influence of cubism on 20th century art\u2019? Hell, what kind of ambitions do you think I have? Last time I checked, darlin\u2019, I lived in a crappy rented trailer in nowhere Wyoming, and my income is close to poverty level.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve acted more immature in the last two weeks than you have in your whole life\u2014</p><p>and why the hell am I tellin\u2019 you this?\u201d He tossed up his hands. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be sellin\u2019 you on spendin\u2019 your life with me, not encouragin\u2019 you to run, though, now, it probably sounds like you should get as far away from me as possible.\u201d</p><p>And then she knew. When Carter didn\u2019t offer her flowery promises, sweet words and romantic bullshit about the perfect life they\u2019d have together as they rode off into the sunset, she knew they\u2019d be okay. They\u2019d make it work. She just had to be brave and fight and take a chance on him. On them.</p><p>Macie stood on tiptoe and got right in his face. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, your lines have improved since the first time I met you, cowboy. But if you ever use them on another woman, I\u2019ll kick your butt worse than my dad or your brothers ever thought of.\u201d</p><p>Then she threw her arms around him and kissed him.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Oh, Macie darlin\u2019, I love you. I love you so damn much.\u201d He peppered her face with kisses. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I hurt you. So sorry. Thank God I didn\u2019t lose you.</p><p>Thank God.\u201d</p><p>Carter didn\u2019t let go of her for the longest time.</p> <p>\u201cNo more nude pictures of me ever, Carter. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d He smiled down at her. \u201cMarry me.\u201d</p><p>Her heart leapt into her throat. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we wait and live together first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want my ring on your finger. I want to start the rest of our life out right. No running away when the going gets tough, for either of us. We stick together for better for worse, forever.\u201d His eyes turned serious. \u201cBesides, I already asked your dad if I could marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say we\u2019re too young to settle down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said age was just a number and there are no age restrictions on when you might find true love. But most importantly, he said yes.\u201d</p><p>How had she gotten so lucky to have not one, but two good men in her life?</p><p>\u201cWanna go meet the rest of the McKay family before we head home to the Bar 9?\u201d</p><p>Home. That sounded nice. \u201cThey\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. They fell all over themselves to be here when I told them I was takin\u2019 my girl dancin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t dance.\u201d</p><p>Carter twirled her in a clumsy circle and tromped on her toe. Then he stopped and cradled her face in his hands. \u201cMacie, with you in my life, I can probably fly.\u201d</p><p>Tears spilled down her cheeks. \u201cYou are such a dumbass, Carter McKay. But you\u2019re my dumbass and I love you.\u201d</p><p>And they raced outside to dance together under the Wyoming stars, young, hopeful and wildly in love. </p> </body></html>"]
