But, in fact, depression is not a side effect of cancer. Depression is a side effect of dying. (Cancer is also a side effect of dying. Almost everything is, really.) But my mom believed I required treatment, so she took me to see my Regular Doctor Jim, who agreed that I was veritably swimming in a paralyzing and totally clinical depression, and that therefore my meds should be adjusted and also I should attend a weekly Support Group.</p><p>This Support Group featured a rotating cast of characters in various states of tumor-driven unwellness. Why did the cast rotate? A side effect of dying.</p> <p>The Support Group, of course, was depressing as hell. It met every Wednesday in the basement of a stone-walled Episcopal church shaped like a cross. We all sat in a circle right in the middle of the cross, where the two boards would have met, where the heart of Jesus would have been.</p><p>I noticed this because Patrick, the Support Group Leader and only person over eighteen in the room, talked about the heart of Jesus every freaking meeting, all about how we, as young cancer survivors, were sitting right in Christ\u2019s very sacred heart and whatever.</p><p>So here\u2019s how it went in God\u2019s heart: The six or seven or ten of us walked/wheeled in, grazed at a decrepit selection of cookies and lemonade, sat down in the Circle of Trust, and listened to Patrick recount for the thousandth time his depressingly miserable life story\u2014how he had cancer in his balls and they thought he was going to die but he didn\u2019t die and now here he is, a full-grown adult in a church basement in the 137th nicest city in America, divorced, addicted to video games, mostly friendless, eking out a meager living by exploiting his cancertastic past, slowly working his way toward a master\u2019s degree that will not improve his career prospects, waiting, as we all do, for the sword of Damocles to give him the relief that he escaped lo those many years ago when cancer took both of his nuts but spared what only the most generous soul would call his life.</p><p>AND YOU TOO MIGHT BE SO LUCKY!</p><p>Then we introduced ourselves: Name. Age. Diagnosis. And how we\u2019re doing today. I\u2019m Hazel, I\u2019d say when they\u2019d get to me. Sixteen. Thyroid originally but with an impressive and long-settled satellite colony in my lungs. And I\u2019m doing okay.</p> <p>Once we got around the circle, Patrick always asked if anyone wanted to share. And then began the circle jerk of support: everyone talking about fighting and battling and winning and shrinking and scanning. To be fair to Patrick, he let us talk about dying, too. But most of them weren\u2019t dying. Most would live into adulthood, as Patrick had.</p><p>(Which meant there was quite a lot of competitiveness about it, with everybody wanting to beat not only cancer itself, but also the other people in the room. Like, I realize that this is irrational, but when they tell you that you have, say, a 20 percent chance of living five years, the math kicks in and you figure that\u2019s one in five . . . so you look around and think, as any healthy person would: I gotta outlast four of these bastards.)</p><p>The only redeeming facet of Support Group was this kid named Isaac, a long-faced, skinny guy with straight blond hair swept over one eye.</p><p>And his eyes were the problem. He had some fantastically improbable eye cancer. One eye had been cut out when he was a kid, and now he wore the kind of thick glasses that made his eyes (both the real one and the glass one) preternaturally huge, like his whole head was basically just this fake eye and this real eye staring at you. From what I could gather on the rare occasions when Isaac shared with the group, a recurrence had placed his remaining eye in mortal peril.</p><p>Isaac and I communicated almost exclusively through sighs. Each time someone discussed anticancer diets or snorting ground-up shark fin or whatever, he\u2019d glance over at me and sigh ever so slightly. I\u2019d shake my head microscopically and exhale in response.</p><p>So Support Group blew, and after a few weeks, I grew to be rather kicking-and-screaming about the whole affair. In fact, on the Wednesday I made the acquaintance of Augustus Waters, I tried my level best to get out of Support Group while sitting on the couch with my mom in the third leg of a twelve-hour marathon of the previous season\u2019s America\u2019s Next Top Model, which admittedly I had already seen, but still.</p> <p>Me: \u201cI refuse to attend Support Group.\u201d</p><p>Mom: \u201cOne of the symptoms of depression is disinterest in activities.\u201d</p><p>Me: \u201cPlease just let me watch America\u2019s Next Top Model. It\u2019s an activity.\u201d</p><p>Mom: \u201cTelevision is a passivity.\u201d</p><p>Me: \u201cUgh, Mom, please.\u201d</p><p>Mom: \u201cHazel, you\u2019re a teenager. You\u2019re not a little kid anymore. You need to make friends, get out of the house, and live your life.\u201d</p><p>Me: \u201cIf you want me to be a teenager, don\u2019t send me to Support Group. Buy me a fake ID so I can go to clubs, drink vodka, and take pot.\u201d</p><p>Mom: \u201cYou don\u2019t take pot, for starters.\u201d</p> <p>Me: \u201cSee, that\u2019s the kind of thing I\u2019d know if you got me a fake ID.\u201d</p><p>Mom: \u201cYou\u2019re going to Support Group.\u201d</p><p>Me: \u201cUGGGGGGGGGGGGG.\u201d</p><p>Mom: \u201cHazel, you deserve a life.\u201d</p><p>That shut me up, although I failed to see how attendance at Support Group met the definition of life. Still, I agreed to go\u2014after negotiating the right to record the 1.5 episodes of ANTM I\u2019d be missing.</p><p>I went to Support Group for the same reason that I\u2019d once allowed nurses with a mere eighteen months of graduate education to poison me with exotically named chemicals: I wanted to make my parents happy. There is only one thing in this world shittier than biting it from cancer when you\u2019re sixteen, and that\u2019s having a kid who bites it from cancer.</p><p>Mom pulled into the circular driveway behind the church at 4:56. I pretended to fiddle with my oxygen tank for a second just to kill time.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to carry it in for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d I said. The cylindrical green tank only weighed a few pounds, and I had this little steel cart to wheel it around behind me. It delivered two liters of oxygen to me each minute through a cannula, a transparent tube that split just beneath my neck, wrapped behind my ears, and then reunited in my nostrils. The contraption was necessary because my lungs sucked at being lungs.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said as I got out.</p><p>\u201cYou too, Mom. See you at six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake friends!\u201d she said through the rolled-down window as I walked away.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to take the elevator because taking the elevator is a Last Days kind of activity at Support Group, so I took the stairs. I grabbed a cookie and poured some lemonade into a Dixie cup and then turned around.</p><p>A boy was staring at me.</p><p>I was quite sure I\u2019d never seen him before. Long and leanly muscular, he dwarfed the molded plastic elementary school chair he was sitting in. Mahogany hair, straight and short. He looked my age, maybe a year older, and he sat with his tailbone against the edge of the chair, his posture aggressively poor, one hand half in a pocket of dark jeans.</p><p>I looked away, suddenly conscious of my myriad insufficiencies. I was wearing old jeans, which had once been tight but now sagged in weird places, and a yellow T-shirt advertising a band I didn\u2019t even like anymore. Also my hair: I had this pageboy haircut, and I hadn\u2019t even bothered to, like, brush it. Furthermore, I had ridiculously fat chipmunked cheeks, a side effect of treatment. I looked like a normally proportioned person with a balloon for a head. This was not even to mention the cankle situation. And yet\u2014I cut a glance to him, and his eyes were still on me.</p><p>It occurred to me why they call it eye contact.</p><p>I walked into the circle and sat down next to Isaac, two seats away from the boy. I glanced again. He was still watching me.</p><p>Look, let me just say it: He was hot. A nonhot boy stares at you relentlessly and it is, at best, awkward and, at worst, a form of assault. But a hot boy . . . well.</p><p>I pulled out my phone and clicked it so it would display the time: 4:59. The circle filled in with the unlucky twelve-to-eighteens, and then Patrick started us out with the serenity prayer: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. The guy was still staring at me. I felt rather blushy.</p><p>Finally, I decided that the proper strategy was to stare back. Boys do not have a monopoly on the Staring Business, after all. So I looked him over as Patrick acknowledged for the thousandth time his ball-lessness etc., and soon it was a staring contest. After a while the boy smiled, and then finally his blue eyes glanced away. When he looked back at me, I flicked my eyebrows up to say, I win.</p><p>He shrugged. Patrick continued and then finally it was time for the introductions. \u201cIsaac, perhaps you\u2019d like to go first today. I know you\u2019re facing a challenging time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Isaac said. \u201cI\u2019m Isaac. I\u2019m seventeen. And it\u2019s looking like I have to get surgery in a couple weeks, after which I\u2019ll be blind. Not to complain or anything because I know a lot of us have it worse, but yeah, I mean, being blind does sort of suck. My girlfriend helps, though. And friends like Augustus.\u201d He nodded toward the boy, who now had a name. \u201cSo, yeah,\u201d Isaac continued. He was looking at his hands, which he\u2019d folded into each other like the top of a tepee. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here for you, Isaac,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cLet Isaac hear it, guys.\u201d And then we all, in a monotone, said, \u201cWe\u2019re here for you, Isaac.\u201d</p><p>Michael was next. He was twelve. He had leukemia. He\u2019d always had leukemia. He was okay. (Or so he said. He\u2019d taken the elevator.)</p><p>Lida was sixteen, and pretty enough to be the object of the hot boy\u2019s eye. She was a regular\u2014in a long remission from appendiceal cancer, which I had not previously known existed. She said\u2014as she had every other time I\u2019d attended Support Group\u2014that she felt strong, which felt like bragging to me as the oxygen-drizzling nubs tickled my nostrils.</p><p>There were five others before they got to him. He smiled a little when his turn came. His voice was low, smoky, and dead sexy. \u201cMy name is Augustus Waters,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m seventeen. I had a little touch of osteosarcoma a year and a half ago, but I\u2019m just here today at Isaac\u2019s request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how are you feeling?\u201d asked Patrick.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m grand.\u201d Augustus Waters smiled with a corner of his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m on a roller coaster that only goes up, my friend.\u201d</p><p>When it was my turn, I said, \u201cMy name is Hazel. I\u2019m sixteen. Thyroid with mets in my lungs. I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>The hour proceeded apace: Fights were recounted, battles won amid wars sure to be lost; hope was clung to; families were both celebrated and denounced; it was agreed that friends just didn\u2019t get it; tears were shed; comfort proffered. Neither Augustus Waters nor I spoke again until Patrick said, \u201cAugustus, perhaps you\u2019d like to share your fears with the group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy fears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fear oblivion,\u201d he said without a moment\u2019s pause. \u201cI fear it like the proverbial blind man who\u2019s afraid of the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo soon,\u201d Isaac said, cracking a smile.</p><p>\u201cWas that insensitive?\u201d Augustus asked. \u201cI can be pretty blind to other people\u2019s feelings.\u201d</p><p>Isaac was laughing, but Patrick raised a chastening finger and said, \u201cAugustus, please. Let\u2019s return to you and your struggles. You said you fear oblivion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Augustus answered.</p><p>Patrick seemed lost. \u201cWould, uh, would anyone like to speak to that?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been in proper school in three years. My parents were my two best friends. My third best friend was an author who did not know I existed. I was a fairly shy person\u2014not the hand-raising type.</p><p>And yet, just this once, I decided to speak. I half raised my hand and Patrick, his delight evident, immediately said, \u201cHazel!\u201d I was, I\u2019m sure he assumed, opening up. Becoming Part Of The Group.</p><p>I looked over at Augustus Waters, who looked back at me. You could almost see through his eyes they were so blue. \u201cThere will come a time,\u201d I said, \u201cwhen all of us are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this\u201d\u2014I gestured encompassingly\u2014\u201cwill have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever. There was time before organisms experienced consciousness, and there will be time after. And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows that\u2019s what everyone else does.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d learned this from my aforementioned third best friend, Peter Van Houten, the reclusive author of An Imperial Affliction, the book that was as close a thing as I had to a Bible. Peter Van Houten was the only person I\u2019d ever come across who seemed to (a) understand what it\u2019s like to be dying, and (b) not have died.</p><p>After I finished, there was quite a long period of silence as I watched a smile spread all the way across Augustus\u2019s face\u2014not the little crooked smile of the boy trying to be sexy while he stared at me, but his real smile, too big for his face. \u201cGoddamn,\u201d Augustus said quietly. \u201cAren\u2019t you something else.\u201d</p><p>Neither of us said anything for the rest of Support Group. At the end, we all had to hold hands, and Patrick led us in a prayer. \u201cLord Jesus Christ, we are gathered here in Your heart, literally in Your heart, as cancer survivors. You and You alone know us as we know ourselves. Guide us to life and the Light through our times of trial. We pray for Isaac\u2019s eyes, for Michael\u2019s and Jamie\u2019s blood, for Augustus\u2019s bones, for Hazel\u2019s lungs, for James\u2019s throat. We pray that You might heal us and that we might feel Your love, and Your peace, which passes all understanding. And we remember in our hearts those whom we knew and loved who have gone home to you: Maria and Kade and Joseph and Haley and Abigail and Angelina and Taylor and Gabriel and . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a long list. The world contains a lot of dead people. And while Patrick droned on, reading the list from a sheet of paper because it was too long to memorize, I kept my eyes closed, trying to think prayerfully but mostly imagining the day when my name would find its way onto that list, all the way at the end when everyone had stopped listening.</p><p>When Patrick was finished, we said this stupid mantra together\u2014LIVING OUR BEST LIFE TODAY\u2014and it was over. Augustus Waters pushed himself out of his chair and walked over to me. His gait was crooked like his smile. He towered over me, but he kept his distance so I wouldn\u2019t have to crane my neck to look him in the eye. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHazel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, your full name.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm, Hazel Grace Lancaster.\u201d He was just about to say something else when Isaac walked up. \u201cHold on,\u201d Augustus said, raising a finger, and turned to Isaac. \u201cThat was actually worse than you made it out to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you it was bleak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you bother with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It kind of helps?\u201d</p><p>Augustus leaned in so he thought I couldn\u2019t hear. \u201cShe\u2019s a regular?\u201d I couldn\u2019t hear Isaac\u2019s comment, but Augustus responded, \u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d He clasped Isaac by both shoulders and then took a half step away from him. \u201cTell Hazel about clinic.\u201d</p> <p>Isaac leaned a hand against the snack table and focused his huge eye on me. \u201cOkay, so I went into clinic this morning, and I was telling my surgeon that I\u2019d rather be deaf than blind. And he said, \u2018It doesn\u2019t work that way,\u2019 and I was, like, \u2018Yeah, I realize it doesn\u2019t work that way; I\u2019m just saying I\u2019d rather be deaf than blind if I had the choice, which I realize I don\u2019t have,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Well, the good news is that you won\u2019t be deaf,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Thank you for explaining that my eye cancer isn\u2019t going to make me deaf. I feel so fortunate that an intellectual giant like yourself would deign to operate on me.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sounds like a winner,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna try to get me some eye cancer just so I can make this guy\u2019s acquaintance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that. All right, I should go. Monica\u2019s waiting for me. I gotta look at her a lot while I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCounterinsurgence tomorrow?\u201d Augustus asked.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d Isaac turned and ran up the stairs, taking them two at a time.</p><p>Augustus Waters turned to me. \u201cLiterally,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cLiterally?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWe are literally in the heart of Jesus,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought we were in a church basement, but we are literally in the heart of Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone should tell Jesus,\u201d I said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s gotta be dangerous, storing children with cancer in your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would tell Him myself,\u201d Augustus said, \u201cbut unfortunately I am literally stuck inside of His heart, so He won\u2019t be able to hear me.\u201d I laughed. He shook his head, just looking at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>Augustus half smiled. \u201cBecause you\u2019re beautiful. I enjoy looking at beautiful people, and I decided a while ago not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence.\u201d A brief awkward silence ensued. Augustus plowed through: \u201cI mean, particularly given that, as you so deliciously pointed out, all of this will end in oblivion and everything.\u201d</p> <p>I kind of scoffed or sighed or exhaled in a way that was vaguely coughy and then said, \u201cI\u2019m not beau\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like a millennial Natalie Portman. Like V for Vendetta Natalie Portman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever seen it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked. \u201cPixie-haired gorgeous girl dislikes authority and can\u2019t help but fall for a boy she knows is trouble. It\u2019s your autobiography, so far as I can tell.\u201d</p><p>His every syllable flirted. Honestly, he kind of turned me on. I didn\u2019t even know that guys could turn me on\u2014not, like, in real life.</p><p>A younger girl walked past us. \u201cHow\u2019s it going, Alisa?\u201d he asked. She smiled and mumbled, \u201cHi, Augustus.\u201d \u201cMemorial people,\u201d he explained. Memorial was the big research hospital. \u201cWhere do you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren\u2019s,\u201d I said, my voice smaller than I expected it to be. He nodded. The conversation seemed over. \u201cWell,\u201d I said, nodding vaguely toward the steps that led us out of the Literal Heart of Jesus. I tilted my cart onto its wheels and started walking. He limped beside me. \u201cSo, see you next time, maybe?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou should see it,\u201d he said. \u201cV for Vendetta, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll look it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. With me. At my house,\u201d he said. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>I stopped walking. \u201cI hardly know you, Augustus Waters. You could be an ax murderer.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cTrue enough, Hazel Grace.\u201d He walked past me, his shoulders filling out his green knit polo shirt, his back straight, his steps lilting just slightly to the right as he walked steady and confident on what I had determined was a prosthetic leg. Osteosarcoma sometimes takes a limb to check you out. Then, if it likes you, it takes the rest.</p><p>I followed him upstairs, losing ground as I made my way up slowly, stairs not being a field of expertise for my lungs.</p><p>And then we were out of Jesus\u2019s heart and in the parking lot, the spring air just on the cold side of perfect, the late-afternoon light heavenly in its hurtfulness.</p><p>Mom wasn\u2019t there yet, which was unusual, because Mom was almost always waiting for me. I glanced around and saw that a tall, curvy brunette girl had Isaac pinned against the stone wall of the church, kissing him rather aggressively. They were close enough to me that I could hear the weird noises of their mouths together, and I could hear him saying, \u201cAlways,\u201d and her saying, \u201cAlways,\u201d in return.</p><p>Suddenly standing next to me, Augustus half whispered, \u201cThey\u2019re big believers in PDA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the \u2018always\u2019?\u201d The slurping sounds intensified.</p><p>\u201cAlways is their thing. They\u2019ll always love each other and whatever. I would conservatively estimate they have texted each other the word always four million times in the last year.\u201d</p><p>A couple more cars drove up, taking Michael and Alisa away. It was just Augustus and me now, watching Isaac and Monica, who proceeded apace as if they were not leaning against a place of worship. His hand reached for her boob over her shirt and pawed at it, his palm still while his fingers moved around. I wondered if that felt good. Didn\u2019t seem like it would, but I decided to forgive Isaac on the grounds that he was going blind. The senses must feast while there is yet hunger and whatever.</p><p>\u201cImagine taking that last drive to the hospital,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cThe last time you\u2019ll ever drive a car.\u201d</p><p>Without looking over at me, Augustus said, \u201cYou\u2019re killing my vibe here, Hazel Grace. I\u2019m trying to observe young love in its many-splendored awkwardness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s hurting her boob,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s difficult to ascertain whether he is trying to arouse her or perform a breast exam.\u201d Then Augustus Waters reached into a pocket and pulled out, of all things, a pack of cigarettes. He flipped it open and put a cigarette between his lips.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou think that\u2019s cool? Oh, my God, you just ruined the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich whole thing?\u201d he asked, turning to me. The cigarette dangled unlit from the unsmiling corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThe whole thing where a boy who is not unattractive or unintelligent or seemingly in any way unacceptable stares at me and points out incorrect uses of literality and compares me to actresses and asks me to watch a movie at his house. But of course there is always a hamartia and yours is that oh, my God, even though you HAD FREAKING CANCER you give money to a company in exchange for the chance to acquire YET MORE CANCER. Oh, my God. Let me just assure you that not being able to breathe? SUCKS. Totally disappointing. Totally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hamartia?\u201d he asked, the cigarette still in his mouth. It tightened his jaw. He had a hell of a jawline, unfortunately.</p><p>\u201cA fatal flaw,\u201d I explained, turning away from him. I stepped toward the curb, leaving Augustus Waters behind me, and then I heard a car start down the street. It was Mom. She\u2019d been waiting for me to, like, make friends or whatever.</p><p>I felt this weird mix of disappointment and anger welling up inside of me. I don\u2019t even know what the feeling was, really, just that there was a lot of it, and I wanted to smack Augustus Waters and also replace my lungs with lungs that didn\u2019t suck at being lungs. I was standing with my Chuck Taylors on the very edge of the curb, the oxygen tank ball-and-chaining in the cart by my side, and right as my mom pulled up, I felt a hand grab mine.</p><p>I yanked my hand free but turned back to him.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t kill you unless you light them,\u201d he said as Mom arrived at the curb. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never lit one. It\u2019s a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don\u2019t give it the power to do its killing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor,\u201d I said, dubious. Mom was just idling.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou choose your behaviors based on their metaphorical resonances . . .\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d He smiled. The big, goofy, real smile. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in metaphor, Hazel Grace.\u201d</p><p>I turned to the car. Tapped the window. It rolled down. \u201cI\u2019m going to a movie with Augustus Waters,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease record the next several episodes of the ANTM marathon for me.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>Augustus Waters drove horrifically. Whether stopping or starting, everything happened with a tremendous JOLT. I flew against the seat belt of his Toyota SUV each time he braked, and my neck snapped backward each time he hit the gas. I might have been nervous\u2014what with sitting in the car of a strange boy on the way to his house, keenly aware that my crap lungs complicate efforts to fend off unwanted advances\u2014but his driving was so astonishingly poor that I could think of nothing else.</p><p>We\u2019d gone perhaps a mile in jagged silence before Augustus said, \u201cI failed the driving test three times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, nodding. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t feel pressure in old Prosty, and I can\u2019t get the hang of driving left-footed. My doctors say most amputees can drive with no problem, but . . . yeah. Not me. Anyway, I go in for my fourth driving test, and it goes about like this is going.\u201d A half mile in front of us, a light turned red. Augustus slammed on the brakes, tossing me into the triangular embrace of the seat belt. \u201cSorry. I swear to God I am trying to be gentle. Right, so anyway, at the end of the test, I totally thought I\u2019d failed again, but the instructor was like, \u2018Your driving is unpleasant, but it isn\u2019t technically unsafe.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I agree,\u201d I said. \u201cI suspect Cancer Perk.\u201d Cancer Perks are the little things cancer kids get that regular kids don\u2019t: basketballs signed by sports heroes, free passes on late homework, unearned driver\u2019s licenses, etc.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. The light turned green. I braced myself. Augustus slammed the gas.</p><p>\u201cYou know they\u2019ve got hand controls for people who can\u2019t use their legs,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe someday.\u201d He sighed in a way that made me wonder whether he was confident about the existence of someday. I knew osteosarcoma was highly curable, but still.</p><p>There are a number of ways to establish someone\u2019s approximate survival expectations without actually asking. I used the classic: \u201cSo, are you in school?\u201d Generally, your parents pull you out of school at some point if they expect you to bite it.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m at North Central. A year behind, though: I\u2019m a sophomore. You?\u201d</p><p>I considered lying. No one likes a corpse, after all. But in the end I told the truth. \u201cNo, my parents withdrew me three years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years?\u201d he asked, astonished.</p><p>I told Augustus the broad outline of my miracle: diagnosed with Stage IV thyroid cancer when I was thirteen. (I didn\u2019t tell him that the diagnosis came three months after I got my first period. Like: Congratulations! You\u2019re a woman. Now die.) It was, we were told, incurable.</p><p>I had a surgery called radical neck dissection, which is about as pleasant as it sounds. Then radiation. Then they tried some chemo for my lung tumors. The tumors shrank, then grew. By then, I was fourteen. My lungs started to fill up with water. I was looking pretty dead\u2014my hands and feet ballooned; my skin cracked; my lips were perpetually blue. They\u2019ve got this drug that makes you not feel so completely terrified about the fact that you can\u2019t breathe, and I had a lot of it flowing into me through a PICC line, and more than a dozen other drugs besides. But even so, there\u2019s a certain unpleasantness to drowning, particularly when it occurs over the course of several months. I finally ended up in the ICU with pneumonia, and my mom knelt by the side of my bed and said, \u201cAre you ready, sweetie?\u201d and I told her I was ready, and my dad just kept telling me he loved me in this voice that was not breaking so much as already broken, and I kept telling him that I loved him, too, and everyone was holding hands, and I couldn\u2019t catch my breath, and my lungs were acting desperate, gasping, pulling me out of the bed trying to find a position that could get them air, and I was embarrassed by their desperation, disgusted that they wouldn\u2019t just let go, and I remember my mom telling me it was okay, that I was okay, that I would be okay, and my father was trying so hard not to sob that when he did, which was regularly, it was an earthquake. And I remember wanting not to be awake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Everyone figured I was finished, but my Cancer Doctor Maria managed to get some of the fluid out of my lungs, and shortly thereafter the antibiotics they\u2019d given me for the pneumonia kicked in.</p><p>I woke up and soon got into one of those experimental trials that are famous in the Republic of Cancervania for Not Working. The drug was Phalanxifor, this molecule designed to attach itself to cancer cells and slow their growth. It didn\u2019t work in about 70 percent of people. But it worked in me. The tumors shrank.</p><p>And they stayed shrunk. Huzzah, Phalanxifor! In the past eighteen months, my mets have hardly grown, leaving me with lungs that suck at being lungs but could, conceivably, struggle along indefinitely with the assistance of drizzled oxygen and daily Phalanxifor.</p><p>Admittedly, my Cancer Miracle had only resulted in a bit of purchased time. (I did not yet know the size of the bit.) But when telling Augustus Waters, I painted the rosiest possible picture, embellishing the miraculousness of the miracle.</p> <p>\u201cSo now you gotta go back to school,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI actually can\u2019t,\u201d I explained, \u201cbecause I already got my GED. So I\u2019m taking classes at MCC,\u201d which was our community college.</p><p>\u201cA college girl,\u201d he said, nodding. \u201cThat explains the aura of sophistication.\u201d He smirked at me. I shoved his upper arm playfully. I could feel the muscle right beneath the skin, all tense and amazing.</p><p>We made a wheels-screeching turn into a subdivision with eight-foot-high stucco walls. His house was the first one on the left. A two-story colonial. We jerked to a halt in his driveway.</p><p>I followed him inside. A wooden plaque in the entryway was engraved in cursive with the words Home Is Where the Heart Is, and the entire house turned out to be festooned in such observations. Good Friends Are Hard to Find and Impossible to Forget read an illustration above the coatrack. True Love Is Born from Hard Times promised a needlepointed pillow in their antique-furnished living room. Augustus saw me reading. \u201cMy parents call them Encouragements,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey\u2019re everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>His mom and dad called him Gus. They were making enchiladas in the kitchen (a piece of stained glass by the sink read in bubbly letters Family Is Forever). His mom was putting chicken into tortillas, which his dad then rolled up and placed in a glass pan. They didn\u2019t seem too surprised by my arrival, which made sense: The fact that Augustus made me feel special did not necessarily indicate that I was special. Maybe he brought home a different girl every night to show her movies and feel her up.</p><p>\u201cThis is Hazel Grace,\u201d he said, by way of introduction.</p><p>\u201cJust Hazel,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going, Hazel?\u201d asked Gus\u2019s dad. He was tall\u2014almost as tall as Gus\u2014and skinny in a way that parentally aged people usually aren\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHow was Isaac\u2019s Support Group?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was incredible,\u201d Gus said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a Debbie Downer,\u201d his mom said. \u201cHazel, do you enjoy it?\u201d</p><p>I paused a second, trying to figure out if my response should be calibrated to please Augustus or his parents. \u201cMost of the people are really nice,\u201d I finally said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we found with families at Memorial when we were in the thick of it with Gus\u2019s treatment,\u201d his dad said. \u201cEverybody was so kind. Strong, too. In the darkest days, the Lord puts the best people into your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuick, give me a throw pillow and some thread because that needs to be an Encouragement,\u201d Augustus said, and his dad looked a little annoyed, but then Gus wrapped his long arm around his dad\u2019s neck and said, \u201cI\u2019m just kidding, Dad. I like the freaking Encouragements. I really do. I just can\u2019t admit it because I\u2019m a teenager.\u201d His dad rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joining us for dinner, I hope?\u201d asked his mom. She was small and brunette and vaguely mousy.</p><p>\u201cI guess?\u201d I said. \u201cI have to be home by ten. Also I don\u2019t, um, eat meat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. We\u2019ll vegetarianize some,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cAnimals are just too cute?\u201d Gus asked.</p><p>\u201cI want to minimize the number of deaths I am responsible for,\u201d I said.</p><p>Gus opened his mouth to respond but then stopped himself.</p><p>His mom filled the silence. \u201cWell, I think that\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>They talked to me for a bit about how the enchiladas were Famous Waters Enchiladas and Not to Be Missed and about how Gus\u2019s curfew was also ten, and how they were inherently distrustful of anyone who gave their kids curfews other than ten, and was I in school\u2014\u201cshe\u2019s a college student,\u201d Augustus interjected\u2014and how the weather was truly and absolutely extraordinary for March, and how in spring all things are new, and they didn\u2019t even once ask me about the oxygen or my diagnosis, which was weird and wonderful, and then Augustus said, \u201cHazel and I are going to watch V for Vendetta so she can see her filmic doppelg\u00e4nger, mid-two thousands Natalie Portman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe living room TV is yours for the watching,\u201d his dad said happily.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re actually gonna watch it in the basement.\u201d</p><p>His dad laughed. \u201cGood try. Living room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to show Hazel Grace the basement,\u201d Augustus said.</p><p>\u201cJust Hazel,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSo show Just Hazel the basement,\u201d said his dad. \u201cAnd then come upstairs and watch your movie in the living room.\u201d</p><p>Augustus puffed out his cheeks, balanced on his leg, and twisted his hips, throwing the prosthetic forward. \u201cFine,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>I followed him down carpeted stairs to a huge basement bedroom. A shelf at my eye level reached all the way around the room, and it was stuffed solid with basketball memorabilia: dozens of trophies with gold plastic men mid\u2013jump shot or dribbling or reaching for a layup toward an unseen basket. There were also lots of signed balls and sneakers.</p><p>\u201cI used to play basketball,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve been pretty good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t bad, but all the shoes and balls are Cancer Perks.\u201d He walked toward the TV, where a huge pile of DVDs and video games were arranged into a vague pyramid shape. He bent at the waist and snatched up V for Vendetta. \u201cI was, like, the prototypical white Hoosier kid,\u201d he said. \u201cI was all about resurrecting the lost art of the midrange jumper, but then one day I was shooting free throws\u2014just standing at the foul line at the North Central gym shooting from a rack of balls. All at once, I couldn\u2019t figure out why I was methodically tossing a spherical object through a toroidal object. It seemed like the stupidest thing I could possibly be doing.</p><p>\u201cI started thinking about little kids putting a cylindrical peg through a circular hole, and how they do it over and over again for months when they figure it out, and how basketball was basically just a slightly more aerobic version of that same exercise. Anyway, for the longest time, I just kept sinking free throws. I hit eighty in a row, my all-time best, but as I kept going, I felt more and more like a two-year-old. And then for some reason I started to think about hurdlers. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d taken a seat on the corner of his unmade bed. I wasn\u2019t trying to be suggestive or anything; I just got kind of tired when I had to stand a lot. I\u2019d stood in the living room and then there had been the stairs, and then more standing, which was quite a lot of standing for me, and I didn\u2019t want to faint or anything. I was a bit of a Victorian Lady, fainting-wise. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said. \u201cJust listening. Hurdlers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, hurdlers. I don\u2019t know why. I started thinking about them running their hurdle races, and jumping over these totally arbitrary objects that had been set in their path. And I wondered if hurdlers ever thought, you know, This would go faster if we just got rid of the hurdles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was before your diagnosis?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cRight, well, there was that, too.\u201d He smiled with half his mouth. \u201cThe day of the existentially fraught free throws was coincidentally also my last day of dual leggedness. I had a weekend between when they scheduled the amputation and when it happened. My own little glimpse of what Isaac is going through.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I liked Augustus Waters. I really, really, really liked him. I liked the way his story ended with someone else. I liked his voice. I liked that he took existentially fraught free throws. I liked that he was a tenured professor in the Department of Slightly Crooked Smiles with a dual appointment in the Department of Having a Voice That Made My Skin Feel More Like Skin. And I liked that he had two names. I\u2019ve always liked people with two names, because you get to make up your mind what you call them: Gus or Augustus? Me, I was always just Hazel, univalent Hazel.</p><p>\u201cDo you have siblings?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d he answered, seeming a little distracted.</p><p>\u201cYou said that thing about watching kids play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, no. I have nephews, from my half sisters. But they\u2019re older. They\u2019re like\u2014DAD, HOW OLD ARE JULIE AND MARTHA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-eight!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re like twenty-eight. They live in Chicago. They are both married to very fancy lawyer dudes. Or banker dudes. I can\u2019t remember. You have siblings?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head no. \u201cSo what\u2019s your story?\u201d he asked, sitting down next to me at a safe distance.</p><p>\u201cI already told you my story. I was diagnosed when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not your cancer story. Your story. Interests, hobbies, passions, weird fetishes, etcetera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re one of those people who becomes their disease. I know so many people like that. It\u2019s disheartening. Like, cancer is in the growth business, right? The taking-people-over business. But surely you haven\u2019t let it succeed prematurely.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to me that perhaps I had. I struggled with how to pitch myself to Augustus Waters, which enthusiasms to embrace, and in the silence that followed it occurred to me that I wasn\u2019t very interesting. \u201cI am pretty unextraordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI reject that out of hand. Think of something you like. The first thing that comes to mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. Reading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything. From, like, hideous romance to pretentious fiction to poetry. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you write poetry, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t write.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d Augustus almost shouted. \u201cHazel Grace, you are the only teenager in America who prefers reading poetry to writing it. This tells me so much. You read a lot of capital-G great books, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I said.</p><p>My favorite book, by a wide margin, was An Imperial Affliction, but I didn\u2019t like to tell people about it. Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book. And then there are books like An Imperial Affliction, which you can\u2019t tell people about, books so special and rare and yours that advertising your affection feels like a betrayal.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t even that the book was so good or anything; it was just that the author, Peter Van Houten, seemed to understand me in weird and impossible ways. An Imperial Affliction was my book, in the way my body was my body and my thoughts were my thoughts.</p><p>Even so, I told Augustus. \u201cMy favorite book is probably An Imperial Affliction,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDoes it feature zombies?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cStormtroopers?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s not that kind of book.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI am going to read this terrible book with the boring title that does not contain stormtroopers,\u201d he promised, and I immediately felt like I shouldn\u2019t have told him about it. Augustus spun around to a stack of books beneath his bedside table. He grabbed a paperback and a pen. As he scribbled an inscription onto the title page, he said, \u201cAll I ask in exchange is that you read this brilliant and haunting novelization of my favorite video game.\u201d He held up the book, which was called The Price of Dawn. I laughed and took it. Our hands kind of got muddled together in the book handoff, and then he was holding my hand. \u201cCold,\u201d he said, pressing a finger to my pale wrist.</p><p>\u201cNot cold so much as underoxygenated,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI love it when you talk medical to me,\u201d he said. He stood, and pulled me up with him, and did not let go of my hand until we reached the stairs.</p><p>We watched the movie with several inches of couch between us. I did the totally middle-schooly thing wherein I put my hand on the couch about halfway between us to let him know that it was okay to hold it, but he didn\u2019t try. An hour into the movie, Augustus\u2019s parents came in and served us the enchiladas, which we ate on the couch, and they were pretty delicious.</p><p>The movie was about this heroic guy in a mask who died heroically for Natalie Portman, who\u2019s pretty badass and very hot and does not have anything approaching my puffy steroid face.</p><p>As the credits rolled, he said, \u201cPretty great, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty great,\u201d I agreed, although it wasn\u2019t, really. It was kind of a boy movie. I don\u2019t know why boys expect us to like boy movies. We don\u2019t expect them to like girl movies. \u201cI should get home. Class in the morning,\u201d I said.</p><p>I sat on the couch for a while as Augustus searched for his keys. His mom sat down next to me and said, \u201cI just love this one, don\u2019t you?\u201d I guess I had been looking toward the Encouragement above the TV, a drawing of an angel with the caption Without Pain, How Could We Know Joy?</p><p>(This is an old argument in the field of Thinking About Suffering, and its stupidity and lack of sophistication could be plumbed for centuries, but suffice it to say that the existence of broccoli does not in any way affect the taste of chocolate.) \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cA lovely thought.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I drove Augustus\u2019s car home with Augustus riding shotgun. He played me a couple songs he liked by a band called The Hectic Glow, and they were good songs, but because I didn\u2019t know them already, they weren\u2019t as good to me as they were to him. I kept glancing over at his leg, or the place where his leg had been, trying to imagine what the fake leg looked like. I didn\u2019t want to care about it, but I did a little. He probably cared about my oxygen. Illness repulses. I\u2019d learned that a long time ago, and I suspected Augustus had, too.</p><p>As I pulled up outside of my house, Augustus clicked the radio off. The air thickened. He was probably thinking about kissing me, and I was definitely thinking about kissing him. Wondering if I wanted to. I\u2019d kissed boys, but it had been a while. Pre-Miracle.</p><p>I put the car in park and looked over at him. He really was beautiful. I know boys aren\u2019t supposed to be, but he was.</p><p>\u201cHazel Grace,\u201d he said, my name new and better in his voice. \u201cIt has been a real pleasure to make your acquaintance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDitto, Mr. Waters,\u201d I said. I felt shy looking at him. I could not match the intensity of his waterblue eyes.</p><p>\u201cMay I see you again?\u201d he asked. There was an endearing nervousness in his voice.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPatience, grasshopper,\u201d I counseled. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to seem overeager.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight, that\u2019s why I said tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to see you again tonight. But I\u2019m willing to wait all night and much of tomorrow.\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know me,\u201d I said. I grabbed the book from the center console. \u201cHow about I call you when I finish this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t even have my phone number,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI strongly suspect you wrote it in the book.\u201d</p><p>He broke out into that goofy smile. \u201cAnd you say we don\u2019t know each other.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>I stayed up pretty late that night reading The Price of Dawn. (Spoiler alert: The price of dawn is blood.) It wasn\u2019t An Imperial Affliction, but the protagonist, Staff Sergeant Max Mayhem, was vaguely likable despite killing, by my count, no fewer than 118 individuals in 284 pages.</p><p>So I got up late the next morning, a Thursday. Mom\u2019s policy was never to wake me up, because one of the job requirements of Professional Sick Person is sleeping a lot, so I was kind of confused at first when I jolted awake with her hands on my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost ten,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSleep fights cancer,\u201d I said. \u201cI was up late reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must be some book,\u201d she said as she knelt down next to the bed and unscrewed me from my large, rectangular oxygen concentrator, which I called Philip, because it just kind of looked like a Philip.</p><p>Mom hooked me up to a portable tank and then reminded me I had class. \u201cDid that boy give it to you?\u201d she asked out of nowhere.</p><p>\u201cBy it, do you mean herpes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are too much,\u201d Mom said. \u201cThe book, Hazel. I mean the book.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, he gave me the book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell you like him,\u201d she said, eyebrows raised, as if this observation required some uniquely maternal instinct. I shrugged. \u201cI told you Support Group would be worth your while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just wait outside the entire time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I brought some paperwork. Anyway, time to face the day, young lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom. Sleep. Cancer. Fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, love, but there is class to attend. Also, today is . . . \u201d The glee in Mom\u2019s voice was evident.</p><p>\u201cThursday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you seriously forget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Thursday, March twenty-ninth!\u201d she basically screamed, a demented smile plastered to her face.</p><p>\u201cYou are really excited about knowing the date!\u201d I yelled back.</p><p>\u201cHAZEL! IT\u2019S YOUR THIRTY-THIRD HALF BIRTHDAY!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhhhhh,\u201d I said. My mom was really super into celebration maximization. IT\u2019S ARBOR DAY! LET\u2019S HUG TREES AND EAT CAKE! COLUMBUS BROUGHT SMALLPOX TO THE NATIVES; WE SHALL RECALL THE OCCASION WITH A PICNIC!, etc. \u201cWell, Happy thirty-third Half Birthday to me,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do on your very special day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome home from class and set the world record for number of episodes of Top Chef watched consecutively?\u201d</p><p>Mom reached up to this shelf above my bed and grabbed Bluie, the blue stuffed bear I\u2019d had since I was, like, one\u2014back when it was socially acceptable to name one\u2019s friends after their hue.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go to a movie with Kaitlyn or Matt or someone?\u201d who were my friends.</p><p>That was an idea. \u201cSure,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll text Kaitlyn and see if she wants to go to the mall or something after school.\u201d</p><p>Mom smiled, hugging the bear to her stomach. \u201cIs it still cool to go to the mall?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI take quite a lot of pride in not knowing what\u2019s cool,\u201d I answered.</p><p>I texted Kaitlyn, took a shower, got dressed, and then Mom drove me to school. My class was American Literature, a lecture about Frederick Douglass in a mostly empty auditorium, and it was incredibly difficult to stay awake. Forty minutes into the ninety-minute class, Kaitlyn texted back.</p><p>Awesomesauce. Happy Half Birthday. Castleton at 3:32?</p><p>Kaitlyn had the kind of packed social life that needs to be scheduled down to the minute. I responded:</p><p>Sounds good. I\u2019ll be at the food court.</p><p>Mom drove me directly from school to the bookstore attached to the mall, where I purchased both Midnight Dawns and Requiem for Mayhem, the first two sequels to The Price of Dawn, and then I walked over to the huge food court and bought a Diet Coke. It was 3:21.</p><p>I watched these kids playing in the pirate-ship indoor playground while I read. There was this tunnel that these two kids kept crawling through over and over and they never seemed to get tired, which made me think of Augustus Waters and the existentially fraught free throws.</p><p>Mom was also in the food court, alone, sitting in a corner where she thought I couldn\u2019t see her, eating a cheesesteak sandwich and reading through some papers. Medical stuff, probably. The paperwork was endless.</p><p>At 3:32 precisely, I noticed Kaitlyn striding confidently past the Wok House. She saw me the moment I raised my hand, flashed her very white and newly straightened teeth at me, and headed over.</p><p>She wore a knee-length charcoal coat that fit perfectly and sunglasses that dominated her face. She pushed them up onto the top of her head as she leaned down to hug me.</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d she said, vaguely British. \u201cHow are you?\u201d People didn\u2019t find the accent odd or off-putting. Kaitlyn just happened to be an extremely sophisticated twenty-five-year-old British socialite stuck inside a sixteen-year-old body in Indianapolis. Everyone accepted it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know anymore. Is that diet?\u201d I nodded and handed it to her. She sipped through the straw. \u201cI do wish you were at school these days. Some of the boys have become downright edible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? Like who?\u201d I asked. She proceeded to name five guys we\u2019d attended elementary and middle school with, but I couldn\u2019t picture any of them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been dating Derek Wellington for a bit,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it will last. He\u2019s such a boy. But enough about me. What is new in the Hazelverse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, really,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHealth is good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same, I guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhalanxifor!\u201d she enthused, smiling. \u201cSo you could just live forever, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not forever,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBut basically,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat else is new?\u201d</p><p>I thought of telling her that I was seeing a boy, too, or at least that I\u2019d watched a movie with one, just because I knew it would surprise and amaze her that anyone as disheveled and awkward and stunted as me could even briefly win the affections of a boy. But I didn\u2019t really have much to brag about, so I just shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhat in heaven is that?\u201d asked Kaitlyn, gesturing to the book.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s sci-fi. I\u2019ve gotten kinda into it. It\u2019s a series.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am alarmed. Shall we shop?\u201d</p><p>We went to this shoe store. As we were shopping, Kaitlyn kept picking out all these open-toed flats for me and saying, \u201cThese would look cute on you,\u201d which reminded me that Kaitlyn never wore open-toed shoes on account of how she hated her feet because she felt her second toes were too long, as if the second toe was a window into the soul or something. So when I pointed out a pair of sandals that would suit her skin tone, she was like, \u201cYeah, but . . .\u201d the but being but they will expose my hideous second toes to the public, and I said, \u201cKaitlyn, you\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve ever known to have toe-specific dysmorphia,\u201d and she said, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, like when you look in the mirror and the thing you see is not the thing as it really is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you like these?\u201d She held up a pair of cute but unspectacular Mary Janes, and I nodded, and she found her size and tried them on, pacing up and down the aisle, watching her feet in the knee-high angled mirrors. Then she grabbed a pair of strappy hooker shoes and said, \u201cIs it even possible to walk in these? I mean, I would just die\u2014\u201d and then stopped short, looking at me as if to say I\u2019m sorry, as if it were a crime to mention death to the dying. \u201cYou should try them on,\u201d Kaitlyn continued, trying to paper over the awkwardness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d sooner die,\u201d I assured her.</p><p>I ended up just picking out some flip-flops so that I could have something to buy, and then I sat down on one of the benches opposite a bank of shoes and watched Kaitlyn snake her way through the aisles, shopping with the kind of intensity and focus that one usually associates with professional chess. I kind of wanted to take out Midnight Dawns and read for a while, but I knew that\u2019d be rude, so I just watched Kaitlyn. Occasionally she\u2019d circle back to me clutching some closed-toe prey and say, \u201cThis?\u201d and I would try to make an intelligent comment about the shoe, and then finally she bought three pairs and I bought my flip-flops and then as we exited she said, \u201cAnthropologie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should head home actually,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m kinda tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to see you more often, darling.\u201d She placed her hands on my shoulders, kissed me on both cheeks, and marched off, her narrow hips swishing.</p><p>I didn\u2019t go home, though. I\u2019d told Mom to pick me up at six, and while I figured she was either in the mall or in the parking lot, I still wanted the next two hours to myself.</p><p>I liked my mom, but her perpetual nearness sometimes made me feel weirdly nervous. And I liked Kaitlyn, too. I really did. But three years removed from proper full-time schoolic exposure to my peers, I felt a certain unbridgeable distance between us. I think my school friends wanted to help me through my cancer, but they eventually found out that they couldn\u2019t. For one thing, there was no through.</p><p>So I excused myself on the grounds of pain and fatigue, as I often had over the years when seeing Kaitlyn or any of my other friends. In truth, it always hurt. It always hurt not to breathe like a normal person, incessantly reminding your lungs to be lungs, forcing yourself to accept as unsolvable the clawing scraping inside-out ache of underoxygenation. So I wasn\u2019t lying, exactly. I was just choosing among truths.</p><p>I found a bench surrounded by an Irish Gifts store, the Fountain Pen Emporium, and a baseball-cap outlet\u2014a corner of the mall even Kaitlyn would never shop, and started reading Midnight Dawns.</p><p>It featured a sentence-to-corpse ratio of nearly 1:1, and I tore through it without ever looking up. I liked Staff Sergeant Max Mayhem, even though he didn\u2019t have much in the way of a technical personality, but mostly I liked that his adventures kept happening. There were always more bad guys to kill and more good guys to save. New wars started even before the old ones were won. I hadn\u2019t read a real series like that since I was a kid, and it was exciting to live again in an infinite fiction.</p><p>Twenty pages from the end of Midnight Dawns, things started to look pretty bleak for Mayhem when he was shot seventeen times while attempting to rescue a (blond, American) hostage from the Enemy. But as a reader, I did not despair. The war effort would go on without him. There could\u2014and would\u2014be sequels starring his cohorts: Specialist Manny Loco and Private Jasper Jacks and the rest.</p><p>I was just about to the end when this little girl with barretted braids appeared in front of me and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s in your nose?\u201d</p><p>And I said, \u201cUm, it\u2019s called a cannula. These tubes give me oxygen and help me breathe.\u201d Her mother swooped in and said, \u201cJackie,\u201d disapprovingly, but I said, \u201cNo no, it\u2019s okay,\u201d because it totally was, and then Jackie asked, \u201cWould they help me breathe, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. Let\u2019s try.\u201d I took it off and let Jackie stick the cannula in her nose and breathe. \u201cTickles,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m breathing better,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI wish I could give you my cannula but I kind of really need the help.\u201d I already felt the loss. I focused on my breathing as Jackie handed the tubes back to me. I gave them a quick swipe with my T-shirt, laced the tubes behind my ears, and put the nubbins back in place.</p><p>\u201cThanks for letting me try it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackie,\u201d her mother said again, and this time I let her go.</p><p>I returned to the book, where Staff Sergeant Max Mayhem was regretting that he had but one life to give for his country, but I kept thinking about that little kid, and how much I liked her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The other thing about Kaitlyn, I guess, was that it could never again feel natural to talk to her. Any attempts to feign normal social interactions were just depressing because it was so glaringly obvious that everyone I spoke to for the rest of my life would feel awkward and self-conscious around me, except maybe kids like Jackie who just didn\u2019t know any better.</p><p>Anyway, I really did like being alone. I liked being alone with poor Staff Sergeant Max Mayhem, who\u2014oh, come on, he\u2019s not going to survive these seventeen bullet wounds, is he?</p><p>(Spoiler alert: He lives.)</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>I went to bed a little early that night, changing into boy boxers and a T-shirt before crawling under the covers of my bed, which was queen size and pillow topped and one of my favorite places in the world. And then I started reading An Imperial Affliction for the millionth time.</p><p>AIA is about this girl named Anna (who narrates the story) and her one-eyed mom, who is a professional gardener obsessed with tulips, and they have a normal lower-middle- class life in a little central California town until Anna gets this rare blood cancer.</p><p>But it\u2019s not a cancer book, because cancer books suck. Like, in cancer books, the cancer person starts a charity that raises money to fight cancer, right? And this commitment to charity reminds the cancer person of the essential goodness of humanity and makes him/her feel loved and encouraged because s/he will leave a cancer-curing legacy. But in AIA, Anna decides that being a person with cancer who starts a cancer charity is a bit narcissistic, so she starts a charity called The Anna Foundation for People with Cancer Who Want to Cure Cholera.</p><p>Also, Anna is honest about all of it in a way no one else really is: Throughout the book, she refers to herself as the side effect, which is just totally correct. Cancer kids are essentially side effects of the relentless mutation that made the diversity of life on earth possible. So as the story goes on, she gets sicker, the treatments and disease racing to kill her, and her mom falls in love with this Dutch tulip trader Anna calls the Dutch Tulip Man. The Dutch Tulip Man has lots of money and very eccentric ideas about how to treat cancer, but Anna thinks this guy might be a con man and possibly not even Dutch, and then just as the possibly Dutch guy and her mom are about to get married and Anna is about to start this crazy new treatment regimen involving wheatgrass and low doses of arsenic, the book ends right in the middle of a</p><p>I know it\u2019s a very literary decision and everything and probably part of the reason I love the book so much, but there is something to recommend a story that ends. And if it can\u2019t end, then it should at least continue into perpetuity like the adventures of Staff Sergeant Max Mayhem\u2019s platoon.</p> <p>I understood the story ended because Anna died or got too sick to write and this midsentence thing was supposed to reflect how life really ends and whatever, but there were characters other than Anna in the story, and it seemed unfair that I would never find out what happened to them. I\u2019d written, care of his publisher, a dozen letters to Peter Van Houten, each asking for some answers about what happens after the end of the story: whether the Dutch Tulip Man is a con man, whether Anna\u2019s mother ends up married to him, what happens to Anna\u2019s stupid hamster (which her mom hates), whether Anna\u2019s friends graduate from high school\u2014all that stuff. But he\u2019d never responded to any of my letters.</p><p>AIA was the only book Peter Van Houten had written, and all anyone seemed to know about him was that after the book came out he moved from the United States to the Netherlands and became kind of reclusive. I imagined that he was working on a sequel set in the Netherlands\u2014maybe Anna\u2019s mom and the Dutch Tulip Man end up moving there and trying to start a new life. But it had been ten years since An Imperial Affliction came out, and Van Houten hadn\u2019t published so much as a blog post. I couldn\u2019t wait forever.</p><p>As I reread that night, I kept getting distracted imagining Augustus Waters reading the same words. I wondered if he\u2019d like it, or if he\u2019d dismiss it as pretentious. Then I remembered my promise to call him after reading The Price of Dawn, so I found his number on its title page and texted him.</p><p>Price of Dawn review: Too many bodies. Not enough adjectives. How\u2019s AIA?</p><p>He replied a minute later:</p><p>As I recall, you promised to CALL when you finished the book, not text.</p> <p>So I called.</p><p>\u201cHazel Grace,\u201d he said upon picking up.</p><p>\u201cSo have you read it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t finished it. It\u2019s six hundred fifty-one pages long and I\u2019ve had twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour fifty-three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will withhold judgment until I finish. However, I will say that I\u2019m feeling a bit embarrassed to have given you The Price of Dawn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I\u2019m already on Requiem for Mayhem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sparkling addition to the series. So, okay, is the tulip guy a crook? I\u2019m getting a bad vibe from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo spoilers,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIf he is anything other than a total gentleman, I\u2019m going to gouge his eyes out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithholding judgment! When can I see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not until you finish An Imperial Affliction.\u201d I enjoyed being coy.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d better hang up and start reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better,\u201d I said, and the line clicked dead without another word.</p><p>Flirting was new to me, but I liked it.</p><p>The next morning I had Twentieth-Century American Poetry at MCC. This old woman gave a lecture wherein she managed to talk for ninety minutes about Sylvia Plath without ever once quoting a single word of Sylvia Plath.</p><p>When I got out of class, Mom was idling at the curb in front of the building.</p><p>\u201cDid you just wait here the entire time?\u201d I asked as she hurried around to help me haul my cart and tank into the car.</p><p>\u201cNo, I picked up the dry cleaning and went to the post office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a book to read,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m the one who needs to get a life.\u201d I smiled, and she tried to smile back, but there was something flimsy in it. After a second, I said, \u201cWanna go to a movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Anything you\u2019ve been wanting to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just do the thing where we go and see whatever starts next.\u201d She closed the door for me and walked around to the driver\u2019s side. We drove over to the Castleton theater and watched a 3-D movie about talking gerbils. It was kind of funny, actually.</p><p>When I got out of the movie, I had four text messages from Augustus.</p><p>Tell me my copy is missing the last twenty pages or something.</p><p>Hazel Grace, tell me I have not reached the end of this book.</p><p>OH MY GOD DO THEY GET MARRIED OR NOT OH MY GOD WHAT IS THIS</p><p>I guess Anna died and so it just ends? CRUEL. Call me when you can. Hope all\u2019s okay.</p><p>So when I got home I went out into the backyard and sat down on this rusting latticed patio chair and called him. It was a cloudy day, typical Indiana: the kind of weather that boxes you in. Our little backyard was dominated by my childhood swing set, which was looking pretty waterlogged and pathetic.</p><p>Augustus picked up on the third ring. \u201cHazel Grace,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSo welcome to the sweet torture of reading An Imperial\u2014\u201d I stopped when I heard violent sobbing on the other end of the line. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grand,\u201d Augustus answered. \u201cI am, however, with Isaac, who seems to be decompensating.\u201d More wailing. Like the death cries of some injured animal. Gus turned his attention to Isaac. \u201cDude. Dude. Does Support Group Hazel make this better or worse? Isaac. Focus. On. Me.\u201d After a minute, Gus said to me, \u201cCan you meet us at my house in, say, twenty minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, and hung up.</p><p>If you could drive in a straight line, it would only take like five minutes to get from my house to Augustus\u2019s house, but you can\u2019t drive in a straight line because Holliday Park is between us.</p><p>Even though it was a geographic inconvenience, I really liked Holliday Park. When I was a little kid, I would wade in the White River with my dad and there was always this great moment when he would throw me up in the air, just toss me away from him, and I would reach out my arms as I flew and he would reach out his arms, and then we would both see that our arms were not going to touch and no one was going to catch me, and it would kind of scare the shit out of both of us in the best possible way, and then I would legs-flailingly hit the water and then come up for air uninjured and the current would bring me back to him as I said again, Daddy, again.</p><p>I pulled into the driveway right next to an old black Toyota sedan I figured was Isaac\u2019s car. Carting the tank behind me, I walked up to the door. I knocked. Gus\u2019s dad answered.</p><p>\u201cJust Hazel,\u201d he said. \u201cNice to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAugustus said I could come over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he and Isaac are in the basement.\u201d At which point there was a wail from below. \u201cThat would be Isaac,\u201d Gus\u2019s dad said, and shook his head slowly. \u201cCindy had to go for a drive. The sound . . .\u201d he said, drifting off. \u201cAnyway, I guess you\u2019re wanted downstairs. Can I carry your, uh, tank?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m good. Thanks, though, Mr. Waters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark,\u201d he said.</p><p>I was kind of scared to go down there. Listening to people howl in misery is not among my favorite pastimes. But I went.</p><p>\u201cHazel Grace,\u201d Augustus said as he heard my footsteps. \u201cIsaac, Hazel from Support Group is coming downstairs. Hazel, a gentle reminder: Isaac is in the midst of a psychotic episode.\u201d</p><p>Augustus and Isaac were sitting on the floor in gaming chairs shaped like lazy Ls, staring up at a gargantuan television. The screen was split between Isaac\u2019s point of view on the left, and Augustus\u2019s on the right. They were soldiers fighting in a bombed-out modern city. I recognized the place from The Price of Dawn. As I approached, I saw nothing unusual: just two guys sitting in the lightwash of a huge television pretending to kill people.</p><p>Only when I got parallel to them did I see Isaac\u2019s face. Tears streamed down his reddened cheeks in a continual flow, his face a taut mask of pain. He stared at the screen, not even glancing at me, and howled, all the while pounding away at his controller. \u201cHow are you, Hazel?\u201d asked Augustus.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I said. \u201cIsaac?\u201d No response. Not even the slightest hint that he was aware of my existence. Just the tears flowing down his face onto his black T-shirt.</p><p>Augustus glanced away from the screen ever so briefly. \u201cYou look nice,\u201d he said. I was wearing this just-past-the-knees dress I\u2019d had forever. \u201cGirls think they\u2019re only allowed to wear dresses on formal occasions, but I like a woman who says, you know, I\u2019m going over to see a boy who is having a nervous breakdown, a boy whose connection to the sense of sight itself is tenuous, and gosh dang it, I am going to wear a dress for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet,\u201d I said, \u201cIsaac won\u2019t so much as glance over at me. Too in love with Monica, I suppose,\u201d which resulted in a catastrophic sob.</p><p>\u201cBit of a touchy subject,\u201d Augustus explained. \u201cIsaac, I don\u2019t know about you, but I have the vague sense that we are being outflanked.\u201d And then back to me, \u201cIsaac and Monica are no longer a going concern, but he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. He just wants to cry and play Counterinsurgence 2: The Price of Dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIsaac, I feel a growing concern about our position. If you agree, head over to that power station, and I\u2019ll cover you.\u201d Isaac ran toward a nondescript building while Augustus fired a machine gun wildly in a series of quick bursts, running behind him.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Augustus said to me, \u201cit doesn\u2019t hurt to talk to him. If you have any sage words of feminine advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually think his response is probably appropriate,\u201d I said as a burst of gunfire from Isaac killed an enemy who\u2019d peeked his head out from behind the burned-out husk of a pickup truck.</p><p>Augustus nodded at the screen. \u201cPain demands to be felt,\u201d he said, which was a line from An Imperial Affliction. \u201cYou\u2019re sure there\u2019s no one behind us?\u201d he asked Isaac. Moments later, tracer bullets started whizzing over their heads. \u201cOh, goddamn it, Isaac,\u201d Augustus said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to criticize you in your moment of great weakness, but you\u2019ve allowed us to be outflanked, and now there\u2019s nothing between the terrorists and the school.\u201d Isaac\u2019s character took off running toward the fire, zigging and zagging down a narrow alleyway.</p><p>\u201cYou could go over the bridge and circle back,\u201d I said, a tactic I knew about thanks to The Price of Dawn.</p><p>Augustus sighed. \u201cSadly, the bridge is already under insurgent control due to questionable strategizing by my bereft cohort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Isaac said, his voice breathy. \u201cMe?! You\u2019re the one who suggested we hole up in the freaking power station.\u201d</p><p>Gus turned away from the screen for a second and flashed his crooked smile at Isaac. \u201cI knew you could talk, buddy,\u201d he said. \u201cNow let\u2019s go save some fictional schoolchildren.\u201d</p><p>Together, they ran down the alleyway, firing and hiding at the right moments, until they reached this one-story, single-room schoolhouse. They crouched behind a wall across the street and picked off the enemy one by one.</p><p>\u201cWhy do they want to get into the school?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThey want the kids as hostages,\u201d Augustus answered. His shoulders rounded over his controller, slamming buttons, his forearms taut, veins visible. Isaac leaned toward the screen, the controller dancing in his thin-fingered hands. \u201cGet it get it get it,\u201d Augustus said. The waves of terrorists continued, and they mowed down every one, their shooting astonishingly precise, as it had to be, lest they fire into the school. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGrenade! Grenade!\u201d Augustus shouted as something arced across the screen, bounced in the doorway of the school, and then rolled against the door.</p><p>Isaac dropped his controller in disappointment. \u201cIf the bastards can\u2019t take hostages, they just kill them and claim we did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCover me!\u201d Augustus said as he jumped out from behind the wall and raced toward the school. Isaac fumbled for his controller and then started firing while the bullets rained down on Augustus, who was shot once and then twice but still ran, Augustus shouting, \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T KILL MAX MAYHEM!\u201d and with a final flurry of button combinations, he dove onto the grenade, which detonated beneath him. His dismembered body exploded like a geyser and the screen went red. A throaty voice said, \u201cMISSION FAILURE,\u201d but Augustus seemed to think otherwise as he smiled at his remnants on the screen. He reached into his pocket, pulled out a cigarette, and shoved it between his teeth. \u201cSaved the kids,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTemporarily,\u201d I pointed out.</p> <p>\u201cAll salvation is temporary,\u201d Augustus shot back. \u201cI bought them a minute. Maybe that\u2019s the minute that buys them an hour, which is the hour that buys them a year. No one\u2019s gonna buy them forever, Hazel Grace, but my life bought them a minute. And that\u2019s not nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, okay,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019re just talking about pixels.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, as if he believed the game might be really real. Isaac was wailing again. Augustus snapped his head back to him. \u201cAnother go at the mission, corporal?\u201d</p><p>Isaac shook his head no. He leaned over Augustus to look at me and through tightly strung vocal cords said, \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to do it after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t want to dump a blind guy,\u201d I said. He nodded, the tears not like tears so much as a quiet metronome\u2014steady, endless.</p> <p>\u201cShe said she couldn\u2019t handle it,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019m about to lose my eyesight and she can\u2019t handle it.\u201d</p><p>I was thinking about the word handle, and all the unholdable things that get handled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said.</p><p>He wiped his sopping face with a sleeve. Behind his glasses, Isaac\u2019s eyes seemed so big that everything else on his face kind of disappeared and it was just these disembodied floating eyes staring at me\u2014one real, one glass. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s totally unacceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, to be fair,\u201d I said, \u201cI mean, she probably can\u2019t handle it. Neither can you, but she doesn\u2019t have to handle it. And you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kept saying \u2018always\u2019 to her today, \u2018always always always,\u2019 and she just kept talking over me and not saying it back. It was like I was already gone, you know? \u2018Always\u2019 was a promise! How can you just break the promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes people don\u2019t understand the promises they\u2019re making when they make them,\u201d I said.</p> <p>Isaac shot me a look. \u201cRight, of course. But you keep the promise anyway. That\u2019s what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway. Don\u2019t you believe in true love?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer. I didn\u2019t have an answer. But I thought that if true love did exist, that was a pretty good definition of it.</p><p>\u201cWell, I believe in true love,\u201d Isaac said. \u201cAnd I love her. And she promised. She promised me always.\u201d He stood and took a step toward me. I pushed myself up, thinking he wanted a hug or something, but then he just spun around, like he couldn\u2019t remember why he\u2019d stood up in the first place, and then Augustus and I both saw this rage settle into his face.</p><p>\u201cIsaac,\u201d Gus said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look a little . . . Pardon the double entendre, my friend, but there\u2019s something a little worrisome in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Isaac started kicking the crap out of his gaming chair, which somersaulted back toward Gus\u2019s bed. \u201cHere we go,\u201d said Augustus. Isaac chased after the chair and kicked it again. \u201cYes,\u201d Augustus said. \u201cGet it. Kick the shit out of that chair!\u201d Isaac kicked the chair again, until it bounced against Gus\u2019s bed, and then he grabbed one of the pillows and started slamming it against the wall between the bed and the trophy shelf above.</p><p>Augustus looked over at me, cigarette still in his mouth, and half smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about that book.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never said what happens to the other characters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I told him. Isaac was still throttling the wall with the pillow. \u201cHe moved to Amsterdam, which makes me think maybe he is writing a sequel featuring the Dutch Tulip Man, but he hasn\u2019t published anything. He\u2019s never interviewed. He doesn\u2019t seem to be online. I\u2019ve written him a bunch of letters asking what happens to everyone, but he never responds. So . . . yeah.\u201d I stopped talking because Augustus didn\u2019t appear to be listening. Instead, he was squinting at Isaac.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d he mumbled to me. He walked over to Isaac and grabbed him by the shoulders. \u201cDude, pillows don\u2019t break. Try something that breaks.\u201d</p><p>Isaac reached for a basketball trophy from the shelf above the bed and then held it over his head as if waiting for permission. \u201cYes,\u201d Augustus said. \u201cYes!\u201d The trophy smashed against the floor, the plastic basketball player\u2019s arm splintering off, still grasping its ball. Isaac stomped on the trophy. \u201cYes!\u201d Augustus said. \u201cGet it!\u201d</p><p>And then back to me, \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for a way to tell my father that I actually sort of hate basketball, and I think we\u2019ve found it.\u201d The trophies came down one after the other, and Isaac stomped on them and screamed while Augustus and I stood a few feet away, bearing witness to the madness. The poor, mangled bodies of plastic basketballers littered the carpeted ground: here, a ball palmed by a disembodied hand; there, two torsoless legs caught midjump. Isaac kept attacking the trophies, jumping on them with both feet, screaming, breathless, sweaty, until finally he collapsed on top of the jagged trophic remnants.</p><p>Augustus stepped toward him and looked down. \u201cFeel better?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Isaac mumbled, his chest heaving.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing about pain,\u201d Augustus said, and then glanced back at me. \u201cIt demands to be felt.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>I did not speak to Augustus again for about a week. I had called him on the Night of the Broken Trophies, so per tradition it was his turn to call. But he didn\u2019t. Now, it wasn\u2019t as if I held my phone in my sweaty hand all day, staring at it while wearing my Special Yellow Dress, patiently waiting for my gentleman caller to live up to his sobriquet. I went about my life: I met Kaitlyn and her (cute but frankly not Augustinian) boyfriend for coffee one afternoon; I ingested my recommended daily allowance of Phalanxifor; I attended classes three mornings that week at MCC; and every night, I sat down to dinner with my mom and dad.</p><p>Sunday night, we had pizza with green peppers and broccoli. We were seated around our little circular table in the kitchen when my phone started singing, but I wasn\u2019t allowed to check it because we have a strict no-phones-during-dinner rule.</p><p>So I ate a little while Mom and Dad talked about this earthquake that had just happened in Papua New Guinea. They met in the Peace Corps in Papua New Guinea, and so whenever anything happened there, even something terrible, it was like all of a sudden they were not large sedentary creatures, but the young and idealistic and self-sufficient and rugged people they had once been, and their rapture was such that they didn\u2019t even glance over at me as I ate faster than I\u2019d ever eaten, transmitting items from my plate into my mouth with a speed and ferocity that left me quite out of breath, which of course made me worry that my lungs were again swimming in a rising pool of fluid. I banished the thought as best I could. I had a PET scan scheduled in a couple weeks. If something was wrong, I\u2019d find out soon enough. Nothing to be gained by worrying between now and then.</p><p>And yet still I worried. I liked being a person. I wanted to keep at it. Worry is yet another side effect of dying.</p><p>Finally I finished and said, \u201cCan I be excused?\u201d and they hardly even paused from their conversation about the strengths and weaknesses of Guinean infrastructure. I grabbed my phone from my purse on the kitchen counter and checked my recent calls. Augustus Waters.</p><p>I went out the back door into the twilight. I could see the swing set, and I thought about walking out there and swinging while I talked to him, but it seemed pretty far away given that eating tired me.</p><p>Instead, I lay down in the grass on the patio\u2019s edge, looked up at Orion, the only constellation I could recognize, and called him.</p><p>\u201cHazel Grace,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrand,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been wanting to call you on a nearly minutely basis, but I have been waiting until I could form a coherent thought in re An Imperial Affliction.\u201d (He said \u201cin re.\u201d He really did. That boy.)</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s, like. Reading it, I just kept feeling like, like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d I asked, teasing him.</p><p>\u201cLike it was a gift?\u201d he said askingly. \u201cLike you\u2019d given me something important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cheesy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cTorture. I totally get it, like, I get that she died or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, I assume so,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAnd okay, fair enough, but there is this unwritten contract between author and reader and I think not ending your book kind of violates that contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, feeling defensive of Peter Van Houten. \u201cThat\u2019s part of what I like about the book in some ways. It portrays death truthfully. You die in the middle of your life, in the middle of a sentence. But I do\u2014God, I do really want to know what happens to everyone else. That\u2019s what I asked him in my letters. But he, yeah, he never answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. You said he is a recluse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible to track down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUtterly unreachable,\u201d Augustus said.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately so,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Dear Mr. Waters,\u2019\u201d he answered. \u201c\u2018I am writing to thank you for your electronic correspondence, received via Ms. Vliegenthart this sixth of April, from the United States of America, insofar as geography can be said to exist in our triumphantly digitized contemporaneity.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cAugustus, what the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has an assistant,\u201d Augustus said. \u201cLidewij Vliegenthart. I found her. I emailed her. She gave him the email. He responded via her email account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Keep reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018My response is being written with ink and paper in the glorious tradition of our ancestors and then transcribed by Ms. Vliegenthart into a series of 1s and 0s to travel through the insipid web which has lately ensnared our species, so I apologize for any errors or omissions that may result.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Given the entertainment bacchanalia at the disposal of young men and women of your generation, I am grateful to anyone anywhere who sets aside the hours necessary to read my little book. But I am particularly indebted to you, sir, both for your kind words about An Imperial Affliction and for taking the time to tell me that the book, and here I quote you directly, \u201cmeant a great deal\u201d to you.</p><p>\u201c\u2018This comment, however, leads me to wonder: What do you mean by meant? Given the final futility of our struggle, is the fleeting jolt of meaning that art gives us valuable? Or is the only value in passing the time as comfortably as possible? What should a story seek to emulate, Augustus? A ringing alarm? A call to arms? A morphine drip? Of course, like all interrogation of the universe, this line of inquiry inevitably reduces us to asking what it means to be human and whether\u2014to borrow a phrase from the angst-encumbered sixteen-year-olds you no doubt revile\u2014there is a point to it all.</p><p>\u201c\u2018I fear there is not, my friend, and that you would receive scant encouragement from further encounters with my writing. But to answer your question: No, I have not written anything else, nor will I. I do not feel that continuing to share my thoughts with readers would benefit either them or me. Thank you again for your generous email.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Yours most sincerely, Peter Van Houten, via Lidewij Vliegenthart.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I said. \u201cAre you making this up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHazel Grace, could I, with my meager intellectual capacities, make up a letter from Peter Van Houten featuring phrases like \u2018our triumphantly digitized contemporaneity\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could not,\u201d I allowed. \u201cCan I, can I have the email address?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Augustus said, like it was not the best gift ever.</p><p>I spent the next two hours writing an email to Peter Van Houten. It seemed to get worse each time I rewrote it, but I couldn\u2019t stop myself.</p><p>Dear Mr. Peter Van Houten</p><p>(c/o Lidewij Vliegenthart),</p><p>My name is Hazel Grace Lancaster. My friend Augustus Waters, who read An Imperial Affliction at my recommendation, just received an email from you at this address. I hope you will not mind that Augustus shared that email with me.</p><p>Mr. Van Houten, I understand from your email to Augustus that you are not planning to publish any more books. In a way, I am disappointed, but I\u2019m also relieved: I never have to worry whether your next book will live up to the magnificent perfection of the original. As a three-year survivor of Stage IV cancer, I can tell you that you got everything right in An Imperial Affliction. Or at least you got me right. Your book has a way of telling me what I\u2019m feeling before I even feel it, and I\u2019ve reread it dozens of times. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wonder, though, if you would mind answering a couple questions I have about what happens after the end of the novel. I understand the book ends because Anna dies or becomes too ill to continue writing it, but I would really like to know what happens to Anna\u2019s mom\u2014whether she married the Dutch Tulip Man, whether she ever has another child, and whether she stays at 917 W. Temple, etc. Also, is the Dutch Tulip Man a fraud or does he really love them? What happens to Anna\u2019s friends\u2014particularly Claire and Jake? Do they stay together? And lastly\u2014I realize that this is the kind of deep and thoughtful question you always hoped your readers would ask\u2014what becomes of Sisyphus the Hamster? These questions have haunted me for years\u2014and I don\u2019t know how long I have left to get answers to them.</p><p>I know these are not important literary questions and that your book is full of important literary questions, but I would just really like to know.</p><p>And of course, if you ever do decide to write anything else, even if you don\u2019t want to publish it, I\u2019d love to read it. Frankly, I\u2019d read your grocery lists.</p><p>Yours with great admiration,</p> <p>Hazel Grace Lancaster</p><p>(age 16)</p><p>After I sent it, I called Augustus back, and we stayed up late talking about An Imperial Affliction, and I read him the Emily Dickinson poem that Van Houten had used for the title, and he said I had a good voice for reading and didn\u2019t pause too long for the line breaks, and then he told me that the sixth Price of Dawn book, The Blood Approves, begins with a quote from a poem. It took him a minute to find the book, but finally he read the quote to me. \u201c\u2018Say your life broke down. The last good kiss / You had was years ago.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d I said. \u201cBit pretentious. I believe Max Mayhem would refer to that as \u2018sissy shit.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, with his teeth gritted, no doubt. God, Mayhem grits his teeth a lot in these books. He\u2019s definitely going to get TMJ, if he survives all this combat.\u201d And then after a second, Gus asked, \u201cWhen was the last good kiss you had?\u201d</p> <p>I thought about it. My kissing\u2014all prediagnosis\u2014had been uncomfortable and slobbery, and on some level it always felt like kids playing at being grown. But of course it had been a while. \u201cYears ago,\u201d I said finally. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a few good kisses with my ex-girlfriend, Caroline Mathers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last one was just less than a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuring the kiss?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, with you and Caroline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said. And then after a second, \u201cCaroline is no longer suffering from personhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. I\u2019d known plenty of dead people, of course. But I\u2019d never dated one. I couldn\u2019t even imagine it, really.</p><p>\u201cNot your fault, Hazel Grace. We\u2019re all just side effects, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Barnacles on the container ship of consciousness,\u2019\u201d I said, quoting AIA.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cI gotta go to sleep. It\u2019s almost one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said.</p><p>I giggled and said, \u201cOkay.\u201d And then the line was quiet but not dead. I almost felt like he was there in my room with me, but in a way it was better, like I was not in my room and he was not in his, but instead we were together in some invisible and tenuous third space that could only be visited on the phone.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said after forever. \u201cMaybe okay will be our always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said.</p><p>It was Augustus who finally hung up.</p><p>Peter Van Houten replied to Augustus\u2019s email four hours after he sent it, but two days later, Van Houten still hadn\u2019t replied to me. Augustus assured me it was because my email was better and required a more thoughtful response, that Van Houten was busy writing answers to my questions, and that brilliant prose took time. But still I worried.</p><p>On Wednesday during American Poetry for Dummies 101, I got a text from Augustus:</p><p>Isaac out of surgery. It went well. He\u2019s officially NEC.</p><p>NEC meant \u201cno evidence of cancer.\u201d A second text came a few seconds later.</p><p>I mean, he\u2019s blind. So that\u2019s unfortunate.</p><p>That afternoon, Mom consented to loan me the car so I could drive down to Memorial to check in on Isaac.</p><p>I found my way to his room on the fifth floor, knocking even though the door was open, and a woman\u2019s voice said, \u201cCome in.\u201d It was a nurse who was doing something to the bandages on Isaac\u2019s eyes. \u201cHey, Isaac,\u201d I said.</p><p>And he said, \u201cMon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Sorry. No, it\u2019s, um, Hazel. Um, Support Group Hazel? Night-of-the-broken-trophies Hazel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, people keep saying my other senses will improve to compensate, but CLEARLY NOT YET. Hi, Support Group Hazel. Come over here so I can examine your face with my hands and see deeper into your soul than a sighted person ever could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s kidding,\u201d the nurse said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cI realize.\u201d</p><p>I took a few steps toward the bed. I pulled a chair up and sat down, took his hand. \u201cHey,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said back. Then nothing for a while.</p><p>\u201cHow you feeling?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what?\u201d I asked. I looked at his hand because I didn\u2019t want to look at his face blindfolded by bandages. Isaac bit his nails, and I could see some blood on the corners of a couple of his cuticles.</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t even visited,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, we were together fourteen months. Fourteen months is a long time. God, that hurts.\u201d Isaac let go of my hand to fumble for his pain pump, which you hit to give yourself a wave of narcotics.</p><p>The nurse, having finished the bandage change, stepped back. \u201cIt\u2019s only been a day, Isaac,\u201d she said, vaguely condescending. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta give yourself time to heal. And fourteen months isn\u2019t that long, not in the scheme of things. You\u2019re just getting started, buddy. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>The nurse left. \u201cIs she gone?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, then realized he couldn\u2019t see me nod. \u201cYeah,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see? Really? Did she seriously say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQualities of a Good Nurse: Go,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201c1. Doesn\u2019t pun on your disability,\u201d Isaac said.</p><p>\u201c2. Gets blood on the first try,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, that is huge. I mean is this my freaking arm or a dartboard? 3. No condescending voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing, sweetie?\u201d I asked, cloying. \u201cI\u2019m going to stick you with a needle now. There might be a little ouchie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs my wittle fuffywump sickywicky?\u201d he answered. And then after a second, \u201cMost of them are good, actually. I just want the hell out of this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis place as in the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too,\u201d he said. His mouth tightened. I could see the pain. \u201cHonestly, I think a hell of a lot more about Monica than my eye. Is that crazy? That\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little crazy,\u201d I allowed.</p><p>\u201cBut I believe in true love, you know? I don\u2019t believe that everybody gets to keep their eyes or not get sick or whatever, but everybody should have true love, and it should last at least as long as your life does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI just wish the whole thing hadn\u2019t happened sometimes. The whole cancer thing.\u201d His speech was slowing down. The medicine working.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cGus was here earlier. He was here when I woke up. Took off school. He . . .\u201d His head turned to the side a little. \u201cIt\u2019s better,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cThe pain?\u201d I asked. He nodded a little.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I said. And then, like the bitch I am: \u201cYou were saying something about Gus?\u201d But he was gone.</p><p>I went downstairs to the tiny windowless gift shop and asked the decrepit volunteer sitting on a stool behind a cash register what kind of flowers smell the strongest.</p><p>\u201cThey all smell the same. They get sprayed with Super Scent,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they just squirt \u2019em with it.\u201d</p><p>I opened the cooler to her left and sniffed at a dozen roses, and then leaned over some carnations. Same smell, and lots of it. The carnations were cheaper, so I grabbed a dozen yellow ones. They cost fourteen dollars. I went back into the room; his mom was there, holding his hand. She was young and really pretty.</p><p>\u201cAre you a friend?\u201d she asked, which struck me as one of those unintentionally broad and unanswerable questions.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m from Support Group. These are for him.\u201d</p><p>She took them and placed them in her lap. \u201cDo you know Monica?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I shook my head no.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s sleeping,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I talked to him a little before, when they were doing the bandages or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hated leaving him for that but I had to pick up Graham at school,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe did okay,\u201d I told her. She nodded. \u201cI should let him sleep.\u201d She nodded again. I left.</p><p>The next morning I woke up early and checked my email first thing.</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ had finally replied.</p><p>Dear Ms. Lancaster,</p><p>I fear your faith has been misplaced\u2014but then, faith usually is. I cannot answer your questions, at least not in writing, because to write out such answers would constitute a sequel to An Imperial Affliction, which you might publish or otherwise share on the network that has replaced the brains of your generation. There is the telephone, but then you might record the conversation. Not that I don\u2019t trust you, of course, but I don\u2019t trust you. Alas, dear Hazel, I could never answer such questions except in person, and you are there, while I am here.</p><p>That noted, I must confess that the unexpected receipt of your correspondence via Ms. Vliegenthart has delighted me: What a wondrous thing to know that I made something useful to you\u2014even if that book seems so distant from me that I feel it was written by a different man altogether. (The author of that novel was so thin, so frail, so comparatively optimistic!)</p><p>Should you find yourself in Amsterdam, however, please do pay a visit at your leisure. I am usually home. I would even allow you a peek at my grocery lists.</p><p>Yours most sincerely,</p><p>Peter Van Houten</p><p>c/o Lidewij Vliegenthart</p><p>\u201cWHAT?!\u201d I shouted aloud. \u201cWHAT IS THIS LIFE?\u201d</p><p>Mom ran in. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I assured her.</p><p>Still nervous, Mom knelt down to check on Philip to ensure he was condensing oxygen appropriately. I imagined sitting at a sun-drenched caf\u00e9 with Peter Van Houten as he leaned across the table on his elbows, speaking in a soft voice so no one else would hear the truth of what happened to the characters I\u2019d spent years thinking about. He\u2019d said he couldn\u2019t tell me except in person, and then invited me to Amsterdam. I explained this to Mom, and then said, \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHazel, I love you, and you know I\u2019d do anything for you, but we don\u2019t\u2014we don\u2019t have the money for international travel, and the expense of getting equipment over there\u2014love, it\u2019s just not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, cutting her off. I realized I\u2019d been silly even to consider it. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d But she looked worried.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really important to you, yeah?\u201d she asked, sitting down, a hand on my calf.</p><p>\u201cIt would be pretty amazing,\u201d I said, \u201cto be the only person who knows what happens besides him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cJust, seriously, don\u2019t spend any money on it please. I\u2019ll think of something.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to me that the reason my parents had no money was me. I\u2019d sapped the family savings with Phalanxifor copays, and Mom couldn\u2019t work because she had taken on the full-time profession of Hovering Over Me. I didn\u2019t want to put them even further into debt.</p><p>I told Mom I wanted to call Augustus to get her out of the room, because I couldn\u2019t handle her I-can\u2019t-make-my-daughter\u2019s-dreams-come-true sad face.</p><p>Augustus Waters\u2013style, I read him the letter in lieu of saying hello.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d I said. \u201cHow am I going to get to Amsterdam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a Wish?\u201d he asked, referring to this organization, The Genie Foundation, which is in the business of granting sick kids one wish.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI used my Wish pre-Miracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do?\u201d</p><p>I sighed loudly. \u201cI was thirteen,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNot Disney,\u201d he said.</p><p>I said nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou did not go to Disney World.\u201d</p><p>I said nothing.</p><p>\u201cHazel GRACE!\u201d he shouted. \u201cYou did not use your one dying Wish to go to Disney World with your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso Epcot Center,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d Augustus said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have a crush on a girl with such clich\u00e9 wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thirteen,\u201d I said again, although of course I was only thinking crush crush crush crush crush. I was flattered but changed the subject immediately. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be in school or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m playing hooky to hang out with Isaac, but he\u2019s sleeping, so I\u2019m in the atrium doing geometry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s just not ready to confront the seriousness of his disability or if he really does care more about getting dumped by Monica, but he won\u2019t talk about anything else.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cHow long\u2019s he gonna be in the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFew days. Then he goes to this rehab or something for a while, but he gets to sleep at home, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSucks,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI see his mom. I gotta go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he answered. I could hear his crooked smile.</p><p>On Saturday, my parents and I went down to the farmers\u2019 market in Broad Ripple. It was sunny, a rarity for Indiana in April, and everyone at the farmers\u2019 market was wearing short sleeves even though the temperature didn\u2019t quite justify it. We Hoosiers are excessively optimistic about summer. Mom and I sat next to each other on a bench across from a goat-soap maker, a man in overalls who had to explain to every single person who walked by that yes, they were his goats, and no, goat soap does not smell like goats.</p><p>My phone rang. \u201cWho is it?\u201d Mom asked before I could even check.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. It was Gus, though.</p> <p>\u201cAre you currently at your house?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cUm, no,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThat was a trick question. I knew the answer, because I am currently at your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Um. Well, we are on our way, I guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome. See you soon.\u201d</p><p>Augustus Waters was sitting on the front step as we pulled into the driveway. He was holding a bouquet of bright orange tulips just beginning to bloom, and wearing an Indiana Pacers jersey under his fleece, a wardrobe choice that seemed utterly out of character, although it did look quite good on him. He pushed himself up off the stoop, handed me the tulips, and asked, \u201cWanna go on a picnic?\u201d I nodded, taking the flowers.</p> <p>My dad walked up behind me and shook Gus\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cIs that a Rik Smits jersey?\u201d my dad asked.</p><p>\u201cIndeed it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I loved that guy,\u201d Dad said, and immediately they were engrossed in a basketball conversation I could not (and did not want to) join, so I took my tulips inside.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to put those in a vase?\u201d Mom asked as I walked in, a huge smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d I told her. If we\u2019d put them in a vase in the living room, they would have been everyone\u2019s flowers. I wanted them to be my flowers.</p><p>I went to my room but didn\u2019t change. I brushed my hair and teeth and put on some lip gloss and the smallest possible dab of perfume. I kept looking at the flowers. They were aggressively orange, almost too orange to be pretty. I didn\u2019t have a vase or anything, so I took my toothbrush out of my toothbrush holder and filled it halfway with water and left the flowers there in the bathroom.</p><p>When I reentered my room, I could hear people talking, so I sat on the edge of my bed for a while and listened through my hollow bedroom door:</p> <p>Dad: \u201cSo you met Hazel at Support Group.\u201d</p><p>Augustus: \u201cYes, sir. This is a lovely house you\u2019ve got. I like your artwork.\u201d</p><p>Mom: \u201cThank you, Augustus.\u201d</p><p>Dad: \u201cYou\u2019re a survivor yourself, then?\u201d</p><p>Augustus: \u201cI am. I didn\u2019t cut this fella off for the sheer unadulterated pleasure of it, although it is an excellent weight-loss strategy. Legs are heavy!\u201d</p><p>Dad: \u201cAnd how\u2019s your health now?\u201d</p><p>Augustus: \u201cNEC for fourteen months.\u201d</p><p>Mom: \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful. The treatment options these days\u2014it really is remarkable.\u201d</p><p>Augustus: \u201cI know. I\u2019m lucky.\u201d</p><p>Dad: \u201cYou have to understand that Hazel is still sick, Augustus, and will be for the rest of her life. She\u2019ll want to keep up with you, but her lungs\u2014\u201d</p><p>At which point I emerged, silencing him.</p><p>\u201cSo where are you going?\u201d asked Mom. Augustus stood up and leaned over to her, whispering the answer, and then held a finger to his lips. \u201cShh,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201d</p><p>Mom smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your phone?\u201d she asked me. I held it up as evidence, tilted my oxygen cart onto its front wheels, and started walking. Augustus hustled over, offering me his arm, which I took. My fingers wrapped around his biceps.</p><p>Unfortunately, he insisted upon driving, so the surprise could be a surprise. As we shuddered toward our destination, I said, \u201cYou nearly charmed the pants off my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and your dad is a Smits fan, which helps. You think they liked me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure they did. Who cares, though? They\u2019re just parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re your parents,\u201d he said, glancing over at me. \u201cPlus, I like being liked. Is that crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to rush to hold doors open or smother me in compliments for me to like you.\u201d He slammed the brakes, and I flew forward hard enough that my breathing felt weird and tight. I thought of the PET scan. Don\u2019t worry. Worry is useless. I worried anyway.</p><p>We burned rubber, roaring away from a stop sign before turning left onto the misnomered Grandview (there\u2019s a view of a golf course, I guess, but nothing grand). The only thing I could think of in this direction was the cemetery. Augustus reached into the center console, flipped open a full pack of cigarettes, and removed one.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever throw them away?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cOne of the many benefits of not smoking is that packs of cigarettes last forever,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019ve had this one for almost a year. A few of them are broken near the filters, but I think this pack could easily get me to my eighteenth birthday.\u201d He held the filter between his fingers, then put it in his mouth. \u201cSo, okay,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay. Name some things that you never see in Indianapolis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. Skinny adults,\u201d I said.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cGood. Keep going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, beaches. Family-owned restaurants. Topography.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll excellent examples of things we lack. Also, culture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we are a bit short on culture,\u201d I said, finally realizing where he was taking me. \u201cAre we going to the museum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, are we going to that park or whatever?\u201d</p><p>Gus looked a bit deflated. \u201cYes, we are going to that park or whatever,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve figured it out, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, figured what out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>There was this park behind the museum where a bunch of artists had made big sculptures. I\u2019d heard about it but had never visited. We drove past the museum and parked right next to this basketball court filled with huge blue and red steel arcs that imagined the path of a bouncing ball.</p><p>We walked down what passes for a hill in Indianapolis to this clearing where kids were climbing all over this huge oversize skeleton sculpture. The bones were each about waist high, and the thighbone was longer than me. It looked like a child\u2019s drawing of a skeleton rising up out of the ground.</p><p>My shoulder hurt. I worried the cancer had spread from my lungs. I imagined the tumor metastasizing into my own bones, boring holes into my skeleton, a slithering eel of insidious intent. \u201cFunky Bones,\u201d Augustus said. \u201cCreated by Joep Van Lieshout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds Dutch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Gus said. \u201cSo is Rik Smits. So are tulips.\u201d Gus stopped in the middle of the clearing with the bones right in front of us and slipped his backpack off one shoulder, then the other. He unzipped it, producing an orange blanket, a pint of orange juice, and some sandwiches wrapped in plastic wrap with the crusts cut off.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with all the orange?\u201d I asked, still not wanting to let myself imagine that all this would lead to Amsterdam.</p><p>\u201cNational color of the Netherlands, of course. You remember William of Orange and everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t on the GED test.\u201d I smiled, trying to contain my excitement.</p><p>\u201cSandwich?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDutch cheese. And tomato. The tomatoes are from Mexico. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always such a disappointment, Augustus. Couldn\u2019t you have at least gotten orange tomatoes?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and we ate our sandwiches in silence, watching the kids play on the sculpture. I couldn\u2019t very well ask him about it, so I just sat there surrounded by Dutchness, feeling awkward and hopeful.</p><p>In the distance, soaked in the unblemished sunlight so rare and precious in our hometown, a gaggle of kids made a skeleton into a playground, jumping back and forth among the prosthetic bones.</p><p>\u201cTwo things I love about this sculpture,\u201d Augustus said. He was holding the unlit cigarette between his fingers, flicking at it as if to get rid of the ash. He placed it back in his mouth. \u201cFirst, the bones are just far enough apart that if you\u2019re a kid, you cannot resist the urge to jump between them. Like, you just have to jump from rib cage to skull. Which means that, second, the sculpture essentially forces children to play on bones. The symbolic resonances are endless, Hazel Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do love symbols,\u201d I said, hoping to steer the conversation back toward the many symbols of the Netherlands at our picnic.</p><p>\u201cRight, about that. You are probably wondering why you are eating a bad cheese sandwich and drinking orange juice and why I am wearing the jersey of a Dutchman who played a sport I have come to loathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has crossed my mind,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHazel Grace, like so many children before you\u2014and I say this with great affection\u2014you spent your Wish hastily, with little care for the consequences. The Grim Reaper was staring you in the face and the fear of dying with your Wish still in your proverbial pocket, ungranted, led you to rush toward the first Wish you could think of, and you, like so many others, chose the cold and artificial pleasures of the theme park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually had a great time on that trip. I met Goofy and Minn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am in the midst of a soliloquy! I wrote this out and memorized it and if you interrupt me I will completely screw it up,\u201d Augustus interrupted. \u201cPlease to be eating your sandwich and listening.\u201d (The sandwich was inedibly dry, but I smiled and took a bite anyway.) \u201cOkay, where was I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe artificial pleasures.\u201d</p><p>He returned the cigarette to its pack. \u201cRight, the cold and artificial pleasures of the theme park. But let me submit that the real heroes of the Wish Factory are the young men and women who wait like Vladimir and Estragon wait for Godot and good Christian girls wait for marriage. These young heroes wait stoically and without complaint for their one true Wish to come along. Sure, it may never come along, but at least they can rest easily in the grave knowing that they\u2019ve done their little part to preserve the integrity of the Wish as an idea.</p><p>\u201cBut then again, maybe it will come along: Maybe you\u2019ll realize that your one true Wish is to visit the brilliant Peter Van Houten in his Amsterdamian exile, and you will be glad indeed to have saved your Wish.\u201d</p><p>Augustus stopped speaking long enough that I figured the soliloquy was over. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t save my Wish,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said. And then, after what felt like a practiced pause, he added, \u201cBut I saved mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I was surprised that Augustus was Wish-eligible, what with being still in school and a year into remission. You had to be pretty sick for the Genies to hook you up with a Wish.</p><p>\u201cI got it in exchange for the leg,\u201d he explained. There was all this light on his face; he had to squint to look at me, which made his nose crinkle adorably. \u201cNow, I\u2019m not going to give you my Wish or anything. But I also have an interest in meeting Peter Van Houten, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to meet him without the girl who introduced me to his book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt definitely wouldn\u2019t,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSo I talked to the Genies, and they are in total agreement. They said Amsterdam is lovely in the beginning of May. They proposed leaving May third and returning May seventh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAugustus, really?\u201d</p><p>He reached over and touched my cheek and for a moment I thought he might kiss me. My body tensed, and I think he saw it, because he pulled his hand away.</p><p>\u201cAugustus,\u201d I said. \u201cReally. You don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do,\u201d he said. \u201cI found my Wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re the best,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI bet you say that to all the boys who finance your international travel,\u201d he answered.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>Mom was folding my laundry while watching this TV show called The View when I got home. I told her that the tulips and the Dutch artist and everything were all because Augustus was using his Wish to take me to Amsterdam. \u201cThat\u2019s too much,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cWe can\u2019t accept that from a virtual stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a stranger. He\u2019s easily my second best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehind Kaitlyn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehind you,\u201d I said. It was true, but I\u2019d mostly said it because I wanted to go to Amsterdam.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask Dr. Maria,\u201d she said after a moment.</p><p>Dr. Maria said I couldn\u2019t go to Amsterdam without an adult intimately familiar with my case, which more or less meant either Mom or Dr. Maria herself. (My dad understood my cancer the way I did: in the vague and incomplete way people understand electrical circuits and ocean tides. But my mom knew more about differentiated thyroid carcinoma in adolescents than most oncologists.)</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll come,\u201d I said. \u201cThe Genies will pay for it. The Genies are loaded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your father,\u201d she said. \u201cHe would miss us. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to him, and he can\u2019t get time off work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? You don\u2019t think Dad would enjoy a few days of watching TV shows that are not about aspiring models and ordering pizza every night, using paper towels as plates so he doesn\u2019t have to do the dishes?\u201d</p><p>Mom laughed. Finally, she started to get excited, typing tasks into her phone: She\u2019d have to call Gus\u2019s parents and talk to the Genies about my medical needs and do they have a hotel yet and what are the best guidebooks and we should do our research if we only have three days, and so on. I kind of had a headache, so I downed a couple Advil and decided to take a nap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But I ended up just lying in bed and replaying the whole picnic with Augustus. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the little moment when I\u2019d tensed up as he touched me. The gentle familiarity felt wrong, somehow. I thought maybe it was how orchestrated the whole thing had been: Augustus was amazing, but he\u2019d overdone everything at the picnic, right down to the sandwiches that were metaphorically resonant but tasted terrible and the memorized soliloquy that prevented conversation. It all felt Romantic, but not romantic.</p><p>But the truth is that I had never wanted him to kiss me, not in the way you are supposed to want these things. I mean, he was gorgeous. I was attracted to him. I thought about him in that way, to borrow a phrase from the middle school vernacular. But the actual touch, the realized touch . . . it was all wrong.</p><p>Then I found myself worrying I would have to make out with him to get to Amsterdam, which is not the kind of thing you want to be thinking, because (a) It shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve even been a question whether I wanted to kiss him, and (b) Kissing someone so that you can get a free trip is perilously close to full-on hooking, and I have to confess that while I did not fancy myself a particularly good person, I never thought my first real sexual action would be prostitutional.</p><p>But then again, he hadn\u2019t tried to kiss me; he\u2019d only touched my face, which is not even sexual. It was not a move designed to elicit arousal, but it was certainly a designed move, because Augustus Waters was no improviser. So what had he been trying to convey? And why hadn\u2019t I wanted to accept it?</p> <p>At some point, I realized I was Kaitlyning the encounter, so I decided to text Kaitlyn and ask for some advice. She called immediately.</p><p>\u201cI have a boy problem,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDELICIOUS,\u201d Kaitlyn responded. I told her all about it, complete with the awkward face touching, leaving out only Amsterdam and Augustus\u2019s name. \u201cYou\u2019re sure he\u2019s hot?\u201d she asked when I was finished.</p><p>\u201cPretty sure,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAthletic?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, he used to play basketball for North Central.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. How\u2019d you meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis hideous Support Group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Kaitlyn said. \u201cOut of curiosity, how many legs does this guy have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, 1.4,\u201d I said, smiling. Basketball players were famous in Indiana, and although Kaitlyn didn\u2019t go to North Central, her social connectivity was endless.</p><p>\u201cAugustus Waters,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cUm, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God. I\u2019ve seen him at parties. The things I would do to that boy. I mean, not now that I know you\u2019re interested in him. But, oh, sweet holy Lord, I would ride that one-legged pony all the way around the corral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaitlyn,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Do you think you\u2019d have to be on top?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaitlyn,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat were we talking about. Right, you and Augustus Waters. Maybe . . . are you gay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so? I mean, I definitely like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he have ugly hands? Sometimes beautiful people have ugly hands.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, he has kind of amazing hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I said.</p><p>After a second, Kaitlyn said, \u201cRemember Derek? He broke up with me last week because he\u2019d decided there was something fundamentally incompatible about us deep down and that we\u2019d only get hurt more if we played it out. He called it preemptive dumping. So maybe you have this premonition that there is something fundamentally incompatible and you\u2019re preempting the preemption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just thinking out loud here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about Derek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I got over it, darling. It took me a sleeve of Girl Scout Thin Mints and forty minutes to get over that boy.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cWell, thanks, Kaitlyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the event you do hook up with him, I expect lascivious details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course,\u201d I said, and then Kaitlyn made a kissy sound into the phone and I said, \u201cBye,\u201d and she hung up.</p><p>I realized while listening to Kaitlyn that I didn\u2019t have a premonition of hurting him. I had a postmonition.</p><p>I pulled out my laptop and looked up Caroline Mathers. The physical similarities were striking: same steroidally round face, same nose, same approximate overall body shape. But her eyes were dark brown (mine are green) and her complexion was much darker\u2014Italian or something.</p><p>Thousands of people\u2014literally thousands\u2014had left condolence messages for her. It was an endless scroll of people who missed her, so many that it took me an hour of clicking to get past the I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dead wall posts to the I\u2019m praying for you wall posts. She\u2019d died a year ago of brain cancer. I was able to click through to some of her pictures. Augustus was in a bunch of the earlier ones: pointing with a thumbs-up to the jagged scar across her bald skull; arm in arm at Memorial Hospital\u2019s playground, with their backs facing the camera; kissing while Caroline held the camera out, so you could only see their noses and closed eyes.</p><p>The most recent pictures were all of her before, when she was healthy, uploaded postmortem by friends: a beautiful girl, wide-hipped and curvy, with long, straight deadblack hair falling over her face. My healthy self looked very little like her healthy self. But our cancer selves might\u2019ve been sisters. No wonder he\u2019d stared at me the first time he saw me.</p><p>I kept clicking back to this one wall post, written two months ago, nine months after she died, by one of her friends. We all miss you so much. It just never ends. It feels like we were all wounded in your battle, Caroline. I miss you. I love you.</p><p>After a while, Mom and Dad announced it was time for dinner. I shut down the computer and got up, but I couldn\u2019t get the wall post out of my mind, and for some reason it made me nervous and unhungry.</p><p>I kept thinking about my shoulder, which hurt, and also I still had the headache, but maybe only because I\u2019d been thinking about a girl who\u2019d died of brain cancer. I kept telling myself to compartmentalize, to be here now at the circular table (arguably too large in diameter for three people and definitely too large for two) with this soggy broccoli and a black-bean burger that all the ketchup in the world could not adequately moisten. I told myself that imagining a met in my brain or my shoulder would not affect the invisible reality going on inside of me, and that therefore all such thoughts were wasted moments in a life composed of a definitionally finite set of such moments. I even tried to tell myself to live my best life today.</p><p>For the longest time I couldn\u2019t figure out why something a stranger had written on the Internet to a different (and deceased) stranger was bothering me so much and making me worry that there was something inside my brain\u2014which really did hurt, although I knew from years of experience that pain is a blunt and nonspecific diagnostic instrument.</p><p>Because there had not been an earthquake in Papua New Guinea that day, my parents were all hyperfocused on me, and so I could not hide this flash flood of anxiety.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d asked Mom as I ate.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I said. I took a bite of burger. Swallowed. Tried to say something that a normal person whose brain was not drowning in panic would say. \u201cIs there broccoli in the burgers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d Dad said. \u201cPretty exciting that you might go to Amsterdam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. I tried not to think about the word wounded, which of course is a way of thinking about it.</p><p>\u201cHazel,\u201d Mom said. \u201cWhere are you right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinking, I guess,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cTwitterpated,\u201d my dad said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI am not a bunny, and I am not in love with Gus Waters or anyone,\u201d I answered, way too defensively. Wounded. Like Caroline Mathers had been a bomb and when she blew up everyone around her was left with embedded shrapnel.</p><p>Dad asked me if I was working on anything for school. \u201cI\u2019ve got some very advanced Algebra homework,\u201d I told him. \u201cSo advanced that I couldn\u2019t possibly explain it to a layperson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s your friend Isaac?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlind,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being very teenagery today,\u201d Mom said. She seemed annoyed about it.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this what you wanted, Mom? For me to be teenagery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not necessarily this kinda teenagery, but of course your father and I are excited to see you become a young woman, making friends, going on dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going on dates,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go on dates with anyone. It\u2019s a terrible idea and a huge waste of time and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney,\u201d my mom said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m like. Like. I\u2019m like a grenade, Mom. I\u2019m a grenade and at some point I\u2019m going to blow up and I would like to minimize the casualties, okay?\u201d</p><p>My dad tilted his head a little to the side, like a scolded puppy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a grenade,\u201d I said again. \u201cI just want to stay away from people and read books and think and be with you guys because there\u2019s nothing I can do about hurting you; you\u2019re too invested, so just please let me do that, okay? I\u2019m not depressed. I don\u2019t need to get out more. And I can\u2019t be a regular teenager, because I\u2019m a grenade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHazel,\u201d Dad said, and then choked up. He cried a lot, my dad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go to my room and read for a while, okay? I\u2019m fine. I really am fine; I just want to go read for a while.\u201d</p><p>I started out trying to read this novel I\u2019d been assigned, but we lived in a tragically thin-walled home, so I could hear much of the whispered conversation that ensued. My dad saying, \u201cIt kills me,\u201d and my mom saying, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what she doesn\u2019t need to hear,\u201d and my dad saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry but\u2014\u201d and my mom saying, \u201cAre you not grateful?\u201d And him saying, \u201cGod, of course I\u2019m grateful.\u201d I kept trying to get into this story but I couldn\u2019t stop hearing them.</p><p>So I turned on my computer to listen to some music, and with Augustus\u2019s favorite band, The Hectic Glow, as my sound track, I went back to Caroline Mathers\u2019s tribute pages, reading about how heroic her fight was, and how much she was missed, and how she was in a better place, and how she would live forever in their memories, and how everyone who knew her\u2014everyone\u2014was laid low by her leaving.</p><p>Maybe I was supposed to hate Caroline Mathers or something because she\u2019d been with Augustus, but I didn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t see her very clearly amid all the tributes, but there didn\u2019t seem to be much to hate\u2014she seemed to be mostly a professional sick person, like me, which made me worry that when I died they\u2019d have nothing to say about me except that I fought heroically, as if the only thing I\u2019d ever done was Have Cancer.</p><p>Anyway, eventually I started reading Caroline Mathers\u2019s little notes, which were mostly actually written by her parents, because I guess her brain cancer was of the variety that makes you not you before it makes you not alive.</p><p>So it was all like, Caroline continues to have behavioral problems. She\u2019s struggling a lot with anger and frustration over not being able to speak (we are frustrated about these things, too, of course, but we have more socially acceptable ways of dealing with our anger). Gus has taken to calling Caroline HULK SMASH, which resonates with the doctors. There\u2019s nothing easy about this for any of us, but you take your humor where you can get it. Hoping to go home on Thursday. We\u2019ll let you know . . .</p><p>She didn\u2019t go home on Thursday, needless to say.</p><p>So of course I tensed up when he touched me. To be with him was to hurt him\u2014inevitably. And that\u2019s what I\u2019d felt as he reached for me: I\u2019d felt as though I were committing an act of violence against him, because I was.</p><p>I decided to text him. I wanted to avoid a whole conversation about it.</p><p>Hi, so okay, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll understand this but I can\u2019t kiss you or anything. Not that you\u2019d necessarily want to, but I can\u2019t.</p><p>When I try to look at you like that, all I see is what I\u2019m going to put you through. Maybe that doesn\u2019t make sense to you.</p><p>Anyway, sorry.</p><p>He responded a few minutes later.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>I wrote back.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>He responded:</p><p>Oh, my God, stop flirting with me!</p><p>I just said:</p><p>Okay.</p><p>My phone buzzed moments later.</p><p>I was kidding, Hazel Grace. I understand. (But we both know that okay is a very flirty word. Okay is BURSTING with sensuality.)</p><p>I was very tempted to respond Okay again, but I pictured him at my funeral, and that helped me text properly.</p><p>Sorry.</p><p>I tried to go to sleep with my headphones still on, but then after a while my mom and dad came in, and my mom grabbed Bluie from the shelf and hugged him to her stomach, and my dad sat down in my desk chair, and without crying he said, \u201cYou are not a grenade, not to us. Thinking about you dying makes us sad, Hazel, but you are not a grenade. You are amazing. You can\u2019t know, sweetie, because you\u2019ve never had a baby become a brilliant young reader with a side interest in horrible television shows, but the joy you bring us is so much greater than the sadness we feel about your illness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d my dad said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t bullshit you about this. If you were more trouble than you\u2019re worth, we\u2019d just toss you out on the streets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sentimental people,\u201d Mom added, deadpan. \u201cWe\u2019d leave you at an orphanage with a note pinned to your pajamas.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go to Support Group,\u201d Mom added. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything. Except go to school.\u201d She handed me the bear.</p><p>\u201cI think Bluie can sleep on the shelf tonight,\u201d I said. \u201cLet me remind you that I am more than thirty-three half years old.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKeep him tonight,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lonely,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, Mom,\u201d I said. But I took stupid Bluie and kind of cuddled with him as I fell asleep.</p> <p>I still had one arm draped over Bluie, in fact, when I awoke just after four in the morning with an apocalyptic pain fingering out from the unreachable center of my head.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>I screamed to wake up my parents, and they burst into the room, but there was nothing they could do to dim the supernovae exploding inside my brain, an endless chain of intracranial firecrackers that made me think that I was once and for all going, and I told myself\u2014as I\u2019ve told myself before\u2014that the body shuts down when the pain gets too bad, that consciousness is temporary, that this will pass. But just like always, I didn\u2019t slip away. I was left on the shore with the waves washing over me, unable to drown.</p><p>Dad drove, talking on the phone with the hospital, while I lay in the back with my head in Mom\u2019s lap. There was nothing to do: Screaming made it worse. All stimuli made it worse, actually.</p><p>The only solution was to try to unmake the world, to make it black and silent and uninhabited again, to return to the moment before the Big Bang, in the beginning when there was the Word, and to live in that vacuous uncreated space alone with the Word.</p> <p>People talk about the courage of cancer patients, and I do not deny that courage. I had been poked and stabbed and poisoned for years, and still I trod on. But make no mistake: In that moment, I would have been very, very happy to die.</p><p>I woke up in the ICU. I could tell I was in the ICU because I didn\u2019t have my own room, and because there was so much beeping, and because I was alone: They don\u2019t let your family stay with you 24/7 in the ICU at Children\u2019s because it\u2019s an infection risk. There was wailing down the hall. Somebody\u2019s kid had died. I was alone. I hit the red call button.</p><p>A nurse came in seconds later. \u201cHi,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHello, Hazel. I\u2019m Alison, your nurse,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHi, Alison My Nurse,\u201d I said.</p><p>Whereupon I started to feel pretty tired again. But I woke up a bit when my parents came in, crying and kissing my face repeatedly, and I reached up for them and tried to squeeze, but my everything hurt when I squeezed, and Mom and Dad told me that I did not have a brain tumor, but that my headache was caused by poor oxygenation, which was caused by my lungs swimming in fluid, a liter and a half (!!!!) of which had been successfully drained from my chest, which was why I might feel a slight discomfort in my side, where there was, hey look at that, a tube that went from my chest into a plastic bladder half full of liquid that for all the world resembled my dad\u2019s favorite amber ale. Mom told me I was going to go home, that I really was, that I would just have to get this drained every now and again and get back on the BiPAP, this nighttime machine that forces air in and out of my crap lungs. But I\u2019d had a total body PET scan on the first night in the hospital, they told me, and the news was good: no tumor growth. No new tumors. My shoulder pain had been lack-of-oxygen pain. Heart-working-too-hard pain.</p> <p>\u201cDr. Maria said this morning that she remains optimistic,\u201d Dad said. I liked Dr. Maria, and she didn\u2019t bullshit you, so that felt good to hear.</p><p>\u201cThis is just a thing, Hazel,\u201d my mom said. \u201cIt\u2019s a thing we can live with.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and then Alison My Nurse kind of politely made them leave. She asked me if I wanted some ice chips, and I nodded, and then she sat at the bed with me and spooned them into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve been gone a couple days,\u201d Alison said. \u201cHmm, what\u2019d you miss . . . A celebrity did drugs. Politicians disagreed. A different celebrity wore a bikini that revealed a bodily imperfection. A team won a sporting event, but another team lost.\u201d I smiled. \u201cYou can\u2019t go disappearing on everybody like this, Hazel. You miss too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d I asked, nodding toward the white Styrofoam cup in her hand.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019m a rebel.\u201d She gave me another plastic spoonful of crushed ice. I mumbled a thank-you. Praise God for good nurses. \u201cGetting tired?\u201d she asked. I nodded. \u201cSleep for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll try to run interference and give you a couple hours before somebody comes in to check vitals and the like.\u201d I said Thanks again. You say thanks a lot in a hospital. I tried to settle into the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna ask about your boyfriend?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have one,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s a kid who has hardly left the waiting room since you got here,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t seen me like this, has he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Family only.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and sank into an aqueous sleep.</p><p>It would take me six days to get home, six undays of staring at acoustic ceiling tile and watching television and sleeping and pain and wishing for time to pass. I did not see Augustus or anyone other than my parents. My hair looked like a bird\u2019s nest; my shuffling gait like a dementia patient\u2019s. I felt a little better each day, though: Each sleep ended to reveal a person who seemed a bit more like me. Sleep fights cancer, Regular Dr. Jim said for the thousandth time as he hovered over me one morning surrounded by a coterie of medical students.</p><p>\u201cThen I am a cancer-fighting machine,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cThat you are, Hazel. Keep resting, and hopefully we\u2019ll get you home soon.\u201d</p><p>On Tuesday, they told me I\u2019d go home on Wednesday. On Wednesday, two minimally supervised medical students removed my chest tube, which felt like getting stabbed in reverse and generally didn\u2019t go very well, so they decided I\u2019d have to stay until Thursday. I was beginning to think that I was the subject of some existentialist experiment in permanently delayed gratification when Dr. Maria showed up on Friday morning, sniffed around me for a minute, and told me I was good to go.</p><p>So Mom opened her oversize purse to reveal that she\u2019d had my Go Home Clothes with her all along. A nurse came in and took out my IV. I felt untethered even though I still had the oxygen tank to carry around with me. I went into the bathroom, took my first shower in a week, got dressed, and when I got out, I was so tired I had to lie down and get my breath. Mom asked, \u201cDo you want to see Augustus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I said after a minute. I stood up and shuffled over to one of the molded plastic chairs against the wall, tucking my tank beneath the chair. It wore me out.</p><p>Dad came back with Augustus a few minutes later. His hair was messy, sweeping down over his forehead. He lit up with a real Augustus Waters Goofy Smile when he saw me, and I couldn\u2019t help but smile back. He sat down in the blue faux-leather recliner next to my chair. He leaned in toward me, seemingly incapable of stifling the smile.</p><p>Mom and Dad left us alone, which felt awkward. I worked hard to meet his eyes, even though they were the kind of pretty that\u2019s hard to look at. \u201cI missed you,\u201d Augustus said.</p><p>My voice was smaller than I wanted it to be. \u201cThanks for not trying to see me when I looked like hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be fair, you still look pretty bad.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI missed you, too. I just don\u2019t want you to see . . . all this. I just want, like . . . It doesn\u2019t matter. You don\u2019t always get what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019d always thought the world was a wish-granting factory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurns out that is not the case,\u201d I said. He was so beautiful. He reached for my hand but I shook my head. \u201cNo,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cIf we\u2019re gonna hang out, it has to be, like, not that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I have good news and bad news on the wish-granting front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThe bad news is that we obviously can\u2019t go to Amsterdam until you\u2019re better. The Genies will, however, work their famous magic when you\u2019re well enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the good news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the good news is that while you were sleeping, Peter Van Houten shared a bit more of his brilliant brain with us.\u201d</p><p>He reached for my hand again, but this time to slip into it a heavily folded sheet of stationery on the letterhead of Peter Van Houten, Novelist Emeritus.</p><p>I didn\u2019t read it until I got home, situated in my own huge and empty bed with no chance of medical interruption. It took me forever to decode Van Houten\u2019s sloped, scratchy script.</p><p>Dear Mr. Waters,</p><p>I am in receipt of your electronic mail dated the 14th of April and duly impressed by the Shakespearean complexity of your tragedy. Everyone in this tale has a rock-solid hamartia: hers, that she is so sick; yours, that you are so well. Were she better or you sicker, then the stars would not be so terribly crossed, but it is the nature of stars to cross, and never was Shakespeare more wrong than when he had Cassius note, \u201cThe fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars / But in ourselves.\u201d Easy enough to say when you\u2019re a Roman nobleman (or Shakespeare!), but there is no shortage of fault to be found amid our stars.</p><p>While we\u2019re on the topic of old Will\u2019s insufficiencies, your writing about young Hazel reminds me of the Bard\u2019s Fifty-fifth sonnet, which of course begins, \u201cNot marble, nor the gilded monuments / Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme; / But you shall shine more bright in these contents / Than unswept stone, besmear\u2019d with sluttish time.\u201d (Off topic, but: What a slut time is. She screws everybody.) It\u2019s a fine poem but a deceitful one: We do indeed remember Shakespeare\u2019s powerful rhyme, but what do we remember about the person it commemorates? Nothing. We\u2019re pretty sure he was male; everything else is guesswork. Shakespeare told us precious little of the man whom he entombed in his linguistic sarcophagus. (Witness also that when we talk about literature, we do so in the present tense. When we speak of the dead, we are not so kind.) You do not immortalize the lost by writing about them. Language buries, but does not resurrect. (Full disclosure: I am not the first to make this observation. cf, the MacLeish poem \u201cNot Marble, Nor the Gilded Monuments,\u201d which contains the heroic line \u201cI shall say you will die and none will remember you.\u201d)</p><p>I digress, but here\u2019s the rub: The dead are visible only in the terrible lidless eye of memory. The living, thank heaven, retain the ability to surprise and to disappoint. Your Hazel is alive, Waters, and you mustn\u2019t impose your will upon another\u2019s decision, particularly a decision arrived at thoughtfully. She wishes to spare you pain, and you should let her. You may not find young Hazel\u2019s logic persuasive, but I have trod through this vale of tears longer than you, and from where I\u2019m sitting, she\u2019s not the lunatic.</p><p>Yours truly,</p><p>Peter Van Houten</p><p>It was really written by him. I licked my finger and dabbed the paper and the ink bled a little, so I knew it was really real.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I said. I did not say it loudly, but I didn\u2019t have to. She was always waiting. She peeked her head around the door.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we call Dr. Maria and ask if international travel would kill me?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>We had a big Cancer Team Meeting a couple days later. Every so often, a bunch of doctors and social workers and physical therapists and whoever else got together around a big table in a conference room and discussed my situation. (Not the Augustus Waters situation or the Amsterdam situation. The cancer situation.)</p><p>Dr. Maria led the meeting. She hugged me when I got there. She was a hugger.</p><p>I felt a little better, I guess. Sleeping with the BiPAP all night made my lungs feel almost normal, although, then again, I did not really remember lung normality.</p><p>Everyone got there and made a big show of turning off their pagers and everything so it would be all about me, and then Dr. Maria said, \u201cSo the great news is that Phalanxifor continues to control your tumor growth, but obviously we\u2019re still seeing serious problems with fluid accumulation. So the question is, how should we proceed?\u201d</p><p>And then she just looked at me, like she was waiting for an answer. \u201cUm,\u201d I said, \u201cI feel like I am not the most qualified person in the room to answer that question?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cRight, I was waiting for Dr. Simons. Dr. Simons?\u201d He was another cancer doctor of some kind.</p><p>\u201cWell, we know from other patients that most tumors eventually evolve a way to grow in spite of Phalanxifor, but if that were the case, we\u2019d see tumor growth on the scans, which we don\u2019t see. So it\u2019s not that yet.\u201d</p><p>Yet, I thought.</p><p>Dr. Simons tapped at the table with his forefinger. \u201cThe thought around here is that it\u2019s possible the Phalanxifor is worsening the edema, but we\u2019d face far more serious problems if we discontinued its use.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Maria added, \u201cWe don\u2019t really understand the long-term effects of Phalanxifor. Very few people have been on it as long as you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re gonna do nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to stay the course,\u201d Dr. Maria said, \u201cbut we\u2019ll need to do more to keep that edema from building up.\u201d I felt kind of sick for some reason, like I was going to throw up. I hated Cancer Team Meetings in general, but I hated this one in particular. \u201cYour cancer is not going away, Hazel. But we\u2019ve seen people live with your level of tumor penetration for a long time.\u201d (I did not ask what constituted a long time. I\u2019d made that mistake before.) \u201cI know that coming out of the ICU, it doesn\u2019t feel this way, but this fluid is, at least for the time being, manageable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I just get like a lung transplant or something?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Dr. Maria\u2019s lips shrank into her mouth. \u201cYou would not be considered a strong candidate for a transplant, unfortunately,\u201d she said. I understood: No use wasting good lungs on a hopeless case. I nodded, trying not to look like that comment hurt me. My dad started crying a little. I didn\u2019t look over at him, but no one said anything for a long time, so his hiccuping cry was the only sound in the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hated hurting him. Most of the time, I could forget about it, but the inexorable truth is this: They might be glad to have me around, but I was the alpha and the omega of my parents\u2019 suffering.</p><p>Just before the Miracle, when I was in the ICU and it looked like I was going to die and Mom was telling me it was okay to let go, and I was trying to let go but my lungs kept searching for air, Mom sobbed something into Dad\u2019s chest that I wish I hadn\u2019t heard, and that I hope she never finds out that I did hear. She said, \u201cI won\u2019t be a mom anymore.\u201d It gutted me pretty badly.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about that during the whole Cancer Team Meeting. I couldn\u2019t get it out of my head, how she sounded when she said that, like she would never be okay again, which probably she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Anyway, eventually we decided to keep things the same only with more frequent fluid drainings. At the end, I asked if I could travel to Amsterdam, and Dr. Simons actually and literally laughed, but then Dr. Maria said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d And Simons said, dubiously, \u201cWhy not?\u201d And Dr. Maria said, \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t see why not. They\u2019ve got oxygen on the planes, after all.\u201d Dr. Simons said, \u201cAre they just going to gate-check a BiPAP?\u201d And Maria said, \u201cYeah, or have one waiting for her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlacing a patient\u2014one of the most promising Phalanxifor survivors, no less\u2014an eight-hour flight from the only physicians intimately familiar with her case? That\u2019s a recipe for disaster.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Maria shrugged. \u201cIt would increase some risks,\u201d she acknowledged, but then turned to me and said, \u201cBut it\u2019s your life.\u201d</p><p>Except not really. On the car ride home, my parents agreed: I would not be going to Amsterdam unless and until there was medical agreement that it would be safe.</p><p>Augustus called that night after dinner. I was already in bed\u2014after dinner had become my bedtime for the moment\u2014propped up with a gajillion pillows and also Bluie, with my computer on my lap.</p><p>I picked up, saying, \u201cBad news,\u201d and he said, \u201cShit, what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t go to Amsterdam. One of my doctors thinks it\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a second. \u201cGod,\u201d he said. \u201cI should\u2019ve just paid for it myself. Should\u2019ve just taken you straight from the Funky Bones to Amsterdam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then I would\u2019ve had a probably fatal episode of deoxygenation in Amsterdam, and my body would have been shipped home in the cargo hold of an airplane,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cBut before that, my grand romantic gesture would have totally gotten me laid.\u201d</p><p>I laughed pretty hard, hard enough that I felt where the chest tube had been.</p><p>\u201cYou laugh because it\u2019s true,\u201d he said.</p> <p>I laughed again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d I said, and then after a moment added, \u201calthough you never know.\u201d</p><p>He moaned in misery. \u201cI\u2019m gonna die a virgin,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a virgin?\u201d I asked, surprised.</p><p>\u201cHazel Grace,\u201d he said, \u201cdo you have a pen and a piece of paper?\u201d I said I did. \u201cOkay, please draw a circle.\u201d I did. \u201cNow draw a smaller circle within that circle.\u201d I did. \u201cThe larger circle is virgins. The smaller circle is seventeen-year-old guys with one leg.\u201d</p><p>I laughed again, and told him that having most of your social engagements occur at a children\u2019s hospital also did not encourage promiscuity, and then we talked about Peter Van Houten\u2019s amazingly brilliant comment about the sluttiness of time, and even though I was in bed and he was in his basement, it really felt like we were back in that uncreated third space, which was a place I really liked visiting with him.</p><p>Then I got off the phone and my mom and dad came into my room, and even though it was really not big enough for all three of us, they lay on either side of the bed with me and we all watched ANTM on the little TV in my room. This girl I didn\u2019t like, Selena, got kicked off, which made me really happy for some reason. Then Mom hooked me up to the BiPAP and tucked me in, and Dad kissed me on the forehead, the kiss all stubble, and then I closed my eyes.</p> <p>The BiPAP essentially took control of my breathing away from me, which was intensely annoying, but the great thing about it was that it made all this noise, rumbling with each inhalation and whirring as I exhaled. I kept thinking that it sounded like a dragon breathing in time with me, like I had this pet dragon who was cuddled up next to me and cared enough about me to time his breaths to mine. I was thinking about that as I sank into sleep.</p><p>I got up late the next morning. I watched TV in bed and checked my email and then after a while started crafting an email to Peter Van Houten about how I couldn\u2019t come to Amsterdam but I swore upon the life of my mother that I would never share any information about the characters with anyone, that I didn\u2019t even want to share it, because I was a terribly selfish person, and could he please just tell me if the Dutch Tulip Man is for real and if Anna\u2019s mom marries him and also about Sisyphus the Hamster.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t send it. It was too pathetic even for me.</p><p>Around three, when I figured Augustus would be home from school, I went into the backyard and called him. As the phone rang, I sat down on the grass, which was all overgrown and dandeliony. That swing set was still back there, weeds growing out of the little ditch I\u2019d created from kicking myself higher as a little kid. I remembered Dad bringing home the kit from Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and building it in the backyard with a neighbor. He\u2019d insisted on swinging on it first to test it, and the thing damn near broke.</p><p>The sky was gray and low and full of rain but not yet raining. I hung up when I got Augustus\u2019s voice mail and then put the phone down in the dirt beside me and kept looking at the swing set, thinking that I would give up all the sick days I had left for a few healthy ones. I tried to tell myself that it could be worse, that the world was not a wish-granting factory, that I was living with cancer not dying of it, that I mustn\u2019t let it kill me before it kills me, and then I just started muttering stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid over and over again until the sound unhinged from its meaning. I was still saying it when he called back.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHazel Grace,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said again.</p><p>\u201cAre you crying, Hazel Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m just\u2014I want to go to Amsterdam, and I want him to tell me what happens after the book is over, and I just don\u2019t want my particular life, and also the sky is depressing me, and there is this old swing set out here that my dad made for me when I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must see this old swing set of tears immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be over in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>I stayed in the backyard because Mom was always really smothery and concerned when I was crying, because I did not cry often, and I knew she\u2019d want to talk and discuss whether I shouldn\u2019t consider adjusting my medication, and the thought of that whole conversation made me want to throw up.</p><p>It\u2019s not like I had some utterly poignant, well-lit memory of a healthy father pushing a healthy child and the child saying higher higher higher or some other metaphorically resonant moment. The swing set was just sitting there, abandoned, the two little swings hanging still and sad from a grayed plank of wood, the outline of the seats like a kid\u2019s drawing of a smile.</p><p>Behind me, I heard the sliding-glass door open. I turned around. It was Augustus, wearing khaki pants and a short-sleeve plaid button-down. I wiped my face with my sleeve and smiled. \u201cHi,\u201d I said.</p><p>It took him a second to sit down on the ground next to me, and he grimaced as he landed rather ungracefully on his ass. \u201cHi,\u201d he said finally. I looked over at him. He was looking past me, into the backyard. \u201cI see your point,\u201d he said as he put an arm around my shoulder. \u201cThat is one sad goddamned swing set.\u201d</p><p>I nudged my head into his shoulder. \u201cThanks for offering to come over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realize that trying to keep your distance from me will not lessen my affection for you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI guess?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAll efforts to save me from you will fail,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why would you even like me? Haven\u2019t you put yourself through enough of this?\u201d I asked, thinking of Caroline Mathers.</p><p>Gus didn\u2019t answer. He just held on to me, his fingers strong against my left arm. \u201cWe gotta do something about this frigging swing set,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s ninety percent of the problem.\u201d</p><p>Once I\u2019d recovered, we went inside and sat down on the couch right next to each other, the laptop half on his (fake) knee and half on mine. \u201cHot,\u201d I said of the laptop\u2019s base.</p><p>\u201cIs it now?\u201d He smiled. Gus loaded this giveaway site called Free No Catch and together we wrote an ad.</p><p>\u201cHeadline?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Swing Set Needs Home,\u2019\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Desperately Lonely Swing Set Needs Loving Home,\u2019\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Lonely, Vaguely Pedophilic Swing Set Seeks the Butts of Children,\u2019\u201d I said.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I like you. Do you realize how rare it is to come across a hot girl who creates an adjectival version of the word pedophile? You are so busy being you that you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath through my nose. There was never enough air in the world, but the shortage was particularly acute in that moment.</p><p>We wrote the ad together, editing each other as we went. In the end, we settled upon this:</p><p>Desperately Lonely Swing Set Needs Loving Home</p><p>One swing set, well worn but structurally sound, seeks new home. Make memories with your kid or kids so that someday he or she or they will look into the backyard and feel the ache of sentimentality as desperately as I did this afternoon. It\u2019s all fragile and fleeting, dear reader, but with this swing set, your child(ren) will be introduced to the ups and downs of human life gently and safely, and may also learn the most important lesson of all: No matter how hard you kick, no matter how high you get, you can\u2019t go all the way around.</p><p>Swing set currently resides near 83rd and Spring Mill.</p><p>After that, we turned on the TV for a little while, but we couldn\u2019t find anything to watch, so I grabbed An Imperial Affliction off the bedside table and brought it back into the living room and Augustus Waters read to me while Mom, making lunch, listened in.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Mother\u2019s glass eye turned inward,\u2019\u201d Augustus began. As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.</p><p>When I checked my email an hour later, I learned that we had plenty of swing-set suitors to choose from. In the end, we picked a guy named Daniel Alvarez who\u2019d included a picture of his three kids playing video games with the subject line I just want them to go outside. I emailed him back and told him to pick it up at his leisure.</p><p>Augustus asked if I wanted to go with him to Support Group, but I was really tired from my busy day of Having Cancer, so I passed. We were sitting there on the couch together, and he pushed himself up to go but then fell back down onto the couch and sneaked a kiss onto my cheek.</p><p>\u201cAugustus!\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cFriendly,\u201d he said. He pushed himself up again and really stood this time, then took two steps over to my mom and said, \u201cAlways a pleasure to see you,\u201d and my mom opened her arms to hug him, whereupon Augustus leaned in and kissed my mom on the cheek. He turned back to me. \u201cSee?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I went to bed right after dinner, the BiPAP drowning out the world beyond my room.</p><p>I never saw the swing set again.</p><p>I slept for a long time, ten hours, possibly because of the slow recovery and possibly because sleep fights cancer and possibly because I was a teenager with no particular wake-up time. I wasn\u2019t strong enough yet to go back to classes at MCC. When I finally felt like getting up, I removed the BiPAP snout from my nose, put my oxygen nubbins in, turned them on, and then grabbed my laptop from beneath my bed, where I\u2019d stashed it the night before.</p><p>I had an email from Lidewij Vliegenthart.</p><p>Dear Hazel,</p><p>I have received word via the Genies that you will be visiting us with Augustus Waters and your mother beginning on 4th of May. Only a week away! Peter and I are delighted and cannot wait to make your acquaintance. Your hotel, the Filosoof, is just one street away from Peter\u2019s home. Perhaps we should give you one day for the jet lag, yes? So if convenient, we will meet you at Peter\u2019s home on the morning of 5th May at perhaps ten o\u2019clock for a cup of coffee and for him to answer questions you have about his book. And then perhaps afterward we can tour a museum or the Anne Frank House?</p><p>With all best wishes,</p><p>Lidewij Vliegenthart</p><p>Executive Assistant to Mr. Peter Van Houten, author of An Imperial Affliction</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I said.

Again, louder, \u201cMOM!\u201d</p><p>She ran in wearing a threadbare pink towel under her armpits, dripping, vaguely panicked. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.

I arrived early, enough time for perennially strong appendiceal cancer survivor Lida to bring me up-to-date on everyone as I ate a grocery-store chocolate chip cookie while leaning against the dessert table.</p> <p>Twelve-year-old leukemic Michael had passed away. He\u2019d fought hard, Lida told me, as if there were another way to fight. Everyone else was still around. Ken was NEC after radiation. Lucas had relapsed, and she said it with a sad smile and a little shrug, the way you might say an alcoholic had relapsed.</p><p>A cute, chubby girl walked over to the table and said hi to Lida, then introduced herself to me as Susan. I didn\u2019t know what was wrong with her, but she had a scar extending from the side of her nose down her lip and across her cheek. She had put makeup over the scar, which only served to emphasize it. I was feeling a little out of breath from all the standing, so I said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna go sit,\u201d and then the elevator opened, revealing Isaac and his mom. He wore sunglasses and clung to his mom\u2019s arm with one hand, a cane in the other.</p><p>\u201cSupport Group Hazel not Monica,\u201d I said when he got close enough, and he smiled and said, \u201cHey, Hazel. How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ve gotten really hot since you went blind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet,\u201d he said. His mom led him to a chair, kissed the top of his head, and shuffled back toward the elevator. He felt around beneath him and then sat. I sat down in the chair next to him. \u201cSo how\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Glad to be home, I guess. Gus told me you were in the ICU?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSucks,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a lot better now,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m going to Amsterdam tomorrow with Gus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m pretty well up-to-date on your life, because Gus never. Talks. About. Anything. Else.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. Patrick cleared his throat and said, \u201cIf we could all take a seat?\u201d He caught my eye. \u201cHazel!\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you!\u201d</p><p>Everyone sat and Patrick began his retelling of his ball-lessness, and I fell into the routine of Support Group: communicating through sighs with Isaac, feeling sorry for everyone in the room and also everyone outside of it, zoning out of the conversation to focus on my breathlessness and the aching. The world went on, as it does, without my full participation, and I only woke up from the reverie when someone said my name.</p><p>It was Lida the Strong. Lida in remission. Blond, healthy, stout Lida, who swam on her high school swim team. Lida, missing only her appendix, saying my name, saying, \u201cHazel is such an inspiration to me; she really is. She just keeps fighting the battle, waking up every morning and going to war without complaint. She\u2019s so strong. She\u2019s so much stronger than I am. I just wish I had her strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHazel?\u201d Patrick asked. \u201cHow does that make you feel?\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged and looked over at Lida. \u201cI\u2019ll give you my strength if I can have your remission.\u201d I felt guilty as soon as I said it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what Lida meant,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cI think she . . .\u201d But I\u2019d stopped listening.</p><p>After the prayers for the living and the endless litany of the dead (with Michael tacked on to the end), we held hands and said, \u201cLiving our best life today!\u201d</p><p>Lida immediately rushed up to me full of apology and explanation, and I said, \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s really fine,\u201d waving her off, and I said to Isaac, \u201cCare to accompany me upstairs?\u201d</p><p>He took my arm, and I walked with him to the elevator, grateful to have an excuse to avoid the stairs. I\u2019d almost made it all the way to the elevator when I saw his mom standing in a corner of the Literal Heart. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she said to Isaac, and he switched from my arm to hers before asking, \u201cYou want to come over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said. I felt bad for him. Even though I hated the sympathy people felt toward me, I couldn\u2019t help but feel it toward him.</p><p>Isaac lived in a small ranch house in Meridian Hills next to this fancy private school. We sat down in the living room while his mom went off to the kitchen to make dinner, and then he asked if I wanted to play a game.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said. So he asked for the remote. I gave it to him, and he turned on the TV and then a computer attached to it. The TV screen stayed black, but after a few seconds a deep voice spoke from it.</p><p>\u201cDeception,\u201d the voice said. \u201cOne player or two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo,\u201d Isaac said. \u201cPause.\u201d He turned to me. \u201cI play this game with Gus all the time, but it\u2019s infuriating because he is a completely suicidal video-game player. He\u2019s, like, way too aggressive about saving civilians and whatnot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, remembering the night of the broken trophies.</p><p>\u201cUnpause,\u201d Isaac said.</p><p>\u201cPlayer one, identify yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is player one\u2019s sexy sexy voice,\u201d Isaac said.</p><p>\u201cPlayer two, identify yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be player two, I guess,\u201d I said.</p><p>Staff Sergeant Max Mayhem and Private Jasper Jacks awake in a dark, empty room approximately twelve feet square.</p><p>Isaac pointed toward the TV, like I should talk to it or something. \u201cUm,\u201d I said. \u201cIs there a light switch?\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cIs there a door?\u201d</p><p>Private Jacks locates the door. It is locked.</p><p>Isaac jumped in. \u201cThere\u2019s a key above the door frame.\u201d</p><p>Yes, there is.</p><p>\u201cMayhem opens the door.\u201d</p><p>The darkness is still complete.</p><p>\u201cTake out knife,\u201d Isaac said.</p><p>\u201cTake out knife,\u201d I added.</p><p>A kid\u2014Isaac\u2019s brother, I assume\u2014darted out from the kitchen. He was maybe ten, wiry and overenergetic, and he kind of skipped across the living room before shouting in a really good imitation of Isaac\u2019s voice, \u201cKILL MYSELF.\u201d</p><p>Sergeant Mayhem places his knife to his neck. Are you sure you\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Isaac said. \u201cPause. Graham, don\u2019t make me kick your ass.\u201d Graham laughed giddily and skipped off down a hallway.</p><p>As Mayhem and Jacks, Isaac and I felt our way forward in the cavern until we bumped into a guy whom we stabbed after getting him to tell us that we were in a Ukrainian prison cave, more than a mile beneath the ground. As we continued, sound effects\u2014a raging underground river, voices speaking in Ukrainian and accented English\u2014led you through the cave, but there was nothing to see in this game. After playing for an hour, we began to hear the cries of a desperate prisoner, pleading, \u201cGod, help me. God, help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPause,\u201d Isaac said. \u201cThis is when Gus always insists on finding the prisoner, even though that keeps you from winning the game, and the only way to actually free the prisoner is to win the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he takes video games too seriously,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit too enamored with metaphor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like him?\u201d Isaac asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course I like him. He\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t want to hook up with him?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re trying to do. You don\u2019t want to give him something he can\u2019t handle. You don\u2019t want him to Monica you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cKinda,\u201d I said. But it wasn\u2019t that. The truth was, I didn\u2019t want to Isaac him. \u201cTo be fair to Monica,\u201d I said, \u201cwhat you did to her wasn\u2019t very nice either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d I do to her?\u201d he asked, defensive.</p><p>\u201cYou know, going blind and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not my fault,\u201d Isaac said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying it was your fault. I\u2019m saying it wasn\u2019t nice.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>We could only take one suitcase. I couldn\u2019t carry one, and Mom insisted that she couldn\u2019t carry two, so we had to jockey for space in this black suitcase my parents had gotten as a wedding present a million years ago, a suitcase that was supposed to spend its life in exotic locales but ended up mostly going back and forth to Dayton, where Morris Property, Inc., had a satellite office that Dad often visited.</p><p>I argued with Mom that I should have slightly more than half of the suitcase, since without me and my cancer, we\u2019d never be going to Amsterdam in the first place. Mom countered that since she was twice as large as me and therefore required more physical fabric to preserve her modesty, she deserved at least two-thirds of the suitcase.</p><p>In the end, we both lost. So it goes.</p><p>Our flight didn\u2019t leave until noon, but Mom woke me up at five thirty, turning on the light and shouting, \u201cAMSTERDAM!\u201d She ran around all morning making sure we had international plug adapters and quadruple-checking that we had the right number of oxygen tanks to get there and that they were all full, etc., while I just rolled out of bed, put on my Travel to Amsterdam Outfit (jeans, a pink tank top, and a black cardigan in case the plane was cold).</p><p>The car was packed by six fifteen, whereupon Mom insisted that we eat breakfast with Dad, although I had a moral opposition to eating before dawn on the grounds that I was not a nineteenth-century Russian peasant fortifying myself for a day in the fields. But anyway, I tried to stomach down some eggs while Mom and Dad enjoyed these homemade versions of Egg McMuffins they liked.</p><p>\u201cWhy are breakfast foods breakfast foods?\u201d I asked them. \u201cLike, why don\u2019t we have curry for breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHazel, eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d I asked. \u201cI mean, seriously: How did scrambled eggs get stuck with breakfast exclusivity? You can put bacon on a sandwich without anyone freaking out. But the moment your sandwich has an egg, boom, it\u2019s a breakfast sandwich.\u201d</p><p>Dad answered with his mouth full. \u201cWhen you come back, we\u2019ll have breakfast for dinner. Deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to have \u2018breakfast for dinner,\u2019\u201d I answered, crossing knife and fork over my mostly full plate. \u201cI want to have scrambled eggs for dinner without this ridiculous construction that a scrambled egg\u2013inclusive meal is breakfast even when it occurs at dinnertime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta pick your battles in this world, Hazel,\u201d my mom said. \u201cBut if this is the issue you want to champion, we will stand behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite a bit behind you,\u201d my dad added, and Mom laughed.</p><p>Anyway, I knew it was stupid, but I felt kind of bad for scrambled eggs.</p><p>After they finished eating, Dad did the dishes and walked us to the car. Of course, he started crying, and he kissed my cheek with his wet stubbly face. He pressed his nose against my cheekbone and whispered, \u201cI love you. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d (For what, I wondered.)</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in a few days, okay, sweetie? I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Dad.\u201d I smiled. \u201cAnd it\u2019s only three days.\u201d</p><p>As we backed out of the driveway, I kept waving at him. He was waving back, and crying. It occurred to me that he was probably thinking he might never see me again, which he probably thought every single morning of his entire weekday life as he left for work, which probably sucked.</p><p>Mom and I drove over to Augustus\u2019s house, and when we got there, she wanted me to stay in the car to rest, but I went to the door with her anyway. As we approached the house, I could hear someone crying inside. I didn\u2019t think it was Gus at first, because it didn\u2019t sound anything like the low rumble of his speaking, but then I heard a voice that was definitely a twisted version of his say, \u201cBECAUSE IT IS MY LIFE, MOM. IT BELONGS TO ME.\u201d And quickly my mom put her arm around my shoulders and spun me back toward the car, walking quickly, and I was like, \u201cMom, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>And she said, \u201cWe can\u2019t eavesdrop, Hazel.\u201d</p><p>We got back into the car and I texted Augustus that we were outside whenever he was ready.</p><p>We stared at the house for a while. The weird thing about houses is that they almost always look like nothing is happening inside of them, even though they contain most of our lives. I wondered if that was sort of the point of architecture.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mom said after a while, \u201cwe are pretty early, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost as if I didn\u2019t have to get up at five thirty,\u201d I said. Mom reached down to the console between us, grabbed her coffee mug, and took a sip. My phone buzzed. A text from Augustus.</p><p>Just CAN\u2019T decide what to wear. Do you like me better in a polo or a button-down?</p><p>I replied:</p><p>Button-down.</p><p>Thirty seconds later, the front door opened, and a smiling Augustus appeared, a roller bag behind him. He wore a pressed sky-blue button-down tucked into his jeans. A Camel Light dangled from his lips. My mom got out to say hi to him. He took the cigarette out momentarily and spoke in the confident voice to which I was accustomed. \u201cAlways a pleasure to see you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>I watched them through the rearview mirror until Mom opened the trunk. Moments later, Augustus opened a door behind me and engaged in the complicated business of entering the backseat of a car with one leg.</p><p>\u201cDo you want shotgun?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd hello, Hazel Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said. \u201cOkay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said.</p><p>My mom got in and closed the car door. \u201cNext stop, Amsterdam,\u201d she announced.</p><p>Which was not quite true. The next stop was the airport parking lot, and then a bus took us to the terminal, and then an open-air electric car took us to the security line. The TSA guy at the front of the line was shouting about how our bags had better not contain explosives or firearms or anything liquid over three ounces, and I said to Augustus, \u201cObservation: Standing in line is a form of oppression,\u201d and he said, \u201cSeriously.\u201d</p><p>Rather than be searched by hand, I chose to walk through the metal detector without my cart or my tank or even the plastic nubbins in my nose. Walking through the X-ray machine marked the first time I\u2019d taken a step without oxygen in some months, and it felt pretty amazing to walk unencumbered like that, stepping across the Rubicon, the machine\u2019s silence acknowledging that I was, however briefly, a nonmetallicized creature.</p> <p>I felt a bodily sovereignty that I can\u2019t really describe except to say that when I was a kid I used to have a really heavy backpack that I carried everywhere with all my books in it, and if I walked around with the backpack for long enough, when I took it off I felt like I was floating.</p><p>After about ten seconds, my lungs felt like they were folding in upon themselves like flowers at dusk. I sat down on a gray bench just past the machine and tried to catch my breath, my cough a rattling drizzle, and I felt pretty miserable until I got the cannula back into place.</p><p>Even then, it hurt. The pain was always there, pulling me inside of myself, demanding to be felt. It always felt like I was waking up from the pain when something in the world outside of me suddenly required my comment or attention. Mom was looking at me, concerned. She\u2019d just said something. What had she just said? Then I remembered. She\u2019d asked what was wrong.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAmsterdam!\u201d she half shouted.</p> <p>I smiled. \u201cAmsterdam,\u201d I answered. She reached her hand down to me and pulled me up.</p><p>We got to the gate an hour before our scheduled boarding time. \u201cMrs. Lancaster, you are an impressively punctual person,\u201d Augustus said as he sat down next to me in the mostly empty gate area.</p><p>\u201cWell, it helps that I am not technically very busy,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re plenty busy,\u201d I told her, although it occurred to me that Mom\u2019s business was mostly me. There was also the business of being married to my dad\u2014he was kind of clueless about, like, banking and hiring plumbers and cooking and doing things other than working for Morris Property, Inc.\u2014but it was mostly me. Her primary reason for living and my primary reason for living were awfully entangled.</p><p>As the seats around the gate started to fill, Augustus said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna get a hamburger before we leave. Can I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I really appreciate your refusal to give in to breakfasty social conventions.\u201d</p> <p>He tilted his head at me, confused. \u201cHazel has developed an issue with the ghettoization of scrambled eggs,\u201d Mom said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing that we all just walk through life blindly accepting that scrambled eggs are fundamentally associated with mornings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk about this more,\u201d Augustus said. \u201cBut I am starving. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>When Augustus hadn\u2019t showed up after twenty minutes, I asked Mom if she thought something was wrong, and she looked up from her awful magazine only long enough to say, \u201cHe probably just went to the bathroom or something.\u201d</p><p>A gate agent came over and switched my oxygen container out with one provided by the airline. I was embarrassed to have this lady kneeling in front of me while everyone watched, so I texted Augustus while she did it.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply. Mom seemed unconcerned, but I was imagining all kinds of Amsterdam trip\u2013ruining fates (arrest, injury, mental breakdown) and I felt like there was something noncancery wrong with my chest as the minutes ticked away.</p><p>And just when the lady behind the ticket counter announced they were going to start preboarding people who might need a bit of extra time and every single person in the gate area turned squarely to me, I saw Augustus fast-limping toward us with a McDonald\u2019s bag in one hand, his backpack slung over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cLine got superlong, sorry,\u201d he said, offering me a hand up. I took it, and we walked side by side to the gate to preboard.</p><p>I could feel everybody watching us, wondering what was wrong with us, and whether it would kill us, and how heroic my mom must be, and everything else. That was the worst part about having cancer, sometimes: The physical evidence of disease separates you from other people. We were irreconcilably other, and never was it more obvious than when the three of us walked through the empty plane, the stewardess nodding sympathetically and gesturing us toward our row in the distant back. I sat in the middle of our three-person row with Augustus in the window seat and Mom in the aisle. I felt a little hemmed in by Mom, so of course I scooted over toward Augustus. We were right behind the plane\u2019s wing. He opened up his bag and unwrapped his burger.</p><p>\u201cThe thing about eggs, though,\u201d he said, \u201cis that breakfastization gives the scrambled egg a certain sacrality, right? You can get yourself some bacon or Cheddar cheese anywhere anytime, from tacos to breakfast sandwiches to grilled cheese, but scrambled eggs\u2014they\u2019re important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLudicrous,\u201d I said. The people were starting to file into the plane now. I didn\u2019t want to look at them, so I looked away, and to look away was to look at Augustus.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying: Maybe scrambled eggs are ghettoized, but they\u2019re also special. They have a place and a time, like church does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t be more wrong,\u201d I said. \u201cYou are buying into the cross-stitched sentiments of your parents\u2019 throw pillows. You\u2019re arguing that the fragile, rare thing is beautiful simply because it is fragile and rare. But that\u2019s a lie, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hard person to comfort,\u201d Augustus said.</p><p>\u201cEasy comfort isn\u2019t comforting,\u201d I said. \u201cYou were a rare and fragile flower once. You remember.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, he said nothing. \u201cYou do know how to shut me up, Hazel Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my privilege and my responsibility,\u201d I answered.</p><p>Before I broke eye contact with him, he said, \u201cListen, sorry I avoided the gate area. The McDonald\u2019s line wasn\u2019t really that long; I just . . . I just didn\u2019t want to sit there with all those people looking at us or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt me, mostly,\u201d I said. You could glance at Gus and never know he\u2019d been sick, but I carried my disease with me on the outside, which is part of why I\u2019d become a homebody in the first place. \u201cAugustus Waters, noted charismatist, is embarrassed to sit next to a girl with an oxygen tank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot embarrassed,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just piss me off sometimes. And I don\u2019t want to be pissed off today.\u201d After a minute, he dug into his pocket and flipped open his pack of smokes.</p><p>About nine seconds later, a blond stewardess rushed over to our row and said, \u201cSir, you can\u2019t smoke on this plane. Or any plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t smoke,\u201d he explained, the cigarette dancing in his mouth as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor,\u201d I explained. \u201cHe puts the killing thing in his mouth but doesn\u2019t give it the power to kill him.\u201d</p><p>The stewardess was flummoxed for only a moment. \u201cWell, that metaphor is prohibited on today\u2019s flight,\u201d she said. Gus nodded and rejoined the cigarette to its pack.</p><p>We finally taxied out to the runway and the pilot said, Flight attendants, prepare for departure, and then two tremendous jet engines roared to life and we began to accelerate. \u201cThis is what it feels like to drive in a car with you,\u201d I said, and he smiled, but kept his jaw clenched tight and I said, \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>We were picking up speed and suddenly Gus\u2019s hand grabbed the armrest, his eyes wide, and I put my hand on top of his and said, \u201cOkay?\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything, just stared at me wide-eyed, and I said, \u201cAre you scared of flying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you in a minute,\u201d he said. The nose of the plane rose up and we were aloft. Gus stared out the window, watching the planet shrink beneath us, and then I felt his hand relax beneath mine. He glanced at me and then back out the window. \u201cWe are flying,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been on a plane before?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cLOOK!\u201d he half shouted, pointing at the window.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cYeah, I see it. It looks like we\u2019re in an airplane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNOTHING HAS EVER LOOKED LIKE THAT EVER IN ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY,\u201d he said. His enthusiasm was adorable. I couldn\u2019t resist leaning over to kiss him on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know, I\u2019m right here,\u201d Mom said. \u201cSitting next to you. Your mother. Who held your hand as you took your first infantile steps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s friendly,\u201d I reminded her, turning to kiss her on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t feel too friendly,\u201d Gus mumbled just loud enough for me to hear. When surprised and excited and innocent Gus emerged from Grand Gesture Metaphorically Inclined Augustus, I literally could not resist.</p><p>It was a quick flight to Detroit, where the little electric car met us as we disembarked and drove us to the gate for Amsterdam. That plane had TVs in the back of each seat, and once we were above the clouds, Augustus and I timed it so that we started watching the same romantic comedy at the same time on our respective screens. But even though we were perfectly synchronized in our pressing of the play button, his movie started a couple seconds before mine, so at every funny moment, he\u2019d laugh just as I started to hear whatever the joke was.</p><p>Mom had this big plan that we would sleep for the last several hours of the flight, so when we landed at eight A.M., we\u2019d hit the city ready to suck the marrow out of life or whatever. So after the movie was over, Mom and Augustus and I all took sleeping pills. Mom conked out within seconds, but Augustus and I stayed up to look out the window for a while. It was a clear day, and although we couldn\u2019t see the sun setting, we could see the sky\u2019s response.</p><p>\u201cGod, that is beautiful,\u201d I said mostly to myself.</p><p>\u201c\u2018The risen sun too bright in her losing eyes,\u2019\u201d he said, a line from An Imperial Affliction.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not rising,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rising somewhere,\u201d he answered, and then after a moment said, \u201cObservation: It would be awesome to fly in a superfast airplane that could chase the sunrise around the world for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso I\u2019d live longer.\u201d He looked at me askew. \u201cYou know, because of relativity or whatever.\u201d He still looked confused. \u201cWe age slower when we move quickly versus standing still. So right now time is passing slower for us than for people on the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollege chicks,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re so smart.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. He hit his (real) knee with my knee and I hit his knee back with mine. \u201cAre you sleepy?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cMe neither.\u201d Sleeping meds and narcotics didn\u2019t do for me what they did for normal people.</p><p>\u201cWant to watch another movie?\u201d he asked. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a Portman movie from her Hazel Era.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to watch something you haven\u2019t seen.\u201d</p><p>In the end we watched 300, a war movie about 300 Spartans who protect Sparta from an invading army of like a billion Persians. Augustus\u2019s movie started before mine again, and after a few minutes of hearing him go, \u201cDang!\u201d or \u201cFatality!\u201d every time someone was killed in some badass way, I leaned over the armrest and put my head on his shoulder so I could see his screen and we could actually watch the movie together.</p><p>300 featured a sizable collection of shirtless and well-oiled strapping young lads, so it was not particularly difficult on the eyes, but it was mostly a lot of sword wielding to no real effect. The bodies of the Persians and the Spartans piled up, and I couldn\u2019t quite figure out why the Persians were so evil or the Spartans so awesome. \u201cContemporaneity,\u201d to quote AIA, \u201cspecializes in the kind of battles wherein no one loses anything of any value, except arguably their lives.\u201d And so it was with these titans clashing.</p><p>Toward the end of the movie, almost everyone is dead, and there is this insane moment when the Spartans start stacking the bodies of the dead up to form a wall of corpses. The dead become this massive roadblock standing between the Persians and the road to Sparta. I found the gore a bit gratuitous, so I looked away for a second, asking Augustus, \u201cHow many dead people do you think there are?\u201d</p><p>He dismissed me with a wave. \u201cShh. Shh. This is getting awesome.\u201d</p><p>When the Persians attacked, they had to climb up the wall of death, and the Spartans were able to occupy the high ground atop the corpse mountain, and as the bodies piled up, the wall of martyrs only became higher and therefore harder to climb, and everybody swung swords/shot arrows, and the rivers of blood poured down Mount Death, etc.</p><p>I took my head off his shoulder for a moment to get a break from the gore and watched Augustus watch the movie. He couldn\u2019t contain his goofy grin. I watched my own screen through squinted eyes as the mountain grew with the bodies of Persians and Spartans. When the Persians finally overran the Spartans, I looked over at Augustus again. Even though the good guys had just lost, Augustus seemed downright joyful. I nuzzled up to him again, but kept my eyes closed until the battle was finished.</p><p>As the credits rolled, he took off his headphones and said, \u201cSorry, I was awash in the nobility of sacrifice. What were you saying?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow many dead people do you think there are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, how many fictional people died in that fictional movie? Not enough,\u201d he joked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean, like, ever. Like, how many people do you think have ever died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happen to know the answer to that question,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are seven billion living people, and about ninety-eight billion dead people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said. I\u2019d thought that maybe since population growth had been so fast, there were more people alive than all the dead combined.</p><p>\u201cThere are about fourteen dead people for every living person,\u201d he said. The credits continued rolling. It took a long time to identify all those corpses, I guess. My head was still on his shoulder. \u201cI did some research on this a couple years ago,\u201d Augustus continued. \u201cI was wondering if everybody could be remembered. Like, if we got organized, and assigned a certain number of corpses to each living person, would there be enough living people to remember all the dead people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, anyone can name fourteen dead people. But we\u2019re disorganized mourners, so a lot of people end up remembering Shakespeare, and no one ends up remembering the person he wrote Sonnet Fifty-five about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said.</p> <p>It was quiet for a minute, and then he asked, \u201cYou want to read or something?\u201d I said sure. I was reading this long poem called Howl by Allen Ginsberg for my poetry class, and Gus was rereading An Imperial Affliction.</p><p>After a while he said, \u201cIs it any good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe poem?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s great. The guys in this poem take even more drugs than I do. How\u2019s AIA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cRead to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t really a poem to read aloud when you are sitting next to your sleeping mother. It has, like, sodomy and angel dust in it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou just named two of my favorite pastimes,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay, read me something else then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. I am so in the mood for poetry. Do you have anything memorized?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Let us go then, you and I,\u2019\u201d I started nervously, \u201c\u2018When the evening is spread out against the sky / Like a patient etherized upon a table.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlower,\u201d he said.</p><p>I felt bashful, like I had when I\u2019d first told him of An Imperial Affliction. \u201cUm, okay. Okay. \u2018Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets, / The muttering retreats / Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels / And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells: / Streets that follow like a tedious argument / Of insidious intent / To lead you to an overwhelming question . . . / Oh, do not ask, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d / Let us go and make our visit.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with you,\u201d he said quietly.</p> <p>\u201cAugustus,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said. He was staring at me, and I could see the corners of his eyes crinkling. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you, and I\u2019m not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I\u2019m in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we\u2019re all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we\u2019ll ever have, and I am in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAugustus,\u201d I said again, not knowing what else to say. It felt like everything was rising up in me, like I was drowning in this weirdly painful joy, but I couldn\u2019t say it back. I couldn\u2019t say anything back. I just looked at him and let him look at me until he nodded, lips pursed, and turned away, placing the side of his head against the window.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>I think he must have fallen asleep. I did, eventually, and woke to the landing gear coming down. My mouth tasted horrible, and I tried to keep it shut for fear of poisoning the airplane.</p><p>I looked over at Augustus, who was staring out the window, and as we dipped below the low-hung clouds, I straightened my back to see the Netherlands. The land seemed sunk into the ocean, little rectangles of green surrounded on all sides by canals. We landed, in fact, parallel to a canal, like there were two runways: one for us and one for waterfowl.</p><p>After getting our bags and clearing customs, we all piled into a taxi driven by this doughy bald guy who spoke perfect English\u2014like better English than I do. \u201cThe Hotel Filosoof?\u201d I said.</p><p>And he said, \u201cYou are Americans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Mom said. \u201cWe\u2019re from Indiana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndiana,\u201d he said. \u201cThey steal the land from the Indians and leave the name, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Mom said. The cabbie pulled out into traffic and we headed toward a highway with lots of blue signs featuring double vowels: Oosthuizen, Haarlem. Beside the highway, flat empty land stretched for miles, interrupted by the occasional huge corporate headquarters. In short, Holland looked like Indianapolis, only with smaller cars. \u201cThis is Amsterdam?\u201d I asked the cabdriver.</p><p>\u201cYes and no,\u201d he answered. \u201cAmsterdam is like the rings of a tree: It gets older as you get closer to the center.\u201d</p><p>It happened all at once: We exited the highway and there were the row houses of my imagination leaning precariously toward canals, ubiquitous bicycles, and coffeeshops advertising LARGE SMOKING ROOM. We drove over a canal and from atop the bridge I could see dozens of houseboats moored along the water. It looked nothing like America. It looked like an old painting, but real\u2014everything achingly idyllic in the morning light\u2014and I thought about how wonderfully strange it would be to live in a place where almost everything had been built by the dead.</p><p>\u201cAre these houses very old?\u201d asked my mom.</p><p>\u201cMany of the canal houses date from the Golden Age, the seventeenth century,\u201d he said. \u201cOur city has a rich history, even though many tourists are only wanting to see the Red Light District.\u201d He paused. \u201cSome tourists think Amsterdam is a city of sin, but in truth it is a city of freedom. And in freedom, most people find sin.\u201d</p><p>All the rooms in the Hotel Filosoof were named after filosoofers: Mom and I were staying on the ground floor in the Kierkegaard; Augustus was on the floor above us, in the Heidegger. Our room was small: a double bed pressed against a wall with my BiPAP machine, an oxygen concentrator, and a dozen refillable oxygen tanks at the foot of the bed. Past the equipment, there was a dusty old paisley chair with a sagging seat, a desk, and a bookshelf above the bed containing the collected works of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard. On the desk we found a wicker basket full of presents from the Genies: wooden shoes, an orange Holland T-shirt, chocolates, and various other goodies.</p><p>The Filosoof was right next to the Vondelpark, Amsterdam\u2019s most famous park. Mom wanted to go on a walk, but I was supertired, so she got the BiPAP working and placed its snout on me. I hated talking with that thing on, but I said, \u201cJust go to the park and I\u2019ll call you when I wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cSleep tight, honey.\u201d</p><p>But when I woke up some hours later, she was sitting in the ancient little chair in the corner, reading a guidebook.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cActually late afternoon,\u201d she answered, pushing herself out of the chair with a sigh. She came to the bed, placed a tank in the cart, and connected it to the tube while I took off the BiPAP snout and placed the nubbins into my nose. She set it for 2.5 liters a minute\u2014six hours before I\u2019d need a change\u2014and then I got up. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I said. \u201cGreat. How was the Vondelpark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI skipped it,\u201d she said. \u201cRead all about it in the guidebook, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I said, \u201cyou didn\u2019t have to stay here.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI know. I wanted to. I like watching you sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid the creeper.\u201d She laughed, but I still felt bad. \u201cI just want you to have fun or whatever, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll have fun tonight, okay? I\u2019ll go do crazy mom stuff while you and Augustus go to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes without me. In fact, you have reservations at a place called Oranjee,\u201d she said. \u201cMr. Van Houten\u2019s assistant set it up. It\u2019s in this neighborhood called the Jordaan. Very fancy, according to the guidebook. There\u2019s a tram station right around the corner. Augustus has directions. You can eat outside, watch the boats go by. It\u2019ll be lovely. Very romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d she said. \u201cYou should get dressed. The sundress, maybe?\u201d</p><p>One might marvel at the insanity of the situation: A mother sends her sixteen-year-old daughter alone with a seventeen-year-old boy out into a foreign city famous for its permissiveness. But this, too, was a side effect of dying: I could not run or dance or eat foods rich in nitrogen, but in the city of freedom, I was among the most liberated of its residents.</p><p>I did indeed wear the sundress\u2014this blue print, flowey knee-length Forever 21 thing\u2014with tights and Mary Janes because I liked being quite a lot shorter than him. I went into the hilariously tiny bathroom and battled my bedhead for a while until everything looked suitably mid-2000s Natalie Portman. At six P.M. on the dot (noon back home), there was a knock.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I said through the door. There was no peephole at the Hotel Filosoof.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Augustus answered. I could hear the cigarette in his mouth. I looked down at myself. The sundress offered the most in the way of my rib cage and collarbone that Augustus had seen. It wasn\u2019t obscene or anything, but it was as close as I ever got to showing some skin. (My mother had a motto on this front that I agreed with: \u201cLancasters don\u2019t bare midriffs.\u201d)</p><p>I pulled the door open. Augustus wore a black suit, narrow lapels, perfectly tailored, over a light blue dress shirt and a thin black tie. A cigarette dangled from the unsmiling corner of his mouth. \u201cHazel Grace,\u201d he said, \u201cyou look gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d I said. I kept thinking the rest of my sentence would emerge from the air passing through my vocal cords, but nothing happened. Then finally, I said, \u201cI feel underdressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, this old thing?\u201d he said, smiling down at me.</p><p>\u201cAugustus,\u201d my mom said behind me, \u201cyou look extremely handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. He offered me his arm. I took it, glancing back to Mom.</p><p>\u201cSee you by eleven,\u201d she said.</p><p>Waiting for the number one tram on a wide street busy with traffic, I said to Augustus, \u201cThe suit you wear to funerals, I assume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, no,\u201d he said. \u201cThat suit isn\u2019t nearly this nice.\u201d</p><p>The blue-and-white tram arrived, and Augustus handed our cards to the driver, who explained that we needed to wave them at this circular sensor. As we walked through the crowded tram, an old man stood up to give us seats together, and I tried to tell him to sit, but he gestured toward the seat insistently. We rode the tram for three stops, me leaning over Gus so we could look out the window together.</p><p>Augustus pointed up at the trees and asked, \u201cDo you see that?\u201d</p><p>I did. There were elm trees everywhere along the canals, and these seeds were blowing out of them. But they didn\u2019t look like seeds. They looked for all the world like miniaturized rose petals drained of their color. These pale petals were gathering in the wind like flocking birds\u2014thousands of them, like a spring snowstorm.</p><p>The old man who\u2019d given up his seat saw us noticing and said, in English, \u201cAmsterdam\u2019s spring snow. The iepen throw confetti to greet the spring.\u201d</p><p>We switched trams, and after four more stops we arrived at a street split by a beautiful canal, the reflections of the ancient bridge and picturesque canal houses rippling in water.</p><p>Oranjee was just steps from the tram. The restaurant was on one side of the street; the outdoor seating on the other, on a concrete outcropping right at the edge of the canal. The hostess\u2019s eyes lit up as Augustus and I walked toward her. \u201cMr. and Mrs. Waters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYour table,\u201d she said, gesturing across the street to a narrow table inches from the canal. \u201cThe champagne is our gift.\u201d</p><p>Gus and I glanced at each other, smiling. Once we\u2019d crossed the street, he pulled out a seat for me and helped me scoot it back in. There were indeed two flutes of champagne at our white-tableclothed table. The slight chill in the air was balanced magnificently by the sunshine; on one side of us, cyclists pedaled past\u2014well-dressed men and women on their way home from work, improbably attractive blond girls riding sidesaddle on the back of a friend\u2019s bike, tiny helmetless kids bouncing around in plastic seats behind their parents. And on our other side, the canal water was choked with millions of the confetti seeds. Little boats were moored at the brick banks, half full of rainwater, some of them near sinking. A bit farther down the canal, I could see houseboats floating on pontoons, and in the middle of the canal, an open-air, flat-bottomed boat decked out with lawn chairs and a portable stereo idled toward us. Augustus took his flute of champagne and raised it. I took mine, even though I\u2019d never had a drink aside from sips of my dad\u2019s beer.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, and we clinked glasses. I took a sip. The tiny bubbles melted in my mouth and journeyed northward into my brain. Sweet. Crisp. Delicious. \u201cThat is really good,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve never drunk champagne.\u201d</p><p>A sturdy young waiter with wavy blond hair appeared. He was maybe even taller than Augustus. \u201cDo you know,\u201d he asked in a delicious accent, \u201cwhat Dom P\u00e9rignon said after inventing champagne?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHe called out to his fellow monks, \u2018Come quickly: I am tasting the stars.\u2019 Welcome to Amsterdam. Would you like to see a menu, or will you have the chef\u2019s choice?\u201d</p><p>I looked at Augustus and he at me. \u201cThe chef\u2019s choice sounds lovely, but Hazel is a vegetarian.\u201d I\u2019d mentioned this to Augustus precisely once, on the first day we met.</p><p>\u201cThis is not a problem,\u201d the waiter said.</p> <p>\u201cAwesome. And can we get more of this?\u201d Gus asked, of the champagne.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d said our waiter. \u201cWe have bottled all the stars this evening, my young friends. Gah, the confetti!\u201d he said, and lightly brushed a seed from my bare shoulder. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been so bad in many years. It\u2019s everywhere. Very annoying.\u201d</p><p>The waiter disappeared. We watched the confetti fall from the sky, skip across the ground in the breeze, and tumble into the canal. \u201cKind of hard to believe anyone could ever find that annoying,\u201d Augustus said after a while.</p><p>\u201cPeople always get used to beauty, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten used to you just yet,\u201d he answered, smiling. I felt myself blushing. \u201cThank you for coming to Amsterdam,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThank you for letting me hijack your wish,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThank you for wearing that dress which is like whoa,\u201d he said. I shook my head, trying not to smile at him. I didn\u2019t want to be a grenade. But then again, he knew what he was doing, didn\u2019t he? It was his choice, too. \u201cHey, how\u2019s that poem end?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one you recited to me on the plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, \u2018Prufrock\u2019? It ends, \u2018We have lingered in the chambers of the sea / By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown / Till human voices wake us, and we drown.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Augustus pulled out a cigarette and tapped the filter against the table. \u201cStupid human voices always ruining everything.\u201d</p> <p>The waiter arrived with two more glasses of champagne and what he called \u201cBelgian white asparagus with a lavender infusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had champagne either,\u201d Gus said after he left. \u201cIn case you were wondering or whatever. Also, I\u2019ve never had white asparagus.\u201d</p><p>I was chewing my first bite. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d I promised.</p><p>He took a bite, swallowed. \u201cGod. If asparagus tasted like that all the time, I\u2019d be a vegetarian, too.\u201d Some people in a lacquered wooden boat approached us on the canal below. One of them, a woman with curly blond hair, maybe thirty, drank from a beer then raised her glass toward us and shouted something.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t speak Dutch,\u201d Gus shouted back.</p><p>One of the others shouted a translation: \u201cThe beautiful couple is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>The food was so good that with each passing course, our conversation devolved further into fragmented celebrations of its deliciousness: \u201cI want this dragon carrot risotto to become a person so I can take it to Las Vegas and marry it.\u201d \u201cSweet-pea sorbet, you are so unexpectedly magnificent.\u201d I wish I\u2019d been hungrier.</p><p>After green garlic gnocchi with red mustard leaves, the waiter said, \u201cDessert next. More stars first?\u201d I shook my head. Two glasses was enough for me. Champagne was no exception to my high tolerance for depressants and pain relievers; I felt warm but not intoxicated. But I didn\u2019t want to get drunk. Nights like this one didn\u2019t come along often, and I wanted to remember it.</p> <p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d I said after the waiter left, and Augustus smiled crookedly as he stared down the canal while I stared up it. We had plenty to look at, so the silence didn\u2019t feel awkward really, but I wanted everything to be perfect. It was perfect, I guess, but it felt like someone had tried to stage the Amsterdam of my imagination, which made it hard to forget that this dinner, like the trip itself, was a cancer perk. I just wanted us to be talking and joking comfortably, like we were on the couch together back home, but some tension underlay everything.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my funeral suit,\u201d he said after a while. \u201cWhen I first found out I was sick\u2014I mean, they told me I had like an eighty-five percent chance of cure. I know those are great odds, but I kept thinking it was a game of Russian roulette. I mean, I was going to have to go through hell for six months or a year and lose my leg and then at the end, it still might not work, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, although I didn\u2019t, not really. I\u2019d never been anything but terminal; all my treatment had been in pursuit of extending my life, not curing my cancer. Phalanxifor had introduced a measure of ambiguity to my cancer story, but I was different from Augustus: My final chapter was written upon diagnosis. Gus, like most cancer survivors, lived with uncertainty.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I went through this whole thing about wanting to be ready. We bought a plot in Crown Hill, and I walked around with my dad one day and picked out a spot. And I had my whole funeral planned out and everything, and then right before the surgery, I asked my parents if I could buy a suit, like a really nice suit, just in case I bit it. Anyway, I\u2019ve never had occasion to wear it. Until tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s your death suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect. Don\u2019t you have a death outfit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dress I bought for my fifteenth birthday party. But I don\u2019t wear it on dates.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lit up. \u201cWe\u2019re on a date?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I looked down, feeling bashful. \u201cDon\u2019t push it.\u201d</p><p>We were both really full, but dessert\u2014a succulently rich cr\u00e9meux surrounded by passion fruit\u2014was too good not to at least nibble, so we lingered for a while over dessert, trying to get hungry again. The sun was a toddler insistently refusing to go to bed: It was past eight thirty and still light.</p><p>Out of nowhere, Augustus asked, \u201cDo you believe in an afterlife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think forever is an incorrect concept,\u201d I answered.</p><p>He smirked. \u201cYou\u2019re an incorrect concept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m being taken out of the rotation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny,\u201d he said, looking at the street. Two girls passed on a bike, one riding sidesaddle over the back wheel.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I said. \u201cThat was a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thought of you being removed from the rotation is not funny to me,\u201d he said. \u201cSeriously, though: afterlife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, and then revised. \u201cWell, maybe I wouldn\u2019t go so far as no. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, his voice full of confidence. \u201cYes, absolutely. Not like a heaven where you ride unicorns, play harps, and live in a mansion made of clouds. But yes. I believe in Something with a capital S. Always have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked. I was surprised. I\u2019d always associated belief in heaven with, frankly, a kind of intellectual disengagement. But Gus wasn\u2019t dumb.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI believe in that line from An Imperial Affliction. \u2018The risen sun too bright in her losing eyes.\u2019 That\u2019s God, I think, the rising sun, and the light is too bright and her eyes are losing but they aren\u2019t lost. I don\u2019t believe we return to haunt or comfort the living or anything, but I think something becomes of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you fear oblivion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I fear earthly oblivion. But, I mean, not to sound like my parents, but I believe humans have souls, and I believe in the conservation of souls. The oblivion fear is something else, fear that I won\u2019t be able to give anything in exchange for my life. If you don\u2019t live a life in service of a greater good, you\u2019ve gotta at least die a death in service of a greater good, you know? And I fear that I won\u2019t get either a life or a death that means anything.\u201d</p><p>I just shook my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYour obsession with, like, dying for something or leaving behind some great sign of your heroism or whatever. It\u2019s just weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone wants to lead an extraordinary life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone,\u201d I said, unable to disguise my annoyance.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just,\u201d I said, and then couldn\u2019t finish my sentence. \u201cJust,\u201d I said again. Between us flickered the candle. \u201cIt\u2019s really mean of you to say that the only lives that matter are the ones that are lived for something or die for something. That\u2019s a really mean thing to say to me.\u201d</p><p>I felt like a little kid for some reason, and I took a bite of dessert to make it appear like it was not that big of a deal to me. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that. I was just thinking about myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you were,\u201d I said. I was too full to finish. I worried I might puke, actually, because I often puked after eating. (Not bulimia, just cancer.) I pushed my dessert plate toward Gus, but he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said again, reaching across the table for my hand. I let him take it. \u201cI could be worse, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I asked, teasing.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I have a work of calligraphy over my toilet that reads, \u2018Bathe Yourself Daily in the Comfort of God\u2019s Words,\u2019 Hazel. I could be way worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds unsanitary,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI could be worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be worse.\u201d I smiled. He really did like me. Maybe I was a narcissist or something, but when I realized it there in that moment at Oranjee, it made me like him even more.</p><p>When our waiter appeared to take dessert away, he said, \u201cYour meal has been paid for by Mr. Peter Van Houten.\u201d</p><p>Augustus smiled. \u201cThis Peter Van Houten fellow ain\u2019t half bad.\u201d</p><p>We walked along the canal as it got dark. A block up from Oranjee, we stopped at a park bench surrounded by old rusty bicycles locked to bike racks and to each other. We sat down hip to hip facing the canal, and he put his arm around me.</p><p>I could see the halo of light coming from the Red Light District. Even though it was the Red Light District, the glow coming from up there was an eerie sort of green. I imagined thousands of tourists getting drunk and stoned and pinballing around the narrow streets.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s going to tell us tomorrow,\u201d I said. \u201cPeter Van Houten is going to tell us the famously unwritten end of the best book ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus he paid for our dinner,\u201d Augustus said.</p><p>\u201cI keep imagining that he is going to search us for recording devices before he tells us. And then he will sit down between us on the couch in his living room and whisper whether Anna\u2019s mom married the Dutch Tulip Man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget Sisyphus the Hamster,\u201d Augustus added.</p><p>\u201cRight, and also of course what fate awaited Sisyphus the Hamster.\u201d I leaned forward, to see into the canal. There were so many of those pale elm petals in the canals, it was ridiculous. \u201cA sequel that will exist just for us,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your guess?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve gone back and forth like a thousand times about it all. Each time I reread it, I think something different, you know?\u201d He nodded. \u201cYou have a theory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t think the Dutch Tulip Man is a con man, but he\u2019s also not rich like he leads them to believe. And I think after Anna dies, Anna\u2019s mom goes to Holland with him and thinks they will live there forever, but it doesn\u2019t work out, because she wants to be near where her daughter was.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d thought about the book so much, that An Imperial Affliction mattered to Gus independently of me mattering to him.</p><p>The water lapped quietly at the stone canal walls beneath us; a group of friends biked past in a clump, shouting over each other in rapid-fire, guttural Dutch; the tiny boats, not much longer than me, half drowned in the canal; the smell of water that had stood too still for too long; his arm pulling me in; his real leg against my real leg all the way from hip to foot. I leaned in to his body a little. He winced. \u201cSorry, you okay?\u201d</p><p>He breathed out a yeah in obvious pain.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said. \u201cBony shoulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said. \u201cNice, actually.\u201d</p><p>We sat there for a long time. Eventually his hand abandoned my shoulder and rested against the back of the park bench. Mostly we just stared into the canal. I was thinking a lot about how they\u2019d made this place exist even though it should\u2019ve been underwater, and how I was for Dr. Maria a kind of Amsterdam, a half-drowned anomaly, and that made me think about dying. \u201cCan I ask you about Caroline Mathers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you say there\u2019s no afterlife,\u201d he answered without looking at me. \u201cBut yeah, of course. What do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to know that he would be okay if I died. I wanted to not be a grenade, to not be a malevolent force in the lives of people I loved. \u201cJust, like, what happened.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, exhaling for so long that to my crap lungs it seemed like he was bragging. He popped a fresh cigarette into his mouth. \u201cYou know how there is famously no place less played in than a hospital playground?\u201d I nodded. \u201cWell, I was at Memorial for a couple weeks when they took off the leg and everything. I was up on the fifth floor and I had a view of the playground, which was always of course utterly desolate. I was all awash in the metaphorical resonance of the empty playground in the hospital courtyard. But then this girl started showing up alone at the playground, every day, swinging on a swing completely alone, like you\u2019d see in a movie or something. So I asked one of my nicer nurses to get the skinny on the girl, and the nurse brought her up to visit, and it was Caroline, and I used my immense charisma to win her over.\u201d He paused, so I decided to say something.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not that charismatic,\u201d I said. He scoffed, disbelieving. \u201cYou\u2019re mostly just hot,\u201d I explained. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laughed it off. \u201cThe thing about dead people,\u201d he said, and then stopped himself. \u201cThe thing is you sound like a bastard if you don\u2019t romanticize them, but the truth is . . . complicated, I guess. Like, you are familiar with the trope of the stoic and determined cancer victim who heroically fights her cancer with inhuman strength and never complains or stops smiling even at the very end, etcetera?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d I said. \u201cThey are kindhearted and generous souls whose every breath is an Inspiration to Us All. They\u2019re so strong! We admire them so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, but really, I mean aside from us obviously, cancer kids are not statistically more likely to be awesome or compassionate or perseverant or whatever. Caroline was always moody and miserable, but I liked it. I liked feeling as if she had chosen me as the only person in the world not to hate, and so we spent all this time together just ragging on everyone, you know? Ragging on the nurses and the other kids and our families and whatever else. But I don\u2019t know if that was her or the tumor. I mean, one of her nurses told me once that the kind of tumor Caroline had is known among medical types as the Asshole Tumor, because it just turns you into a monster. So here\u2019s this girl missing a fifth of her brain who\u2019s just had a recurrence of the Asshole Tumor, and so she was not, you know, the paragon of stoic cancer-kid heroism. She was . . . I mean, to be honest, she was a bitch. But you can\u2019t say that, because she had this tumor, and also she\u2019s, I mean, she\u2019s dead. And she had plenty of reason to be unpleasant, you know?\u201d</p><p>I knew.</p> <p>\u201cYou know that part in An Imperial Affliction when Anna\u2019s walking across the football field to go to PE or whatever and she falls and goes face-first into the grass and that\u2019s when she knows that the cancer is back and in her nervous system and she can\u2019t get up and her face is like an inch from the football-field grass and she\u2019s just stuck there looking at this grass up close, noticing the way the light hits it and . . . I don\u2019t remember the line but it\u2019s something like Anna having the Whitmanesque revelation that the definition of humanness is the opportunity to marvel at the majesty of creation or whatever. You know that part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that part,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSo afterward, while I was getting eviscerated by chemo, for some reason I decided to feel really hopeful. Not about survival specifically, but I felt like Anna does in the book, that feeling of excitement and gratitude about just being able to marvel at it all.</p><p>\u201cBut meanwhile Caroline got worse every day. She went home after a while and there were moments where I thought we could have, like, a regular relationship, but we couldn\u2019t, really, because she had no filter between her thoughts and her speech, which was sad and unpleasant and frequently hurtful. But, I mean, you can\u2019t dump a girl with a brain tumor. And her parents liked me, and she has this little brother who is a really cool kid. I mean, how can you dump her? She\u2019s dying.</p><p>\u201cIt took forever. It took almost a year, and it was a year of me hanging out with this girl who would, like, just start laughing out of nowhere and point at my prosthetic and call me Stumpy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I mean, it was the tumor. It ate her brain, you know? Or it wasn\u2019t the tumor. I have no way of knowing, because they were inseparable, she and the tumor. But as she got sicker, I mean, she\u2019d just repeat the same stories and laugh at her own comments even if she\u2019d already said the same thing a hundred times that day. Like, she made the same joke over and over again for weeks: \u2018Gus has great legs. I mean leg.\u2019 And then she would just laugh like a maniac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gus,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s . . .\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to say. He wasn\u2019t looking at me, and it felt invasive of me to look at him. I felt him scoot forward. He took the cigarette out of his mouth and stared at it, rolling it between his thumb and forefinger, then put it back.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cto be fair, I do have great leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all good, Hazel Grace. But just to be clear, when I thought I saw Caroline Mathers\u2019s ghost in Support Group, I was not entirely happy. I was staring, but I wasn\u2019t yearning, if you know what I mean.\u201d He pulled the pack out of his pocket and placed the cigarette back in it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said again.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ever want to do that to you,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t mind, Hazel Grace. It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>I woke up at four in the Dutch morning ready for the day. All attempts to go back to sleep failed, so I lay there with the BiPAP pumping the air in and urging it out, enjoying the dragon sounds but wishing I could choose my breaths.</p><p>I reread An Imperial Affliction until Mom woke up and rolled over toward me around six. She nuzzled her head against my shoulder, which felt uncomfortable and vaguely Augustinian.</p><p>The hotel brought a breakfast to our room that, much to my delight, featured deli meat among many other denials of American breakfast constructions. The dress I\u2019d planned to wear to meet Peter Van Houten had been moved up in the rotation for the Oranjee dinner, so after I showered and got my hair to lie halfway flat, I spent like thirty minutes debating with Mom the various benefits and drawbacks of the available outfits before deciding to dress as much like Anna in AIA as possible: Chuck Taylors and dark jeans like she always wore, and a light blue T-shirt.</p> <p>The shirt was a screen print of a famous Surrealist artwork by Ren\u00e9 Magritte in which he drew a pipe and then beneath it wrote in cursive Ceci n\u2019est pas une pipe. (\u201cThis is not a pipe.\u201d)</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t get that shirt,\u201d Mom said.</p><p>\u201cPeter Van Houten will get it, trust me. There are like seven thousand Magritte references in An Imperial Affliction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it is a pipe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a drawing of a pipe. Get it? All representations of a thing are inherently abstract. It\u2019s very clever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get so grown up that you understand things that confuse your ancient mother?\u201d Mom asked. \u201cIt seems like just yesterday that I was telling seven-year-old Hazel why the sky was blue. You thought I was a genius back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is the sky blue?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cCuz,\u201d she answered. I laughed.</p><p>As it got closer to ten, I grew more and more nervous: nervous to see Augustus; nervous to meet Peter Van Houten; nervous that my outfit was not a good outfit; nervous that we wouldn\u2019t find the right house since all the houses in Amsterdam looked pretty similar; nervous that we would get lost and never make it back to the Filosoof; nervous nervous nervous. Mom kept trying to talk to me, but I couldn\u2019t really listen. I was about to ask her to go upstairs and make sure Augustus was up when he knocked.</p><p>I opened the door. He looked down at the shirt and smiled. \u201cFunny,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call my boobs funny,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cRight here,\u201d Mom said behind us. But I\u2019d made Augustus blush and put him enough off his game that I could finally bear to look up at him.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to come?\u201d I asked Mom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the Rijksmuseum and the Vondelpark today,\u201d she said. \u201cPlus, I just don\u2019t get his book. No offense. Thank him and Lidewij for us, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. I hugged Mom, and she kissed my head just above my ear.</p><p>Peter Van Houten\u2019s white row house was just around the corner from the hotel, on the Vondelstraat, facing the park. Number 158. Augustus took me by one arm and grabbed the oxygen cart with the other, and we walked up the three steps to the lacquered blue-black front door. My heart pounded. One closed door away from the answers I\u2019d dreamed of ever since I first read that last unfinished page.</p><p>Inside, I could hear a bass beat thumping loud enough to rattle the windowsills. I wondered whether Peter Van Houten had a kid who liked rap music.</p><p>I grabbed the lion\u2019s-head door knocker and knocked tentatively. The beat continued. \u201cMaybe he can\u2019t hear over the music?\u201d Augustus asked. He grabbed the lion\u2019s head and knocked much louder.</p><p>The music disappeared, replaced by shuffled footsteps. A dead bolt slid. Another. The door creaked open. A potbellied man with thin hair, sagging jowls, and a week-old beard squinted into the sunlight. He wore baby-blue man pajamas like guys in old movies. His face and belly were so round, and his arms so skinny, that he looked like a dough ball with four sticks stuck into it. \u201cMr. Van Houten?\u201d Augustus asked, his voice squeaking a bit.</p><p>The door slammed shut. Behind it, I heard a stammering, reedy voice shout, \u201cLEEE-DUH-VIGH!\u201d (Until then, I\u2019d pronounced his assistant\u2019s name like lid-uh-widge.)</p><p>We could hear everything through the door. \u201cAre they here, Peter?\u201d a woman asked.</p><p>\u201cThere are\u2014Lidewij, there are two adolescent apparitions outside the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparitions?\u201d she asked with a pleasant Dutch lilt.</p><p>Van Houten answered in a rush. \u201cPhantasms specters ghouls visitants post-terrestrials apparitions, Lidewij. How can someone pursuing a postgraduate degree in American literature display such abominable English-language skills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, those are not post-terrestrials. They are Augustus and Hazel, the young fans with whom you have been corresponding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are\u2014what? They\u2014I thought they were in America!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you invited them here, you will remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know why I left America, Lidewij? So that I would never again have to encounter Americans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are an American.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncurably so, it seems. But as to these Americans, you must tell them to leave at once, that there has been a terrible mistake, that the blessed Van Houten was making a rhetorical offer to meet, not an actual one, that such offers must be read symbolically.\u201d</p><p>I thought I might throw up. I looked over at Augustus, who was staring intently at the door, and saw his shoulders slacken.</p><p>\u201cI will not do this, Peter,\u201d answered Lidewij. \u201cYou must meet them. You must. You need to see them. You need to see how your work matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLidewij, did you knowingly deceive me to arrange this?\u201d</p><p>A long silence ensued, and then finally the door opened again. He turned his head metronomically from Augustus to me, still squinting. \u201cWhich of you is Augustus Waters?\u201d he asked. Augustus raised his hand tentatively. Van Houten nodded and said, \u201cDid you close the deal with that chick yet?\u201d</p><p>Whereupon I encountered for the first and only time a truly speechless Augustus Waters. \u201cI,\u201d he started, \u201cum, I, Hazel, um. Well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis boy appears to have some kind of developmental delay,\u201d Peter Van Houten said to Lidewij.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d she scolded.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Peter Van Houten said, extending his hand to me. \u201cIt is at any rate a pleasure to meet such ontologically improbable creatures.\u201d I shook his swollen hand, and then he shook hands with Augustus. I was wondering what ontologically meant. Regardless, I liked it. Augustus and I were together in the Improbable Creatures Club: us and duck-billed platypuses.</p><p>Of course, I had hoped that Peter Van Houten would be sane, but the world is not a wish-granting factory. The important thing was that the door was open and I was crossing the threshold to learn what happens after the end of An Imperial Affliction. That was enough. We followed him and Lidewij inside, past a huge oak dining room table with only two chairs, into a creepily sterile living room. It looked like a museum, except there was no art on the empty white walls. Aside from one couch and one lounge chair, both a mix of steel and black leather, the room seemed empty. Then I noticed two large black garbage bags, full and twist-tied, behind the couch.</p><p>\u201cTrash?\u201d I mumbled to Augustus soft enough that I thought no one else would hear.</p><p>\u201cFan mail,\u201d Van Houten answered as he sat down in the lounge chair. \u201cEighteen years\u2019 worth of it. Can\u2019t open it. Terrifying. Yours are the first missives to which I have replied, and look where that got me. I frankly find the reality of readers wholly unappetizing.\u201d</p><p>That explained why he\u2019d never replied to my letters: He\u2019d never read them. I wondered why he kept them at all, let alone in an otherwise empty formal living room. Van Houten kicked his feet up onto the ottoman and crossed his slippers. He motioned toward the couch. Augustus and I sat down next to each other, but not too next.</p><p>\u201cWould you care for some breakfast?\u201d asked Lidewij.</p><p>I started to say that we\u2019d already eaten when Peter interrupted. \u201cIt is far too early for breakfast, Lidewij.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they are from America, Peter, so it is past noon in their bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s too late for breakfast,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it being after noon in the body and whatnot, we should enjoy a cocktail. Do you drink Scotch?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>\u201cDo I\u2014um, no, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAugustus Waters?\u201d Van Houten asked, nodding toward Gus.</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust me, then, Lidewij. Scotch and water, please.\u201d Peter turned his attention to Gus, asking, \u201cYou know how we make a Scotch and water in this home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Gus said.</p><p>\u201cWe pour Scotch into a glass and then call to mind thoughts of water, and then we mix the actual Scotch with the abstracted idea of water.\u201d</p><p>Lidewij said, \u201cPerhaps a bit of breakfast first, Peter.\u201d</p><p>He looked toward us and stage-whispered, \u201cShe thinks I have a drinking problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I think that the sun has risen,\u201d Lidewij responded. Nonetheless, she turned to the bar in the living room, reached up for a bottle of Scotch, and poured a glass half full. She carried it to him. Peter Van Houten took a sip, then sat up straight in his chair. \u201cA drink this good deserves one\u2019s best posture,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I became conscious of my own posture and sat up a little on the couch. I rearranged my cannula. Dad always told me that you can judge people by the way they treat waiters and assistants. By this measure, Peter Van Houten was possibly the world\u2019s douchiest douche. \u201cSo you like my book,\u201d he said to Augustus after another sip.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, speaking up on Augustus\u2019s behalf. \u201cAnd yes, we\u2014well, Augustus, he made meeting you his Wish so that we could come here, so that you could tell us what happens after the end of An Imperial Affliction.\u201d</p><p>Van Houten said nothing, just took a long pull on his drink.</p><p>After a minute, Augustus said, \u201cYour book is sort of the thing that brought us together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you aren\u2019t together,\u201d he observed without looking at me.</p><p>\u201cThe thing that brought us nearly together,\u201d I said.</p><p>Now he turned to me. \u201cDid you dress like her on purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He just kept staring at me.</p> <p>\u201cKind of,\u201d I said.</p><p>He took a long drink, then grimaced. \u201cI do not have a drinking problem,\u201d he announced, his voice needlessly loud. \u201cI have a Churchillian relationship with alcohol: I can crack jokes and govern England and do anything I want to do. Except not drink.\u201d He glanced over at Lidewij and nodded toward his glass. She took it, then walked back to the bar. \u201cJust the idea of water, Lidewij,\u201d he instructed.</p><p>\u201cYah, got it,\u201d she said, the accent almost American.</p><p>The second drink arrived. Van Houten\u2019s spine stiffened again out of respect. He kicked off his slippers. He had really ugly feet. He was rather ruining the whole business of authorial genius for me. But he had the answers.</p><p>\u201cWell, um,\u201d I said, \u201cfirst, we do want to say thank you for dinner last night and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe bought them dinner last night?\u201d Van Houten asked Lidewij.</p> <p>\u201cYes, at Oranjee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. Well, believe me when I say that you do not have me to thank but rather Lidewij, who is exceptionally talented in the field of spending my money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was our pleasure,\u201d Lidewij said.</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks, at any rate,\u201d Augustus said. I could hear annoyance in his voice.</p><p>\u201cSo here I am,\u201d Van Houten said after a moment. \u201cWhat are your questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Augustus said.</p><p>\u201cHe seemed so intelligent in print,\u201d Van Houten said to Lidewij regarding Augustus. \u201cPerhaps the cancer has established a beachhead in his brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Lidewij said, duly horrified.</p> <p>I was horrified, too, but there was something pleasant about a guy so despicable that he wouldn\u2019t treat us deferentially. \u201cWe do have some questions, actually,\u201d I said. \u201cI talked about them in my email. I don\u2019t know if you remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis memory is compromised,\u201d Lidewij said.</p><p>\u201cIf only my memory would compromise,\u201d Van Houten responded.</p><p>\u201cSo, our questions,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cShe uses the royal we,\u201d Peter said to no one in particular. Another sip. I didn\u2019t know what Scotch tasted like, but if it tasted anything like champagne, I couldn\u2019t imagine how he could drink so much, so quickly, so early in the morning. \u201cAre you familiar with Zeno\u2019s tortoise paradox?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>\u201cWe have questions about what happens to the characters after the end of the book, specifically Anna\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wrongly assume that I need to hear your question in order to answer it. You are familiar with the philosopher Zeno?\u201d I shook my head vaguely. \u201cAlas. Zeno was a pre-Socratic philosopher who is said to have discovered forty paradoxes within the worldview put forth by Parmenides\u2014surely you know Parmenides,\u201d he said, and I nodded that I knew Parmenides, although I did not. \u201cThank God,\u201d he said. \u201cZeno professionally specialized in revealing the inaccuracies and oversimplifications of Parmenides, which wasn\u2019t difficult, since Parmenides was spectacularly wrong everywhere and always. Parmenides is valuable in precisely the way that it is valuable to have an acquaintance who reliably picks the wrong horse each and every time you take him to the racetrack. But Zeno\u2019s most important\u2014wait, give me a sense of your familiarity with Swedish hip-hop.\u201d</p><p>I could not tell if Peter Van Houten was kidding. After a moment, Augustus answered for me. \u201cLimited,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but presumably you know Afasi och Filthy\u2019s seminal album Fl\u00e4cken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do not,\u201d I said for the both of us.</p><p>\u201cLidewij, play \u2018Bomfalleralla\u2019 immediately.\u201d Lidewij walked over to an MP3 player, spun the wheel a bit, then hit a button. A rap song boomed from every direction. It sounded like a fairly regular rap song, except the words were in Swedish.</p><p>After it was over, Peter Van Houten looked at us expectantly, his little eyes as wide as they could get. \u201cYeah?\u201d he asked. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, but we don\u2019t speak Swedish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course you don\u2019t. Neither do I. Who the hell speaks Swedish? The important thing is not whatever nonsense the voices are saying, but what the voices are feeling. Surely you know that there are only two emotions, love and fear, and that Afasi och Filthy navigate between them with the kind of facility that one simply does not find in hip-hop music outside of Sweden. Shall I play it for you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you joking?\u201d Gus said.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this some kind of performance?\u201d He looked up at Lidewij and asked, \u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d Lidewij answered. \u201cHe\u2019s not always\u2014this is unusually\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up, Lidewij. Rudolf Otto said that if you had not encountered the numinous, if you have not experienced a nonrational encounter with the mysterium tremendum, then his work was not for you. And I say to you, young friends, that if you cannot hear Afasi och Filthy\u2019s bravadic response to fear, then my work is not for you.\u201d</p><p>I cannot emphasize this enough: It was a completely normal rap song, except in Swedish. \u201cUm,\u201d I said. \u201cSo about An Imperial Affliction. Anna\u2019s mom, when the book ends, is about to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Van Houten interrupted me, tapping his glass as he talked until Lidewij refilled it again. \u201cSo Zeno is most famous for his tortoise paradox. Let us imagine that you are in a race with a tortoise. The tortoise has a ten-yard head start. In the time it takes you to run that ten yards, the tortoise has maybe moved one yard. And then in the time it takes you to make up that distance, the tortoise goes a bit farther, and so on forever. You are faster than the tortoise but you can never catch him; you can only decrease his lead.</p><p>\u201cOf course, you just run past the tortoise without contemplating the mechanics involved, but the question of how you are able to do this turns out to be incredibly complicated, and no one really solved it until Cantor showed us that some infinities are bigger than other infinities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI assume that answers your question,\u201d he said confidently, then sipped generously from his glass.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I said. \u201cWe were wondering, after the end of An Imperial Affliction\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disavow everything in that putrid novel,\u201d Van Houten said, cutting me off.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that is not acceptable,\u201d I said. \u201cI understand that the story ends midnarrative because Anna dies or becomes too sick to continue, but you said you would tell us what happens to everybody, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here, and we, I need you to tell me.\u201d</p><p>Van Houten sighed. After another drink, he said, \u201cVery well. Whose story do you seek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna\u2019s mom, the Dutch Tulip Man, Sisyphus the Hamster, I mean, just\u2014what happens to everyone.\u201d</p><p>Van Houten closed his eyes and puffed his cheeks as he exhaled, then looked up at the exposed wooden beams crisscrossing the ceiling. \u201cThe hamster,\u201d he said after a while. \u201cThe hamster gets adopted by Christine\u201d\u2014who was one of Anna\u2019s presickness friends. That made sense. Christine and Anna played with Sisyphus in a few scenes. \u201cHe is adopted by Christine and lives for a couple years after the end of the novel and dies peacefully in his hamster sleep.\u201d</p><p>Now we were getting somewhere. \u201cGreat,\u201d I said. \u201cGreat. Okay, so the Dutch Tulip Man. Is he a con man? Do he and Anna\u2019s mom get married?\u201d</p><p>Van Houten was still staring at the ceiling beams. He took a drink. The glass was almost empty again. \u201cLidewij, I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t.\u201d He leveled his gaze to me. \u201cNothing happens to the Dutch Tulip Man. He isn\u2019t a con man or not a con man; he\u2019s God. He\u2019s an obvious and unambiguous metaphorical representation of God, and asking what becomes of him is the intellectual equivalent of asking what becomes of the disembodied eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg in Gatsby. Do he and Anna\u2019s mom get married? We are speaking of a novel, dear child, not some historical enterprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, but surely you must have thought about what happens to them, I mean as characters, I mean independent of their metaphorical meanings or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fictions,\u201d he said, tapping his glass again. \u201cNothing happens to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d tell me,\u201d I insisted. I reminded myself to be assertive. I needed to keep his addled attention on my questions.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but I was under the misguided impression that you were incapable of transatlantic travel. I was trying . . . to provide you some comfort, I suppose, which I should know better than to attempt. But to be perfectly frank, this childish idea that the author of a novel has some special insight into the characters in the novel . . . it\u2019s ridiculous. That novel was composed of scratches on a page, dear. The characters inhabiting it have no life outside of those scratches. What happened to them? They all ceased to exist the moment the novel ended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. I pushed myself up off the couch. \u201cNo, I understand that, but it\u2019s impossible not to imagine a future for them. You are the most qualified person to imagine that future. Something happened to Anna\u2019s mother. She either got married or didn\u2019t. She either moved to Holland with the Dutch Tulip Man or didn\u2019t. She either had more kids or didn\u2019t. I need to know what happens to her.\u201d</p><p>Van Houten pursed his lips. \u201cI regret that I cannot indulge your childish whims, but I refuse to pity you in the manner to which you are well accustomed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your pity,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cLike all sick children,\u201d he answered dispassionately, \u201cyou say you don\u2019t want pity, but your very existence depends upon it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Lidewij said, but he continued as he reclined there, his words getting rounder in his drunken mouth. \u201cSick children inevitably become arrested: You are fated to live out your days as the child you were when diagnosed, the child who believes there is life after a novel ends. And we, as adults, we pity this, so we pay for your treatments, for your oxygen machines. We give you food and water though you are unlikely to live long enough\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPETER!\u201d Lidewij shouted.</p><p>\u201cYou are a side effect,\u201d Van Houten continued, \u201cof an evolutionary process that cares little for individual lives. You are a failed experiment in mutation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI RESIGN!\u201d Lidewij shouted. There were tears in her eyes. But I wasn\u2019t angry. He was looking for the most hurtful way to tell the truth, but of course I already knew the truth. I\u2019d had years of staring at ceilings from my bedroom to the ICU, and so I\u2019d long ago found the most hurtful ways to imagine my own illness. I stepped toward him. \u201cListen, douchepants,\u201d I said, \u201cyou\u2019re not going to tell me anything about disease I don\u2019t already know. I need one and only one thing from you before I walk out of your life forever: WHAT HAPPENS TO ANNA\u2019S MOTHER?\u201d</p><p>He raised his flabby chins vaguely toward me and shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI can no more tell you what happens to her than I can tell you what becomes of Proust\u2019s Narrator or Holden Caulfield\u2019s sister or Huckleberry Finn after he lights out for the territories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBULLSHIT! That\u2019s bullshit. Just tell me! Make something up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and I\u2019ll thank you not to curse in my house. It isn\u2019t becoming of a lady.\u201d</p><p>I still wasn\u2019t angry, exactly, but I was very focused on getting the thing I\u2019d been promised. Something inside me welled up and I reached down and smacked the swollen hand that held the glass of Scotch. What remained of the Scotch splashed across the vast expanse of his face, the glass bouncing off his nose and then spinning balletically through the air, landing with a shattering crash on the ancient hardwood floors.</p><p>\u201cLidewij,\u201d Van Houten said calmly, \u201cI\u2019ll have a martini, if you please. Just a whisper of vermouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have resigned,\u201d Lidewij said after a moment.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to do. Being nice hadn\u2019t worked. Being mean hadn\u2019t worked. I needed an answer. I\u2019d come all this way, hijacked Augustus\u2019s Wish. I needed to know.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever stopped to wonder,\u201d he said, his words slurring now, \u201cwhy you care so much about your silly questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYOU PROMISED!\u201d I shouted, hearing Isaac\u2019s impotent wailing echoing from the night of the broken trophies. Van Houten didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>I was still standing over him, waiting for him to say something to me when I felt Augustus\u2019s hand on my arm. He pulled me away toward the door, and I followed him while Van Houten ranted to Lidewij about the ingratitude of contemporary teenagers and the death of polite society, and Lidewij, somewhat hysterical, shouted back at him in rapid-fire Dutch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive my former assistant,\u201d he said. \u201cDutch is not so much a language as an ailment of the throat.\u201d</p><p>Augustus pulled me out of the room and through the door to the late spring morning and the falling confetti of the elms.</p><p>For me there was no such thing as a quick getaway, but we made our way down the stairs, Augustus holding my cart, and then started to walk back toward the Filosoof on a bumpy sidewalk of interwoven rectangular bricks. For the first time since the swing set, I started crying.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, touching my waist. \u201cHey. It\u2019s okay.\u201d I nodded and wiped my face with the back of my hand. \u201cHe sucks.\u201d I nodded again. \u201cI\u2019ll write you an epilogue,\u201d Gus said. That made me cry harder. \u201cI will,\u201d he said. \u201cI will. Better than any shit that drunk could write. His brain is Swiss cheese. He doesn\u2019t even remember writing the book. I can write ten times the story that guy can. There will be blood and guts and sacrifice. An Imperial Affliction meets The Price of Dawn. You\u2019ll love it.\u201d I kept nodding, faking a smile, and then he hugged me, his strong arms pulling me into his muscular chest, and I sogged up his polo shirt a little but then recovered enough to speak.</p> <p>\u201cI spent your Wish on that doucheface,\u201d I said into his chest.</p><p>\u201cHazel Grace. No. I will grant you that you did spend my one and only Wish, but you did not spend it on him. You spent it on us.\u201d</p><p>Behind us, I heard the plonk plonk of high heels running. I turned around. It was Lidewij, her eyeliner running down her cheeks, duly horrified, chasing us up the sidewalk. \u201cPerhaps we should go to the Anne Frank Huis,\u201d Lidewij said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with that monster,\u201d Augustus said.</p><p>\u201cHe is not invited,\u201d Lidewij said.</p> <p>Augustus kept holding me, protective, his hand on the side of my face. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d he started, but I cut him off.</p><p>\u201cWe should go.\u201d I still wanted answers from Van Houten. But it wasn\u2019t all I wanted. I only had two days left in Amsterdam with Augustus Waters. I wouldn\u2019t let a sad old man ruin them.</p><p>Lidewij drove a clunky gray Fiat with an engine that sounded like an excited four-year-old girl. As we drove through the streets of Amsterdam, she repeatedly and profusely apologized. \u201cI am very sorry. There is no excuse. He is very sick,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought meeting you would help him, if he would see that his work has shaped real lives, but . . . I\u2019m very sorry. It is very, very embarrassing.\u201d Neither Augustus nor I said anything. I was in the backseat behind him. I snuck my hand between the side of the car and his seat, feeling for his hand, but I couldn\u2019t find it. Lidewij continued, \u201cI have continued this work because I believe he is a genius and because the pay is very good, but he has become a monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess he got pretty rich on that book,\u201d I said after a while.</p><p>\u201cOh, no no, he is of the Van Houtens,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the seventeenth century, his ancestor discovered how to mix cocoa into water. Some Van Houtens moved to the United States long ago, and Peter is of those, but he moved to Holland after his novel. He is an embarrassment to a great family.\u201d</p><p>The engine screamed. Lidewij shifted and we shot up a canal bridge. \u201cIt is circumstance,\u201d she said. \u201cCircumstance has made him so cruel. He is not an evil man. But this day, I did not think\u2014when he said these terrible things, I could not believe it. I am very sorry. Very very sorry.\u201d</p> <p>We had to park a block away from the Anne Frank House, and then while Lidewij stood in line to get tickets for us, I sat with my back against a little tree, looking at all the moored houseboats in the Prinsengracht canal. Augustus was standing above me, rolling my oxygen cart in lazy circles, just watching the wheels spin. I wanted him to sit next to me, but I knew it was hard for him to sit, and harder still to stand back up. \u201cOkay?\u201d he asked, looking down at me. I shrugged and reached a hand for his calf. It was his fake calf, but I held on to it. He looked down at me.</p><p>\u201cI wanted . . .\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI know. Apparently the world is not a wish-granting factory.\u201d That made me smile a little.</p><p>Lidewij returned with tickets, but her thin lips were pursed with worry. \u201cThere is no elevator,\u201d she said. \u201cI am very very sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo, there are many stairs,\u201d she said. \u201cSteep stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said again. Augustus started to say something, but I interrupted. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I can do it.\u201d</p><p>We began in a room with a video about Jews in Holland and the Nazi invasion and the Frank family. Then we walked upstairs into the canal house where Otto Frank\u2019s business had been. The stairs were slow, for me and Augustus both, but I felt strong. Soon I was staring at the famous bookcase that had hid Anne Frank, her family, and four others. The bookcase was half open, and behind it was an even steeper set of stairs, only wide enough for one person. There were fellow visitors all around us, and I didn\u2019t want to hold up the procession, but Lidewij said, \u201cIf everyone could be patient, please,\u201d and I began the walk up, Lidewij carrying the cart behind me, Gus behind her.</p> <p>It was fourteen steps. I kept thinking about the people behind me\u2014they were mostly adults speaking a variety of languages\u2014and feeling embarrassed or whatever, feeling like a ghost that both comforts and haunts, but finally I made it up, and then I was in an eerily empty room, leaning against the wall, my brain telling my lungs it\u2019s okay it\u2019s okay calm down it\u2019s okay and my lungs telling my brain oh, God, we\u2019re dying here. I didn\u2019t even see Augustus come upstairs, but he came over and wiped his brow with the back of his hand like whew and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a champion.\u201d</p><p>After a few minutes of wall-leaning, I made it to the next room, which Anne had shared with the dentist Fritz Pfeffer. It was tiny, empty of all furniture. You\u2019d never know anyone had ever lived there except that the pictures Anne had pasted onto the wall from magazines and newspapers were still there.</p><p>Another staircase led up to the room where the van Pels family had lived, this one steeper than the last and eighteen steps, essentially a glorified ladder. I got to the threshold and looked up and figured I could not do it, but also knew the only way through was up.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back,\u201d Gus said behind me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I answered quietly. It\u2019s stupid, but I kept thinking I owed it to her\u2014to Anne Frank, I mean\u2014because she was dead and I wasn\u2019t, because she had stayed quiet and kept the blinds drawn and done everything right and still died, and so I should go up the steps and see the rest of the world she\u2019d lived in those years before the Gestapo came.</p><p>I began to climb the stairs, crawling up them like a little kid would, slow at first so I could breathe, but then faster because I knew I couldn\u2019t breathe and wanted to get to the top before everything gave out. The blackness encroached around my field of vision as I pulled myself up, eighteen steps, steep as hell. I finally crested the staircase mostly blind and nauseated, the muscles in my arms and legs screaming for oxygen. I slumped seated against a wall, heaving watered-down coughs. There was an empty glass case bolted to the wall above me and I stared up through it to the ceiling and tried not to pass out.</p><p>Lidewij crouched down next to me, saying, \u201cYou are at the top, that is it,\u201d and I nodded. I had a vague awareness of the adults all around glancing down at me worriedly; of Lidewij speaking quietly in one language and then another and then another to various visitors; of Augustus standing above me, his hand on the top of my head, stroking my hair along the part.</p><p>After a long time, Lidewij and Augustus pulled me to my feet and I saw what was protected by the glass case: pencil marks on the wallpaper measuring the growth of all the children in the annex during the period they lived there, inch after inch until they would grow no more.</p><p>From there, we left the Franks\u2019 living area, but we were still in the museum: A long narrow hallway showed pictures of each of the annex\u2019s eight residents and described how and where and when they died.</p><p>\u201cThe only member of his whole family who survived the war,\u201d Lidewij told us, referring to Anne\u2019s father, Otto. Her voice was hushed like we were in church.</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t survive a war, not really,\u201d Augustus said. \u201cHe survived a genocide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Lidewij said. \u201cI do not know how you go on, without your family. I do not know.\u201d As I read about each of the seven who died, I thought of Otto Frank not being a father anymore, left with a diary instead of a wife and two daughters. At the end of the hallway, a huge book, bigger than a dictionary, contained the names of the 103,000 dead from the Netherlands in the Holocaust. (Only 5,000 of the deported Dutch Jews, a wall label explained, had survived. 5,000 Otto Franks.) The book was turned to the page with Anne Frank\u2019s name, but what got me about it was the fact that right beneath her name there were four Aron Franks. Four. Four Aron Franks without museums, without historical markers, without anyone to mourn them. I silently resolved to remember and pray for the four Aron Franks as long as I was around. (Maybe some people need to believe in a proper and omnipotent God to pray, but I don\u2019t.)</p><p>As we got to the end of the room, Gus stopped and said, \u201cYou okay?\u201d I nodded.</p><p>He gestured back toward Anne\u2019s picture. \u201cThe worst part is that she almost lived, you know? She died weeks away from liberation.\u201d</p><p>Lidewij took a few steps away to watch a video, and I grabbed Augustus\u2019s hand as we walked into the next room. It was an A-frame room with some letters Otto Frank had written to people during his months-long search for his daughters. On the wall in the middle of the room, a video of Otto Frank played. He was speaking in English.</p><p>\u201cAre there any Nazis left that I could hunt down and bring to justice?\u201d Augustus asked while we leaned over the vitrines reading Otto\u2019s letters and the gutting replies that no, no one had seen his children after the liberation.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re all dead. But it\u2019s not like the Nazis had a monopoly on evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we should do, Hazel Grace: We should team up and be this disabled vigilante duo roaring through the world, righting wrongs, defending the weak, protecting the endangered.\u201d</p><p>Although it was his dream and not mine, I indulged it. He\u2019d indulged mine, after all. \u201cOur fearlessness shall be our secret weapon,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThe tales of our exploits will survive as long as the human voice itself,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd even after that, when the robots recall the human absurdities of sacrifice and compassion, they will remember us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will robot-laugh at our courageous folly,\u201d he said. \u201cBut something in their iron robot hearts will yearn to have lived and died as we did: on the hero\u2019s errand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAugustus Waters,\u201d I said, looking up at him, thinking that you cannot kiss anyone in the Anne Frank House, and then thinking that Anne Frank, after all, kissed someone in the Anne Frank House, and that she would probably like nothing more than for her home to have become a place where the young and irreparably broken sink into love.</p><p>\u201cI must say,\u201d Otto Frank said on the video in his accented English, \u201cI was very much surprised by the deep thoughts Anne had.\u201d</p><p>And then we were kissing. My hand let go of the oxygen cart and I reached up for his neck, and he pulled me up by my waist onto my tiptoes. As his parted lips met mine, I started to feel breathless in a new and fascinating way. The space around us evaporated, and for a weird moment I really liked my body; this cancer-ruined thing I\u2019d spent years dragging around suddenly seemed worth the struggle, worth the chest tubes and the PICC lines and the ceaseless bodily betrayal of the tumors.</p><p>\u201cIt was quite a different Anne I had known as my daughter. She never really showed this kind of inner feeling,\u201d Otto Frank continued.</p><p>The kiss lasted forever as Otto Frank kept talking from behind me. \u201cAnd my conclusion is,\u201d he said, \u201csince I had been in very good terms with Anne, that most parents don\u2019t know really their children.\u201d</p><p>I realized that my eyes were closed and opened them. Augustus was staring at me, his blue eyes closer to me than they\u2019d ever been, and behind him, a crowd of people three deep had sort of circled around us. They were angry, I thought. Horrified. These teenagers, with their hormones, making out beneath a video broadcasting the shattered voice of a former father.</p><p>I pulled away from Augustus, and he snuck a peck onto my forehead as I stared down at my Chuck Taylors. And then they started clapping. All the people, all these adults, just started clapping, and one shouted \u201cBravo!\u201d in a European accent. Augustus, smiling, bowed. Laughing, I curtsied ever so slightly, which was met with another round of applause.</p><p>We made our way downstairs, letting all the adults go down first, and right before we got to the caf\u00e9 (where blessedly an elevator took us back down to ground level and the gift shop) we saw pages of Anne\u2019s diary, and also her unpublished book of quotations. The quote book happened to be turned to a page of Shakespeare quotations. For who so firm that cannot be seduced? she\u2019d written.</p><p>Lidewij drove us back to the Filosoof. Outside the hotel, it was drizzling and Augustus and I stood on the brick sidewalk slowly getting wet.</p><p>Augustus: \u201cYou probably need some rest.\u201d</p><p>Me: \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Augustus: \u201cOkay.\u201d (Pause.) \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>Me: \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>Augustus: \u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>Me: \u201c\u2018I do not know which to prefer, / The beauty of inflections / Or the beauty of innuendos, / The blackbird whistling / Or just after.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Augustus: \u201cGod, you are sexy.\u201d</p><p>Me: \u201cWe could go to your room.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Augustus: \u201cI\u2019ve heard worse ideas.\u201d</p><p>We squeezed into the tiny elevator together. Every surface, including the floor, was mirrored. We had to pull the door to shut ourselves in and then the old thing creaked slowly up to the second floor. I was tired and sweaty and worried that I generally looked and smelled gross, but even so I kissed him in that elevator, and then he pulled away and pointed at the mirror and said, \u201cLook, infinite Hazels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome infinities are larger than other infinities,\u201d I drawled, mimicking Van Houten.</p><p>\u201cWhat an assclown,\u201d Augustus said, and it took all that time and more just to get us to the second floor. Finally the elevator lurched to a halt, and he pushed the mirrored door open. When it was half open, he winced in pain and lost his grip on the door for a second.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>After a second, he said, \u201cYeah, yeah, door\u2019s just heavy, I guess.\u201d He pushed again and got it open. He let me walk out first, of course, but then I didn\u2019t know which direction to walk down the hallway, and so I just stood there outside the elevator and he stood there, too, his face still contorted, and I said again, \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust out of shape, Hazel Grace. All is well.\u201d</p><p>We were just standing there in the hallway, and he wasn\u2019t leading the way to his room or anything, and I didn\u2019t know where his room was, and as the stalemate continued, I became convinced he was trying to figure out a way not to hook up with me, that I never should have suggested the idea in the first place, that it was unladylike and therefore had disgusted Augustus Waters, who was standing there looking at me unblinking, trying to think of a way to extricate himself from the situation politely. And then, after forever, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s above my knee and it just tapers a little and then it\u2019s just skin. There\u2019s a nasty scar, but it just looks like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cMy leg,\u201d he said. \u201cJust so you\u2019re prepared in case, I mean, in case you see it or what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, get over yourself,\u201d I said, and took the two steps I needed to get to him. I kissed him, hard, pressing him against the wall, and I kept kissing him as he fumbled for the room key.</p><p>We crawled into the bed, my freedom circumscribed some by the oxygen, but even so I could get on top of him and take his shirt off and taste the sweat on the skin below his collarbone as I whispered into his skin, \u201cI love you, Augustus Waters,\u201d his body relaxing beneath mine as he heard me say it. He reached down and tried to pull my shirt off, but it got tangled in the tube. I laughed.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do this every day?\u201d he asked as I disentangled my shirt from the tubes. Idiotically, it occurred to me that my pink underwear didn\u2019t match my purple bra, as if boys even notice such things. I crawled under the covers and kicked out of my jeans and socks and then watched the comforter dance as beneath it, Augustus removed first his jeans and then his leg.</p><p>We were lying on our backs next to each other, everything hidden by the covers, and after a second I reached over for his thigh and let my hand trail downward to the stump, the thick scarred skin. I held the stump for a second. He flinched. \u201cIt hurts?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He flipped himself onto his side and kissed me. \u201cYou\u2019re so hot,\u201d I said, my hand still on his leg.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to think you have an amputee fetish,\u201d he answered, still kissing me. I laughed.</p><p>\u201cI have an Augustus Waters fetish,\u201d I explained.</p><p>The whole affair was the precise opposite of what I figured it would be: slow and patient and quiet and neither particularly painful nor particularly ecstatic. There were a lot of condomy problems that I did not get a particularly good look at. No headboards were broken. No screaming. Honestly, it was probably the longest time we\u2019d ever spent together without talking.</p><p>Only one thing followed type: Afterward, when I had my face resting against Augustus\u2019s chest, listening to his heart pound, Augustus said, \u201cHazel Grace, I literally cannot keep my eyes open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMisuse of literality,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cSo. Tired.\u201d</p><p>His face turned away from me, my ear pressed to his chest, listening to his lungs settle into the rhythm of sleep. After a while, I got up, dressed, found the Hotel Filosoof stationery, and wrote him a love letter:</p> <p>Dearest Augustus,</p><p>yrs,</p><p>Hazel Grace</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>The next morning, our last full day in Amsterdam, Mom and Augustus and I walked the half block from the hotel to the Vondelpark, where we found a caf\u00e9 in the shadow of the Dutch national film museum. Over lattes\u2014which, the waiter explained to us, the Dutch called \u201cwrong coffee\u201d because it had more milk than coffee\u2014we sat in the lacy shade of a huge chestnut tree and recounted for Mom our encounter with the great Peter Van Houten. We made the story funny. You have a choice in this world, I believe, about how to tell sad stories, and we made the funny choice: Augustus, slumped in the caf\u00e9 chair, pretended to be the tongue-tied, word-slurring Van Houten who could not so much as push himself out of his chair; I stood up to play a me all full of bluster and machismo, shouting, \u201cGet up, you fat ugly old man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you call him ugly?\u201d Augustus asked.</p><p>\u201cJust go with it,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m naht uggy. You\u2019re the uggy one, nosetube girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a coward!\u201d I rumbled, and Augustus broke character to laugh. I sat down. We told Mom about the Anne Frank House, leaving out the kissing.</p><p>\u201cDid you go back to chez Van Houten afterward?\u201d Mom asked.</p><p>Augustus didn\u2019t even give me time to blush. \u201cNah, we just hung out at a caf\u00e9. Hazel amused me with some Venn diagram humor.\u201d He glanced at me. God, he was sexy.</p><p>\u201cSounds lovely,\u201d she said. \u201cListen, I\u2019m going to go for a walk. Give the two of you time to talk,\u201d she said at Gus, an edge in it. \u201cThen maybe later we can go for a tour on a canal boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, okay?\u201d I said. Mom left a five-euro note under her saucer and then kissed me on the top of the head, whispering, \u201cI love love love you,\u201d which was two more loves than usual.</p><p>Gus motioned down to the shadows of the branches intersecting and coming apart on the concrete. \u201cBeautiful, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSuch a good metaphor,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cIs it now?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe negative image of things blown together and then blown apart,\u201d he said. Before us, hundreds of people passed, jogging and biking and Rollerblading. Amsterdam was a city designed for movement and activity, a city that would rather not travel by car, and so inevitably I felt excluded from it. But God, was it beautiful, the creek carving a path around the huge tree, a heron standing still at the water\u2019s edge, searching for a breakfast amid the millions of elm petals floating in the water.</p><p>But Augustus didn\u2019t notice. He was too busy watching the shadows move. Finally, he said, \u201cI could look at this all day, but we should go to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have time?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He smiled sadly. \u201cIf only,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He nodded back in the direction of the hotel.</p><p>We walked in silence, Augustus a half step in front of me. I was too scared to ask if I had reason to be scared.</p><p>So there is this thing called Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs. Basically, this guy Abraham Maslow became famous for his theory that certain needs must be met before you can even have other kinds of needs. It looks like this:</p><p>Once your needs for food and water are fulfilled, you move up to the next set of needs, security, and then the next and the next, but the important thing is that, according to Maslow, until your physiological needs are satisfied, you can\u2019t even worry about security or social needs, let alone \u201cself-actualization,\u201d which is when you start to, like, make art and think about morality and quantum physics and stuff.</p><p>According to Maslow, I was stuck on the second level of the pyramid, unable to feel secure in my health and therefore unable to reach for love and respect and art and whatever else, which is, of course, utter horseshit: The urge to make art or contemplate philosophy does not go away when you are sick. Those urges just become transfigured by illness.</p><p>Maslow\u2019s pyramid seemed to imply that I was less human than other people, and most people seemed to agree with him. But not Augustus. I always thought he could love me because he\u2019d once been sick. Only now did it occur to me that maybe he still was.</p><p>We arrived in my room, the Kierkegaard. I sat down on the bed expecting him to join me, but he hunkered down in the dusty paisley chair. That chair. How old was it? Fifty years?</p><p>I felt the ball in the base of my throat hardening as I watched him pull a cigarette from his pack and stick it between his lips. He leaned back and sighed. \u201cJust before you went into the ICU, I started to feel this ache in my hip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. Panic rolled in, pulled me under.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSo I went in for a PET scan.\u201d He stopped. He yanked the cigarette out of his mouth and clenched his teeth.</p><p>Much of my life had been devoted to trying not to cry in front of people who loved me, so I knew what Augustus was doing. You clench your teeth. You look up. You tell yourself that if they see you cry, it will hurt them, and you will be nothing but A Sadness in their lives, and you must not become a mere sadness, so you will not cry, and you say all of this to yourself while looking up at the ceiling, and then you swallow even though your throat does not want to close and you look at the person who loves you and smile.</p><p>He flashed his crooked smile, then said, \u201cI lit up like a Christmas tree, Hazel Grace. The lining of my chest, my left hip, my liver, everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Everywhere. That word hung in the air awhile. We both knew what it meant. I got up, dragging my body and the cart across carpet that was older than Augustus would ever be, and I knelt at the base of the chair and put my head in his lap and hugged him by the waist.</p><p>He was stroking my hair. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you,\u201d he said, his voice calm. \u201cYour mom must know. The way she looked at me. My mom must\u2019ve just told her or something. I should\u2019ve told you. It was stupid. Selfish.\u201d</p><p>I knew why he hadn\u2019t said anything, of course: the same reason I hadn\u2019t wanted him to see me in the ICU. I couldn\u2019t be mad at him for even a moment, and only now that I loved a grenade did I understand the foolishness of trying to save others from my own impending fragmentation: I couldn\u2019t unlove Augustus Waters. And I didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s just so goddamned unfair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe world,\u201d he said, \u201cis not a wish-granting factory,\u201d and then he broke down, just for one moment, his sob roaring impotent like a clap of thunder unaccompanied by lightning, the terrible ferocity that amateurs in the field of suffering might mistake for weakness. Then he pulled me to him and, his face inches from mine, resolved, \u201cI\u2019ll fight it. I\u2019ll fight it for you. Don\u2019t you worry about me, Hazel Grace. I\u2019m okay. I\u2019ll find a way to hang around and annoy you for a long time.\u201d</p><p>I was crying. But even then he was strong, holding me tight so that I could see the sinewy muscles of his arms wrapped around me as he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019ll be okay. I promise,\u201d and smiled his crooked smile.</p><p>He kissed my forehead, and then I felt his powerful chest deflate just a little. \u201cI guess I had a hamartia after all.\u201d</p><p>After a while, I pulled him over to the bed and we lay there together as he told me they\u2019d started palliative chemo, but he gave it up to go to Amsterdam, even though his parents were furious. They\u2019d tried to stop him right up until that morning, when I heard him screaming that his body belonged to him. \u201cWe could have rescheduled,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo, we couldn\u2019t have,\u201d he answered. \u201cAnyway, it wasn\u2019t working. I could tell it wasn\u2019t working, you know?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s just bullshit, the whole thing,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll try something else when I get home. They\u2019ve always got a new idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, having been the experimental pincushion myself.</p><p>\u201cI kind of conned you into believing you were falling in love with a healthy person,\u201d he said.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d have done the same to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve, but we can\u2019t all be as awesome as you.\u201d He kissed me, then grimaced.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Just.\u201d He stared at the ceiling for a long time before saying, \u201cI like this world. I like drinking champagne. I like not smoking. I like the sound of Dutch people speaking Dutch. And now . . . I don\u2019t even get a battle. I don\u2019t get a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get to battle cancer,\u201d I said. \u201cThat is your battle. And you\u2019ll keep fighting,\u201d I told him. I hated it when people tried to build me up to prepare for battle, but I did it to him, anyway. \u201cYou\u2019ll . . . you\u2019ll . . . live your best life today. This is your war now.\u201d I despised myself for the cheesy sentiment, but what else did I have?</p><p>\u201cSome war,\u201d he said dismissively. \u201cWhat am I at war with? My cancer. And what is my cancer? My cancer is me. The tumors are made of me. They\u2019re made of me as surely as my brain and my heart are made of me. It is a civil war, Hazel Grace, with a predetermined winner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGus,\u201d I said. I couldn\u2019t say anything else. He was too smart for the kinds of solace I could offer.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. But it wasn\u2019t. After a moment, he said, \u201cIf you go to the Rijksmuseum, which I really wanted to do\u2014but who are we kidding, neither of us can walk through a museum. But anyway, I looked at the collection online before we left. If you were to go, and hopefully someday you will, you would see a lot of paintings of dead people. You\u2019d see Jesus on the cross, and you\u2019d see a dude getting stabbed in the neck, and you\u2019d see people dying at sea and in battle and a parade of martyrs. But Not. One. Single. Cancer. Kid. Nobody biting it from the plague or smallpox or yellow fever or whatever, because there is no glory in illness. There is no meaning to it. There is no honor in dying of.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Abraham Maslow, I present to you Augustus Waters, whose existential curiosity dwarfed that of his well-fed, well-loved, healthy brethren. While the mass of men went on leading thoroughly unexamined lives of monstrous consumption, Augustus Waters examined the collection of the Rijksmuseum from afar.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Augustus asked after a while.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m just . . .\u201d I couldn\u2019t finish the sentence, didn\u2019t know how to. \u201cI\u2019m just very, very fond of you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled with half his mouth, his nose inches from mine. \u201cThe feeling is mutual. I don\u2019t suppose you can forget about it and treat me like I\u2019m not dying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re dying,\u201d I said. \u201cI think you\u2019ve just got a touch of cancer.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. Gallows humor. \u201cI\u2019m on a roller coaster that only goes up,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd it is my privilege and my responsibility to ride all the way up with you,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWould it be absolutely ludicrous to try to make out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no try,\u201d I said. \u201cThere is only do.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>On the flight home, twenty thousand feet above clouds that were ten thousand feet above the ground, Gus said, \u201cI used to think it would be fun to live on a cloud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cLike it would be like one of those inflatable moonwalk machines, except for always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then in middle school science, Mr. Martinez asked who among us had ever fantasized about living in the clouds, and everyone raised their hand. Then Mr. Martinez told us that up in the clouds the wind blew one hundred and fifty miles an hour and the temperature was thirty below zero and there was no oxygen and we\u2019d all die within seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a nice guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe specialized in the murder of dreams, Hazel Grace, let me tell you. You think volcanoes are awesome? Tell that to the ten thousand screaming corpses at Pompeii. You still secretly believe that there is an element of magic to this world? It\u2019s all just soulless molecules bouncing against each other randomly. Do you worry about who will take care of you if your parents die? As well you should, because they will be worm food in the fullness of time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIgnorance is bliss,\u201d I said.</p><p>A flight attendant walked through the aisle with a beverage cart, half whispering, \u201cDrinks? Drinks? Drinks? Drinks?\u201d Gus leaned over me, raising his hand. \u201cCould we have some champagne, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re twenty-one?\u201d she asked dubiously. I conspicuously rearranged the nubbins in my nose. The stewardess smiled, then glanced down at my sleeping mother. \u201cShe won\u2019t mind?\u201d she asked of Mom.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d I said.</p><p>So she poured champagne into two plastic cups. Cancer Perks.</p><p>Gus and I toasted. \u201cTo you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTo you,\u201d I said, touching my cup to his.</p><p>We sipped. Dimmer stars than we\u2019d had at Oranjee, but still good enough to drink.</p> <p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Gus said to me, \u201ceverything Van Houten said was true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but he didn\u2019t have to be such a douche about it. I can\u2019t believe he imagined a future for Sisyphus the Hamster but not for Anna\u2019s mom.\u201d</p><p>Augustus shrugged. He seemed to zone out all of a sudden. \u201cOkay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He shook his head microscopically. \u201cHurts,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cChest?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. Fists clenched. Later, he would describe it as a one-legged fat man wearing a stiletto heel standing on the middle of his chest. I returned my seat-back tray to its upright and locked position and bent forward to dig pills out of his backpack. He swallowed one with champagne. \u201cOkay?\u201d I asked again.</p><p>Gus sat there, pumping his fist, waiting for the medicine to work, the medicine that did not kill the pain so much as distance him from it (and from me).</p><p>\u201cIt was like it was personal,\u201d Gus said quietly. \u201cLike he was mad at us for some reason. Van Houten, I mean.\u201d He drank the rest of his champagne in a quick series of gulps and soon fell asleep.</p><p>My dad was waiting for us in baggage claim, standing amid all the limo drivers in suits holding signs printed with the last names of their passengers: JOHNSON, BARRINGTON, CARMICHAEL. Dad had a sign of his own. MY BEAUTIFUL FAMILY, it read, and then underneath that (AND GUS).</p><p>I hugged him, and he started crying (of course). As we drove home, Gus and I told Dad stories of Amsterdam, but it wasn\u2019t until I was home and hooked up to Philip watching good ol\u2019 American television with Dad and eating American pizza off napkins on our laps that I told him about Gus.</p><p>\u201cGus had a recurrence,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. He scooted over toward me, and then added, \u201cHis mom told us before the trip. I\u2019m sorry he kept it from you. I\u2019m . . . I\u2019m sorry, Hazel.\u201d I didn\u2019t say anything for a long time. The show we were watching was about people who are trying to pick which house they are going to buy. \u201cSo I read An Imperial Affliction while you guys were gone,\u201d Dad said.</p><p>I turned my head up to him. \u201cOh, cool. What\u2019d you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was good. A little over my head. I was a biochemistry major, remember, not a literature guy. I do wish it had ended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cCommon complaint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, it was a bit hopeless,\u201d he said. \u201cA bit defeatist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf by defeatist you mean honest, then I agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think defeatism is honest,\u201d Dad answered. \u201cI refuse to accept that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo everything happens for a reason and we\u2019ll all go live in the clouds and play harps and live in mansions?\u201d</p><p>Dad smiled. He put a big arm around me and pulled me to him, kissing the side of my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I believe, Hazel. I thought being an adult meant knowing what you believe, but that has not been my experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He told me again that he was sorry about Gus, and then we went back to watching the show, and the people picked a house, and Dad still had his arm around me, and I was kinda starting to fall asleep, but I didn\u2019t want to go to bed, and then Dad said, \u201cYou know what I believe? I remember in college I was taking this math class, this really great math class taught by this tiny old woman. She was talking about fast Fourier transforms and she stopped midsentence and said, \u2018Sometimes it seems the universe wants to be noticed.\u2019</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I believe. I believe the universe wants to be noticed. I think the universe is improbably biased toward consciousness, that it rewards intelligence in part because the universe enjoys its elegance being observed. And who am I, living in the middle of history, to tell the universe that it\u2014or my observation of it\u2014is temporary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are fairly smart,\u201d I said after a while.</p><p>\u201cYou are fairly good at compliments,\u201d he answered.</p><p>The next afternoon, I drove over to Gus\u2019s house and ate peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches with his parents and told them stories about Amsterdam while Gus napped on the living room couch, where we\u2019d watched V for Vendetta. I could just see him from the kitchen: He lay on his back, head turned away from me, a PICC line already in. They were attacking the cancer with a new cocktail: two chemo drugs and a protein receptor that they hoped would turn off the oncogene in Gus\u2019s cancer. He was lucky to get enrolled in the trial, they told me. Lucky. I knew one of the drugs. Hearing the sound of its name made me want to barf.</p><p>After a while, Isaac\u2019s mom brought him over.</p><p>\u201cIsaac, hi, it\u2019s Hazel from Support Group, not your evil ex-girlfriend.\u201d His mom walked him to me, and I pulled myself out of the dining room chair and hugged him, his body taking a moment to find me before he hugged me back, hard.</p><p>\u201cHow was Amsterdam?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWaters,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere are ya, bro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s napping,\u201d I said, and my voice caught. Isaac shook his head, everyone quiet.</p><p>\u201cSucks,\u201d Isaac said after a second. His mom walked him to a chair she\u2019d pulled out. He sat.</p><p>\u201cI can still dominate your blind ass at Counterinsurgence,\u201d Augustus said without turning toward us. The medicine slowed his speech a bit, but only to the speed of regular people.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure all asses are blind,\u201d Isaac answered, reaching his hands into the air vaguely, looking for his mom. She grabbed him, pulled him up, and they walked over to the couch, where Gus and Isaac hugged awkwardly. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Isaac asked.</p><p>\u201cEverything tastes like pennies. Aside from that, I\u2019m on a roller coaster that only goes up, kid,\u201d Gus answered. Isaac laughed. \u201cHow are the eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, excellent,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re not in my head is the only problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome, yeah,\u201d Gus said. \u201cNot to one-up you or anything, but my body is made out of cancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I heard,\u201d Isaac said, trying not to let it get to him. He fumbled toward Gus\u2019s hand and found only his thigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taken,\u201d Gus said.</p><p>Isaac\u2019s mom brought over two dining room chairs, and Isaac and I sat down next to Gus. I took Gus\u2019s hand, stroking circles around the space between his thumb and forefinger.</p><p>The adults headed down to the basement to commiserate or whatever, leaving the three of us alone in the living room. After a while, Augustus turned his head to us, the waking up slow. \u201cHow\u2019s Monica?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t heard from her once,\u201d Isaac said. \u201cNo cards; no emails. I got this machine that reads me my emails. It\u2019s awesome. I can change the voice\u2019s gender or accent or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can like send you a porn story and you can have an old German man read it to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Isaac said. \u201cAlthough Mom still has to help me with it, so maybe hold off on the German porno for a week or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t even, like, texted you to ask how you\u2019re doing?\u201d I asked. This struck me as an unfathomable injustice.</p><p>\u201cTotal radio silence,\u201d Isaac said.</p><p>\u201cRidiculous,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve stopped thinking about it. I don\u2019t have time to have a girlfriend. I have like a full-time job Learning How to Be Blind.\u201d</p><p>Gus turned his head back away from us, staring out the window at the patio in his backyard. His eyes closed.</p><p>Isaac asked how I was doing, and I said I was good, and he told me there was a new girl in Support Group with a really hot voice and he needed me to go to tell him if she was actually hot. Then out of nowhere Augustus said, \u201cYou can\u2019t just not contact your former boyfriend after his eyes get cut out of his freaking head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one of\u2014\u201d Isaac started.</p><p>\u201cHazel Grace, do you have four dollars?\u201d asked Gus.</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I said. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. You\u2019ll find my leg under the coffee table,\u201d he said. Gus pushed himself upright and scooted down to the edge of the couch. I handed him the prosthetic; he fastened it in slow motion.</p><p>I helped him to stand and then offered my arm to Isaac, guiding him past furniture that suddenly seemed intrusive, realizing that, for the first time in years, I was the healthiest person in the room.</p><p>I drove. Augustus rode shotgun. Isaac sat in the back. We stopped at a grocery store, where, per Augustus\u2019s instruction, I bought a dozen eggs while he and Isaac waited in the car. And then Isaac guided us by his memory to Monica\u2019s house, an aggressively sterile, two-story house near the JCC. Monica\u2019s bright green 1990s Pontiac Firebird sat fat-wheeled in the driveway.</p><p>\u201cIs it there?\u201d Isaac asked when he felt me coming to a stop.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s there,\u201d Augustus said. \u201cYou know what it looks like, Isaac? It looks like all the hopes we were foolish to hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s inside?\u201d</p><p>Gus turned his head around slowly to look at Isaac. \u201cWho cares where she is? This is not about her. This is about you.\u201d Gus gripped the egg carton in his lap, then opened the door and pulled his legs out onto the street. He opened the door for Isaac, and I watched through the mirror as Gus helped Isaac out of the car, the two of them leaning on each other at the shoulder then tapering away, like praying hands that don\u2019t quite meet at the palms.</p><p>I rolled down the windows and watched from the car, because vandalism made me nervous. They took a few steps toward the car, then Gus flipped open the egg carton and handed Isaac an egg. Isaac tossed it, missing the car by a solid forty feet.</p><p>\u201cA little to the left,\u201d Gus said.</p><p>\u201cMy throw was a little to the left or I need to aim a little to the left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAim left.\u201d Isaac swiveled his shoulders. \u201cLefter,\u201d Gus said. Isaac swiveled again. \u201cYes. Excellent. And throw hard.\u201d Gus handed him another egg, and Isaac hurled it, the egg arcing over the car and smashing against the slow-sloping roof of the house. \u201cBull\u2019s-eye!\u201d Gus said.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Isaac asked excitedly.</p><p>\u201cNo, you threw it like twenty feet over the car. Just, throw hard, but keep it low. And a little right of where you were last time.\u201d Isaac reached over and found an egg himself from the carton Gus cradled. He tossed it, hitting a taillight. \u201cYes!\u201d Gus said. \u201cYes! TAILLIGHT!\u201d</p><p>Isaac reached for another egg, missed wide right, then another, missing low, then another, hitting the back windshield. He then nailed three in a row against the trunk. \u201cHazel Grace,\u201d Gus shouted back to me. \u201cTake a picture of this so Isaac can see it when they invent robot eyes.\u201d I pulled myself up so I was sitting in the rolled-down window, my elbows on the roof of the car, and snapped a picture with my phone: Augustus, an unlit cigarette in his mouth, his smile deliciously crooked, holds the mostly empty pink egg carton above his head. His other hand is draped around Isaac\u2019s shoulder, whose sunglasses are turned not quite toward the camera. Behind them, egg yolks drip down the windshield and bumper of the green Firebird. And behind that, a door is opening. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat,\u201d asked the middle-aged woman a moment after I\u2019d snapped the picture, \u201cin God\u2019s name\u2014\u201d and then she stopped talking.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d Augustus said, nodding toward her, \u201cyour daughter\u2019s car has just been deservedly egged by a blind man. Please close the door and go back inside or we\u2019ll be forced to call the police.\u201d After wavering for a moment, Monica\u2019s mom closed the door and disappeared. Isaac threw the last three eggs in quick succession and Gus then guided him back toward the car. \u201cSee, Isaac, if you just take\u2014we\u2019re coming to the curb now\u2014the feeling of legitimacy away from them, if you turn it around so they feel like they are committing a crime by watching\u2014a few more steps\u2014their cars get egged, they\u2019ll be confused and scared and worried and they\u2019ll just return to their\u2014you\u2019ll find the door handle directly in front of you\u2014quietly desperate lives.\u201d Gus hurried around the front of the car and installed himself in the shotgun seat. The doors closed, and I roared off, driving for several hundred feet before I realized I was headed down a dead-end street. I circled the cul-de-sac and raced back past Monica\u2019s house.</p><p>I never took another picture of him.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p> <p>A few days later, at Gus\u2019s house, his parents and my parents and Gus and me all squeezed around the dining room table, eating stuffed peppers on a tablecloth that had, according to Gus\u2019s dad, last seen use in the previous century.</p><p>My dad: \u201cEmily, this risotto . . .\u201d</p><p>My mom: \u201cIt\u2019s just delicious.\u201d</p><p>Gus\u2019s mom: \u201cOh, thanks. I\u2019d be happy to give you the recipe.\u201d</p><p>Gus, swallowing a bite: \u201cYou know, the primary taste I\u2019m getting is not-Oranjee.\u201d</p> <p>Me: \u201cGood observation, Gus. This food, while delicious, does not taste like Oranjee.\u201d</p><p>My mom: \u201cHazel.\u201d</p><p>Gus: \u201cIt tastes like . . .\u201d</p><p>Me: \u201cFood.\u201d</p><p>Gus: \u201cYes, precisely. It tastes like food, excellently prepared. But it does not taste, how do I put this delicately . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Me: \u201cIt does not taste like God Himself cooked heaven into a series of five dishes which were then served to you accompanied by several luminous balls of fermented, bubbly plasma while actual and literal flower petals floated down all around your canal-side dinner table.\u201d</p> <p>Gus: \u201cNicely phrased.\u201d</p><p>Gus\u2019s father: \u201cOur children are weird.\u201d</p><p>My dad: \u201cNicely phrased.\u201d</p><p>A week after our dinner, Gus ended up in the ER with chest pain, and they admitted him overnight, so I drove over to Memorial the next morning and visited him on the fourth floor. I hadn\u2019t been to Memorial since visiting Isaac. It didn\u2019t have any of the cloyingly bright primary color\u2013painted walls or the framed paintings of dogs driving cars that one found at Children\u2019s, but the absolute sterility of the place made me nostalgic for the happy-kid bullshit at Children\u2019s. Memorial was so functional. It was a storage facility. A prematorium.</p><p>When the elevator doors opened on the fourth floor, I saw Gus\u2019s mom pacing in the waiting room, talking on a cell phone. She hung up quickly, then hugged me and offered to take my cart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I said. \u201cHow\u2019s Gus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had a tough night, Hazel,\u201d she said. \u201cHis heart is working too hard. He needs to scale back on activity. Wheelchairs from here on out. They\u2019re putting him on some new medicine that should be better for the pain. His sisters just drove in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cCan I see him?\u201d</p> <p>She put her arm around me and squeezed my shoulder. It felt weird. \u201cYou know we love you, Hazel, but right now we just need to be a family. Gus agrees with that. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him you visited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna read here for a while, I think.\u201d</p><p>She went down the hall, back to where he was. I understood, but I still missed him, still thought maybe I was missing my last chance to see him, to say good-bye or whatever. The waiting room was all brown carpet and brown overstuffed cloth chairs. I sat in a love seat for a while, my oxygen cart tucked by my feet. I\u2019d worn my Chuck Taylors and my Ceci n\u2019est pas une pipe shirt, the exact outfit I\u2019d been wearing two weeks before on the Late Afternoon of the Venn Diagram, and he wouldn\u2019t see it. I started scrolling through the pictures on my phone, a backward flip-book of the last few months, beginning with him and Isaac outside of Monica\u2019s house and ending with the first picture I\u2019d taken of him, on the drive to Funky Bones. It seemed like forever ago, like we\u2019d had this brief but still infinite forever. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.</p><p>Two weeks later, I wheeled Gus across the art park toward Funky Bones with one entire bottle of very expensive champagne and my oxygen tank in his lap. The champagne had been donated by one of Gus\u2019s doctors\u2014Gus being the kind of person who inspires doctors to give their best bottles of champagne to children. We sat, Gus in his chair and me on the damp grass, as near to Funky Bones as we could get him in the chair. I pointed at the little kids goading each other to jump from rib cage to shoulder and Gus answered just loud enough for me to hear over the din, \u201cLast time, I imagined myself as the kid. This time, the skeleton.\u201d</p><p>We drank from paper Winnie-the-Pooh cups.</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>A typical day with late-stage Gus:</p><p>I went over to his house about noon, after he had eaten and puked up breakfast. He met me at the door in his wheelchair, no longer the muscular, gorgeous boy who stared at me at Support Group, but still half smiling, still smoking his unlit cigarette, his blue eyes bright and alive.</p><p>We ate lunch with his parents at the dining room table. Peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches and last night\u2019s asparagus. Gus didn\u2019t eat. I asked how he was feeling.</p><p>\u201cGrand,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. What\u2019d you do last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI slept quite a lot. I want to write you a sequel, Hazel Grace, but I\u2019m just so damned tired all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can just tell it to me,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I stand by my pre\u2013Van Houten analysis of the Dutch Tulip Man. Not a con man, but not as rich as he was letting on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Anna\u2019s mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t settled on an opinion there. Patience, Grasshopper.\u201d Augustus smiled. His parents were quiet, watching him, never looking away, like they just wanted to enjoy The Gus Waters Show while it was still in town. \u201cSometimes I dream that I\u2019m writing a memoir. A memoir would be just the thing to keep me in the hearts and memories of my adoring public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need an adoring public when you\u2019ve got me?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHazel Grace, when you\u2019re as charming and physically attractive as myself, it\u2019s easy enough to win over people you meet. But getting strangers to love you . . . now, that\u2019s the trick.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes.</p><p>After lunch, we went outside to the backyard. He was still well enough to push his own wheelchair, pulling miniature wheelies to get the front wheels over the bump in the doorway. Still athletic, in spite of it all, blessed with balance and quick reflexes that even the abundant narcotics could not fully mask.</p><p>His parents stayed inside, but when I glanced back into the dining room, they were always watching us.</p><p>We sat out there in silence for a minute and then Gus said, \u201cI wish we had that swing set sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one from my backyard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. My nostalgia is so extreme that I am capable of missing a swing my butt never actually touched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNostalgia is a side effect of cancer,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cNah, nostalgia is a side effect of dying,\u201d he answered. Above us, the wind blew and the branching shadows rearranged themselves on our skin. Gus squeezed my hand. \u201cIt is a good life, Hazel Grace.\u201d</p><p>We went inside when he needed meds, which were pressed into him along with liquid nutrition through his G-tube, a bit of plastic that disappeared into his belly. He was quiet for a while, zoned out. His mom wanted him to take a nap, but he kept shaking his head no when she suggested it, so we just let him sit there half asleep in the chair for a while.</p><p>His parents watched an old video of Gus with his sisters\u2014they were probably my age and Gus was about five. They were playing basketball in the driveway of a different house, and even though Gus was tiny, he could dribble like he\u2019d been born doing it, running circles around his sisters as they laughed. It was the first time I\u2019d even seen him play basketball. \u201cHe was good,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cShould\u2019ve seen him in high school,\u201d his dad said. \u201cStarted varsity as a freshman.\u201d</p><p>Gus mumbled, \u201cCan I go downstairs?\u201d</p><p>His mom and dad wheeled the chair downstairs with Gus still in it, bouncing down crazily in a way that would have been dangerous if danger retained its relevance, and then they left us alone. He got into bed and we lay there together under the covers, me on my side and Gus on his back, my head on his bony shoulder, his heat radiating through his polo shirt and into my skin, my feet tangled with his real foot, my hand on his cheek.</p><p>When I got his face nose-touchingly close so that I could only see his eyes, I couldn\u2019t tell he was sick. We kissed for a while and then lay together listening to The Hectic Glow\u2019s eponymous album, and eventually we fell asleep like that, a quantum entanglement of tubes and bodies.</p><p>We woke up later and arranged an armada of pillows so that we could sit comfortably against the edge of the bed and played Counterinsurgence 2: The Price of Dawn. I sucked at it, of course, but my sucking was useful to him: It made it easier for him to die beautifully, to jump in front of a sniper\u2019s bullet and sacrifice himself for me, or else to kill a sentry who was just about to shoot me. How he reveled in saving me. He shouted, \u201cYou will not kill my girlfriend today, International Terrorist of Ambiguous Nationality!\u201d</p><p>It crossed my mind to fake a choking incident or something so that he might give me the Heimlich. Maybe then he could rid himself of this fear that his life had been lived and lost for no greater good. But then I imagined him being physically unable to Heimlich, and me having to reveal that it was all a ruse, and the ensuing mutual humiliation.</p><p>It\u2019s hard as hell to hold on to your dignity when the risen sun is too bright in your losing eyes, and that\u2019s what I was thinking about as we hunted for bad guys through the ruins of a city that didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>Finally, his dad came down and dragged Gus back upstairs, and in the entryway, beneath an Encouragement telling me that Friends Are Forever, I knelt to kiss him good night. I went home and ate dinner with my parents, leaving Gus to eat (and puke up) his own dinner.</p><p>After some TV, I went to sleep.</p><p>I woke up.</p><p>Around noon, I went over there again.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>One morning, a month after returning home from Amsterdam, I drove over to his house. His parents told me he was still sleeping downstairs, so I knocked loudly on the basement door before entering, then asked, \u201cGus?\u201d</p><p>I found him mumbling in a language of his own creation. He\u2019d pissed the bed. It was awful. I couldn\u2019t even look, really. I just shouted for his parents and they came down, and I went upstairs while they cleaned him up.</p><p>When I came back down, he was slowly waking up out of the narcotics to the excruciating day. I arranged his pillows so we could play Counterinsurgence on the bare sheetless mattress, but he was so tired and out of it that he sucked almost as bad as I did, and we couldn\u2019t go five minutes without both getting dead. Not fancy heroic deaths either, just careless ones.</p><p>I didn\u2019t really say anything to him. I almost wanted him to forget I was there, I guess, and I was hoping he didn\u2019t remember that I\u2019d found the boy I love deranged in a wide pool of his own piss. I kept kind of hoping that he\u2019d look over at me and say, \u201cOh, Hazel Grace. How\u2019d you get here?\u201d</p><p>But unfortunately, he remembered. \u201cWith each passing minute, I\u2019m developing a deeper appreciation of the word mortified,\u201d he said finally.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve pissed the bed, Gus, believe me. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used,\u201d he said, and then took a sharp breath, \u201cto call me Augustus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said after a while, \u201cit\u2019s kids\u2019 stuff, but I always thought my obituary would be in all the newspapers, that I\u2019d have a story worth telling. I always had this secret suspicion that I was special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean, though,\u201d he said.</p><p>I did know what he meant. I just didn\u2019t agree. \u201cI don\u2019t care if the New York Times writes an obituary for me. I just want you to write one,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou say you\u2019re not special because the world doesn\u2019t know about you, but that\u2019s an insult to me. I know about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna make it to write your obituary,\u201d he said, instead of apologizing.</p><p>I was so frustrated with him. \u201cI just want to be enough for you, but I never can be. This can never be enough for you. But this is all you get. You get me, and your family, and this world. This is your life. I\u2019m sorry if it sucks. But you\u2019re not going to be the first man on Mars, and you\u2019re not going to be an NBA star, and you\u2019re not going to hunt Nazis. I mean, look at yourself, Gus.\u201d He didn\u2019t respond. \u201cI don\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d I started.</p><p>\u201cOh, you meant it,\u201d he interrupted. I started to apologize and he said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re right. Let\u2019s just play.\u201d</p><p>So we just played.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>I woke up to my phone singing a song by The Hectic Glow. Gus\u2019s favorite. That meant he was calling\u2014or someone was calling from his phone. I glanced at the alarm clock: 2:35 A.M. He\u2019s gone, I thought as everything inside of me collapsed into a singularity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I could barely creak out a \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>I waited for the sound of a parent\u2019s annihilated voice.</p><p>\u201cHazel Grace,\u201d Augustus said weakly.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God it\u2019s you. Hi. Hi, I love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHazel Grace, I\u2019m at the gas station. Something\u2019s wrong. You gotta help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Speedway at Eighty-sixth and Ditch. I did something wrong with the G-tube and I can\u2019t figure it out and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling nine-one-one,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo no no no no, they\u2019ll take me to a hospital. Hazel, listen to me. Do not call nine-one-one or my parents I will never forgive you don\u2019t please just come please just come and fix my goddamned G-tube. I\u2019m just, God, this is the stupidest thing. I don\u2019t want my parents to know I\u2019m gone. Please. I have the medicine with me; I just can\u2019t get it in. Please.\u201d He was crying. I\u2019d never heard him sob like this except from outside his house before Amsterdam.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m leaving now.\u201d</p><p>I took the BiPAP off and connected myself to an oxygen tank, lifted the tank into my cart, and put on sneakers to go with my pink cotton pajama pants and a Butler basketball T-shirt, which had originally been Gus\u2019s. I grabbed the keys from the kitchen drawer where Mom kept them and wrote a note in case they woke up while I was gone.</p><p>Went to check on Gus. It\u2019s important. Sorry.</p><p>Love, H</p><p>As I drove the couple miles to the gas station, I woke up enough to wonder why Gus had left the house in the middle of the night. Maybe he\u2019d been hallucinating, or his martyrdom fantasies had gotten the better of him.</p><p>I sped up Ditch Road past flashing yellow lights, going too fast partly to reach him and partly in the hopes a cop would pull me over and give me an excuse to tell someone that my dying boyfriend was stuck outside of a gas station with a malfunctioning G-tube. But no cop showed up to make my decision for me.</p> <p>There were only two cars in the lot. I pulled up next to his. I opened the door. The interior lights came on. Augustus sat in the driver\u2019s seat, covered in his own vomit, his hands pressed to his belly where the G-tube went in. \u201cHi,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Augustus, we have to get you to a hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease just look at it.\u201d I gagged from the smell but bent forward to inspect the place above his belly button where they\u2019d surgically installed the tube. The skin of his abdomen was warm and bright red.</p><p>\u201cGus, I think something\u2019s infected. I can\u2019t fix this. Why are you here? Why aren\u2019t you at home?\u201d He puked, without even the energy to turn his mouth away from his lap. \u201cOh, sweetie,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to buy a pack of cigarettes,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cI lost my pack. Or they took it away from me. I don\u2019t know. They said they\u2019d get me another one, but I wanted . . . to do it myself. Do one little thing myself.\u201d</p><p>He was staring straight ahead. Quietly, I pulled out my phone and glanced down to dial 911.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I told him. Nine-one-one, what is your emergency? \u201cHi, I\u2019m at the Speedway at Eighty-sixth and Ditch, and I need an ambulance. The great love of my life has a malfunctioning G-tube.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me. It was horrible. I could hardly look at him. The Augustus Waters of the crooked smiles and unsmoked cigarettes was gone, replaced by this desperate humiliated creature sitting there beneath me.</p> <p>\u201cThis is it. I can\u2019t even not smoke anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGus, I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is my chance to be somebody\u2019s Peter Van Houten?\u201d He hit the steering wheel weakly, the car honking as he cried. He leaned his head back, looking up. \u201cI hate myself I hate myself I hate this I hate this I disgust myself I hate it I hate it I hate it just let me fucking die.\u201d</p><p>According to the conventions of the genre, Augustus Waters kept his sense of humor till the end, did not for a moment waiver in his courage, and his spirit soared like an indomitable eagle until the world itself could not contain his joyous soul.</p><p>But this was the truth, a pitiful boy who desperately wanted not to be pitiful, screaming and crying, poisoned by an infected G-tube that kept him alive, but not alive enough.</p><p>I wiped his chin and grabbed his face in my hands and knelt down close to him so that I could see his eyes, which still lived. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wish it was like that movie, with the Persians and the Spartans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut it isn\u2019t,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThere are no bad guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven cancer isn\u2019t a bad guy really: Cancer just wants to be alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d I told him. I could hear the sirens.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. He was losing consciousness.</p><p>\u201cGus, you have to promise not to try this again. I\u2019ll get you cigarettes, okay?\u201d He looked at me. His eyes swam in their sockets. \u201cYou have to promise.\u201d</p><p>He nodded a little and then his eyes closed, his head swiveling on his neck.</p><p>\u201cGus,\u201d I said. \u201cStay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead me something,\u201d he said as the goddamned ambulance roared right past us. So while I waited for them to turn around and find us, I recited the only poem I could bring to mind, \u201cThe Red Wheelbarrow\u201d by William Carlos Williams.</p><p>so much depends</p><p>a red wheel</p><p>barrow</p><p>glazed with rain</p><p>water</p><p>beside the white</p><p>chickens.</p><p>Williams was a doctor. It seemed to me like a doctor\u2019s poem. The poem was over, but the ambulance was still driving away from us, so I kept writing it.</p><p>And so much depends, I told Augustus, upon a blue sky cut open by the branches of the trees above. So much depends upon the transparent G-tube erupting from the gut of the blue-lipped boy. So much depends upon this observer of the universe.</p><p>Half conscious, he glanced over at me and mumbled, \u201cAnd you say you don\u2019t write poetry.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>He came home from the hospital a few days later, finally and irrevocably robbed of his ambitions. It took more medication to remove him from the pain. He moved upstairs permanently, into a hospital bed near the living room window.</p><p>These were days of pajamas and beard scruff, of mumblings and requests and him endlessly thanking everyone for all they were doing on his behalf. One afternoon, he pointed vaguely toward a laundry basket in a corner of the room and asked me, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat laundry basket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, next to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see anything next to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my last shred of dignity. It\u2019s very small.\u201d</p><p>The next day, I let myself in. They didn\u2019t like me to ring the doorbell anymore because it might wake him up. His sisters were there with their banker husbands and three kids, all boys, who ran up to me and chanted who are you who are you who are you, running circles around the entryway like lung capacity was a renewable resource. I\u2019d met the sisters before, but never the kids or their dads.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Hazel,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cGus has a girlfriend,\u201d one of the kids said.</p><p>\u201cI am aware that Gus has a girlfriend,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got boobies,\u201d another said.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have that?\u201d the first one asked, pointing at my oxygen cart.</p><p>\u201cIt helps me breathe,\u201d I said. \u201cIs Gus awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dying,\u201d said another.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dying,\u201d the third one confirmed, suddenly serious. It was quiet for a moment, and I wondered what I was supposed to say, but then one of them kicked another and they were off to the races again, falling all over each other in a scrum that migrated toward the kitchen.</p><p>I made my way to Gus\u2019s parents in the living room and met his brothers-in-law, Chris and Dave.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t gotten to know his half sisters, really, but they both hugged me anyway. Julie was sitting on the edge of the bed, talking to a sleeping Gus in precisely the same voice that one would use to tell an infant he was adorable, saying, \u201cOh, Gussy Gussy, our little Gussy Gussy.\u201d Our Gussy? Had they acquired him?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Augustus?\u201d I said, trying to model appropriate behavior.</p><p>\u201cOur beautiful Gussy,\u201d Martha said, leaning in toward him. I began to wonder if he was actually asleep or if he\u2019d just laid a heavy finger on the pain pump to avoid the Attack of the Well-Meaning Sisters.</p><p>He woke up after a while and the first thing he said was, \u201cHazel,\u201d which I have to admit made me kind of happy, like maybe I was part of his family, too. \u201cOutside,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cCan we go?\u201d</p><p>We went, his mom pushing the wheelchair, sisters and brothers-in-law and dad and nephews and me trailing. It was a cloudy day, still and hot as summer settled in. He wore a long-sleeve navy T-shirt and fleece sweatpants. He was cold all the time for some reason. He wanted some water, so his dad went and got some for him.</p><p>Martha tried to engage Gus in conversation, kneeling down next to him and saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve always had such beautiful eyes.\u201d He nodded a little.</p><p>One of the husbands put an arm on Gus\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cHow\u2019s that fresh air feel?\u201d Gus shrugged.</p><p>\u201cDo you want meds?\u201d his mom asked, joining the circle kneeling around him. I took a step back, watching as the nephews tore through a flower bed on their way to the little patch of grass in Gus\u2019s backyard. They immediately commenced to play a game that involved throwing one another to the ground.</p><p>\u201cKids!\u201d Julie shouted vaguely.</p><p>\u201cI can only hope,\u201d Julie said, turning back to Gus, \u201cthey grow into the kind of thoughtful, intelligent young men you\u2019ve become.\u201d</p><p>I resisted the urge to audibly gag. \u201cHe\u2019s not that smart,\u201d I said to Julie.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. It\u2019s just that most really good-looking people are stupid, so I exceed expectations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, it\u2019s primarily his hotness,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt can be sort of blinding,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt actually did blind our friend Isaac,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cTerrible tragedy, that. But can I help my own deadly beauty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is my burden, this beautiful face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to mention your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, don\u2019t even get me started on my hot bod. You don\u2019t want to see me naked, Dave. Seeing me naked actually took Hazel Grace\u2019s breath away,\u201d he said, nodding toward the oxygen tank.</p><p>\u201cOkay, enough,\u201d Gus\u2019s dad said, and then out of nowhere, his dad put an arm around me and kissed the side of my head and whispered, \u201cI thank God for you every day, kid.\u201d</p><p>Anyway, that was the last good day I had with Gus until the Last Good Day.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>One of the less bullshitty conventions of the cancer kid genre is the Last Good Day convention, wherein the victim of cancer finds herself with some unexpected hours when it seems like the inexorable decline has suddenly plateaued, when the pain is for a moment bearable. The problem, of course, is that there\u2019s no way of knowing that your last good day is your Last Good Day. At the time, it is just another good day.</p><p>I\u2019d taken a day off from visiting Augustus because I was feeling a bit unwell myself: nothing specific, just tired. It had been a lazy day, and when Augustus called just after five P.M., I was already attached to the BiPAP, which we\u2019d dragged out to the living room so I could watch TV with Mom and Dad.</p><p>\u201cHi, Augustus,\u201d I said.</p><p>He answered in the voice I\u2019d fallen for. \u201cGood evening, Hazel Grace. Do you suppose you could find your way to the Literal Heart of Jesus around eight P.M.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Also, if it\u2019s not too much trouble, please prepare a eulogy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I you,\u201d I answered. Then the phone clicked off.</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I said. \u201cI have to go to Support Group at eight tonight. Emergency session.\u201d</p><p>My mom muted the TV. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>I looked at her for a second, my eyebrows raised. \u201cI assume that\u2019s a rhetorical question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why would there\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Gus needs me for some reason. It\u2019s fine. I can drive.\u201d I fiddled with the BiPAP so Mom would help me take it off, but she didn\u2019t. \u201cHazel,\u201d she said, \u201cyour dad and I feel like we hardly even see you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParticularly those of us who work all week,\u201d Dad said.</p><p>\u201cHe needs me,\u201d I said, finally unfastening the BiPAP myself.</p><p>\u201cWe need you, too, kiddo,\u201d my dad said. He took hold of my wrist, like I was a two-year-old about to dart out into the street, and gripped it.</p><p>\u201cWell, get a terminal disease, Dad, and then I\u2019ll stay home more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHazel,\u201d my mom said.</p><p>\u201cYou were the one who didn\u2019t want me to be a homebody,\u201d I said to her. Dad was still clutching my arm. \u201cAnd now you want him to go ahead and die so I\u2019ll be back here chained to this place, letting you take care of me like I always used to. But I don\u2019t need it, Mom. I don\u2019t need you like I used to. You\u2019re the one who needs to get a life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHazel!\u201d Dad said, squeezing harder. \u201cApologize to your mother.\u201d</p><p>I was tugging at my arm but he wouldn\u2019t let go, and I couldn\u2019t get my cannula on with only one hand. It was infuriating. All I wanted was an old-fashioned Teenager Walkout, wherein I stomp out of the room and slam the door to my bedroom and turn up The Hectic Glow and furiously write a eulogy. But I couldn\u2019t because I couldn\u2019t freaking breathe. \u201cThe cannula,\u201d I whined. \u201cI need it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My dad immediately let go and rushed to connect me to the oxygen.

Mom just sat there with her arms folded, not even looking at me. After a while, I got up and went to my room to write about Augustus.</p><p>Both Mom and Dad tried a few times to knock on the door or whatever, but I just told them I was doing something important. It took me forever to figure out what I wanted to say, and even then I wasn\u2019t very happy with it. Before I\u2019d technically finished, I noticed it was 7:40, which meant that I would be late even if I didn\u2019t change, so in the end I wore baby blue cotton pajama pants, flip-flops, and Gus\u2019s Butler shirt.</p> <p>I walked out of the room and tried to go right past them, but my dad said, \u201cYou can\u2019t leave the house without permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, Dad. He wanted me to write him a eulogy, okay? I\u2019ll be home every. Freaking. Night. Starting any day now, okay?\u201d That finally shut them up.</p><p>It took the entire drive to calm down about my parents. I pulled up around the back of the church and parked in the semicircular driveway behind Augustus\u2019s car. The back door to the church was held open by a fist-size rock. Inside, I contemplated taking the stairs but decided to wait for the ancient creaking elevator.</p><p>When the elevator doors unscrolled, I was in the Support Group room, the chairs arranged in the same circle. But now I saw only Gus in a wheelchair, ghoulishly thin. He was facing me from the center of the circle. He\u2019d been waiting for the elevator doors to open.</p><p>\u201cHazel Grace,\u201d he said, \u201cyou look ravishing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d</p><p>I heard a shuffling in a dark corner of the room. Isaac stood behind a little wooden lectern, clinging to it. \u201cYou want to sit?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m about to eulogize. You\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re . . . I\u2019m . . . what?\u201d</p><p>Gus gestured for me to sit. I pulled a chair into the center of the circle with him as he spun the chair to face Isaac. \u201cI want to attend my funeral,\u201d Gus said. \u201cBy the way, will you speak at my funeral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, of course, yeah,\u201d I said, letting my head fall onto his shoulder. I reached across his back and hugged both him and the wheelchair. He winced. I let go.</p> <p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful I\u2019ll get to attend as a ghost, but just to make sure, I thought I\u2019d\u2014well, not to put you on the spot, but I just this afternoon thought I could arrange a prefuneral, and I figured since I\u2019m in reasonably good spirits, there\u2019s no time like the present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you even get in here?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cWould you believe they leave the door open all night?\u201d Gus asked.</p><p>\u201cUm, no,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAs well you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d Gus smiled. \u201cAnyway, I know it\u2019s a bit self-aggrandizing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re stealing my eulogy,\u201d Isaac said. \u201cMy first bit is about how you were a self-aggrandizing bastard.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Gus said. \u201cAt your leisure.\u201d</p> <p>Isaac cleared his throat. \u201cAugustus Waters was a self-aggrandizing bastard. But we forgive him. We forgive him not because he had a heart as figuratively good as his literal one sucked, or because he knew more about how to hold a cigarette than any nonsmoker in history, or because he got eighteen years when he should have gotten more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeventeen,\u201d Gus corrected.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve got some time, you interrupting bastard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you,\u201d Isaac continued, \u201cAugustus Waters talked so much that he\u2019d interrupt you at his own funeral. And he was pretentious: Sweet Jesus Christ, that kid never took a piss without pondering the abundant metaphorical resonances of human waste production. And he was vain: I do not believe I have ever met a more physically attractive person who was more acutely aware of his own physical attractiveness.</p><p>\u201cBut I will say this: When the scientists of the future show up at my house with robot eyes and they tell me to try them on, I will tell the scientists to screw off, because I do not want to see a world without him.\u201d</p><p>I was kind of crying by then.</p><p>\u201cAnd then, having made my rhetorical point, I will put my robot eyes on, because I mean, with robot eyes you can probably see through girls\u2019 shirts and stuff. Augustus, my friend, Godspeed.\u201d</p><p>Augustus nodded for a while, his lips pursed, and then gave Isaac a thumbs-up. After he\u2019d recovered his composure, he added, \u201cI would cut the bit about seeing through girls\u2019 shirts.\u201d</p><p>Isaac was still clinging to the lectern. He started to cry. He pressed his forehead down to the podium and I watched his shoulders shake, and then finally, he said, \u201cGoddamn it, Augustus, editing your own eulogy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t swear in the Literal Heart of Jesus,\u201d Gus said.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it,\u201d Isaac said again. He raised his head and swallowed. \u201cHazel, can I get a hand here?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten he couldn\u2019t make his own way back to the circle. I got up, placed his hand on my arm, and walked him slowly back to the chair next to Gus where I\u2019d been sitting. Then I walked up to the podium and unfolded the piece of paper on which I\u2019d printed my eulogy.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Hazel. Augustus Waters was the great star-crossed love of my life. Ours was an epic love story, and I won\u2019t be able to get more than a sentence into it without disappearing into a puddle of tears. Gus knew. Gus knows. I will not tell you our love story, because\u2014like all real love stories\u2014it will die with us, as it should. I\u2019d hoped that he\u2019d be eulogizing me, because there\u2019s no one I\u2019d rather have . . .\u201d I started crying. \u201cOkay, how not to cry. How am I\u2014okay. Okay.\u201d</p><p>I took a few breaths and went back to the page. \u201cI can\u2019t talk about our love story, so I will talk about math. I am not a mathematician, but I know this: There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There\u2019s .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. There are days, many of them, when I resent the size of my unbounded set. I want more numbers than I\u2019m likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>Augustus Waters died eight days after his prefuneral, at Memorial, in the ICU, when the cancer, which was made of him, finally stopped his heart, which was also made of him.</p><p>He was with his mom and dad and sisters. His mom called me at three thirty in the morning. I\u2019d known, of course, that he was going. I\u2019d talked to his dad before going to bed, and he told me, \u201cIt could be tonight,\u201d but still, when I grabbed the phone from the bedside table and saw Gus\u2019s Mom on the caller ID, everything inside of me collapsed. She was just crying on the other end of the line, and she told me she was sorry, and I said I was sorry, too, and she told me that he was unconscious for a couple hours before he died.</p><p>My parents came in then, looking expectant, and I just nodded and they fell into each other, feeling, I\u2019m sure, the harmonic terror that would in time come for them directly.</p><p>I called Isaac, who cursed life and the universe and God Himself and who said where are the goddamned trophies to break when you need them, and then I realized there was no one else to call, which was the saddest thing. The only person I really wanted to talk to about Augustus Waters\u2019s death was Augustus Waters.</p><p>My parents stayed in my room forever until it was morning and finally Dad said, \u201cDo you want to be alone?\u201d and I nodded and Mom said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be right outside the door,\u201d me thinking, I don\u2019t doubt it.</p><p>It was unbearable. The whole thing. Every second worse than the last. I just kept thinking about calling him, wondering what would happen, if anyone would answer. In the last weeks, we\u2019d been reduced to spending our time together in recollection, but that was not nothing: The pleasure of remembering had been taken from me, because there was no longer anyone to remember with. It felt like losing your co-rememberer meant losing the memory itself, as if the things we\u2019d done were less real and important than they had been hours before.</p><p>When you go into the ER, one of the first things they ask you to do is to rate your pain on a scale of one to ten, and from there they decide which drugs to use and how quickly to use them. I\u2019d been asked this question hundreds of times over the years, and I remember once early on when I couldn\u2019t get my breath and it felt like my chest was on fire, flames licking the inside of my ribs fighting for a way to burn out of my body, my parents took me to the ER. A nurse asked me about the pain, and I couldn\u2019t even speak, so I held up nine fingers.</p><p>Later, after they\u2019d given me something, the nurse came in and she was kind of stroking my hand while she took my blood pressure and she said, \u201cYou know how I know you\u2019re a fighter? You called a ten a nine.\u201d</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t quite right. I called it a nine because I was saving my ten. And here it was, the great and terrible ten, slamming me again and again as I lay still and alone in my bed staring at the ceiling, the waves tossing me against the rocks then pulling me back out to sea so they could launch me again into the jagged face of the cliff, leaving me floating faceup on the water, undrowned.</p><p>Finally I did call him. His phone rang five times and then went to voice mail. \u201cYou\u2019ve reached the voice mail of Augustus Waters,\u201d he said, the clarion voice I\u2019d fallen for. \u201cLeave a message.\u201d It beeped. The dead air on the line was so eerie. I just wanted to go back to that secret post-terrestrial third space with him that we visited when we talked on the phone. I waited for that feeling, but it never came: The dead air on the line was no comfort, and finally I hung up.</p><p>I got my laptop out from under the bed and fired it up and went onto his wall page, where already the condolences were flooding in. The most recent one said:</p><p>I love you, bro. See you on the other side.</p><p>. . . Written by someone I\u2019d never heard of. In fact, almost all the wall posts, which arrived nearly as fast as I could read them, were written by people I\u2019d never met and whom he\u2019d never spoken about, people who were extolling his various virtues now that he was dead, even though I knew for a fact they hadn\u2019t seen him in months and had made no effort to visit him. I wondered if my wall would look like this if I died, or if I\u2019d been out of school and life long enough to escape widespread memorialization.</p><p>I kept reading.</p><p>I miss you already, bro.</p><p>I love you, Augustus. God bless and keep you.</p><p>You\u2019ll live forever in our hearts, big man.</p><p>(That particularly galled me, because it implied the immortality of those left behind: You will live forever in my memory, because I will live forever! I AM YOUR GOD NOW, DEAD BOY! I OWN YOU! Thinking you won\u2019t die is yet another side effect of dying.)</p><p>You were always such a great friend I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t see more of you after you left school, bro. I bet you\u2019re already playing ball in heaven.</p><p>I imagined the Augustus Waters analysis of that comment: If I am playing basketball in heaven, does that imply a physical location of a heaven containing physical basketballs? Who makes the basketballs in question? Are there less fortunate souls in heaven who work in a celestial basketball factory so that I can play? Or did an omnipotent God create the basketballs out of the vacuum of space? Is this heaven in some kind of unobservable universe where the laws of physics don\u2019t apply, and if so, why in the hell would I be playing basketball when I could be flying or reading or looking at beautiful people or something else I actually enjoy? It\u2019s almost as if the way you imagine my dead self says more about you than it says about either the person I was or the whatever I am now.</p><p>His parents called around noon to say the funeral would be in five days, on Saturday. I pictured a church packed with people who thought he liked basketball, and I wanted to puke, but I knew I had to go, since I was speaking and everything. When I hung up, I went back to reading his wall:</p><p>Just heard that Gus Waters died after a lengthy battle with cancer. Rest in peace, buddy.</p><p>I knew these people were genuinely sad, and that I wasn\u2019t really mad at them. I was mad at the universe. Even so, it infuriated me: You get all these friends just when you don\u2019t need friends anymore. I wrote a reply to his comment:</p><p>We live in a universe devoted to the creation, and eradication, of awareness. Augustus Waters did not die after a lengthy battle with cancer. He died after a lengthy battle with human consciousness, a victim\u2014as you will be\u2014of the universe\u2019s need to make and unmake all that is possible.</p><p>I posted it and waited for someone to reply, refreshing over and over again. Nothing. My comment got lost in the blizzard of new posts. Everyone was going to miss him so much. Everyone was praying for his family. I remembered Van Houten\u2019s letter: Writing does not resurrect. It buries.</p><p>After a while, I went out into the living room to sit with my parents and watch TV. I couldn\u2019t tell you what the show was, but at some point, my mom said, \u201cHazel, what can we do for you?\u201d</p><p>And I just shook my head. I started crying again.</p><p>\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d Mom asked again.</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>But she kept asking, as if there were something she could do, until finally I just kind of crawled across the couch into her lap and my dad came over and held my legs really tight and I wrapped my arms all the way around my mom\u2019s middle and they held on to me for hours while the tide rolled in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>When we first got there, I sat in the back of the visitation room, a little room of exposed stone walls off to the side of the sanctuary in the Literal Heart of Jesus church. There were maybe eighty chairs set up in the room, and it was two-thirds full but felt one-third empty.</p><p>For a while, I just watched people walk up to the coffin, which was on some kind of cart covered in a purple tablecloth. All these people I\u2019d never seen before would kneel down next to him or stand over him and look at him for a while, maybe crying, maybe saying something, and then all of them would touch the coffin instead of touching him, because no one wants to touch the dead.</p><p>Gus\u2019s mom and dad were standing next to the coffin, hugging everybody as they passed by, but when they noticed me, they smiled and shuffled over. I got up and hugged first his dad and then his mom, who held on to me too tight, like Gus used to, squeezing my shoulder blades. They both looked so old\u2014their eye sockets hollowed, the skin sagging from their exhausted faces. They had reached the end of a hurdling sprint, too.</p> <p>\u201cHe loved you so much,\u201d Gus\u2019s mom said. \u201cHe really did. It wasn\u2019t\u2014it wasn\u2019t puppy love or anything,\u201d she added, as if I didn\u2019t know that.</p><p>\u201cHe loved you so much, too,\u201d I said quietly. It\u2019s hard to explain, but talking to them felt like stabbing and being stabbed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. And then his parents were talking to my parents\u2014the conversation all nodding and tight lips. I looked up at the casket and saw it unattended, so I decided to walk up there. I pulled the oxygen tube from my nostrils and raised the tube up over my head, handing it to Dad. I wanted it to be just me and just him. I grabbed my little clutch and walked up the makeshift aisle between the rows of chairs.</p><p>The walk felt long, but I kept telling my lungs to shut up, that they were strong, that they could do this. I could see him as I approached: His hair was parted neatly on the left side in a way that he would have found absolutely horrifying, and his face was plasticized. But he was still Gus. My lanky, beautiful Gus.</p><p>I wanted to wear the little black dress I\u2019d bought for my fifteenth birthday party, my death dress, but I didn\u2019t fit into it anymore, so I wore a plain black dress, knee-length. Augustus wore the same thin-lapeled suit he\u2019d worn to Oranjee.</p><p>As I knelt, I realized they\u2019d closed his eyes\u2014of course they had\u2014and that I would never again see his blue eyes. \u201cI love you present tense,\u201d I whispered, and then put my hand on the middle of his chest and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Gus. It\u2019s okay. It is. It\u2019s okay, you hear me?\u201d I had\u2014and have\u2014absolutely no confidence that he could hear me. I leaned forward and kissed his cheek. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>I suddenly felt conscious that there were all these people watching us, that the last time so many people saw us kiss we were in the Anne Frank House. But there was, properly speaking, no us left to watch. Only a me.</p><p>I snapped open the clutch, reached in, and pulled out a hard pack of Camel Lights. In a quick motion I hoped no one behind would notice, I snuck them into the space between his side and the coffin\u2019s plush silver lining. \u201cYou can light these,\u201d I whispered to him. \u201cI won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>While I was talking to him, Mom and Dad had moved up to the second row with my tank, so I didn\u2019t have a long walk back. Dad handed me a tissue as I sat down. I blew my nose, threaded the tubes around my ears, and put the nubbins back in.</p><p>I thought we\u2019d go into the proper sanctuary for the real funeral, but it all happened in that little side room\u2014the Literal Hand of Jesus, I guess, the part of the cross he\u2019d been nailed to. A minister walked up and stood behind the coffin, almost like the coffin was a pulpit or something, and talked a little bit about how Augustus had a courageous battle and how his heroism in the face of illness was an inspiration to us all, and I was already starting to get pissed off at the minister when he said, \u201cIn heaven, Augustus will finally be healed and whole,\u201d implying that he had been less whole than other people due to his leglessness, and I kind of could not repress my sigh of disgust. My dad grabbed me just above the knee and cut me a disapproving look, but from the row behind me, someone muttered almost inaudibly near my ear, \u201cWhat a load of horse crap, eh, kid?\u201d</p><p>I spun around.</p><p>Peter Van Houten wore a white linen suit, tailored to account for his rotundity, a powder-blue dress shirt, and a green tie. He looked like he was dressed for a colonial occupation of Panama, not a funeral. The minister said, \u201cLet us pray,\u201d but as everyone else bowed their head, I could only stare slack-jawed at the sight of Peter Van Houten. After a moment, he whispered, \u201cWe gotta fake pray,\u201d and bowed his head.</p> <p>I tried to forget about him and just pray for Augustus. I made a point of listening to the minister and not looking back.</p><p>The minister called up Isaac, who was much more serious than he\u2019d been at the prefuneral. \u201cAugustus Waters was the Mayor of the Secret City of Cancervania, and he is not replaceable,\u201d Isaac began. \u201cOther people will be able to tell you funny stories about Gus, because he was a funny guy, but let me tell you a serious one: A day after I got my eye cut out, Gus showed up at the hospital. I was blind and heartbroken and didn\u2019t want to do anything and Gus burst into my room and shouted, \u2018I have wonderful news!\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t really want to hear wonderful news right now,\u2019 and Gus said, \u2018This is wonderful news you want to hear,\u2019 and I asked him, \u2018Fine, what is it?\u2019 and he said, \u2018You are going to live a good and long life filled with great and terrible moments that you cannot even imagine yet!\u2019\u201d</p><p>Isaac couldn\u2019t go on, or maybe that was all he had written.</p><p>After a high school friend told some stories about Gus\u2019s considerable basketball talents and his many qualities as a teammate, the minister said, \u201cWe\u2019ll now hear a few words from Augustus\u2019s special friend, Hazel.\u201d Special friend? There were some titters in the audience, so I figured it was safe for me to start out by saying to the minister, \u201cI was his girlfriend.\u201d That got a laugh. Then I began reading from the eulogy I\u2019d written.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a great quote in Gus\u2019s house, one that both he and I found very comforting: Without pain, we couldn\u2019t know joy.\u201d</p><p>I went on spouting bullshit Encouragements as Gus\u2019s parents, arm in arm, hugged each other and nodded at every word. Funerals, I had decided, are for the living.</p><p>After his sister Julie spoke, the service ended with a prayer about Gus\u2019s union with God, and I thought back to what he\u2019d told me at Oranjee, that he didn\u2019t believe in mansions and harps, but did believe in capital-S Something, and so I tried to imagine him capital-S Somewhere as we prayed, but even then I could not quite convince myself that he and I would be together again. I already knew too many dead people. I knew that time would now pass for me differently than it would for him\u2014that I, like everyone in that room, would go on accumulating loves and losses while he would not. And for me, that was the final and truly unbearable tragedy: Like all the innumerable dead, he\u2019d once and for all been demoted from haunted to haunter.</p><p>And then one of Gus\u2019s brothers-in-law brought up a boom box and they played this song Gus had picked out\u2014a sad and quiet song by The Hectic Glow called \u201cThe New Partner.\u201d I just wanted to go home, honestly. I didn\u2019t know hardly any of these people, and I felt Peter Van Houten\u2019s little eyes boring into my exposed shoulder blades, but after the song was over, everyone had to come up to me and tell me that I\u2019d spoken beautifully, and that it was a lovely service, which was a lie: It was a funeral. It looked like any other funeral.</p> <p>His pallbearers\u2014cousins, his dad, an uncle, friends I\u2019d never seen\u2014came and got him, and they all started walking toward the hearse.</p><p>When Mom and Dad and I got in the car, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go. I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHazel,\u201d Mom said.</p><p>\u201cMom, there won\u2019t be a place to sit and it\u2019ll last forever and I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHazel, we have to go for Mr. and Mrs. Waters,\u201d Mom said.</p><p>\u201cJust . . .\u201d I said. I felt so little in the backseat for some reason. I kind of wanted to be little. I wanted to be like six years old or something. \u201cFine,\u201d I said.</p><p>I just stared out the window awhile. I really didn\u2019t want to go. I didn\u2019t want to see them lower him into the ground in the spot he\u2019d picked out with his dad, and I didn\u2019t want to see his parents sink to their knees in the dew-wet grass and moan in pain, and I didn\u2019t want to see Peter Van Houten\u2019s alcoholic belly stretched against his linen jacket, and I didn\u2019t want to cry in front of a bunch of people, and I didn\u2019t want to toss a handful of dirt onto his grave, and I didn\u2019t want my parents to have to stand there beneath the clear blue sky with its certain slant of afternoon light, thinking about their day and their kid and my plot and my casket and my dirt.</p><p>But I did these things. I did all of them and worse, because Mom and Dad felt we should.</p><p>After it was over, Van Houten walked up to me and put a fat hand on my shoulder and said, \u201cCould I hitch a ride? Left my rental at the bottom of the hill.\u201d I shrugged, and he opened the door to the backseat right as my dad unlocked the car.</p><p>Inside, he leaned between the front seats and said, \u201cPeter Van Houten: Novelist Emeritus and Semiprofessional Disappointer.\u201d</p><p>My parents introduced themselves. He shook their hands. I was pretty surprised that Peter Van Houten had flown halfway across the world to attend a funeral. \u201cHow did you even\u2014\u201d I started, but he cut me off.</p><p>\u201cI used the infernal Internet of yours to follow the Indianapolis obituary notices.\u201d He reached into his linen suit and produced a fifth of whiskey.</p><p>\u201cAnd you just like bought a ticket and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted again while unscrewing the cap. \u201cIt was fifteen thousand for a first-class ticket, but I\u2019m sufficiently capitalized to indulge such whims. And the drinks are free on the flight. If you\u2019re ambitious, you can almost break even.\u201d</p><p>Van Houten took a swig of the whiskey and then leaned forward to offer it to my dad, who said, \u201cUm, no thanks.\u201d Then Van Houten nodded the bottle toward me. I grabbed it.</p><p>\u201cHazel,\u201d my mom said, but I unscrewed the cap and sipped. It made my stomach feel like my lungs. I handed the bottle back to Van Houten, who took a long slug from it and then said, \u201cSo. Omnis cellula e cellula.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour boy Waters and I corresponded a bit, and in his last\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you read your fan mail now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he sent it to my house, not through my publisher. And I\u2019d hardly call him a fan. He despised me. But at any rate he was quite insistent that I\u2019d be absolved for my misbehavior if I attended his funeral and told you what became of Anna\u2019s mother. So here I am, and there\u2019s your answer: Omnis cellula e cellula.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked again.</p><p>\u201cOmnis cellula e cellula,\u201d he said again. \u201cAll cells come from cells. Every cell is born of a previous cell, which was born of a previous cell. Life comes from life. Life begets life begets life begets life begets life.\u201d</p><p>We reached the bottom of the hill. \u201cOkay, yeah,\u201d I said. I was in no mood for this. Peter Van Houten would not hijack Gus\u2019s funeral. I wouldn\u2019t allow it. \u201cThanks,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, I guess we\u2019re at the bottom of the hill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want an explanation?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m good. I think you\u2019re a pathetic alcoholic who says fancy things to get attention like a really precocious eleven-year-old and I feel super bad for you. But yeah, no, you\u2019re not the guy who wrote An Imperial Affliction anymore, so you couldn\u2019t sequel it even if you wanted to. Thanks, though. Have an excellent life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the booze,\u201d I said. \u201cNow get out of the car.\u201d He looked scolded. Dad had stopped the car and we just idled there below Gus\u2019s grave for a minute until Van Houten opened the door and, finally silent, left.</p><p>As we drove away, I watched through the back window as he took a drink and raised the bottle in my direction, as if toasting me. His eyes looked so sad. I felt kinda bad for him, to be honest.</p><p>We finally got home around six, and I was exhausted. I just wanted to sleep, but Mom made me eat some cheesy pasta, although she at least allowed me to eat in bed. I slept with the BiPAP for a couple hours. Waking up was horrible, because for a disoriented moment I felt like everything was fine, and then it crushed me anew. Mom took me off the BiPAP, I tethered myself to a portable tank, and stumbled into my bathroom to brush my teeth.</p><p>Appraising myself in the mirror as I brushed my teeth, I kept thinking there were two kinds of adults: There were Peter Van Houtens\u2014miserable creatures who scoured the earth in search of something to hurt. And then there were people like my parents, who walked around zombically, doing whatever they had to do to keep walking around.</p><p>Neither of these futures struck me as particularly desirable. It seemed to me that I had already seen everything pure and good in the world, and I was beginning to suspect that even if death didn\u2019t get in the way, the kind of love that Augustus and I share could never last. So dawn goes down to day, the poet wrote. Nothing gold can stay.</p><p>Someone knocked on the bathroom door.</p><p>\u201cOccupada,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHazel,\u201d my dad said. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d I didn\u2019t answer, but after a while I unlocked the door. I sat down on the closed toilet seat. Why did breathing have to be such work? Dad knelt down next to me. He grabbed my head and pulled it into his collarbone, and he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Gus died.\u201d I felt kind of suffocated by his T-shirt, but it felt good to be held so hard, pressed into the comfortable smell of my dad. It was almost like he was angry or something, and I liked that, because I was angry, too. \u201cIt\u2019s total bullshit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole thing. Eighty percent survival rate and he\u2019s in the twenty percent? Bullshit. He was such a bright kid. It\u2019s bullshit. I hate it. But it was sure a privilege to love him, huh?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nodded into his shirt.</p><p>\u201cGives you an idea how I feel about you,\u201d he said.</p><p>My old man. He always knew just what to say.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p> <p>A couple days later, I got up around noon and drove over to Isaac\u2019s house. He answered the door himself. \u201cMy mom took Graham to a movie,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe should go do something,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cCan the something be play blind-guy video games while sitting on the couch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s just the kind of something I had in mind.\u201d</p><p>So we sat there for a couple hours talking to the screen together, navigating this invisible labyrinthine cave without a single lumen of light. The most entertaining part of the game by far was trying to get the computer to engage us in humorous conversation:</p> <p>Me: \u201cTouch the cave wall.\u201d</p><p>Computer: \u201cYou touch the cave wall. It is moist.\u201d</p><p>Isaac: \u201cLick the cave wall.\u201d</p><p>Computer: \u201cI do not understand. Repeat?\u201d</p><p>Me: \u201cHump the moist cave wall.\u201d</p><p>Computer: \u201cYou attempt to jump. You hit your head.\u201d</p> <p>Isaac: \u201cNot jump. HUMP.\u201d</p><p>Computer: \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Isaac: \u201cDude, I\u2019ve been alone in the dark in this cave for weeks and I need some relief. HUMP THE CAVE WALL.\u201d</p><p>Computer: \u201cYou attempt to ju\u2014\u201d</p><p>Me: \u201cThrust pelvis against the cave wall.\u201d</p><p>Computer: \u201cI do not\u2014\u201d</p><p>Isaac: \u201cMake sweet love to the cave.\u201d</p><p>Computer: \u201cI do not\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Me: \u201cFINE. Follow left branch.\u201d</p><p>Computer: \u201cYou follow the left branch. The passage narrows.\u201d</p><p>Me: \u201cCrawl.\u201d</p><p>Computer: \u201cYou crawl for one hundred yards. The passage narrows.\u201d</p><p>Me: \u201cSnake crawl.\u201d</p><p>Computer: \u201cYou snake crawl for thirty yards. A trickle of water runs down your body. You reach a mound of small rocks blocking the passageway.\u201d</p><p>Me: \u201cCan I hump the cave now?\u201d</p><p>Computer: \u201cYou cannot jump without standing.\u201d</p><p>Isaac: \u201cI dislike living in a world without Augustus Waters.\u201d</p><p>Computer: \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>Isaac: \u201cMe neither. Pause.\u201d</p><p>He dropped the remote onto the couch between us and asked, \u201cDo you know if it hurt or whatever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was really fighting for breath, I guess,\u201d I said. \u201cHe eventually went unconscious, but it sounds like, yeah, it wasn\u2019t great or anything. Dying sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Isaac said. And then after a long time, \u201cIt just seems so impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappens all the time,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou seem angry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. We just sat there quiet for a long time, which was fine, and I was thinking about way back in the very beginning in the Literal Heart of Jesus when Gus told us that he feared oblivion, and I told him that he was fearing something universal and inevitable, and how really, the problem is not suffering itself or oblivion itself but the depraved meaninglessness of these things, the absolutely inhuman nihilism of suffering. I thought of my dad telling me that the universe wants to be noticed. But what we want is to be noticed by the universe, to have the universe give a shit what happens to us\u2014not the collective idea of sentient life but each of us, as individuals.</p><p>\u201cGus really loved you, you know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t shut up about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt was annoying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t find it that annoying,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDid he ever give you that thing he was writing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sequel or whatever to that book you liked.\u201d</p><p>I turned to Isaac. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he was working on something for you but he wasn\u2019t that good of a writer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did he say this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Like, after he got back from Amsterdam at some point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt which point?\u201d I pressed. Had he not had a chance to finish it? Had he finished it and left it on his computer or something?</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Isaac sighed. \u201cUm, I don\u2019t know. We talked about it over here once. He was over here, like\u2014uh, we played with my email machine and I\u2019d just gotten an email from my grandmother. I can check on the machine if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, where is it?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d mentioned it a month before. A month. Not a good month, admittedly, but still\u2014a month. That was enough time for him to have written something, at least. There was still something of him, or by him at least, floating around out there. I needed it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go to his house,\u201d I told Isaac.</p><p>I hurried out to the minivan and hauled the oxygen cart up and into the passenger seat. I started the car. A hip-hop beat blared from the stereo, and as I reached to change the radio station, someone started rapping. In Swedish.</p><p>I swiveled around and screamed when I saw Peter Van Houten sitting in the backseat.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for alarming you,\u201d Peter Van Houten said over the rapping. He was still wearing the funeral suit, almost a week later. He smelled like he was sweating alcohol. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to keep the CD,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Snook, one of the major Swedish\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ah ah ah GET OUT OF MY CAR.\u201d I turned off the stereo.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your mother\u2019s car, as I understand it,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, it wasn\u2019t locked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God! Get out of the car or I\u2019ll call nine-one-one. Dude, what is your problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only there were just one,\u201d he mused. \u201cI am here simply to apologize. You were correct in noting earlier that I am a pathetic little man, dependent upon alcohol. I had one acquaintance who only spent time with me because I paid her to do so\u2014worse, still, she has since quit, leaving me the rare soul who cannot acquire companionship even through bribery. It is all true, Hazel. All that and more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. It would have been a more moving speech had he not slurred his words.</p><p>\u201cYou remind me of Anna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remind a lot of people of a lot of people,\u201d I answered. \u201cI really have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo drive,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You remind me of Anna,\u201d he said again. After a second, I put the car in reverse and backed out. I couldn\u2019t make him leave, and I didn\u2019t have to. I\u2019d drive to Gus\u2019s house, and Gus\u2019s parents would make him leave.</p><p>\u201cYou are, of course, familiar,\u201d Van Houten said, \u201cwith Antonietta Meo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, no,\u201d I said. I turned on the stereo, and the Swedish hip-hop blared, but Van Houten yelled over it.</p><p>\u201cShe may soon be the youngest nonmartyr saint ever beatified by the Catholic Church. She had the same cancer that Mr. Waters had, osteosarcoma. They removed her right leg. The pain was excruciating. As Antonietta Meo lay dying at the ripened age of six from this agonizing cancer, she told her father, \u2018Pain is like fabric: The stronger it is, the more it\u2019s worth.\u2019 Is that true, Hazel?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t looking at him directly but at his reflection in the mirror. \u201cNo,\u201d I shouted over the music. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you wish it were true!\u201d he cried back. I cut the music. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I ruined your trip. You were too young. You were\u2014\u201d He broke down. As if he had a right to cry over Gus. Van Houten was just another of the endless mourners who did not know him, another too-late lamentation on his wall.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ruin our trip, you self-important bastard. We had an awesome trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am trying,\u201d he said. \u201cI am trying, I swear.\u201d It was around then that I realized Peter Van Houten had a dead person in his family. I considered the honesty with which he had written about cancer kids; the fact that he couldn\u2019t speak to me in Amsterdam except to ask if I\u2019d dressed like her on purpose; his shittiness around me and Augustus; his aching question about the relationship between pain\u2019s extremity and its value. He sat back there drinking, an old man who\u2019d been drunk for years. I thought of a statistic I wish I didn\u2019t know: Half of marriages end in the year after a child\u2019s death. I looked back at Van Houten. I was driving down College and I pulled over behind a line of parked cars and asked, \u201cYou had a kid who died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daughter,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was eight. Suffered beautifully. Will never be beatified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had leukemia?\u201d I asked. He nodded. \u201cLike Anna,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cVery much like her, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Well, not at the time of her death. I was insufferable long before we lost her. Grief does not change you, Hazel. It reveals you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you live with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not primarily, although at the end, we brought her to New York, where I was living, for a series of experimental tortures that increased the misery of her days without increasing the number of them.\u201d</p><p>After a second, I said, \u201cSo it\u2019s like you gave her this second life where she got to be a teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that would be a fair assessment,\u201d he said, and then quickly added, \u201cI assume you are familiar with Philippa Foot\u2019s Trolley Problem thought experiment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then I show up at your house and I\u2019m dressed like the girl you hoped she would live to become and you\u2019re, like, all taken aback by it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a trolley running out of control down a track,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about your stupid thought experiment,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Philippa Foot\u2019s, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hers either,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t understand why it was happening,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to tell her she would die. Her social worker said I had to tell her. I had to tell her she would die, so I told her she was going to heaven. She asked if I would be there, and I said that I would not, not yet. But eventually, she said, and I promised that yes, of course, very soon. And I told her that in the meantime we had great family up there that would take care of her. And she asked me when I would be there, and I told her soon. Twenty-two years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>After a while, I asked, \u201cWhat happened to her mom?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re still looking for your sequel, you little rat.\u201d</p><p>I smiled back. \u201cYou should go home,\u201d I told him. \u201cSober up. Write another novel. Do the thing you\u2019re good at. Not many people are lucky enough to be so good at something.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me through the mirror for a long time. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah. You\u2019re right. You\u2019re right.\u201d But even as he said it, he pulled out his mostly empty fifth of whiskey. He drank, recapped the bottle, and opened the door. \u201cGood-bye, Hazel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it easy, Van Houten.\u201d</p><p>He sat down on the curb behind the car. As I watched him shrink in the rearview mirror, he pulled out the bottle and for a second it looked like he would leave it on the curb. And then he took a swig.</p><p>It was a hot afternoon in Indianapolis, the air thick and still like we were inside a cloud. It was the worst kind of air for me, and I told myself it was just the air when the walk from his driveway to his front door felt infinite. I rang the doorbell, and Gus\u2019s mom answered.</p><p>\u201cOh, Hazel,\u201d she said, and kind of enveloped me, crying.</p><p>She made me eat some eggplant lasagna\u2014I guess a lot of people had brought them food or whatever\u2014with her and Gus\u2019s dad. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t really know what to say. I just wanted to go downstairs and find whatever he\u2019d written for me. Plus, the silence in the room really bothered me. I wanted them to be talking to each other, comforting or holding hands or whatever. But they just sat there eating very small amounts of lasagna, not even looking at each other. \u201cHeaven needed an angel,\u201d his dad said after a while.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. Then his sisters and their mess of kids showed up and piled into the kitchen. I got up and hugged both his sisters and then watched the kids run around the kitchen with their sorely needed surplus of noise and movement, excited molecules bouncing against each other and shouting, \u201cYou\u2019re it no you\u2019re it no I was it but then I tagged you you didn\u2019t tag me you missed me well I\u2019m tagging you now no dumb butt it\u2019s a time-out DANIEL DO NOT CALL YOUR BROTHER A DUMB BUTT Mom if I\u2019m not allowed to use that word how come you just used it dumb butt dumb butt,\u201d and then, chorally, dumb butt dumb butt dumb butt dumb butt, and at the table Gus\u2019s parents were now holding hands, which made me feel better.</p><p>\u201cIsaac told me Gus was writing something, something for me,\u201d I said. The kids were still singing their dumb-butt song.</p><p>\u201cWe can check his computer,\u201d his mom said.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t on it much the last few weeks,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. I\u2019m not even sure we brought it upstairs. Is it still in the basement, Mark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201ccan I . . .\u201d I nodded toward the basement door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not ready,\u201d his dad said. \u201cBut of course, yes, Hazel. Of course you can.\u201d</p><p>I walked downstairs, past his unmade bed, past the gaming chairs beneath the TV. His computer was still on. I tapped the mouse to wake it up and then searched for his most recently edited files. Nothing in the last month. The most recent thing was a response paper to Toni Morrison\u2019s The Bluest Eye.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d written something by hand. I walked over to his bookshelves, looking for a journal or a notebook. Nothing. I flipped through his copy of An Imperial Affliction. He hadn\u2019t left a single mark in it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I walked to his bedside table next. Infinite Mayhem, the ninth sequel to The Price of Dawn, lay atop the table next to his reading lamp, the corner of page 138 turned down. He\u2019d never made it to the end of the book. \u201cSpoiler alert: Mayhem survives,\u201d I said out loud to him, just in case he could hear me.</p><p>And then I crawled into his unmade bed, wrapping myself in his comforter like a cocoon, surrounding myself with his smell. I took out my cannula so I could smell better, breathing him in and breathing him out, the scent fading even as I lay there, my chest burning until I couldn\u2019t distinguish among the pains.</p><p>I sat up in the bed after a while and reinserted my cannula and breathed for a while before going up the stairs. I just shook my head no in response to his parents\u2019 expectant looks. The kids raced past me. One of Gus\u2019s sisters\u2014I could not tell them apart\u2014said, \u201cMom, do you want me to take them to the park or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, they\u2019re fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs there anywhere he might have put a notebook? Like by his hospital bed or something?\u201d The bed was already gone, reclaimed by hospice.</p><p>\u201cHazel,\u201d his dad said, \u201cyou were there every day with us. You\u2014 he wasn\u2019t alone much, sweetie. He wouldn\u2019t have had time to write anything. I know you want . . . I want that, too. But the messages he leaves for us now are coming from above, Hazel.\u201d He pointed toward the ceiling, as if Gus were hovering just above the house. Maybe he was. I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t feel his presence, though.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. I promised to visit them again in a few days.</p><p>I never quite caught his scent again.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p> <p>Three days later, on the eleventh day AG, Gus\u2019s father called me in the morning. I was still hooked to the BiPAP, so I didn\u2019t answer, but I listened to his message the moment it beeped through to my phone. \u201cHazel, hi, it\u2019s Gus\u2019s dad. I found a, uh, black Moleskine notebook in the magazine rack that was near his hospital bed, I think near enough that he could have reached it. Unfortunately there\u2019s no writing in the notebook. All the pages are blank. But the first\u2014I think three or four\u2014the first few pages are torn out of the notebook. We looked through the house but couldn\u2019t find the pages. So I don\u2019t know what to make of that. But maybe those pages are what Isaac was referring to? Anyway, I hope that you are doing okay. You\u2019re in our prayers every day, Hazel. Okay, bye.\u201d</p><p>Three or four pages ripped from a Moleskine notebook no longer in Augustus Waters\u2019s house. Where would he leave them for me? Taped to Funky Bones? No, he wasn\u2019t well enough to get there.</p><p>The Literal Heart of Jesus. Maybe he\u2019d left it there for me on his Last Good Day.</p><p>So I left twenty minutes early for Support Group the next day. I drove over to Isaac\u2019s house, picked him up, and then we drove down to the Literal Heart of Jesus with the windows of the minivan down, listening to The Hectic Glow\u2019s leaked new album, which Gus would never hear.</p><p>We took the elevator. I walked Isaac to a seat in the Circle of Trust then slowly worked my way around the Literal Heart. I checked everywhere: under the chairs, around the lectern I\u2019d stood behind while delivering my eulogy, under the treat table, on the bulletin board packed with Sunday school kids\u2019 drawings of God\u2019s love. Nothing. It was the only place we\u2019d been together in those last days besides his house, and it either wasn\u2019t here or I was missing something. Perhaps he\u2019d left it for me in the hospital, but if so, it had almost certainly been thrown away after his death.</p><p>I was really out of breath by the time I settled into a chair next to Isaac, and I devoted the entirety of Patrick\u2019s nutless testimonial to telling my lungs they were okay, that they could breathe, that there was enough oxygen. They\u2019d been drained only a week before Gus died\u2014I watched the amber cancer water dribble out of me through the tube\u2014and yet already they felt full again. I was so focused on telling myself to breathe that I didn\u2019t notice Patrick saying my name at first.</p> <p>I snapped to attention. \u201cYeah?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, Patrick. I\u2019m a little out of breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to share a memory of Augustus with the group?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I would just die, Patrick. Do you ever wish you would just die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Patrick said, without his usual pause. \u201cYes, of course. So why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I thought about it. My old stock answer was that I wanted to stay alive for my parents, because they would be all gutted and childless in the wake of me, and that was still true kind of, but that wasn\u2019t it, exactly. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the hopes that you\u2019ll get better?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. I really don\u2019t know. Isaac?\u201d I asked. I was tired of talking.</p><p>Isaac started talking about true love. I couldn\u2019t tell them what I was thinking because it seemed cheesy to me, but I was thinking about the universe wanting to be noticed, and how I had to notice it as best I could. I felt that I owed a debt to the universe that only my attention could repay, and also that I owed a debt to everybody who didn\u2019t get to be a person anymore and everyone who hadn\u2019t gotten to be a person yet. What my dad had told me, basically.</p><p>I stayed quiet for the rest of Support Group, and Patrick said a special prayer for me, and Gus\u2019s name was tacked onto the long list of the dead\u2014fourteen of them for every one of us\u2014and we promised to live our best life today, and then I took Isaac to the car.</p><p>When I got home, Mom and Dad were at the dining room table on their separate laptops, and the moment I walked in the door, Mom slammed her laptop shut. \u201cWhat\u2019s on the computer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust some antioxidant recipes. Ready for BiPAP and America\u2019s Next Top Model?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to lie down for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve gotta eat before you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I am aggressively unhungry.\u201d I took a step toward the door but she cut me off.</p><p>\u201cHazel, you have to eat. Just some ch\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mom said. \u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d I glanced at my dad, who shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my life,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to starve yourself to death just because Augustus died. You\u2019re going to eat dinner.\u201d</p><p>I was really pissed off for some reason. \u201cI can\u2019t eat, Mom. I can\u2019t. Okay?\u201d</p><p>I tried to push past her but she grabbed both my shoulders and said, \u201cHazel, you\u2019re eating dinner. You need to stay healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d I shouted. \u201cI\u2019m not eating dinner, and I can\u2019t stay healthy, because I\u2019m not healthy. I am dying, Mom. I am going to die and leave you here alone and you won\u2019t have a me to hover around and you won\u2019t be a mother anymore, and I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t do anything about it, okay?!\u201d</p><p>I regretted it as soon as I said it.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me say that to your father?\u201d Her eyes welled up. \u201cDid you?\u201d I nodded. \u201cOh, God, Hazel. I\u2019m sorry. I was wrong, sweetie. That wasn\u2019t true. I said that in a desperate moment. It\u2019s not something I believe.\u201d She sat down, and I sat down with her. I was thinking that I should have just puked up some pasta for her instead of getting pissed off.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you believe, then?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAs long as either of us is alive, I will be your mother,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you die, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen,\u201d I said.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cEven when you die, I will still be your mom, Hazel. I won\u2019t stop being your mom. Have you stopped loving Gus?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cWell, then how could I stop loving you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. My dad was crying now.</p><p>\u201cI want you guys to have a life,\u201d I said. \u201cI worry that you won\u2019t have a life, that you\u2019ll sit around here all day with no me to look after and stare at the walls and want to off yourselves.\u201d</p><p>After a minute, Mom said, \u201cI\u2019m taking some classes. Online, through IU. To get my master\u2019s in social work. In fact, I wasn\u2019t looking at antioxidant recipes; I was writing a paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m imagining a world without you. But if I get my MSW, I can counsel families in crisis or lead groups dealing with illness in their families or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you\u2019re going to become a Patrick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not exactly. There are all kinds of social work jobs.\u201d</p><p>Dad said, \u201cWe\u2019ve both been worried that you\u2019ll feel abandoned. It\u2019s important for you to know that we will always be here for you, Hazel. Your mom isn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, this is great. This is fantastic!\u201d I was really smiling. \u201cMom is going to become a Patrick. She\u2019ll be a great Patrick! She\u2019ll be so much better at it than Patrick is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Hazel. That means everything to me.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I was crying. I couldn\u2019t get over how happy I was, crying genuine tears of actual happiness for the first time in maybe forever, imagining my mom as a Patrick. It made me think of Anna\u2019s mom. She would\u2019ve been a good social worker, too.</p><p>After a while we turned on the TV and watched ANTM. But I paused it after five seconds because I had all these questions for Mom. \u201cSo how close are you to finishing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I go up to Bloomington for a week this summer, I should be able to finish by December.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been keeping this from me, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to hurt you, Hazel.\u201d</p><p>Amazing. \u201cSo when you\u2019re waiting for me outside of MCC or Support Group or whatever, you\u2019re always\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, working or reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is so great. If I\u2019m dead, I want you to know I will be sighing at you from heaven every time you ask someone to share their feelings.\u201d</p><p>My dad laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll be right there with ya, kiddo,\u201d he assured me.</p><p>Finally, we watched ANTM. Dad tried really hard not to die of boredom, and he kept messing up which girl was which, saying, \u201cWe like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. We revile Anastasia. We like Antonia, the other blonde,\u201d Mom explained.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all tall and horrible,\u201d Dad responded. \u201cForgive me for failing to tell the difference.\u201d Dad reached across me for Mom\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you guys will stay together if I die?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHazel, what? Sweetie.\u201d She fumbled for the remote control and paused the TV again. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust, do you think you would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Of course,\u201d Dad said. \u201cYour mom and I love each other, and if we lose you, we\u2019ll go through it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwear to God,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI swear to God,\u201d he said.</p><p>I looked back at Mom. \u201cSwear to God,\u201d she agreed. \u201cWhy are you even worrying about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to ruin your life or anything.\u201d</p><p>Mom leaned forward and pressed her face into my messy puff of hair and kissed me at the very top of my head. I said to Dad, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to become like a miserable unemployed alcoholic or whatever.\u201d</p><p>My mom smiled. \u201cYour father isn\u2019t Peter Van Houten, Hazel. You of all people know it is possible to live with pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d I said. Mom hugged me and I let her even though I didn\u2019t really want to be hugged. \u201cOkay, you can unpause it,\u201d I said. Anastasia got kicked off. She threw a fit. It was awesome.</p><p>I ate a few bites of dinner\u2014bow-tie pasta with pesto\u2014and managed to keep it down.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>I woke up the next morning panicked because I\u2019d dreamed of being alone and boatless in a huge lake. I bolted up, straining against the BiPAP, and felt Mom\u2019s arm on me.</p><p>\u201cHi, you okay?\u201d</p><p>My heart raced, but I nodded. Mom said, \u201cKaitlyn\u2019s on the phone for you.\u201d I pointed at my BiPAP. She helped me get it off and hooked me up to Philip and then finally I took my cell from Mom and said, \u201cHey, Kaitlyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust calling to check in,\u201d she said. \u201cSee how you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m doing okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve just had the worst luck, darling. It\u2019s unconscionable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I said. I didn\u2019t think much about my luck anymore one way or the other. Honestly, I didn\u2019t really want to talk with Kaitlyn about anything, but she kept dragging the conversation along.</p><p>\u201cSo what was it like?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHaving your boyfriend die? Um, it sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cOh. It was . . . it was nice to spend time with someone so interesting. We were very different, and we disagreed about a lot of things, but he was always so interesting, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlas, I do not. The boys I\u2019m acquainted with are vastly uninteresting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t perfect or anything. He wasn\u2019t your fairy-tale Prince Charming or whatever. He tried to be like that sometimes, but I liked him best when that stuff fell away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have like a scrapbook of pictures and letters he wrote?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some pictures, but he never really wrote me letters. Except, well there are some missing pages from his notebook that might have been something for me, but I guess he threw them away or they got lost or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he mailed them to you,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNah, they\u2019d\u2019ve gotten here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe they weren\u2019t written for you,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe . . . I mean, not to depress you or anything, but maybe he wrote them for someone else and mailed them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVAN HOUTEN!\u201d I shouted.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? Was that a cough?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKaitlyn, I love you. You are a genius. I have to go.\u201d</p><p>I hung up, rolled over, reached for my laptop, turned it on, and emailed lidewij.vliegenthart.</p><p>Lidewij,</p><p>I believe Augustus Waters sent a few pages from a notebook to Peter Van Houten shortly before he (Augustus) died. It is very important to me that someone reads these pages. I want to read them, of course, but maybe they weren\u2019t written for me. Regardless, they must be read. They must be. Can you help?</p><p>Your friend,</p> <p>Hazel Grace Lancaster</p><p>She responded late that afternoon.</p><p>Dear Hazel,</p><p>I did not know that Augustus had died. I am very sad to hear this news. He was such a very charismatic young man. I am so sorry, and so sad.</p><p>I have not spoken to Peter since I resigned that day we met. It is very late at night here, but I am going over to his house first thing in the morning to find this letter and force him to read it. Mornings were his best time, usually.</p><p>Your friend,</p> <p>Lidewij Vliegenthart</p><p>p.s. I am bringing my boyfriend in case we have to physically restrain Peter.</p><p>I wondered why he\u2019d written Van Houten in those last days instead of me, telling Van Houten that he\u2019d be redeemed if only he gave me my sequel. Maybe the notebook pages had just repeated his request to Van Houten. It made sense, Gus leveraging his terminality to make my dream come true: The sequel was a tiny thing to die for, but it was the biggest thing left at his disposal.</p><p>I refreshed my email continually that night, slept for a few hours, and then commenced to refreshing around five in the morning. But nothing arrived. I tried to watch TV to distract myself, but my thoughts kept drifting back to Amsterdam, imagining Lidewij Vliegenthart and her boyfriend bicycling around town on this crazy mission to find a dead kid\u2019s last correspondence. How fun it would be to bounce on the back of Lidewij Vliegenthart\u2019s bike down the brick streets, her curly red hair blowing into my face, the smell of the canals and cigarette smoke, all the people sitting outside the caf\u00e9s drinking beer, saying their r\u2019s and g\u2019s in a way I\u2019d never learn.</p><p>I missed the future. Obviously I knew even before his recurrence that I\u2019d never grow old with Augustus Waters. But thinking about Lidewij and her boyfriend, I felt robbed. I would probably never again see the ocean from thirty thousand feet above, so far up that you can\u2019t make out the waves or any boats, so that the ocean is a great and endless monolith. I could imagine it. I could remember it. But I couldn\u2019t see it again, and it occurred to me that the voracious ambition of humans is never sated by dreams coming true, because there is always the thought that everything might be done better and again.</p><p>That is probably true even if you live to be ninety\u2014although I\u2019m jealous of the people who get to find out for sure. Then again, I\u2019d already lived twice as long as Van Houten\u2019s daughter. What he wouldn\u2019t have given to have a kid die at sixteen.</p><p>Suddenly Mom was standing between the TV and me, her hands folded behind her back. \u201cHazel,\u201d she said. Her voice was so serious I thought something might be wrong.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you know what today is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my birthday, is it?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNot just yet. It\u2019s July fourteenth, Hazel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it your birthday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Harry Houdini\u2019s birthday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am really tired of guessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIT IS BASTILLE DAY!\u201d She pulled her arms from behind her back, producing two small plastic French flags and waving them enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a fake thing. Like Cholera Awareness Day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you, Hazel, that there is nothing fake about Bastille Day. Did you know that two hundred and twenty-three years ago today, the people of France stormed the Bastille prison to arm themselves to fight for their freedom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I said. \u201cWe should celebrate this momentous anniversary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt so happens that I have just now scheduled a picnic with your father in Holliday Park.\u201d</p><p>She never stopped trying, my mom. I pushed against the couch and stood up. Together, we cobbled together some sandwich makings and found a dusty picnic basket in the hallway utility closet.</p><p>It was kind of a beautiful day, finally real summer in Indianapolis, warm and humid\u2014the kind of weather that reminds you after a long winter that while the world wasn\u2019t built for humans, we were built for the world. Dad was waiting for us, wearing a tan suit, standing in a handicapped parking spot typing away on his handheld. He waved as we parked and then hugged me. \u201cWhat a day,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we lived in California, they\u2019d all be like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but then you wouldn\u2019t enjoy them,\u201d my mom said. She was wrong, but I didn\u2019t correct her.</p><p>We ended up putting our blanket down by the Ruins, this weird rectangle of Roman ruins plopped down in the middle of a field in Indianapolis. But they aren\u2019t real ruins: They\u2019re like a sculptural re-creation of ruins built eighty years ago, but the fake Ruins have been neglected pretty badly, so they have kind of become actual ruins by accident. Van Houten would like the Ruins. Gus, too.</p><p>So we sat in the shadow of the Ruins and ate a little lunch. \u201cDo you need sunscreen?\u201d Mom asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I said.</p><p>You could hear the wind in the leaves, and on that wind traveled the screams of the kids on the playground in the distance, the little kids figuring out how to be alive, how to navigate a world that was not built for them by navigating a playground that was. Dad saw me watching the kids and said, \u201cYou miss running around like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, I guess.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t what I was thinking. I was just trying to notice everything: the light on the ruined Ruins, this little kid who could barely walk discovering a stick at the corner of the playground, my indefatigable mother zigzagging mustard across her turkey sandwich, my dad patting his handheld in his pocket and resisting the urge to check it, a guy throwing a Frisbee that his dog kept running under and catching and returning to him.</p><p>Who am I to say that these things might not be forever? Who is Peter Van Houten to assert as fact the conjecture that our labor is temporary? All I know of heaven and all I know of death is in this park: an elegant universe in ceaseless motion, teeming with ruined ruins and screaming children.</p><p>My dad was waving his hand in front of my face. \u201cTune in, Hazel. Are you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, yeah, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom suggested we go see Gus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah,\u201d I said.</p><p>So after lunch, we drove down to Crown Hill Cemetery, the last and final resting place of three vice presidents, one president, and Augustus Waters. We drove up the hill and parked. Cars roared by behind us on Thiry-eighth Street. It was easy to find his grave: It was the newest. The earth was still mounded above his coffin. No headstone yet.</p><p>I didn\u2019t feel like he was there or anything, but I still took one of Mom\u2019s dumb little French flags and stuck it in the ground at the foot of his grave. Maybe passersby would think he was a member of the French Foreign Legion or some heroic mercenary.</p><p>Lidewij finally wrote back just after six P.M. while I was on the couch watching both TV and videos on my laptop. I saw immediately there were four attachments to the email and I wanted to open them first, but I resisted temptation and read the email.</p><p>Dear Hazel,</p><p>Peter was very intoxicated when we arrived at his house this morning, but this made our job somewhat easier. Bas (my boyfriend) distracted him while I searched through the garbage bag Peter keeps with the fan mail in it, but then I realized that Augustus knew Peter\u2019s address. There was a large pile of mail on his dining room table, where I found the letter very quickly. I opened it and saw that it was addressed to Peter, so I asked him to read it.</p><p>He refused.</p><p>At this point, I became very angry, Hazel, but I did not yell at him. Instead, I told him that he owed it to his dead daughter to read this letter from a dead boy, and I gave him the letter and he read the entire thing and said\u2014I quote him directly\u2014\u201cSend it to the girl and tell her I have nothing to add.\u201d</p><p>I have not read the letter, although my eyes did fall on some phrases while scanning the pages. I have attached them here and then will mail them to you at your home; your address is the same?</p><p>May God bless and keep you, Hazel.</p><p>Your friend,</p><p>Lidewij Vliegenthart</p><p>I clicked open the four attachments. His handwriting was messy, slanting across the page, the size of the letters varying, the color of the pen changing. He\u2019d written it over many days in varying degrees of consciousness.</p><p>Van Houten,</p><p>I\u2019m a good person but a shitty writer. You\u2019re a shitty person but a good writer. We\u2019d make a good team. I don\u2019t want to ask you any favors, but if you have time\u2014and from what I saw, you have plenty\u2014I was wondering if you could write a eulogy for Hazel. I\u2019ve got notes and everything, but if you could just make it into a coherent whole or whatever? Or even just tell me what I should say differently.</p><p>Here\u2019s the thing about Hazel: Almost everyone is obsessed with leaving a mark upon the world. Bequeathing a legacy. Outlasting death. We all want to be remembered. I do, too. That\u2019s what bothers me most, is being another unremembered casualty in the ancient and inglorious war against disease.</p><p>I want to leave a mark.</p><p>But Van Houten: The marks humans leave are too often scars. You build a hideous minimall or start a coup or try to become a rock star and you think, \u201cThey\u2019ll remember me now,\u201d but (a) they don\u2019t remember you, and (b) all you leave behind are more scars. Your coup becomes a dictatorship. Your minimall becomes a lesion.</p><p>(Okay, maybe I\u2019m not such a shitty writer. But I can\u2019t pull my ideas together, Van Houten. My thoughts are stars I can\u2019t fathom into constellations.)</p><p>We are like a bunch of dogs squirting on fire hydrants. We poison the groundwater with our toxic piss, marking everything MINE in a ridiculous attempt to survive our deaths. I can\u2019t stop pissing on fire hydrants. I know it\u2019s silly and useless\u2014epically useless in my current state\u2014but I am an animal like any other.</p><p>Hazel is different. She walks lightly, old man. She walks lightly upon the earth. Hazel knows the truth: We\u2019re as likely to hurt the universe as we are to help it, and we\u2019re not likely to do either.</p><p>People will say it\u2019s sad that she leaves a lesser scar, that fewer remember her, that she was loved deeply but not widely. But it\u2019s not sad, Van Houten. It\u2019s triumphant. It\u2019s heroic. Isn\u2019t that the real heroism? Like the doctors say: First, do no harm.</p><p>The real heroes anyway aren\u2019t the people doing things; the real heroes are the people NOTICING things, paying attention. The guy who invented the smallpox vaccine didn\u2019t actually invent anything. He just noticed that people with cowpox didn\u2019t get smallpox.</p><p>After my PET scan lit up, I snuck into the ICU and saw her while she was unconscious. I just walked in behind a nurse with a badge and I got to sit next to her for like ten minutes before I got caught. I really thought she was going to die before I could tell her that I was going to die, too. It was brutal: the incessant mechanized haranguing of intensive care. She had this dark cancer water dripping out of her chest. Eyes closed. Intubated. But her hand was still her hand, still warm and the nails painted this almost black dark blue and I just held her hand and tried to imagine the world without us and for about one second I was a good enough person to hope she died so she would never know that I was going, too. But then I wanted more time so we could fall in love. I got my wish, I suppose. I left my scar.</p><p>A nurse guy came in and told me I had to leave, that visitors weren\u2019t allowed, and I asked if she was doing okay, and the guy said, \u201cShe\u2019s still taking on water.\u201d A desert blessing, an ocean curse.</p><p>What else? She is so beautiful. You don\u2019t get tired of looking at her. You never worry if she is smarter than you: You know she is. She is funny without ever being mean. I love her. I am so lucky to love her, Van Houten. You don\u2019t get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers.</p><p>I do, Augustus.</p><p>I do. </p> </body></html>"]
