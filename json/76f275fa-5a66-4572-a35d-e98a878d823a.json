Already?\u201d</p><p>Cassie wheeled her chair back to her station. \u201cCan you believe it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn old college friend. You wouldn\u2019t know her.\u201d Cassie shrugged. \u201cJill married Tom two weeks after we graduated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have children?\u201d</p><p>Cassie caught the wisp of longing in Angie\u2019s voice and answered with a nod. \u201cTwo, a boy and a girl, and of course they\u2019re adorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Angie echoed.</p> <p>The Christmas card photo showed the four of them in matching outfits of green and red. The mother and daughter wore full-length green dresses with red-and-green plaid skirts. Father and son had on three-piece suits with vests in the same fabric as the dress skirts. It was too adorable for words.</p><p>\u201cThere was a letter, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything in their lives is perfect, right?\u201d Angie asked.</p><p>\u201cPerfect in every way,\u201d Cassie grumbled. The unfairness of it all was too much. Jill, who worked as a financial planner, held down a forty-hour-a-week job, kept a meticulous house and still managed to be a terrific wife and mother. Despite all the demands on her time, she\u2019d mailed out her Christmas cards a full month in advance.</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason the perfect Jill sent her Christmas cards so soon?\u201d Angie asked.</p><p>\u201cJill and Tom just moved into a new home and wanted to update family and friends with their address change. Oh, and there was a photo of the house and it was\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Angie finished for her.</p><p>\u201cPerfect doesn\u2019t begin to describe it.\u201d</p><p>Angie watched her closely. \u201cDo I detect a slight note of envy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSlight envy? Me?\u201d Cassie asked, exaggerating the words. \u201cHeavens, no. What you\u2019re hearing is a full-blown case of jealousy. The green-eyed monster is alive and well.\u201d Cassie rolled her chair to the end of a counter filled with an assortment of microscopes, test tubes, slides and other equipment, then stood, hands propped on her hips. \u201cDo you realize how long it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve been on a real date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went out with Greg last week,\u201d Angie reminded her.</p><p>\u201cGreg isn\u2019t a man,\u201d Cassie blurted out. \u201cI mean, he is, but not in the sense of someone I\u2019m interested in,\u201d she said. \u201cGreg\u2019s...completely unsuitable as marriage material.\u201d She didn\u2019t need to explain that, at thirty-four, the ticking of her biological clock got louder by the year.</p><p>Angie sighed. \u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>He was eligible in practically every way but he happened to be divorced and in love with his ex-wife. Unfortunately, he hadn\u2019t figured that out yet. The entire date, if it could even be called a date, was spent rehashing the tragedy of his divorce. He went on and on about how much he missed his three kids\u2014and his ex-wife, if the number of times he mentioned her name was any indication. The night had been sheer drudgery for Cassie. It was her first and last date with Greg.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is, we don\u2019t meet many guys here at work,\u201d Angie said. Cassie was well aware of that. Since they were holed up in a lab eight to ten hours a day, working as biochemists for a plastics company, the opportunities to socialize outside the job were limited.</p><p>\u201cWhat really hit home,\u201d Cassie said, \u201cafter receiving that Christmas card, is how badly I want a family of my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The longing was back in Angie\u2019s voice, too.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so hard to meet men. I\u2019m reasonably attractive, right?\u201d</p><p>Angie nodded enthusiastically. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-four isn\u2019t so old, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Cassie shook her head and wondered why she was still single. She wanted to be married, and she liked to think she had the full package\u2014five-five, dark hair, dark eyes. She was attractive, as Angie had confirmed, and she was smart, with a successful career, an engaging personality (if she did say so herself) and plenty of friends. \u201cI blame my mother for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI blame my father, too, even if he didn\u2019t stick around all that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe because he didn\u2019t stick around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess. After the divorce, my mother was so down on marriage, the whole idea terrified me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t anymore, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want a husband and I\u2019d really like children.\u201d She grinned. \u201cThe ironic thing is, my mother\u2019s remarried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage seems to terrify your brother, too. Shawn should be married by now, don\u2019t you think? He\u2019s older than you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure about Shawn.\u201d Cassie sometimes wondered if Angie might be interested in her brother. There was actually nothing to indicate that, but every once in a while Cassie had this feeling.... \u201cHe travels so much that maintaining a long-term relationship would be difficult for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Angie said.</p><p>Shawn was a well-known artist who painted murals all over the country. Brother and sister were close and kept in touch, calling each other two and three times a week. Currently Shawn was in Boca Raton, Florida, painting the side of a building that stood next to the freeway. He\u2019d sent her photos of the mural from his cell phone\u2014an ocean scene, which Cassie knew was his favorite. Whales rising up out of the crashing waves. Dolphins and sea turtles and all kinds of fish frolicked in the sparkling blue water. His murals made headlines wherever he went and huge crowds showed up to watch him paint.</p><p>\u201cShawn\u2019s a different case,\u201d Cassie said. In her opinion, that summed up the situation pretty accurately.</p><p>\u201cBut if you were married, I bet he\u2019d show some interest in finding a wife,\u201d Angie commented.</p><p>Cassie had never thought of their family dynamic in those terms. Perhaps, in some obscure way, Shawn was waiting for her to make the leap first. Angie might be right. It wasn\u2019t that Shawn followed her lead\u2014far from it. They\u2019d both been traumatized by the divorce and by their mother\u2019s reaction. Their father, who wanted his kids to call him Pete, had been in and out of their lives. Mostly out and yet...yet he\u2019d had a powerful influence on his children, whom he rarely recognized as such.</p><p>\u201cShawn won\u2019t feel marriage is safe until he sees you happily married,\u201d Angie went on to say.</p><p>Cassie scowled at her friend. \u201cWhat makes you so smart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust an observation,\u201d Angie said. \u201cI may not be correct, but it seems to me that you and Shawn are afraid of love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe afraid of love? Hardly.\u201d Not if the longing in her heart was anything to go by. Like her friend Jill, she wanted it all.</p><p>\u201cWhenever you meet a man\u2014no matter how perfect he is\u2014you find fault with him,\u201d Angie said.</p><p>Now, that was categorically untrue. \u201cNot so,\u201d Cassie argued.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s all wine and roses in the beginning, but then it\u2019s over before you even have a chance to really know the guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, mostly,\u201d Angie told her softly, \u201cI can say it because I\u2019ve seen you do it again and again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not talking about me and Jess, are you? The man had no class. He scratched his private parts in public!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you mean, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRod.\u201d</p><p>Cassie cocked her head. \u201cRod? Rod who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember his last name. You went out with him a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Rod Showers? Good grief, he was so cheap I had to pay for my half of the meal and tip the valet because he refused to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Charles...\u201d</p><p>Cassie got the point quickly enough. \u201cOkay, okay, so I have standards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh standards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. High standards.\u201d Cassie had made the effort, though. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to meet men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had hopes for that online dating service.\u201d The advertisements had looked so promising. Cassie and Angie had signed up together and then waited expectantly to meet their perfect matches.</p><p>It didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>\u201cI had real hopes for that, too,\u201d Angie returned sadly. \u201cI thought for sure we\u2019d meet really wonderful husbands.\u201d</p><p>Cassie sighed. That had been an expensive venture. Her expectations had been great and her disappointment greater. Angie\u2019s too. In fact, Angie was the one who\u2019d suggested trying the Internet.</p><p>\u201cThe church singles group was a good idea,\u201d she said now.</p><p>\u201cA great idea,\u201d Cassie concurred, \u201cif there\u2019d been any men involved.\u201d They\u2019d gone there to discover the group consisted of thirty women and two men\u2014both close to retirement age.</p><p>Angie nodded. \u201cThe pickings were few and far between.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve read all the right books,\u201d Cassie said. \u201cDating for Dummies. How to Find a Man in Five Easy Lessons. My personal favorite was Lasso Yourself a Husband and Other Ways to Make a Man Notice You.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing we managed to lasso was a hundred-dollar credit-card bill for all those books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDivided two ways,\u201d Cassie reminded her.</p><p>\u201cThey did make for interesting reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would\u2019ve been a lot more interesting if we\u2019d been able to make any of them work,\u201d Cassie said in acerbic tones.</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve tried everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving up,\u201d Angie insisted. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t let you give up, either.\u201d</p><p>Cassie sighed.</p><p>She was close to it. The Christmas card from Jill and Tom was the final straw. For too long she\u2019d been convinced that one day soon, she\u2019d be mailing glossy Christmas cards to all her friends and relatives. She, too, would have a photograph that showed the perfect husband, the perfect children, a boy and a girl, all looking forward to the perfect Christmas. But year after year it was the same. No husband. No children. And each Christmas with her embittered mother more depressing than the one before.</p><p>The time had come to step forward and find a man, she decided with new resolve. Maybe she did need to lower her standards. She couldn\u2019t allow another Christmas to pass without\u2014</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something, or rather someone, you haven\u2019t tried,\u201d Angie said, cutting into Cassie\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>Cassie perked up. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Angie grew strangely quiet.</p><p>Cassie frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t hold out on me now, Angie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow expensive? No, wait, don\u2019t tell me.\u201d She paused. \u201cWho is this he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA matchmaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA matchmaker,\u201d Cassie repeated slowly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there was such a thing in this day and age.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere is.\u201d Angie avoided eye contact. \u201cIn fact, more and more people are turning to professional matchmakers. It works, too\u2014most of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow tell me how expensive he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou heard me\u2014and apparently he\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know about him because...\u201d Cassie let the question hang between them.</p><p>\u201cBecause I went to him.\u201d</p><p>Cassie slapped her hands against her sides. \u201cClearly you wasted your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t cost me a dime.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>Angie\u2019s gaze darted in every direction except Cassie\u2019s. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t accept me as a client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe rejected you?\u201d The man was nuts! Angie was lovely and smart and a thousand other adjectives that flew through her mind. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this guy, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was right.... I\u2019m not a good candidate and I would\u2019ve been wasting my money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about him before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I didn\u2019t want anyone to know I\u2019d been turned down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf he rejected you, then he\u2019ll probably reject me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...he said he couldn\u2019t accept me because I have feelings for someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did\u2014a long time ago,\u201d she said without elaborating further. \u201cBut don\u2019t let my experience dissuade you. Check him out. Like you said earlier, you\u2019ve tried everything else. At least make an appointment and see what he has to say.\u201d</p><p>Cassie was tempted to ask more about this man Angie had feelings for, but her friend had clearly signalled an unwillingness to talk about it. As far as the matchmaker went, she wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cHe actually does this for a living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He has an office and an assistant. I asked him for his credentials and he has an advanced degree in psychology and\u2014\u201d Angie stared directly at her \u201c\u2014he guarantees his work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuarantees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. If he doesn\u2019t find you a husband, you get a full refund. So make an appointment and see for yourself. Remember\u2014nothing ventured, nothing gained.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll consider it,\u201d Cassie said. She hated to admit that the idea intrigued her. Then again, it was rather archaic. Besides, if this man had rejected Angie, he couldn\u2019t be any good. Still it was an opportunity, and nothing else had presented itself.</p><p>When she got to her condo building that evening, Cassie stopped at her mailbox in the lobby and immediately noticed that her newspaper was missing. No surprise there. It vanished every Tuesday when the shopping ads came out. Her neighbor Mrs. Mullinex, took it, although Cassie hadn\u2019t been able to prove that yet. On Wednesday mornings, her paper mysteriously reappeared with the coupons clipped out. Twice now, Cassie had met her neighbor in the lobby. The grandmotherly woman didn\u2019t resemble a thief and would\u2019ve been above suspicion if not for the handful of coupons she clutched in her gloved fingers.</p><p>Grumbling under her breath, Cassie headed for her apartment. She tossed the mail on the kitchen counter without looking. The picture of Jill, Tom and their two children smiled at her from the refrigerator door.</p><p>The perfect family having the perfect Christmas.</p><p>Jill\u2019s smile seemed to be telling Cassie \u201cAll this could be yours, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA matchmaker?\u201d Cassie said aloud. \u201cAm I really resorting to this?\u201d</p><p>Angie had given Cassie his business card and then for good measure a hug and parting words of advice. \u201cJust do it. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be sorry.\u201d</p><p>Cassie hesitated and glanced over at the perfect family posed in front of the world\u2019s most beautiful Christmas tree. Oh, for heaven\u2019s sake, what would it hurt?</p><p>After rummaging around the bottom of her purse, she found the engraved card that read: Dr. Simon Dodson, Professional Matchmaker.</p><p>Heart pounding, Cassie reached for the phone.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Simon says: A good matchmaker always knows his clients\u2014especially after a background check! C assie had to wait a week before she could get an appointment with Simon Dodson. He made sure she understood that he was doing her a favor by squeezing her in at the end of the day. All right, to be fair, his personal assistant, Ms. Snelling, a rather unpleasant woman, made it sound as if an appointment was a terrible inconvenience. Frankly Cassie didn\u2019t hold out much hope for this, and who could blame her? The matchmaking psychologist had declined to accept Angie, who was probably the most decent, kindest person Cassie had ever known.</p><p>The day of the appointment, Cassie went home to change clothes. She dressed carefully, choosing a suit that made her look confident but not formal, and she refreshed her makeup. When she walked into his office, it was with her head held high. She\u2019d done her homework and was keeping an open mind. She\u2019d checked two references the Snelling woman had passed on and felt she knew what to expect. Both couples had raved about Simon. The wives had warned her that Dr. Dodson wasn\u2019t the \u201cwarm and fuzzy\u201d type. One of them had suggested that Cassie should be patient and not take offense. Hmm...that was unusual advice.</p><p>\u201cDr. Dodson will see you shortly,\u201d his assistant informed her primly after Cassie announced herself. The office had modern art decorating the walls, large green plants in the corners and soft leather furniture in a deep shade of brown.</p><p>\u201cYou filled out the paperwork I e-mailed you and brought it in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have it here.\u201d Cassie thought applying for a job at the CIA would\u2019ve been easier. Simon was interested in every aspect of her background, from the name of her first-grade teacher to her current shoe size. Okay, maybe that was an exaggeration\u2014a slight one\u2014but she didn\u2019t see how most of the questions were relevant. Really, why did Simon need a list of any allergies she might have?</p><p>She handed the lengthy application form to the assistant, who scanned it, then took it into the inner office. Ms. Snelling reappeared a couple of minutes later and gave her a thorough once-over. Then, to Cassie\u2019s surprise, the woman offered her a reassuring smile.</p><p>Cassie studied the assistant. She guessed Ms. Snelling was in her late fifties; she seemed efficient and no-nonsense. Cassie sat with her hands politely folded in her lap. This might be the most important appointment of her entire life. The best Christmas present she\u2019d ever get\u2014even if it was from herself. A husband for Christmas. Hmm...</p><p>The great Dr. Simon Dodson kept her waiting a full thirty minutes. Cassie knew because she glanced at her watch every five minutes, crossed and uncrossed her legs and flipped through three magazines. By then, she\u2019d grown impatient and irritable and had started to wonder if she\u2019d made a mistake\u2014or, worse, fallen for a scam. She wasn\u2019t accustomed to being ignored. She had better things to do than sit in a waiting room on what might turn out to be a fool\u2019s errand, a complete waste of time. She trusted that wasn\u2019t the case; still, the longer she waited, the less hope she had.</p><p>A buzzer made her jump. Ms. Snelling got smoothly to her feet, obviously used to such a peremptory summons. \u201cDr. Dodson will see you now,\u201d she said. She motioned toward the massive double doors that led into his office.</p><p>Cassie walked inside and her gaze went instantly to the man standing behind the large desk. The Internet research she\u2019d done hadn\u2019t included any photos, so she hadn\u2019t been sure what to expect\u2014but not someone relatively young with shockingly good looks. He was easily six-two and loomed above her.</p><p>\u201cMs. Beaumont?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be me,\u201d she said, straining to sound cool and collected.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d The door closed behind her.</p><p>\u201cWalk to the far side of my office and then walk back.\u201d</p><p>Cassie paused, which apparently he didn\u2019t like because he gestured for her to comply.</p><p>\u201cDo I need to say, \u2018Mother, may I?\u2019\u201d she asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t so much as crack a smile. \u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She did as he requested and felt his eyes burning into her with every step she took.</p><p>\u201cYou could stand to lose five pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d What a jerk!</p><p>\u201cYou heard me and you agree with me, only I doubt you\u2019d admit it.\u201d</p><p>Okay, maybe she could shed a few pounds, but her figure looked fine the way it was.</p><p>He continued to study her and his frown deepened. \u201cThat color doesn\u2019t flatter you.\u201d</p><p>How dare he! \u201cI happen to like navy blue.\u201d This was her favorite suit and she\u2019d purchased it at a closeout sale for seventy percent off.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cPale blue would be better.\u201d He came out from behind his desk and walked around her. \u201cYou should let your hair grow, as well. That style is becoming but you need more length.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you think there\u2019s something attractive about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>This man was too much! Cassie was tempted to turn around and leave. She might have, only she decided to see how many other ways he could find to insult her. It was becoming a game to her.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d Someone needed to teach this man some manners.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d he repeated, more loudly this time.</p><p>\u201cSit, please,\u201d she returned pointedly.</p><p>A flicker of a smile showed in his dark brown eyes. \u201cAll right, sit, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do,\u201d she said pleasantly, taking the chair across from his desk.</p><p>After a moment he said, \u201cI\u2019ve read your application.\u201d He sat down across from her, reached for the papers and leafed through them. \u201cTell me about your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you asking about him?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his shoulder in a nonchalant shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s my experience that most women want to marry a man just like their father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me. Pete\u2019s a poor excuse for a father. I want as little to do with him as possible.\u201d</p><p>Simon immediately made a lengthy notation on a pad in front of him.</p><p>Cassie moved to the edge of the cushion. \u201cWhat did you write?\u201d</p><p>Simon looked up, a frown darkening his face. Clearly she\u2019d offended him. She could only suppose he wasn\u2019t accustomed to anyone questioning his actions. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he said frostily.</p><p>\u201cI asked if you\u2019d tell me what you wrote down.\u201d She pointed at his notepad. \u201cIt was about me and my nonrelationship with my father, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He flattened his hands on the desk. \u201cThese are my notes. I don\u2019t share them with clients.\u201d</p><p>The urge to stand and simply walk out the door was nearly overwhelming. Gritting her teeth, she said, \u201cHas anyone ever told you you\u2019re rude?\u201d</p><p>He grinned as if the comment pleased him. \u201cAs a matter of fact, yes. Several people have taken delight in revealing their opinions.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt has more to do with them and their hurt feelings than with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat others think doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d</p><p>He gave a bored sigh. \u201cNot particularly. Why should it? Now listen, Ms....\u201d He glanced down at the application in an apparent effort to locate her name.</p><p>\u201cBeaumont,\u201d she supplied.</p><p>\u201cMs. Beaumont,\u201d he said impatiently. \u201cThis is my office and I ask the questions here. Kindly refrain from interrupting me.\u201d</p> <p>She leaned back in the chair. \u201cBy all means, ask away.\u201d She waved in his direction as though granting him permission to continue.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. \u201cIn as few words as possible, explain to me why you aren\u2019t married.\u201d</p><p>That was easy enough to answer. She thought of what Angie had said a few days earlier. \u201cI\u2019ve been told my standards are too high.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyes from the page, his expression startled.</p><p>\u201cI guess you could say I\u2019m choosy,\u201d she amended. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a perfect match. Someone who\u2019s just right\u2014for me. The perfect man, the perfect marriage...and,\u201d she added, almost in a whisper, \u201cthe perfect Christmas.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t respond. \u201cYou\u2019re how old?\u201d he asked, instead. He ran his finger down the application.</p><p>\u201cThirty-four. How old are you?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled. \u201cAs I requested earlier, kindly refrain from asking questions. My age is not your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer me one question, and then I promise not to ask anything else.\u201d</p><p>He glared at her.</p><p>\u201cJust one,\u201d she cajoled. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how uncomfortable it is to sit here and have you scrutinize me. It\u2019s only fair that I should know something about you.\u201d</p> <p>Sighing, he set the application aside, but before he could speak, she blurted out, \u201cAre you married?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows arched. \u201cThat\u2019s your one question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and it\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, first, if you haven\u2019t been able to find yourself a wife, what qualifies you to find me a husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I will say is that a doctor doesn\u2019t need to have a disease in order to cure it. I\u2019m good at what I do. If I wasn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t be willing to offer a refund if I\u2019m unsuccessful in locating a husband for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you always so stiff and formal\u2014as if your underwear\u2019s been starched?\u201d</p><p>He stood abruptly. \u201cI believe that will be all for this afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sending me away?\u201d She blinked, disappointed. Cassie was just starting to enjoy this. His typical clients were probably more respectful, if not downright obsequious.</p><p>\u201cThis interview is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I pass?\u201d She\u2019d rather know now than be left hanging. She guessed not. She wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he didn\u2019t take her on. And yet, disagreeable though he was, Simon Dodson intrigued her.</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch later this week.\u201d</p><p>This was a line Cassie had heard before. \u201cIn other words, don\u2019t call me, I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>Cassie recognized her marching orders. She bent down for her purse and reluctantly stood.</p><p>As she drove back to her condo, she tried to make sense of her short interview. On her way up, she collected her mail and noticed once again that the Tuesday paper was missing. Mrs. Mullinex, no doubt.</p><p>She ran for the elevator and saw Mr. Oliver, who lived on the same floor, standing inside. Looking her right in the eye, he let the doors close instead of holding them for her. This wasn\u2019t the first time, either. He was an unsociable man; the most she\u2019d been able to coax out of him was a muffled greeting, as if he begrudged every word he was forced to speak.</p><p>When she got to her condo, she saw that she had company.</p><p>\u201cShawn!\u201d Her brother had made himself at home and was wolfing down a sandwich while standing over her kitchen sink.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s about time you got home. Where were you?\u201d</p><p>Rather than explain, Cassie walked over and hugged her big brother. \u201cI had an appointment. How long are you here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo days, maybe three.\u201d</p><p>Shawn often had only a few days\u2019 rest before he flew to some other town where another commission awaited him. She knew he was headed to Phoenix, Arizona, next. He had his own home in Portland, but every now and then he dropped in on her. In an effort to encourage his visits, she\u2019d given him a key to her condo.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me fix you something decent.\u201d Cassie checked the contents of her refrigerator, then reached for a frying pan. She loved to cook and had a small repertoire of favorite dishes. This was one. \u201cHow does taco salad sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike ambrosia from the gods.\u201d He sat on the stool and watched her move about the compact kitchen. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make some man a wonderful wife.\u201d</p><p>She whirled around to face him. \u201cFunny you should say that.\u201d</p><p>Shawn went still. \u201cYou\u2019ve met someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve told you!\u201d They weren\u2019t in the habit of keeping secrets from each other. \u201cMy appointment this afternoon was with a professional matchmaker.\u201d</p><p>Her brother\u2019s head went back as if the announcement had shocked him. \u201cGet out of here! A matchmaker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had my first appointment with the great and mighty Dr. Simon Dodson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d</p><p>Cassie set the onion on the chopping board and paused. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Simon\u2019s pretty rude, but apparently he knows his stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon, is it?\u201d</p><p>In her mind it was. \u201cYeah. He\u2019s not a medical doctor, even though he has a bunch of letters behind his name.\u201d</p><p>Her brother looked unconvinced. \u201cYou checked his references?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. I spoke with two couples who met through him. I was warned in advance that he isn\u2019t the most likeable fellow on the face of the earth, but they say he has this gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you hear about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough Angie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngie?\u201d Her brother appeared as astonished by this as Cassie had been. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think she\u2019d need a matchmaker. Did she go to him?\u201d</p><p>Cassie nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little while ago. She didn\u2019t really say. What I don\u2019t get is why Simon rejected her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy! Angie\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not?\u201d she asked, her hand on her hip.</p><p>Shawn chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m staying as far away from that question as I can. What did the matchmaker say? If he rejected Angie, then what about you?\u201d</p><p>That was the thirty-thousand-dollar question. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Simon will accept me as a client or not. He said he\u2019d phone, but...\u201d The rest of her sentence was drowned out by loud rap music coming from the condo to the right of hers.</p><p>\u201cGood grief, what\u2019s that?\u201d Shawn covered his ears.</p><p>\u201cMy new neighbor,\u201d Cassie shouted back. She walked over to the kitchen wall and banged hard three times. Within half a minute, the music had been turned down to a more respectable volume.</p><p>\u201cJalape\u00f1o?\u201d she asked next, hardly missing a beat.</p><p>\u201cMight as well. My life could do with a bit of spicing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me more about this matchmaker. Do you like him?\u201d</p><p>Cassie began tearing lettuce industriously. \u201cThe truth is, I don\u2019t. He\u2019s arrogant, snooty and definitely not my type. I\u2019m not his, either. Not that it matters...But he doesn\u2019t like to be questioned or challenged. I could tell I irritated him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard he\u2019s successful, though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Until that moment, Cassie hadn\u2019t realized how much she hoped Simon would agree to work with her. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s ready for someone like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>She waved a lettuce leaf in his direction. \u201cLike I said, I questioned his actions and his decisions. He didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder why he rejected Angie,\u201d Shawn mused. \u201cI mean, she\u2019s not annoying or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, stop right there.\u201d</p><p>Shawn laughed and leaned his elbows on the counter where he sat. \u201cWho\u2019s that picture of on the fridge?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Although she didn\u2019t need to turn and look, Cassie did. She tensed slightly as she stared at the photograph of Jill and Tom and their perfect Christmas. \u201cThat, brother dearest, is my inspiration.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>A few minutes later, Cassie reached for her phone on impulse and dialed Angie\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cHello? Oh, Cassie, I was hoping you\u2019d call. How\u2019d the appointment go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like taco salad?\u201d Cassie asked rather than answering.</p><p>\u201cIs there any food group I don\u2019t like?\u201d Her friend had a smile in her voice.</p><p>\u201cSilly question. Come join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Shawn stopped by. I\u2019m making a taco salad and if you have fresh tomatoes bring one. If not, we\u2019ll do without.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShawn\u2019s there? Your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I just said. Are you coming or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way, and I\u2019ve got a tomato,\u201d Angie said, \u201cbut when I get there, I want details about the meeting with Dr. Dodson.\u201d</p><p>Shawn grabbed an orange from her fruit bowl and tossed it in the air, juggling it with an apple and doing a poor job. The orange hit the floor and rolled into the living room. \u201cI\u2019m glad you invited Angie. How\u2019s she doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Angie. She\u2019s always in a good mood.\u201d</p><p>Her brother retrieved the orange. \u201cWell...it\u2019ll be nice to see her again.\u201d</p><p>Cassie nodded absently as she began to saut\u00e9 the ground beef.</p><p>By the time Angie arrived, Cassie had the hamburger with taco sauce simmering together. The salad fixings were in a large bowl, awaiting Angie\u2019s tomato. Shawn was grating the cheese.</p><p>Angie brightened the moment she walked into the room. \u201cShawn, it\u2019s great to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d He set the cheese down long enough to give her a brief hug. Cassie always forgot how tiny her friend was until Angie stood next to her brother, who was well over six feet.</p><p>While Cassie got out the bag of tortilla chips and assembled the rest of the salad, Angie set the table and Shawn filled their water glasses. \u201cSorry I don\u2019t have any sangria,\u201d Cassie said as she carried the large wooden bowl to the table. Smaller bowls of meat, cheese and chips followed.</p><p>\u201cThis looks wonderful,\u201d Angie told her.</p><p>\u201cAllow me.\u201d Shawn pulled out Angie\u2019s chair. Then he hurried around to the other side of the table to do the same for Cassie.</p><p>\u201cSince when have you acquired gentlemanly manners?\u201d Cassie asked.</p><p>Jokingly Shawn checked his watch. \u201cAbout five minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect timing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dying to hear how everything went this afternoon,\u201d Angie said, her fork poised over the salad. \u201cHow was the meeting with...Dr. Dodson?\u201d She glanced toward Shawn as if she wasn\u2019t sure she should say any more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Cassie nodded. \u201cHe knows all about it.\u201d</p><p>Shawn rolled his eyes. \u201cPersonally I think she\u2019s nuts. So, what\u2019s the story with you and this matchmaker?\u201d</p><p>Angie ignored the question and returned her attention to Cassie. \u201cDon\u2019t keep me in suspense. What was your impression when you met him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s abrupt and ill-mannered, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s putting it mildly.\u201d She turned to Shawn. \u201cHe rejected me. I didn\u2019t make it past the initial interview. I\u2019ll admit it was a blow to my ego but I felt I had to tell Cassie about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019d reject you.\u201d Shawn looked genuinely outraged on Angie\u2019s behalf. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why either of you would have any interest in someone who seems to enjoy insulting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Cassie answered. \u201cWe\u2019re getting desperate, that\u2019s why. It\u2019s not easy to meet decent men, you know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at our age,\u201d Angie added.</p><p>\u201cSee that picture of Jill and Tom?\u201d Cassie said, pointing to her refrigerator. \u201cShe has the perfect life, the perfect family and is about to have the perfect Christmas. I want all that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Angie murmured fervently. \u201cAnd so far I haven\u2019t even come close.\u201d</p><p>Shawn blinked. \u201cYou two are actually serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSerious enough to pay thirty thousand bucks to find the right man.\u201d</p><p>Shawn\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t feel like repeating it. \u201cYou heard me.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Shawn muttered something about being in the wrong business.</p> <p>Angie sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous amount of money, I know, but from what I understand, it\u2019s worth every penny\u2014if you\u2019re accepted, that is. Now, Cassie, tell me about your meeting with Dr. Dodson.\u201d</p><p>Mentally reviewing the appointment, Cassie suffered more than a few doubts. \u201cI don\u2019t think I went over well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have a second appointment, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSupposedly.\u201d Cassie shrugged. \u201cHe said he\u2019d call....\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie, that\u2019s great! Dr. Dodson read my application, took one look at me and said he didn\u2019t have anyone who\u2019d suit me.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t precisely what Angie had told her earlier. Simon had apparently said she already held feelings for someone. If that was the case, Cassie didn\u2019t have any idea who it might be. She wished she\u2019d questioned her further, but at the time she\u2019d been too interested in hearing about this matchmaker and now didn\u2019t seem appropriate. Especially since Angie was obviously reluctant to talk about her own situation. The man in question must\u2019ve been someone she\u2019d met years ago, which was what Angie had implied. It certainly wasn\u2019t anyone Cassie knew, and they\u2019d worked together for six years.</p><p>\u201cTell us what he said,\u201d Angie urged.</p><p>\u201cSimon was pretty rude,\u201d Cassie said between bites of her salad. She added another layer of crushed tortilla chips to the lettuce.</p> <p>\u201cHow?\u201d Shawn asked. \u201cI want specifics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t seem to like a single thing about me. Not my body type, not my choice of clothes or the color of my suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that suit!\u201d Angie cried.</p><p>\u201cI did, too,\u201d Cassie said, immediately noting that she\u2019d used the past tense. Hard as it was to admit, he was right about that. She would\u2019ve preferred it in a soft robin\u2019s-egg blue, but the only available color had been navy.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t he have anything nice to say?\u201d Angie asked.</p><p>\u201cWell...he did mention that my hairstyle suited me but it needed more length. That was as close to a compliment as he got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you made it past the first interview,\u201d Angie said again, as though Cassie had managed a feat of unparalleled skill.</p><p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Shawn said, pushing back in his chair, \u201cis why you\u2019d allow this man to insult you. I mean, everything he said was just a matter of opinion. His opinion.\u201d He raised both hands as the women started to protest. \u201cOkay, I understand you\u2019re feeling desperate\u2014to quote you\u2014but I don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>Cassie and Angie shared a look.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s the promise,\u201d Cassie said.</p><p>\u201cThe promise,\u201d Shawn repeated. \u201cWhat promise?\u201d</p><p>Angie leaned forward, folding her arms on the table. \u201cDr. Dodson guarantees that he\u2019ll find you a match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone who\u2019ll be a perfect match...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone who\u2019s as eager to meet us as we are them,\u201d Angie explained.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d Cassie said, \u201cI can\u2019t help wondering if the man of my dreams is actually out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he is,\u201d Shawn insisted. \u201cFrankly I think all of this is nonsense. How can anyone guarantee that he\u2019ll find you a perfect match?\u201d Sarcasm dripped from his words. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re willing to pay the guy that much money when you\u2019re completely capable of finding yourself a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Cassie asked, opening her arms and gesturing widely. \u201cTell me where he is and I\u2019ll send a search party to bag him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll volunteer,\u201d Angie said. \u201cMaybe there\u2019ll be an extra man hanging around for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Shawn ignored their teasing. \u201cThere are men, decent men, everywhere. You can meet him at work\u2014\u201d they shook their heads simultaneously \u201c\u2014well, then, at...at the grocery store. Or on the street. Or in a bookstore. Or...\u201d</p><p>Angie cocked one finely shaped eyebrow. \u201cDid you hear what I just heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Cassie confirmed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shawn looked from one woman to the other.</p><p>\u201cYou used the word meet,\u201d Cassie told him.</p><p>\u201cNot marry,\u201d Angie said.</p><p>\u201cNow, just a minute\u2014\u201d Shawn started to speak but Cassie cut him off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a prime example of what we\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Shawn placed a hand over his heart. \u201cI\u2019m too busy for a wife and family. I\u2019m constantly on the road. That\u2019s no life for kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t feel the need for companionship, then?\u201d Angie asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen don\u2019t,\u201d Cassie complained. \u201cThey don\u2019t know they\u2019re miserable until we tell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m miserable now?\u201d Shawn laughed as if she\u2019d made a joke. \u201cToo bad I\u2019ve never noticed.\u201d</p><p>Cassie wasn\u2019t about to argue with him. \u201cMen aren\u2019t on the same timetable women are, and when they finally wake up and realize they want the same things we do, they can still father children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman has biological limitations,\u201d Angie said, \u201cif she wants kids.\u201d</p><p>Her brother\u2019s look sobered. \u201cYou two aren\u2019t kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Cassie said. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re willing to put up with the criticism and scrutiny of someone like Simon Dodson in the hope of finding a good man we can share our lives with.\u201d</p><p>Shawn grew thoughtful. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he\u2019d reject you, Angie. It seems to me you\u2019d be an ideal candidate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he did, and it\u2019s his prerogative,\u201d she said briskly. Then she smiled at Cassie. \u201cI can hardly wait until you have your next appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, just a minute,\u201d Shawn said again. \u201cYou should\u2019ve asked me to set you up before you went to all this trouble.\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou have someone you want me to meet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sure. I know a dozen eligible men. I could\u2019ve introduced you.\u201d</p><p>Cassie glanced at Angie. \u201cHe only thinks to mention this now?\u201d</p><p>Angie frowned. \u201cDo you really trust your brother to find you a husband?\u201d</p><p>Cassie shook her head. \u201cMy idea of what I want and what he has to offer might be worlds apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you two,\u201d Shawn said, breaking into their conversation. \u201cI\u2019m sitting right here. If you have any doubts, you can address them to me directly and not to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Cassie said. \u201cTell me about one such man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He appeared to be deep in thought.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he can scrounge up even one,\u201d Cassie whispered, raising her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute, would you,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cNotice how testy he gets when challenged.\u201d</p><p>Her brother silenced her with a look.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Riley,\u201d he declared triumphantly. He beamed a smile at Angie and then Cassie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always liked the name Riley,\u201d Angie said.</p><p>\u201cRiley.\u201d Cassie threw back her head. \u201cYou\u2019re joking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Riley?\u201d Angie wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an artist friend of Shawn\u2019s. He\u2019s got two ex-wives, a gambling problem and he drinks too much. You\u2019re scraping the bottom of the frying pan if you\u2019re suggesting either of us should marry Riley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s reformed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. And when did this happen?\u201d</p><p>Shawn seemed unsure. \u201cNot too long ago. He said he\u2019s through messing up his life. What he needs now is a good woman.\u201d</p><p>Cassie exhaled slowly. \u201cTell him to talk to one of his ex-wives, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Angie said, \u201cI\u2019m not interested, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to try harder than that,\u201d Cassie informed her brother.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Larry Upjohn? You couldn\u2019t meet a nicer guy if you tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know Larry?\u201d Angie asked her.</p><p>Cassie nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s Shawn\u2019s CPA and in a word...b-o-r-i-n-g.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say you were looking for a stand-up comic,\u201d Shawn said, obviously annoyed.</p><p>\u201cCall me superficial, but I don\u2019t want to date a man who wears knee-high socks with his sandals and a pocket protector in his pajamas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little personality would be helpful,\u201d Angie said in a defeated voice. \u201cAs you can tell, it\u2019s not as easy as it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarren!\u201d Shawn\u2019s face lit up. \u201cWhat about Warren?\u201d</p><p>Once more Angie turned to Cassie.</p><p>She nodded, but without enthusiasm. \u201cWarren\u2019s a...possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Warren?\u201d Shawn cried.</p><p>Cassie shrugged. \u201cNothing really. He just doesn\u2019t ring my bells. He might Angie\u2019s, though.\u201d</p><p>Shawn leaned back, throwing out his arms in an expansive gesture. \u201cI can introduce you, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about him first,\u201d Angie said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Shawn\u2019s agent,\u201d Cassie explained. \u201cHe\u2019s a nice guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice isn\u2019t a word I\u2019d use to describe Warren,\u201d Shawn commented. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough negotiator.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut a real kitten on the inside,\u201d Cassie said. \u201cHe\u2019s also divorced. Recently, if I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe and Clare split last year. I don\u2019t know many guys your age who aren\u2019t divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s reassuring,\u201d Cassie muttered. Warren was the best of the rather shallow pool of Shawn\u2019s male friends and acquaintances. Shallow pools, as everyone knew, were usually the slimiest, too. This was exactly why she\u2019d decided on the matchmaker.</p><p>\u201cWarren\u2019s got a couple of kids. His wife has custody.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, big brother, but I\u2019ll stick with Dr. Dodson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the suggestion,\u201d Angie said, \u201cbut I\u2019ll pass on Warren, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I think of anyone else, I\u2019ll give you a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that,\u201d Cassie said, although she didn\u2019t expect he would. \u201cOn second thought, phone Angie.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p> <p>Simon says: I can find the right mate for everyone. Even you! S imon kept Cassie waiting forty-five minutes on her next visit. His assistant, Ms. Snelling, had called the day after her first appointment. It was now Friday. Since she\u2019d been on pins and needles for three whole days, an additional forty-five minutes didn\u2019t bother her. Today would be when he\u2019d announce whether he\u2019d found her a match.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t figure out how, based on their brief conversation, Simon would be able to match her up with the perfect man. Maybe, as Angie said, it really was all about his ability as a psychologist, his scientific study of her lengthy questionnaire.</p><p>For three nights now, she\u2019d been like a kid at Christmas\u2014only instead of sugar plums dancing around in her head she saw men\u2019s faces. Men who were enthralled with her. Men who\u2019d go through the same insulting rigmarole she had for the chance to meet her. Men who were just as eager for the very things she wanted\u2014a home and family, security, a sense of belonging and a lifetime filled with love. And one of those men would be her perfect match.</p><p>\u201cDr. Dodson will see you now,\u201d Ms. Snelling said in the same crisp tone she\u2019d used on Cassie\u2019s first visit.</p><p>Cassie bounded up from the chair as though she\u2019d been ejected. Despite her eagerness, she tried to move slowly and calmly. When she entered his office, she found Simon sitting at his desk.</p><p>Without looking up, he gestured for her to sit, too.</p> <p>Cassie did, perching on the very edge. She didn\u2019t expect an apology for being kept waiting and wasn\u2019t disappointed. When Simon eventually looked up, she noticed streaks of gray in his hair that had escaped her notice previously.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans for Christmas?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Of all the things Cassie had expected him to say, this wasn\u2019t it. \u201cAh...I\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d She hadn\u2019t talked to her brother yet. Her mother and stepfather lived in Hawaii and it was unlikely that they\u2019d fly in for the holidays. Her father...well, she hadn\u2019t spent Christmas with him since she was five or six. \u201cThere\u2019s just Shawn and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Shawn is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother. It\u2019s on the questionnaire. He\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d Simon broke in. \u201cWhat did you do last Christmas?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, let me see...\u201d She tried to remember where she\u2019d been and with whom. Was it last year that Angie\u2014</p><p>\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be so difficult,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt was eleven months ago,\u201d she snapped. His attitude irritated her. \u201cAs I recall, Shawn and I went out to eat. Angie, a friend of mine, was supposed to join us but at the last minute she couldn\u2019t and we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d he said, interrupting her again.</p><p>\u201cAnd what exactly were you doing?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you last Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I indicated during our previous session, I\u2019m the one asking the questions.\u201d</p><p>Cassie made an effort to hold her temper. \u201cI guess that slipped my mind. But I was allowed one question then, so I assume that\u2019s the case today, and I\u2019m asking it now.\u201d She took a deep\u2014and necessary\u2014breath. \u201cWhere were you last Christmas?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled slowly. \u201cRight here in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith friends and loved ones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more than one question.\u201d He looked pointedly in her direction. \u201cShall we continue or not? The choice is yours.\u201d</p><p>Knowing she was fighting a losing battle, Cassie tried to regain her equilibrium. \u201cYes, let\u2019s continue, although I don\u2019t understand what last Christmas has to do with anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you always this dictatorial?\u201d She realized she was asking yet another question, but she couldn\u2019t stop herself.</p><p>\u201cI am when I feel I can find the right match for a client. An exasperating one, I might add.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d That was worth all the insults he could issue, Cassie decided. She slid so far to the edge of the chair that she was in danger of falling onto the carpet. \u201cYou actually have someone in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d This was said in a clipped, businesslike way.</p><p>She waited, but he wasn\u2019t any more forthcoming than that.</p><p>\u201cBefore I introduce you, there are a few matters we need to attend to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Her heart felt as if it had moved into her throat.</p><p>\u201cMy fee is thirty thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know...That\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>Simon glanced up. \u201cI thought you were aware of my fee. If you can\u2019t afford me, then I suggest you leave now and save us both a lot of time and trouble.\u201d</p><p>The money was safely tucked in Cassie\u2019s savings account. \u201cI put it aside for a wedding, but obviously there won\u2019t be one without a groom. I\u2019m willing to make the investment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then I\u2019ll introduce you to John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is John?\u201d John was a solid name, implying that he was a solid man; she liked him already.</p><p>\u201cBefore I introduce you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a money-back guarantee, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain that in a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.\u201d She wanted to capture every single detail of this meeting so she could repeat it all to Angie.</p><p>\u201cI have three tasks I want you to complete first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d She wondered if she\u2019d misheard him. Cassie was waiting to hear about her perfect mate, and he was talking about tasks? What was this, homework?</p><p>\u201cThese are qualifying tasks,\u201d he was saying. \u201cI need to be sure you\u2019re the woman for John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...no one said anything about needing to qualify.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her outburst. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve fulfilled these three simple tasks, I will introduce you to John. The choice is easy\u2014do what I ask and meet the man of your dreams or keep your money and walk away now.\u201d He sat back in his chair and clasped his hands, clearly regarding this as a take-it-or-leave-it proposition.</p><p>Cassie\u2019s head reeled. \u201cDo you ask this of all your clients?\u201d she cried, almost positive he didn\u2019t. Her nerves were quickly fraying.</p><p>\u201cHow often do I need to tell you? I\u2019m not in the habit of answering questions.\u201d He paused and looked her straight in the eye. \u201cHowever, I\u2019ll admit that I don\u2019t ask this of every client. Only certain ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made me so lucky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour motives. You expect to find the perfect husband, the perfect marriage and the perfect Christmas, correct?\u201d</p><p>She remembered having said as much. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking for the impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...isn\u2019t that what you promised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. If you\u2019ll examine my Web site, you\u2019ll see that I promise the right mate. The most suitable spouse. But that\u2019s just the beginning. A happy marriage is about much more than the appearance of perfection.\u201d</p><p>Others had found true love. Jill and Tom had, so why couldn\u2019t she? \u201cI can dream, can\u2019t I?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can dream as long as your dreams are rooted in reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you consider it your duty to drag me out of my happy fantasy and into the real world,\u201d she said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cWhat I consider my duty is to match you up with someone who\u2019ll spend the rest of his life thinking he\u2019s the most fortunate man alive to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She swallowed tightly.</p><p>\u201cDo you accept the three tasks or not?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. She needed more information before she agreed to anything. \u201cWhat are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to swim in shark-infested waters, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about. It\u2019s nothing life-threatening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have to eat anything disgusting, will I?\u201d</p><p>He cringed. \u201cGood grief, no. As I said, these are simple, ordinary tasks. It sounds as if you\u2019ve been watching too much reality television.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t. My friend Angie watches that stuff and then tells me about it the next day.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her explanation and reached for a slip of paper on his desk. \u201cHere\u2019s your first task. I need you to volunteer for a four-hour shift as a bell ringer in front of the Southcenter Mall near Kent. Do you know it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know every mall within a two-hundred-mile radius of Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt of that.\u201d</p><p>Really, how difficult could a four-hour shift be? \u201cSure, that won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the weekend after Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. The mall will be hopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a quota the charity expects you to make, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have any trouble with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. What\u2019s the second task?\u201d The first one didn\u2019t seem too hard; the next one was probably along similar lines.</p><p>\u201cYou said on the application form that you\u2019re interested in a man who wants children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m going to give you the opportunity to spend an entire afternoon with the little darlings. You\u2019ll be one of Santa\u2019s elves for a picture-taking session at the Tacoma Mall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn elf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a costume. I apologize, but it\u2019s one of the requirements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, I can be an elf.\u201d She didn\u2019t like the idea of wearing some silly outfit with tights and pointed shoes but she could cope. \u201cAnd the final task?\u201d</p><p>He reached for another slip of paper. \u201cI also saw on your application that you enjoy cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d And she was pretty good at it if she did say so herself.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. For your third task, I want you to cook Christmas dinner. Turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes with gravy, salad, vegetables...that sort of thing. Oh, and two different kinds of homemade pie.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd who\u2019s going to be eating this huge meal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour neighbors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d She raised her index finger in protest. \u201cI don\u2019t have the friendliest neighbors....\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvite them, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd who\u2019s going to check up to see if I\u2019ve completed these tasks?\u201d she asked. She suspected Simon hadn\u2019t thought this completely through.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be checking in on you during the first two tasks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might as well come to Christmas dinner, then. Can I invite my brother and best friend, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, but he didn\u2019t respond to her admittedly reluctant invitation.</p><p>\u201cCan they bring a contribution?\u201d She was thinking Shawn could scrounge up a cooked turkey somewhere and even Angie could manage stuffing out of a box.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you will be providing the entire meal.\u201d</p><p>Cassie was afraid of that.</p><p>\u201cNow that you know the tasks, do you feel you can handle them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so\u2014but what exactly is the point?\u201d</p><p>He smiled\u2014a glimmer of a smile. \u201cEach task will tell me something about you. Something important. However, you don\u2019t seem very confident. Can you or can\u2019t you? A yes or no will suffice.\u201d</p><p>Lifting her hand to her brow she saluted him smartly. \u201cAye, aye, sir.\u201d</p> <p>Her gesture failed to amuse him, but he did relax somewhat. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve squared away that portion of our discussion, it\u2019s time to finalize the paperwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Oh\u2014do I get to ask three things of you\u2014small, easy-to-perform tasks?\u201d</p><p>He sent her a withering look.</p><p>\u201cObviously I don\u2019t,\u201d she said under her breath.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make this clear,\u201d he said with exaggerated patience. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who sought me out. You came to me because of your desire for a husband and a family. I don\u2019t advertise. I didn\u2019t ask you to step into this office. You came of your own free will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she concurred.</p><p>\u201cThen we play this by my rules.\u201d</p><p>She resisted rolling her eyes for fear he\u2019d demand she leave. \u201cRules,\u201d she repeated softly. \u201cIs this a game to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, this is life, yours and John\u2019s. He\u2019s a good man who wants the same things you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I accept your rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I at least see his photograph?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You will meet when it\u2019s time. There will be no information exchanged before that official meeting.\u201d</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t like it, but she didn\u2019t have any alternative. She nodded.</p><p>Simon opened a side drawer and withdrew a contract. \u201cI advise you to have your attorney look this over before you sign it. This is a standard contract, stating what you can expect for your thirty thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if John and I don\u2019t gel? If we aren\u2019t a good fit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat occasionally happens and it\u2019s a fair question. Your money will be refunded to both of you in full.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, will you introduce me to another potential mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a one-shot deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne-shot?\u201d That sounded risky.</p><p>\u201cIf I offered choices, my clients would be wondering who else might be available. When I pick a mate for you, it\u2019s the best match I can find, someone I believe will complement your strengths, share your values and fulfill your desires\u2014within reasonable parameters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your success rate is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh. I don\u2019t accept a client unless I\u2019m confident I have the right person for him or her. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d</p><p>Cassie stared down at the contract. She\u2019d feel better if she liked Simon more. The man was rude, arrogant and short-tempered.</p><p>It was as if he\u2019d read her thoughts. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to like me, Cassie,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s preferable that you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really,\u201d he returned. \u201cThe last thing I want or need is for a client to fall in love with me. It only complicates matters, and I don\u2019t like unnecessary complications. Understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s dreaming?\u201d</p><p>A smile came and went. A smile that charmed her despite everything he\u2019d said and done.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Simon says: Maybe money can\u2019t buy love\u2014but it can get you practically everything else. O n the Saturday morning after Thanksgiving, which she\u2019d spent with Angie and her family, Cassie headed for Southcenter Mall. This was the venue for her first task and she was eager to prove herself to Simon, obviously a curmudgeon. Spending four hours soliciting money for charity couldn\u2019t possibly be that difficult.</p><p>Since she\u2019d be standing outside, Cassie dressed in wool pants and a hand-knit sweater over her long-sleeved blouse. Between the shirt and sweater, she could barely get her arms inside the sleeves of her coat. She added a hat, gloves and a scarf, dressing for the cold. When she met her one true love, she wanted to make sure she didn\u2019t have a runny nose and a sore throat.</p><p>Cassie showed up at the mall at the required time and met the other charity bell ringers. Standing with her colleagues, she glanced around. Some were being paid and frankly she thought they looked kind of shifty. Others, like her, were volunteers.</p><p>\u201cSmile and greet everyone,\u201d the leader instructed. \u201cBe friendly even if someone walks past you.\u201d</p><p>Filled with enthusiasm, Cassie could hardly wait to be assigned her post.</p><p>\u201cMake eye contact\u201d was the second bit of advice. \u201cAnd ring that bell. Remind shoppers of those less fortunate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Cassie said aloud.</p><p>\u201cThis is one of the busiest shopping weekends of the year, so you shouldn\u2019t have any problem making your quota.\u201d</p><p>In the back of her mind, she recalled Simon\u2019s casually mentioning something about collecting a certain dollar amount and the way he\u2019d made light of it. The recommended donation amount turned out to be $60 an hour. That was a dollar a minute! How was she supposed to know how much money she\u2019d collected when the red pot was securely locked? It wasn\u2019t as if she could pry the lid off and count the cash.</p><p>\u201cAre we ready?\u201d their helpful leader called out.</p><p>Cassie\u2019s shout blended in with the others\u2019. \u201cReady!\u201d</p><p>One by one, they received their assignments. Cassie was told to stand in front of the Target store, which had an outside entrance. With bell in hand, she headed toward her designated post. This wasn\u2019t so bad. Not only was she helping the underprivileged but she was moving toward the man of her dreams.</p><p>She waited eagerly as a couple walked up. Smiling sweetly, she jerked her hand several times in succession, making the bell jangle. \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d she greeted them.</p><p>The couple avoided eye contact and entered the store via the door farthest from Cassie.</p><p>Their lack of generosity\u2014and appreciation for her efforts\u2014didn\u2019t faze her.</p><p>Not much later, a grandmotherly type approached her. \u201cDo you have change for a five?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>\u201cSorry, we can\u2019t make change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d she said regretfully, \u201cthen perhaps I can give you something on my way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Cassie said cheerfully, \u201cI\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>In her first thirty minutes, Cassie estimated that she\u2019d collected less than five dollars, which wasn\u2019t even close to her hourly goal. She stomped her feet to ward off the cold. In an effort to liven things up a bit, she attempted to ring the tunes of popular Christmas songs.</p><p>She gave that up during \u201cFrosty the Snowman\u201d when a teenage boy walked past and reached for his cell phone. He said, \u201cHello. Hello. Hello,\u201d before he realized it was her bell and not his cell. He stopped in front of her and glared.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, and gasped when the youth shot her the finger.</p><p>\u201cWell, Merry Christmas to you, too.\u201d Of all the nerve!</p><p>After an hour Angie came by and mercifully handed her a cup of steaming hot coffee.</p><p>\u201cGod love you,\u201d she said, gratefully accepting it.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>If it\u2019d been Simon rather than Angie, she would have declared that this was the most wonderful, rewarding experience of her life. With Angie she felt compelled to tell the truth. \u201cI can\u2019t feel my nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything else?\u201d her friend asked, her expression concerned.</p><p>\u201cPut some money in the pot. I\u2019m nowhere near my quota.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure.\u201d Angie put in a hefty donation.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stand in for you? You look like you could use a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Simon Dodson was sure to find out about it and consider her unworthy of John. Cassie wasn\u2019t willing to risk that.</p><p>\u201cYou have a donation quota?\u201d</p><p>Cassie nodded. \u201cI bet that guy at the other entrance isn\u2019t having this problem,\u201d she muttered. Her breath made small whiffs of fog. Her nose wasn\u2019t the only body part in danger of frostbite. Even the knit cap wasn\u2019t enough to completely protect her ears. She\u2019d swear those weren\u2019t earrings dangling from her lobes, but tiny icicles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come and see you again later,\u201d Angie promised.</p><p>\u201cGreat, and thanks for the coffee.\u201d Cassie wondered whether anyone would notice if she stuck her nose in the hot liquid.</p><p>Angie disappeared inside the mall and Cassie rang her bell with renewed enthusiasm. It helped to remember that in less than three hours she would have completed one of the tasks that would bring her closer to meeting John.</p><p>In retrospect she wished she\u2019d pushed Simon to show her John\u2019s photograph. Then again, she didn\u2019t want any predetermined impressions of him. He was already bigger than life in her mind. She pictured him at the head of a boardroom table or the helm of a sailboat. Or...</p><p>Suddenly, she noticed the scruffily dressed middle-aged man standing in front of her. He looked like he belonged to a motorcycle gang. He had on a worn leather jacket that barely zipped up over his protruding belly and a bandanna around his head. His hair, long and greasy and tied in a ponytail, reached to the middle of his back. He made a beeline for Cassie as if destiny had called him to her side.</p><p>Her bell ringing became a whole lot less enthusiastic.</p><p>He looked her slowly up and down. Then he smiled as if to say her waiting days were over; he had arrived. \u201cHello, there, pretty lady.\u201d</p><p>Cassie managed a weak smile in return. \u201cHappy holidays.\u201d This guy didn\u2019t strike her as the charitable type.</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019re real cold standing out here all by yourself.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond but his gaze lingered on her, which gave her a decidedly uncomfortable feeling.</p><p>\u201cI could find ways to keep us both warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...actually I\u2019m warm as toast,\u201d she said. An outright lie. She hoped he didn\u2019t notice that, by this time, her nose was probably blue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A mother and daughter scurried past her. Cassie thrust out her arm and rang the bell as if sounding an alarm during the great San Francisco fire. When the pair resolutely ignored her, she rang the bell using both hands. Still they walked past. In fact, it seemed to Cassie that they went out of their way to avoid her. In other words, she was on her own with the biker.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d be grateful for a donation,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking you could give me one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? What could I possibly give you?\u201d As soon as she asked the question, Cassie realized her mistake. \u201cForget I asked that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing after this stint?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Cassie could hardly believe this was happening and let her bell-holding hand fall to her side. \u201cAre you trying to pick me up?\u201d she asked incredulously. \u201cYou\u2019re old enough to be my father.\u201d She did her best to hide her revulsion.</p><p>\u201cHey, you can\u2019t blame a guy for trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can. Now kindly move along. You\u2019re discouraging donations.\u201d She scowled at him, letting him know she didn\u2019t appreciate that he was cutting into her hourly quota.</p><p>He chuckled as though amused. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re missing.\u201d</p> <p>Frankly, Cassie was grateful for the escape. She heaved a sigh of relief when he sauntered off. Her one hope was that when he left the mall he\u2019d use a different exit.</p><p>As soon as Mr. Easy Rider was gone, donations picked up. Still, as far as she could figure, Cassie wasn\u2019t even close to making the recommended quota, despite her cheerful greetings.</p><p>Distracted, she didn\u2019t notice another man approaching.</p><p>\u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself,\u201d he said angrily.</p><p>Taken aback, she blinked, then asked, \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Obviously he wasn\u2019t the one standing in the cold, ringing his heart out, seeking donations for the poor.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t even December.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd your point is?\u201d she challenged, which she recognized almost immediately was a mistake. She didn\u2019t want to invite an argument, which she\u2019d inadvertently done.</p><p>\u201cChristmas is far too commercial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s got their hand out. I\u2019ve had it up to here,\u201d he said, slicing the air over his head, \u201cwith greedy beggars asking for handouts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreedy beggars?\u201d she repeated, growing agitated. \u201cDon\u2019t you have any compassion for others? Where\u2019s your Christmas spirit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t come out until December. Look at these shops! Most of them had their Christmas displays up before Halloween. All they\u2019re after is the almighty dollar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo complain to them, not me,\u201d she urged, hoping to send Scrooge on his way. \u201cAnd when you do, say hello to Tiny Tim for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose greedy shop owners spoil the true meaning of Christmas. And you\u2019re no better than corporate America, stopping people as they\u2019re going into the store. Irritating them with that stupid bell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you for anything. The bell is to remind shoppers of the less fortunate. I didn\u2019t stop you\u2014you\u2019re the one who came up to me. Furthermore...\u201d She halted midsentence as it occurred to her that this man might be a plant of Simon\u2019s, that he\u2019d purposely headed right over to chat with her.</p><p>Cassie eyed him warily. \u201cSimon sent you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon? Who\u2019s Simon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a test, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fool me! Simon sent you to see how I\u2019d respond. Well, you can tell him I saw through your little charade and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d She felt downright smug that Simon hadn\u2019t outsmarted her.</p><p>Scrooge stared at her, wearing a puzzled look. Then his eyes narrowed. \u201cLady, I suggest you seek counseling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, but I suggest you make an appointment first. You can tell Simon I said that, okay?\u201d</p><p>He backed away from her as if he suddenly suspected she carried an infectious disease.</p><p>Donations were few and far between, and Cassie glanced toward her counterpart at the other end of the mall with envy. He had more business than he knew what to do with. She, on the other hand, felt like the Little Match Girl. Using her foot, she eased the red kettle ever so slightly toward the department store entrance. She was about halfway between the two when the other charity collector noticed.</p><p>Cassie eased her foot away from the pot and gazed in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cHey, you!\u201d he shouted, pointing an accusing finger at her. \u201cYou stay in your half of the mall and I\u2019ll stay in mine.\u201d</p><p>Playing innocent, Cassie pressed her gloved hand to her chest. \u201cAre you speaking to me?\u201d she called.</p><p>\u201cYou drag that kettle one step closer, sister, and you\u2019ll live to regret it.\u201d</p><p>Cassie opened her mouth, then closed it. She\u2019d been caught. There was nothing to do but drag the kettle back, one step at a time.</p><p>Eventually Cassie returned to her original spot and figured she\u2019d probably lost thirty minutes in this attempt to find more fertile ground. With no option other than to follow her original plan, she continued to greet the shoppers, doing her best to display a cheerful holiday spirit.</p><p>A young couple approached from the mall parking lot and Cassie made eye contact with the man. The woman, who carried a cup of takeout coffee, didn\u2019t appear to see her, but he looked friendly enough, so Cassie rang the bell with renewed energy. These people seemed like the kind who\u2019d dig deep into their wallets in order to help the less fortunate.</p><p>As they neared the store, just as Cassie had hoped, the man reached in his back pocket for his wallet. This was a good sign. Cassie smiled encouragingly.</p><p>The woman walked toward the store entrance, while the man paused in front of Cassie and slipped a twenty-dollar bill into the pot.</p><p>The woman quickly rejoined her husband. \u201cHow much did you put in there?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Alicia, it\u2019s for charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharity begins at home. We\u2019ve been through this, remember? We\u2019re on a Christmas budget. We don\u2019t have extra money to be giving away.\u201d</p><p>The man grimaced apologetically.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for a good cause,\u201d Cassie reminded the woman.</p><p>\u201cAs for you,\u201d Alicia said menacingly. \u201cI saw the way you were flirting with my husband. You didn\u2019t think I noticed, did you?\u201d</p><p>Cassie was too stunned to react. \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother denying it. I have eyes. Maybe the two of you are old friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlicia,\u201d the man snapped.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, we\u2019re finished. It\u2019s over.\u201d In a fit of anger she tossed the cup of coffee at Cassie.</p><p>She gasped and leaped back but not in time to avoid having coffee splash the front of her caramel-colored wool coat.</p><p>The man looked horrified, whispered something Cassie couldn\u2019t hear, then hurried after his wife. \u201cAlicia, Alicia...\u201d</p><p>In shock and denial, Cassie stared down at her coat. Some very unladylike comments formed in her mind. However, she didn\u2019t express them since that would reflect poorly on the charitable organization. Within minutes she was glad she\u2019d kept her mouth shut. Because, to Cassie\u2019s astonishment, donations started to increase dramatically following the incident. She glanced at the other bell ringer, who was scowling at her. He rang his bell louder and harder.</p><p>Cassie retaliated with an all-out rendition of \u201cDeck the Halls\u201d and soon had a short line, everyone waiting to drop in donations. She wasn\u2019t sure what had changed but clearly there\u2019d been a reversal. Perhaps her bell ringing was superior. Or perhaps that section of the parking lot had filled up. Whatever the cause, she was taking full advantage of it.</p><p>Toward the end of her shift, a sweet old lady sidled up to Cassie with a benevolent smile. She stuffed something inside her coat pocket and leaned close to whisper, \u201cUse this to buy yourself a decent coat, dear. You poor thing.\u201d</p><p>That was it? People thought she was a charity case and had taken pity on her. Too bad the coffee incident had happened at the end of her four hours. Who knew how much she would\u2019ve collected if it had occurred earlier.</p><p>She nearly laughed aloud when she realized one glove was missing. Cassie didn\u2019t have a clue when that had disappeared or how.</p><p>Precisely four hours into her assignment, when she was about ready to hand in her kettle and bell, she saw Dr. Simon Dodson. He was walking across the parking lot and headed directly toward her. And he was frowning.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Simon says: The best match for you is the one I arrange. J ust as Simon approached, an elderly gentleman stepped up to the pot and inserted a folded bill.</p><p>\u201cThank you and Merry Christmas,\u201d Cassie told him cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d the old man returned. \u201cYou see, I was on a troop train in World War II and your organization met us at the station as we disembarked and handed out doughnuts and coffee. That small kindness meant the world to those of us going off to war. I\u2019ve never forgotten it.\u201d</p><p>Cassie hardly knew what to say.</p><p>\u201cA lot of us didn\u2019t come home from the war, but I\u2019ll bet you those of us who did will always remember the friendly smiles and support you gave us. I\u2019m an old man now and I don\u2019t have many more years left.\u201d He grew teary-eyed as he spoke. \u201cMerry Christmas, young lady,\u201d he whispered, gently squeezing her hand, \u201cand thank you again for the sacrifice you\u2019re making on behalf of others.\u201d</p><p>Now it was Cassie who had tears in her eyes. She brushed them aside as Simon came closer. The old man had disappeared inside the mall by the time he arrived.</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Cassie tried to swallow the lump in her throat. \u201cMy grandfather was in the Second World War, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat elderly gentleman,\u201d she said, sniffling, \u201cthe one who was just here. He told me about something that happened when he went off to war and thanked me as if I was the one who\u2019d been kind to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see any old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t? He was here a minute ago and was...just wonderful.\u201d She didn\u2019t understand how Simon could have missed him. It was unlikely that he\u2019d have eyes only for her.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your coat?\u201d Simon asked, apparently not interested in hearing about the man who had touched her so deeply.</p><p>\u201cOh, that,\u201d she said, glancing down. \u201cThat was a lucky break. Well, to be honest, it didn\u2019t seem like it at the time, but I collected a lot of pity donations as a result.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask her to elaborate. \u201cYour shift is over. You can leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my substitute?\u201d Cassie wasn\u2019t about to be lured away from her duty station until the next person was firmly in place.</p><p>\u201cThat would be me,\u201d a cheerful middle-aged woman said from behind Simon, the supervisor at her side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cassie handed over the bell, and the supervisor took her full kettle and replaced it with an empty one. \u201cGood luck,\u201d Cassie told the new bell ringer and meant every word. She nearly added that the woman was going to need it.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me how your morning went,\u201d Simon said. He walked into the mall with her.</p><p>Cassie stood just inside the sliding glass doors for a moment, soaking in the blast of warm air. Until now she hadn\u2019t fully realized how utterly cold she\u2019d been. Four hours had felt like forever.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know,\u201d she said. Her teeth had only now stopped chattering.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t ask questions if I don\u2019t want an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. I misplaced a glove, and my nose lost feeling in the first half hour.\u201d She looked at him and muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s still there, isn\u2019t it? My nose, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His mouth twitched, but he didn\u2019t admit he was amused.</p><p>\u201cMy feet feel like blocks of ice. A jealous wife threw coffee on me and some sweet old lady slipped a fifty-dollar bill into my coat pocket because she felt sorry for me. I threw it in the pot,\u201d she added righteously.</p><p>Simon arched his brows. That apparently was his only comment.</p> <p>\u201cFurthermore, I recognized your plant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy...plant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man you sent. Okay, so I made that remark about saying hello to Tiny Tim. Oh, and about seeing a shrink. I probably shouldn\u2019t have, but I couldn\u2019t help it. He was obnoxious. Did you pay him extra for being rude?\u201d she asked. That sounded like something Simon would do.</p><p>He eyed her speculatively, but didn\u2019t respond one way or the other.</p><p>\u201cHe told you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Cassie could easily picture Scrooge running to Simon to tattle on her.</p><p>As they walked past a Starbucks, Cassie stopped abruptly. \u201cI would kill for a latte,\u201d she said and veered back into the store.</p> <p>Simon followed, and they stood in line together. When they reached the counter, Cassie ordered her vanilla latte, along with two shortbread cookies. It was after two, and she hadn\u2019t had lunch yet.</p><p>Simon ordered a large black coffee and paid their bill. Although the small area was crowded, a couple left just then and they were able to secure a table.</p><p>Cassie sank gratefully into the chair. She crossed her legs, and removed one boot so she could rub feeling back into her toes, pausing occasionally to sip her latte. It tasted like heaven.</p><p>\u201cAbout this, uh, plant you mentioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, him. Not to worry, I caught on fast enough. Well, maybe not as fast as I should have, but it was obvious that you sent him. He didn\u2019t try very hard to hide it, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that obvious,\u201d Simon said mildly. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t send anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. There\u2019s no need to carry on this charade.\u201d</p><p>He regarded her sternly. \u201cI am not in the habit of lying.\u201d</p> <p>She studied him\u2014and realized he just might be telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cI will repeat myself this once. I did not send anyone to test you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The man with all the complaints had been so unpleasant that it was a natural assumption.</p><p>To hide her embarrassment, Cassie tore the cellophane off her cookies and gobbled them both down.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you learn from the experience?\u201d Simon asked.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me there\u2019d be an exam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an exam. I asked a straightforward question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Cassie took a sip of her latte, then removed her other boot. \u201cFor one thing, I will never pass someone standing in the cold ringing a bell and not leave a donation. You wouldn\u2019t believe how many people simply look the other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve ignored a bell ringer now and then, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I may have, but I won\u2019t again. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever worked harder at anything.\u201d</p><p>The merest hint of a smile showed in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou find that funny? Why don\u2019t you stand out in the cold for four hours and see how you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to write a check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you would. It\u2019s much easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. That\u2019s the point. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there was the lovely old man.\u201d She turned an angry look on Simon. \u201cYou must\u2019ve chased him away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I didn\u2019t notice any old man and I certainly didn\u2019t chase one away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was definitely there. He reminded me of my grandfather. Grampa died when I was young, but I remember him so well.\u201d She grew introspective. \u201cHe was in the war, too. That old man made everything that happened today worthwhile.\u201d</p><p>She gestured at her stained coat and her stocking feet, then tentatively at her nose. \u201cI think I\u2019m finally thawing out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t sound glad. In fact, he sounded bored.</p><p>\u201cTell me about John,\u201d she urged.</p><p>Simon\u2019s deep sigh informed her that she was becoming tiresome. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething. Anything. Did you assign him three tasks like you did me? What are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t discuss my other clients with you.\u201d The way he said it suggested she\u2019d committed a major faux pas.</p><p>She forged ahead despite that. \u201cHas John asked about me?\u201d</p><p>Another sigh. \u201cI should never have mentioned his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did and now I\u2019m curious. Come on, Simon, have a heart. Give me one small detail, one tiny tidbit, about my hero.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her coat and, seeing the huge coffee stain, must have taken pity on her. \u201cAll right, if you have to know, he\u2019s an engineer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn engineer?\u201d she repeated slowly.</p><p>\u201cYour children will be left-brain geniuses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren.\u201d Overwhelmed with excitement she grasped Simon\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cRestrain yourself, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Simon, loosen up a little, would you?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her coldly, as though her comment didn\u2019t merit a response.</p><p>\u201cHas John asked about me?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Rubbing her palms together, she blurted out, \u201cAnd what did you say?\u201d After asking, she quickly changed her mind. \u201cNo, don\u2019t tell me\u2014I\u2019d rather not know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t unflattering, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re implying.\u201d</p><p>This was promising. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you looking for compliments, Cassie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...well, maybe.\u201d Then, because she was curious and she couldn\u2019t resist, she asked, \u201cDo you like me, Simon?\u201d</p><p>He regarded her for a moment, as though carefully weighing his response. \u201cNot particularly. Wait\u2014let me rephrase that. I don\u2019t have any feelings for you whatsoever. Except for the appropriate reactions of a professional toward his client, of course.\u201d</p><p>What would it have cost him to smile and say something nice? \u201cYou really are a dolt.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. You know, if you smiled more often you might look human. You\u2019re supposed to be a psychologist\u2014haven\u2019t you heard that a smile is a positive way of interacting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any reason to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. You are who you are, and I am who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was profound.\u201d He seemed to be making fun of her.</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t care. Simon was a means to an end, and if he found her a decent man she could love for the rest of her life, then it didn\u2019t matter if he liked her or not.</p><p>\u201cWhen can I complete the second task?\u201d she asked, eager to hurry the process along. From the sound of it, John was equally excited about meeting her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making the final arrangements next week. I\u2019ll be in touch as soon as everything\u2019s set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Cassie finished her latte and dabbed at the crumbs left over from her shortbread cookies. \u201cYou\u2019re not very good at relationships, are you? Personally, I mean, not professionally.\u201d</p><p>Acting as if she hadn\u2019t spoken, Simon shoved back his chair and seemed about to leave. \u201cAs I said earlier, I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you go, I\u2019d like to ask how you came to this line of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know I don\u2019t answer personal questions. This isn\u2019t about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAu contraire. You came to me for services rendered. Do you interrogate your dentist about his background\u2014or private life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let him do his job and you walk away satisfied when he\u2019s finished. It\u2019s the same with me, or it should be. I perform a service, nothing more. I\u2019m good at what I do and I enjoy my work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome matches are more difficult than others. Some clients more trying.\u201d He looked pointedly in her direction.</p><p>\u201cAt least you can take comfort from knowing that once I meet John, you won\u2019t ever need to see me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there is that....\u201d</p><p>Cassie couldn\u2019t help it; she burst out laughing.</p><p>Simon seemed genuinely puzzled. \u201cWhy is that funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been if you hadn\u2019t been so honest about it. You\u2019ll be happy to get rid of me, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He stood and tossed his empty coffee container in the proper receptacle. \u201cYou did very well today, Cassie.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she thought her ears had deceived her. \u201cWas that a compliment, an actual compliment, from the great Dr. Simon Dodson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he said soberly. \u201cIt was a statement of fact. The truth is, I didn\u2019t expect you to last all four hours. You surprised me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to meet John,\u201d she told him, disregarding the implied insult in his words.</p><p>\u201cSo I gathered, and soon you shall.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, they left Starbucks together and exchanged civil goodbyes.</p><p>Cassie could hardly wait to get back to her condo so she could talk to Angie. The minute she\u2019d showered and changed, she reached for the phone and hit speed dial.</p><p>After several rings, she was connected to voice mail. That was odd. Angie hadn\u2019t said anything about going out\u2014but then it wasn\u2019t as if Cassie was her parole officer.</p><p>Much later that afternoon she heard from Angie.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d Cassie asked right away.</p><p>\u201cShopping. \u2019Tis the season, you know?\u201d Her friend seemed to be in high spirits.</p><p>\u201cDid you find any bargains?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots. How\u2019d the morning go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon said I surprised him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw Dr. Dodson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he showed up to check on me. We had coffee afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and...Dr. Dodson? Simon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so odd about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Angie said. \u201cI just can\u2019t picture it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like a date or anything,\u201d Cassie insisted. \u201cMore of a...debriefing. He said he\u2019d be in touch next week with the details about my next task. I get to be an elf. That has to be easier than what I did this morning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure of that,\u201d Angie warned her.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>H er arms loaded down with groceries, Cassie hurried over to the elevator. \u201cMr. Oliver, hold that door for me!\u201d she cried frantically, trying not to drop the quart of milk dangling from her index finger.</p><p>Mr. Oliver pretended not to hear, and the doors glided shut in her face.</p> <p>Cassie ground her teeth in frustration. This wasn\u2019t the first time Mr. Oliver had purposely let the elevator close as she ran toward it. She\u2019d watched him do the same thing with other residents. Obviously it gave him some kind of thrill. She might have imagined it, but Cassie swore she saw a glimmer of sadistic humor in his eyes as the doors slid closed.</p><p>She lowered one bag to the floor and pushed the call button. While she waited, she went to collect her newspaper, only to discover the slot was empty\u2014and it wasn\u2019t even Tuesday. Apparently Mrs. Mullinex was now clipping coupons from the Sunday edition, as well.</p><p>Perhaps it was time to confront the retired schoolteacher.</p><p>Cassie took the elevator up to the fifth floor, brought her groceries to the kitchen, and walked down the hallway to Mrs. Mullinex\u2019s unit. Outside her neighbor\u2019s door, she rang the bell until she heard footsteps on the other side.</p><p>\u201cHold your horses,\u201d Mrs. Mullinex called out.</p> <p>She answered the door, wearing her housecoat and slippers. Her head was covered in pink curlers and wrapped with a bandanna knotted directly above her forehead. It wasn\u2019t a look Cassie saw very often these days\u2014if ever.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Cassie, how nice of you to stop by,\u201d she said pleasantly. \u201cCan I offer you a glass of eggnog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, thank you.\u201d Cassie made an attempt to be neighborly or at least polite. \u201cUh, I believe you have my newspaper.\u201d</p><p>Her neighbor seemed startled, as if the suggestion that she might have taken something not hers was a devastating insult. Mrs. Mullinex raised one hand to her mouth in a gesture of innocence. \u201cOh, dear, was that your paper?\u201d</p><p>Cassie held out her hand.</p><p>The older woman slowly retrieved the thick weekend edition and reluctantly placed it in Cassie\u2019s outstretched hand. \u201cI was wondering, dear, if you wouldn\u2019t mind letting me have the section with the New York Times crossword puzzle.\u201d</p> <p>Cassie clutched the paper to her chest.</p><p>\u201cOnly when you\u2019re finished with it, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happen to enjoy doing the crossword puzzle, Mrs. Mullinex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Wondering if she\u2019d been a little too inflexible, Cassie returned to her own condo, put away her groceries and made a cup of coffee. She sat down with the paper, prepared to relax. She\u2019d just turned to the middle section, grabbed a pen\u2014doing the crossword puzzle in pen was a matter of pride\u2014when the rap music started next door. The whole room seemed to vibrate. Cassie groaned. There was no question: the fates were conspiring against her.</p><p>Getting up from her chair, Cassie pounded her fist against the kitchen wall hard enough to rattle her dishes. She had to repeat the pounding twice before the music was lowered to a tolerable level.</p><p>Settled once more, she rested her feet on the ottoman, crossed her ankles and savored the first sip of coffee when her doorbell rang.</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of heaven,\u201d she muttered, tossing down the pen. If it turned out to be one of her annoying neighbors\u2014whom she\u2019d be having dinner with all too soon, according to Simon\u2014she didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d say.</p> <p>To her astonishment, it was her brother, toting a five-foot Christmas tree.</p><p>\u201cShawn, what are you doing here?\u201d Normally she\u2019d be fortunate to see him twice in four months, and this was his second visit to Seattle in as many weeks.</p><p>\u201cAre you complaining?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI come bearing gifts.\u201d He thrust the Christmas tree into the room.</p><p>\u201cSo I noticed.\u201d</p><p>Shawn grinned. \u201cI thought you could use a bit of Christmas cheer.\u201d He stepped into the condo and leaned the tree against the living room wall. \u201cThis also seemed like a good excuse to stop by so you could tell me how everything went yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Had it only been the day before that she\u2019d stood in the cold, soliciting donations? That didn\u2019t seem possible, and yet Cassie hadn\u2019t stopped thinking about the experience. What remained uppermost in her mind was the time she\u2019d spent with Simon at the coffee shop. He\u2019d been frank, unemotional, honest. She amended that to brutally honest. When she\u2019d met him, she\u2019d considered him rude and arrogant, but since then she\u2019d had a change of heart. Simon, she decided, was simply...direct. He said what he felt and didn\u2019t moderate his opinions in deference to other people\u2019s flimsy egos. She\u2019d never met anyone quite like him.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Shawn prodded her.</p><p>\u201cWho do you want to hear about first\u2014Mr. Scrooge, who wasn\u2019t sent by Simon as a test,\u201d she added, \u201cor would you rather I told you about the woman who threw coffee at me because she thought I\u2019d flirted with her husband?\u201d</p><p>Shawn flopped down on the sofa. \u201cBoth, and while you\u2019re up, I\u2019ll take a cup of that coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, while she got a mug and filled it to the brim. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe what he said to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrooge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Simon. I asked if he liked me and he said \u2018not particularly.\u2019 What\u2019s so funny is the fact that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny? You thought this was funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at first,\u201d she admitted. \u201cThe thing with Simon is that he wasn\u2019t being intentionally rude. He\u2019s the most plainspoken man I\u2019ve ever encountered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a bore to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called him a dolt.\u201d She smiled at the memory. \u201cHe didn\u2019t much like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he can dish it out, but he can\u2019t take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he certainly isn\u2019t used to it.\u201d</p><p>They chatted for a while, until Shawn eventually said, \u201cI hope you realize that all you\u2019ve done is talk about Simon. I\u2019ve yet to hear a word about anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Caught up in her musing, Cassie hadn\u2019t noticed.</p><p>\u201cI think you might be falling for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Simon?\u201d The suggestion was ludicrous. \u201cOh, hardly! If I\u2019m focusing on him, it\u2019s because he\u2019s the man who holds the key to my happiness. He\u2019s going to introduce me to John\u2014and I have high hopes for John. He\u2019s my perfect\u2014oops, most suitable, which is what Simon calls it\u2014match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust in time for the perfect\u2014or should I say, most suitable\u2014Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Cassie suspected Shawn was mocking her a little, but she was too hopeful and too happy to care.</p><p>All at once he grew serious. \u201cDon\u2019t build your expectations too high, Cassie. What if you and this John character don\u2019t really connect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we will. That\u2019s the beauty of it. Simon studied our profiles and concluded that we\u2019re ideal for each other. I think his success lies in the fact that he can be emotionally detached and even clinical. It\u2019s all quite scientific, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Shawn nodded wryly.</p><p>\u201cDid I mention Simon refuses to talk about himself? That\u2019s probably why he\u2019s so brilliant at this. He doesn\u2019t want to cloud the relationship between him and his clients. His sole focus is on finding the right person for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems to me you\u2019ve got him all figured out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I just might. Now wipe that smirk off your face,\u201d she said. Now that she\u2019d thought seriously about Simon, and she\u2019d been doing that for the past twenty-four hours, it all made a crazy kind of sense.</p><p>Simon made sense.</p><p>Simply put, he wasn\u2019t encumbered with the need to please others. His skill at matchmaking was based on his knowledge of psychology, as he claimed, but he obviously had good instincts, too. His success rate was impressive, and if he honestly felt John-the-engineer would make her a good husband, then Cassie didn\u2019t doubt it for an instant.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an engineer,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cSimon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my match. Simon offered me a crumb of information yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn engineer,\u201d Shawn echoed. \u201cI guess your kids will be left-brained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Simon said,\u201d she returned excitedly.</p><p>Shawn looked surprised. \u201cYou told him about your IQ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it was on the questionnaire.\u201d In high school, her high IQ had been an embarrassment rather than an asset. She always used to insist that scoring well on a test didn\u2019t make her any different from everyone else. She still felt that way\u2014although it did get her through two chemistry degrees in four years instead of six.</p><p>\u201cMom was always proud of your intelligence,\u201d Shawn reminded her.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter to our father, though, did it?\u201d As a child, Cassie had thought it was her fault their father had left the family. Although it made no sense for a seven-year-old to assume that kind of blame, she had. Later, she\u2019d learned this was fairly typical in situations like this. They\u2019d all been devastated, but she\u2019d unconsciously taken on the role of scapegoat.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Dad...\u201d</p><p>Cassie already knew what was coming. \u201cHe called you?\u201d</p><p>Shawn nodded.</p><p>\u201cHis yearly sojourn into fatherhood! Lucky you. This year it was your turn to receive the great gift of his phone call. What did he have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saw one of my murals and wanted to tell me he was impressed.\u201d</p><p>Cassie shrugged. \u201cThat was nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA surprise, actually.\u201d</p><p>Cassie knew how long Shawn had waited for any praise from their father. They rarely discussed him; the subject was still too painful for them both.</p><p>\u201cWhere was he?\u201d The last she\u2019d heard, he was living aboard his sailboat somewhere in the Caribbean.</p><p>\u201cHawaii.\u201d</p><p>Cassie chuckled. \u201cReally? Wouldn\u2019t it be amusing if he ran into Mom on the streets of Honolulu?\u201d</p><p>Shawn shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s over him. She forgave him a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s a better woman than I am.\u201d Talking about their father depressed her. \u201cCan\u2019t we discuss something else? Something more cheerful\u2014like bank foreclosures?\u201d</p><p>Shawn snorted. \u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why he bothers,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI thought we weren\u2019t going to discuss Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Shawn drank the last of his coffee and stood. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you aren\u2019t going to stay and help me trim the tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019ve got an...appointment.\u201d</p><p>From the gleam in his eyes, this so-called appointment involved a woman. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling.\u201d</p><p>It really wasn\u2019t fair. Cassie had to pay tens of thousands of dollars to meet men, and her brother had women falling all over him. It must be those piercing blue eyes of his\u2014plus, of course, the fact that he was talented, rich and eligible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cassie walked him to the door.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming back here tonight?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m taking the red-eye to Phoenix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I see you at Christmas?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. Where else would I go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. Besides, I want to hear all about Simon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn,\u201d she corrected. \u201cSimon\u2019s the matchmaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d That gleam was back in his eyes and Cassie suspected the slip had been intentional.</p> <p>An hour later, Cassie had the Christmas tree in its stand and set by the window that overlooked the city. The big star above Macy\u2019s glowed in the dim light of late afternoon. She dragged her ornaments out from the guest room closet and decided to give Angie a call. Trimming a tree all alone wasn\u2019t any fun.</p><p>Her friend answered immediately. \u201cCome on over,\u201d Cassie invited her. \u201cShawn stopped by to drop off a Christmas tree and then abandoned me to decorate it by myself. I\u2019ve got hot apple cider and popcorn popping in the microwave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Cassie, I\u2019d love to but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you off shopping again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m meeting an old friend. Sort of a last-minute thing. You could join us if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone I know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, I\u2019ve got an appointment with a box of ornaments, a bowl of popcorn and the DVD of The Bishop\u2019s Wife.\u201d</p><p>Angie sounded regretful. \u201cI hate the thought of you trimming the tree alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d And that was true. She was in a good mood; in fact, she planned to give Mrs. Mullinex the Sunday paper when she\u2019d finished\u2014and she\u2019d leave the crossword untouched.</p><p>\u201cThink of next year,\u201d Angie urged. \u201cYou\u2019ll most likely be married by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn and me.\u201d She filled her head with happy thoughts of a Christmas photo in front of next year\u2019s tree, the two of them smiling blissfully into the camera. The perfect Christmas. The first card she mailed out would be to Jill and Tom.</p><p>\u201cYou might even be pregnant by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, you\u2019re moving a little too fast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019re getting the best husband money can buy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Cassie laughed. She hadn\u2019t thought of it in those terms but Angie was right. She was paying top dollar to meet John-the-engineer; by the same token, he\u2019d been willing to pay top dollar to meet her.</p><p>And the one walking away with fistfuls of cash was Simon Dodson.</p><p>As far as Cassie was concerned, he would have earned every penny.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>A t the end of their brief telephone conversation, Angie had said she\u2019d call Cassie once she got home Sunday evening. Although it\u2019d been an offhand comment, Cassie was surprised when she didn\u2019t hear from her. Apparently Angie\u2019s last-minute meeting with her friend had turned into more of an event.</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t think much about it until Angie showed up at the lab Monday morning. Her friend\u2019s face radiated...joy. Unmistakable joy.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d Cassie said, watching Angie closely. Something was up, and it didn\u2019t take Sherlock Holmes to figure out that a man was involved. Clearly Angie had met someone special. The \u201cold friend\u201d from yesterday evening?</p><p>\u201cStop looking at me like that,\u201d Angie said, blushing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in love, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Angie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou can tell? Really?\u201d</p><p>Cassie nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the happy look. You know, the one we all get when we first realize we\u2019re falling for someone.\u201d She knew it had to be the \u201cfriend\u201d Angie had seen last night.</p><p>Angie shyly glanced away. \u201cThe most incredible feeling came over me this morning.\u201d Her voice fell to a whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s like...a sixth sense, a knowledge, that this man could be the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the feeling I\u2019m talking about.\u201d Cassie had never experienced it herself, but she\u2019d seen it again and again with her friends.</p><p>A wistful happiness shone from Angie\u2019s eyes, but she didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><p>After several minutes Cassie couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. \u201cWell?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The reflective look disappeared and was instantly replaced by one that was far more guarded. \u201cWell, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to give me details?\u201d</p><p>Angie hesitated. \u201cOf course...but not yet.\u201d</p><p>This confused Cassie. First, there was very little they didn\u2019t tell each other\u2014except for Angie\u2019s meeting with the matchmaker and it was easy to understand why her friend hadn\u2019t mentioned that, since Simon had rejected her as a client. If it\u2019d happened to her, Cassie wouldn\u2019t have announced it, either. But this was an entirely different matter. For some reason, Angie preferred to remain tightlipped about this man in her life. Well, so be it. When necessary, Cassie could be patient. If Angie wanted to keep this mystery man to herself for a while, Cassie would respect that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything soon,\u201d Angie said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019d like to hold on to this feeling for a little longer.\u201d</p><p>Still, Cassie couldn\u2019t help being curious. \u201cWould it hurt to let me know how you met?\u201d</p><p>Angie\u2019s face relaxed into a warm smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll love that part. We sort of stumbled upon each other. We dated for a while ages ago and decided it wasn\u2019t going to work. Or rather, he did, not me. So I began the search again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is the guy you\u2019ve been in love with all along?\u201d</p><p>Angie nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet him,\u201d she said a second time. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be seeing him soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s a bit...complicated at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplicated?\u201d Cassie didn\u2019t like the sound of that. \u201cHe\u2019s not married or anything, is he?\u201d</p><p>Angie shook her head. \u201cOh, no! Nothing like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Cassie smiled, then glanced down at her feet. \u201cActually,\u201d she said in a low voice, \u201cI was hoping to chat with you last night. I had a couple of questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to ask you about Simon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically...I was curious. Other than the information on his Web site, what do you know?\u201d</p><p>Angie shrugged. \u201cNot much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you hear about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a birthday gift\u2014at least, the first consultation was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother. She wants grandchildren and knew how brokenhearted I was when...this other relationship ended. She heard about Simon when he did a radio interview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon did a radio interview?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he does them often. This was around Valentine\u2019s Day a few years back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Angie cocked her head to one side. \u201cWhy this interest in Dr. Dodson all of a sudden?\u201d</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t want Angie or anyone to suspect how intrigued she was by the matchmaker. She found her thoughts drifting toward him far more often than was comfortable. She told herself that once her curiosity was satisfied, he\u2019d drift into the background where he belonged.</p><p>While she\u2019d gone on to his Web site\u2014the address was noted on his business card\u2014she hadn\u2019t searched further.</p><p>That evening, she did. She logged on to the Internet and immediately typed his name into Google. There wasn\u2019t a lot, but enough to answer some of her questions. He\u2019d been a Rhodes scholar, attending Cambridge\u2014after Harvard. He\u2019d taught at a prestigious East Coast college. He\u2019d written political articles for the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. Just as she\u2019d realized earlier, he had opinions about everything and didn\u2019t mind sharing them...in unvarnished prose.</p><p>According to Wikipedia, Simon had never been married. She found that...interesting.</p><p>Intent as she was on reading her computer screen, the phone startled her. \u201cYes,\u201d Cassie said, snatching it up. Her gaze stayed on the screen for fear she\u2019d miss a single detail.</p><p>\u201cMs. Beaumont?\u201d The female voice was vaguely familiar. \u201cThis is Dr. Dodson\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>A chill raced down her spine. Simon knew she was online, reading about him! He was about to inform her that she\u2019d forfeited her thirty thousand dollars. \u201cI won\u2019t do it again!\u201d she blurted without thinking.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you phoning because\u2014\u201d Cassie stopped abruptly, aware of how absurd she\u2019d been. How paranoid. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d she asked sweetly.</p><p>By now Ms. Snelling sounded utterly confused. \u201cWould it be convenient for you to stop by tomorrow afternoon at four-thirty?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAh, sure.\u201d That meant leaving work a bit early, which wasn\u2019t really a problem.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Dr. Dodson will see you then.\u201d</p><p>Rattled as she was, Cassie had hung up before she thought to ask what the meeting was about. She assumed Simon would be giving her the information regarding her second task. But why not call? Maybe he had her elf costume, although that seemed unlikely.</p><p>She felt a sense of expectation. She had to admit that Simon fascinated her, although she didn\u2019t especially like him\u2014any more than he liked her. Perhaps he represented a challenge and she couldn\u2019t resist trying to make him aware of her as a woman. Everyone needed to be liked and appreciated, even Simon. That was probably what had led him into the matchmaking business. Certainly the couples she\u2019d spoken to had expressed their appreciation\u2014if not liking\u2014for him. So maybe he couldn\u2019t achieve romantic satisfaction for himself but he could for others. It all seemed rather lonely.</p><p>On Tuesday, she kept checking her watch. Angie, who might otherwise have commented, was preoccupied, as well. Cassie had decided not to question her about this new, or rather resumed, relationship. When Angie was ready to tell her, she would. Cassie could only hope this man turned out to be everything Angie believed he was. Perhaps they could have a double wedding!</p><p>Because Simon had kept her waiting at their previous appointments, Cassie didn\u2019t bother to show up until four forty-five. His assistant\u2019s disapproval was obvious. When Cassie stepped up to the desk, the older woman regarded her with distaste. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes...Simon, Dr. Dodson, was late the past two times and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you felt turnabout was fair play,\u201d he said, standing in the doorway leading to his office. \u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive the clich\u00e9.\u201d His arms were crossed and he looked more amused than annoyed.</p><p>It\u2019d been four days since she\u2019d last seen him and it struck her again how attractive he was.</p><p>He arched his brows. \u201cYou have nothing to say? Generally I can\u2019t get you to shut up and now you act as if we\u2019ve never met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I figured you\u2019d be late and\u2014and I didn\u2019t want to waste time sitting here...\u201d she stammered, embarrassed that he\u2019d caught her staring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t let it happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t keep me waiting again,\u201d she returned.</p><p>His shoulders relaxed. \u201cAh, I see the Cassie I recognize is back. Follow me. We have business to discuss.\u201d He walked into his office, Cassie close behind him.</p><p>Without waiting for an invitation, she took the visitor\u2019s chair across from his desk. She leaned back, legs crossed, trying to appear confident.</p> <p>Looking stiff and formal once more, Simon sat down. \u201cI asked to see you because I have the information concerning your agreement to work as Santa\u2019s helper.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cOkay, but you could\u2019ve phoned\u2014unless you have my outfit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutfit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor my elf job.\u201d</p><p>Simon shook his head, and for the first time since she\u2019d arrived, he seemed edgy. \u201cThere\u2019s been a small change in plans.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChange? What do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mall has experienced a decline in the number of parents bringing their children to meet Santa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean Santa won\u2019t be requiring my help, after all?\u201d She did her best to keep her enthusiasm to a minimum. She wouldn\u2019t mind getting out of this; she liked children\u2014in fact, she loved them\u2014but if her tasks were limited to two instead of three, she\u2019d be done that much sooner. Then Simon could introduce her to John.</p><p>Despite herself, she felt a twinge of regret at the idea of never seeing Simon again. But once he\u2019d made the official introduction, his role would be over, his job done. She realized she\u2019d miss his acerbic responses....</p><p>Simon frowned at her. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Cassie answered a bit more sharply than she\u2019d intended. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re not interested in my thoughts.\u201d</p> <p>Again his brows shot toward his hairline. \u201cI wonder how long it will take you to learn that I do not ask questions unless I am interested in the answer.\u201d</p><p>Cassie threw back her head. \u201cAll right, fine. I was just thinking that you\u2019re a very odd man. I find I\u2019m rather...intrigued by you. Not in any romantic way, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what a relief that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more like...driving past a car wreck. Horrible though it is, you can\u2019t stop yourself from looking.\u201d</p><p>His frown deepened. \u201cI can assure you my life is no wreck\u2014nor is my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s nothing wrong with your car.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her comment and its implication, Simon picked up a piece of paper. \u201cAs I was saying, I heard from the Tacoma Mall regarding your assignment. There\u2019s been a slight change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this because of what you said earlier\u2014that there\u2019s a decline in the number of children visiting Santa?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. But here\u2019s what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wait, I have a question,\u201d Cassie broke in.</p><p>Simon looked up at the ceiling as though his patience, which was always in short supply, had been sorely tested yet again. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rather dictatorial,\u201d she said. \u201cHow could a question hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d let me get a word in edgewise...I\u2019m trying to give you some important information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout helping Santa?\u201d Simon acted as if she\u2019d have to smuggle top secret papers to the north pole.</p><p>\u201cThis relates directly to your assignment,\u201d he said, avoiding eye contact. \u201cI need to know if you\u2019re afraid of heights.\u201d</p><p>How could that possibly pertain to her working as an elf? \u201cNot really. Why?\u201d</p><p>Simon paused. \u201cMaybe you should ask me your question, after all, before I explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather hear what you have to say first.\u201d</p><p>He sighed loudly. \u201cI talked to the mall and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, we\u2019ve been through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did mention that a uniform\u2014a costume\u2014is required.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His reluctance to get to the point was beginning to concern her.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware anything like this would be asked of you, but I\u2019m encouraged that you don\u2019t have any fear of heights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to swing from the top of the Space Needle, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d He exhaled slowly, staring down at his desk. \u201cThe mall wants the first elf\u2014that would be you\u2014to arrive by wire.\u201d</p><p>Cassie swallowed hard. \u201cYou\u2019re not referring to a telegram, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wire...from where?\u201d</p><p>Again he avoided meeting her gaze. \u201cThe ceiling.\u201d</p><p>Cassie frowned, attempting to picture it. \u201cYou mean they want me to fly in like Peter Pan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking!\u201d This was the most preposterous idea she\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>\u201cThe reindeer will follow you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLive reindeer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re plastic, but the mall wants to make a real production of Santa\u2019s arrival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d she said, swallowing again since her mouth was so dry, \u201cI\u2019m part of the production.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Are you willing to do this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Cassie\u2019s fingers tightened around her purse strap. \u201cWould I still meet John if I decline?\u201d</p><p>Simon hesitated. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t part of our original agreement, so I\u2019d need to find a replacement task. That might take a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to wait any longer than I already have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll inform the mall there won\u2019t be a problem and they can expect you on Saturday morning around nine.\u201d</p><p>Her complete lack of reaction must have alerted Simon to the fact that she was having second thoughts.</p><p>\u201cNo need to worry,\u201d Simon assured her. \u201cI\u2019ve been told it\u2019s quite safe. The wire will hold up to four hundred pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Cassie couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d agreed to this. When she glanced up, she thought, just for a moment, that she saw a smile on Simon\u2019s face. She leaned forward. \u201cWere you smiling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were smiling, weren\u2019t you? You\u2019re enjoying this.\u201d The man should be arrested for deriving pleasure from her humiliation.</p><p>His mouth quivered, but Simon had the good grace to look away. \u201cActually, I was thinking you\u2019re going to manage this quite well. You\u2019re a woman who\u2019s destined for high places.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, his vote of confidence didn\u2019t excite her. And his joke didn\u2019t amuse her.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Simon says: The best match for you is the one I arrange\u2014because I know you better than you know yourself. \u201cT his must be a joke,\u201d Cassie said, staring at the limp green tights. No way was she going to stuff her hips and thighs into those.</p><p>\u201cDr. Dodson gave us your size, miss,\u201d said an elderly woman, whose name tag identified her as Daisy.</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d Well, if he assumed she wore a size four, then who was she to enlighten him with the truth? Besides, the material did stretch.</p><p>Daisy handed her the elf costume, which consisted of a short green dress, like a skater\u2019s, with white faux fur edging the hem and a wide red belt. A green Santa-style hat with a white fur ball dangling from the end completed the outfit. But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was a gold-painted pair of slippers with curled-up toes.</p><p>\u201cThe changing room is this way,\u201d Daisy said as she guided her down the dimly lit mall corridor.</p><p>Cassie followed, clutching the uniform, the hat and shoes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how pleased we are that you agreed to do this,\u201d Daisy was telling her. \u201cYou already have an audience of children waiting.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t news Cassie wanted to hear. \u201cWhere will Santa be while I\u2019m floating through the air?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d So she wouldn\u2019t be doing a solo flight. If she was going to descend from the clouds, Santa should do the same.</p><p>\u201cOnly...Santa will be on ground level,\u201d Daisy explained.</p><p>This was unfair.</p><p>The woman stopped and, frowning, bent down to pick up an empty beer can. \u201cOh, dear,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Floyd\u2019s been at it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who is Floyd?\u201d Cassie asked a bit fearfully.</p><p>Daisy\u2019s voice was a low whisper. \u201cHe\u2019s Santa.\u201d</p><p>Was she saying Santa was a drunk? Outrageous!</p><p>\u201cSanta?\u201d Cassie cried.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand me,\u201d Daisy hurried to say. \u201cFloyd\u2019s a wonderful Santa and the kids love him. The problem is, the children can be a bit wearing...as you\u2019ll discover for yourself in a few minutes.\u201d Daisy led her through a dark tunnel to some kind of alleyway deep inside the mall. \u201cThere\u2019s a ladies\u2019 room back here where you can change into your costume. I\u2019ll wait outside and once you\u2019re done, I\u2019ll have one of the technicians help you into the harness.\u201d</p><p>Cassie gaped at her.</p><p>\u201cWe want you to be as safe as possible,\u201d Daisy said in a confiding voice. \u201cThe wire will lower you from the top level of the mall to the ground floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Cassie couldn\u2019t recall if the mall was two or three levels. One thing was guaranteed\u2014she\u2019d have her eyes closed the entire flight.</p><p>As if reading her mind, Daisy added, \u201cYou have to play this up, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay this up?\u201d Cassie asked skeptically. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the crowd. We want you to yell out that Santa\u2019s on his way and all the boys and girls will be getting a gift from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re giving them gifts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCandy canes. The children look forward to receiving those.\u201d</p><p>A cheap candy cane was a gift? That seemed to be an exaggeration\u2014but who was Cassie to quibble over truth in advertising?</p><p>They finally got to the ladies\u2019 room and Cassie went inside. She removed her shoes and then her jeans and sweater. She hung what she could on the hook of the stall door, then sat on the toilet in order to slip on the tights. Force them on was more accurate.</p><p>The fit was so tight, they felt like an extra skin. Unfortunately they didn\u2019t reach all the way to her waist. One wrong move, and Cassie feared they\u2019d roll down and reveal features\u2014like her butt\u2014that she\u2019d rather keep private. It helped a little to jump up and down and then prance around, pulling on the waistband as she did. She also did a couple of squats. Still, the tights didn\u2019t stretch quite as far as she would\u2019ve liked.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right in there, dear?\u201d Daisy asked.</p><p>\u201cJust fine,\u201d Cassie told her. Thankfully, the minidress fit. The shoes were good, too. She adjusted the hat in the bathroom mirror and realized she\u2019d need to secure it for the flight. Digging around the bottom of her purse, she located two paper clips, which worked\u2014sort of. How long those paper clips had been there and where they\u2019d come from would forever remain a mystery. Cassie could only be grateful for their presence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She opened the restroom door, feeling more than a little foolish.</p><p>Daisy stood back and brought both hands to her face. \u201cOh, this is just perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look wonderful. The children are going to be so excited.\u201d Daisy glanced at her watch, then led Cassie to an elevator. Silently they rode to the second floor, where a crew of men seemed to be waiting for her. Eight\u2014or was it nine?\u2014life-size plastic reindeer were lined up against the wall beside an authentic-looking sleigh.</p> <p>Before Cassie had a chance to ask any questions, two of the men stepped forward and strapped her into a harness. They moved her arms, each grasping one, lifting them up and down.</p><p>One of the men murmured something in Spanish. She couldn\u2019t understand what he\u2019d said, but got the gist of it when he made the sign of the cross and raised his eyes heavenward.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look down,\u201d the other man advised her tersely.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a thing to worry about,\u201d Daisy said with a grandmotherly smile.</p><p>Suddenly a voice came over the loudspeaker system. \u201cBoys and girls, moms and dads\u2014is that Santa\u2019s sleigh I hear?\u201d</p> <p>The man next to her jingled bells and everyone looked up to where Cassie stood.</p><p>\u201cOkay, boys,\u201d Daisy whispered and stepped back.</p><p>Suddenly Cassie was hoisted from the ground. Her feet made running movements as she scrabbled to find her footing and instead found only air.</p><p>\u201cPlay to the crowd,\u201d Daisy instructed in a loud stage whisper.</p><p>\u201cSanta\u2019s on his way!\u201d Cassie called out, doing her best to sound enthusiastic although she was absolutely terrified. \u201cI can see him now! Look, here comes Santa.\u201d</p><p>And then it happened. Cassie gasped as her tights rolled down, catching on her thighs. She didn\u2019t know what to do. The tights slid farther down and everyone in the entire mall seemed to be staring up at her.</p> <p>\u201cI can see the elf\u2019s underpants,\u201d a little boy called, pointing at her.</p><p>Suspended above the ground, Cassie watched as several mothers covered their children\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cGet her to the ground fast,\u201d Cassie heard Daisy hiss.</p><p>The men released the rope and Cassie plunged downward. \u201cYiiiiiii!\u201d she screamed, all the while struggling to pull up her tights. She\u2019d partially succeeded\u2014then saw that she was about to make a crash landing.</p><p>Just when it seemed she was destined to slam into the ground, a tall man emerged from the crowd and deftly caught her in his arms. The impact would have been enough to send them both sprawling to the floor if not for the fact that he\u2019d braced his feet. Together they staggered backward until her hero recovered his balance.</p><p>Cassie opened her eyes to see that the stranger who\u2019d rescued her wasn\u2019t a stranger at all. Her startled eyes met Simon\u2019s, and they both breathed a sigh of relief. For a long moment, they stared at each other. Cassie\u2019s arms were tightly wrapped around his neck. It took time for her to find her voice and, when she did, it came out in a high-pitched squeal.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re paying for this,\u201d she told him, her pulse hammering in her ears. Why she\u2019d ever agreed to this ridiculous scenario she\u2019d never know. One thing was for sure; there wouldn\u2019t be a repeat performance.</p><p>Simon lowered her to the ground. \u201cA simple thank-you will suffice,\u201d he said calmly.</p> <p>Fortunately the audience was distracted by the flying reindeer, and no one could hear her X-rated response. Santa made his appearance, slipping out from behind a curtain. Santa Floyd carried a large bag over his shoulder, presumably filled with candy canes.</p><p>Santa ascended to his special chair, a huge cushioned monstrosity set up on the curtained dais, and Cassie took her place beside him. She looked around for Simon but he was nowhere in sight. The boys and girls lined up with their parents, and the photographer was ready with his camera.</p><p>The first boy clung to his mother. \u201cHe\u2019s a little scared,\u201d the woman explained, prying her son loose from her leg.</p><p>The poor kid was panic-stricken. Cassie couldn\u2019t understand why the mother felt it was so important to make him sit on Santa\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be frightened.\u201d Cassie crouched down and tried to reassure the boy, who couldn\u2019t have been more than four years old.</p><p>\u201cGo away!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Cassie straightened and stepped back. Her timing was perfect. The boy, without even a hint of warning, vomited on one of her shoes.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d the mother said a dozen times. \u201cI had no idea Jason was going to do that.\u201d</p><p>Cassie hopped around on one foot until the photographer produced a small towel. If Jason was any indication of what she should expect, Cassie could only imagine the rest of her day.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit on Santa\u2019s lap with your son,\u201d the photographer suggested. The mother appeared eager to do anything that would remove attention from Cassie and the results of her son\u2019s queasy stomach. She clambered onto Floyd\u2019s lap, her son dangling from her arms.</p><p>After cleaning off her shoe, Cassie returned to her duties. The next few children had obviously had prior experience. They all told Santa their Christmas wishes, rattling off everything on their lists.</p><p>The line moved relatively well for the next half hour or so. There was the occasional crying baby and one pair of twins who took up more time than allotted, but all in all, it was a smooth-running operation.</p><p>Cassie had worked about two hours of her three-hour shift and was just beginning to think this job was tolerable. A lot of the children, while frightened, were eager to meet Santa. \u201cWho are you?\u201d a little girl asked as she waited patiently for her turn some time later. Cassie\u2019s shift was almost over by then, and there were only a few more kids in line. Other than a harrowing entrance and one small boy with a queasy stomach, it hadn\u2019t worked out so badly.</p><p>\u201cWho am I?\u201d Cassie repeated the question. \u201cI\u2019m one of Santa\u2019s helpers,\u201d she said as she handed the child a candy cane.</p><p>\u201cAre you really an elf?\u201d</p><p>Cassie nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like an elf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t?\u201d Cassie said, surprised.</p><p>\u201cYou look more like a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pushed in front of me,\u201d the child\u2019s mother protested, elbowing the woman ahead of her in line.</p><p>\u201cI most certainly did not!\u201d The second woman elbowed the other one back as her son watched, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cMommy, I have to pee.\u201d This plaintive declaration came from the first combatant\u2019s daughter, aged four or five.</p><p>\u201cWe are not getting out of this line now. I\u2019ll find you a restroom as soon as we\u2019re done,\u201d she said and shoved her way to the front, dragging the little girl.</p><p>\u201cWould you kindly tell this person that I was ahead of her?\u201d The comment was directed at Cassie by the other woman. The shoving match continued.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Cassie said, coming to stand between the two mothers. \u201cI really wasn\u2019t paying attention, but if this goes on, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to ask you both to leave.\u201d She said this with great authority and was rather proud of herself.</p><p>\u201cMommy,\u201d the little girl cried, her voice urgent now. \u201cI can\u2019t wait anymore.\u201d</p><p>That was when Cassie felt the warm liquid soak into the top of her foot. She glanced down and saw a small waterfall raining down, ruining her undamaged shoe\u2014the one unstained by vomit.</p><p>Letting out a yell, she leaped back and automatically shook her foot.</p><p>\u201cOrange!\u201d the woman shouted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t have to pee anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour daughter\u2019s name is Orange?\u201d the other woman asked.</p><p>The first woman nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re from Florida.\u201d</p><p>The second mother backed away from the puddle on the floor, clutching her son\u2019s hand\u2014and leaving Orange at the head of the line.</p><p>\u201cI have a tissue.\u201d Orange\u2019s mother\u2014Grapefruit? Cassie thought hysterically\u2014offered her a crumpled wad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Cassie muttered. She intended to burn these tights once her shift was over. The shoes were probably goners, too. She wondered if Simon could possibly have known what this stint would entail.</p><p>After the two squabbling mothers had finished with Santa, a young girl, the very last one in line, approached Cassie all by herself.</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t paid,\u201d the photographer said as he returned his camera to its case.</p><p>Pleading eyes were raised to Cassie\u2019s. \u201cI need to talk to Santa for just a minute,\u201d the girl whispered. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to give me a candy cane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d Cassie asked, bending down so they were eye-to-eye.</p><p>\u201cEight.\u201d</p><p>Just a bit too old to believe in Santa Claus. And yet the child was so intent, Cassie didn\u2019t feel she could turn her away.</p><p>\u201cForget about the picture,\u201d she said when the photographer cast her a dirty look.</p><p>\u201cHo. Ho. Ho. And who do we have here?\u201d Santa asked, ignoring the other man. He held out his arms to the child.</p><p>\u201cCatherine,\u201d the child said softly. She walked up to Santa but didn\u2019t sit on his lap.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would you like for Christmas?\u201d he asked, playing his role to the hilt.</p><p>Staring down at the carpet, the child said, \u201cI want my daddy to come home.\u201d Huge tears welled in her eyes. \u201cHe left and now my mommy says they\u2019re getting a divorce. All I want for Christmas is my daddy back.\u201d</p><p>Cassie felt tears burning in her own eyes. She looked at Floyd and wondered how he\u2019d handle this.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a mighty big order, Catherine,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anything else. I don\u2019t need toys but I need my daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatherine?\u201d A woman\u2019s voice echoed through the mall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Mommy!\u201d</p><p>The child\u2019s mother rushed up the steps to Santa\u2019s throne and fell to her knees in front of her daughter. She seemed about to burst into tears. \u201cI looked everywhere for you,\u201d she cried. She threw her arms around her daughter\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cI told you I was going to talk to Santa,\u201d Catherine reminded her. \u201cI had to wait in line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if Catherine caused a problem,\u201d her mother said and, standing, took the little girl by the hand\u2014but not before Santa whispered a few words in the child\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re finished,\u201d Santa said as Catherine\u2019s mother led her daughter away.</p><p>Cassie must have looked as upset as she felt because Floyd gently patted her back. \u201cThose are the tough ones. You did a great job.\u201d</p><p>Cassie doubted that.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to her?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI said her daddy still loves her and that he\u2019ll always love her. That it\u2019s not her fault he left.\u201d He stretched his arms high above his head. \u201cNow this Santa has an appointment with Mr. Budweiser. Want to join me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks...but no thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re free to go. Another elf will take over for you this afternoon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cassie nodded, eager to make her escape. As she started for the changing room, Simon appeared beside her.</p><p>Cassie realized she wasn\u2019t going to be able to control her emotions. Tears streamed down her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked. He seemed genuinely concerned.</p><p>\u201cI was that little girl once,\u201d she said with difficulty. \u201cAll I wanted for Christmas was for my daddy to come home.\u201d She covered her mouth with both hands, trying to stifle her sobs.</p> <p>They reached the doorway that led to the mall interior. Simon held open the door and Cassie slipped into the darkened hallway. Once inside, she leaned against the wall and let the tears flow unrestrained.</p><p>Simon stood next to her for several minutes, then tentatively placed his arms around her.</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t care who he was; she needed his comfort. She rested her face against him, sobbing into his expensive wool jacket.</p><p>His hold relaxed and, after an awkward moment, he spoke soothingly into her ear. She couldn\u2019t make out what he was saying. It didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>As if by instinct, she lifted her head and gazed up at him. He whispered something else, something that sounded like \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d Then his lips, warm and tender, descended on hers.</p> <p>Chapter 10</p><p>Simon says: If you\u2019re the woman he\u2019s looking for, I will find you. S imon\u2019s gentleness consoled her as he held her close. Cassie didn\u2019t want him to ever stop, and he didn\u2019t seem inclined to let her go. Time lost meaning, and Cassie didn\u2019t know how long he held her against him.</p><p>Then, just when she was least prepared, he seemed to snap to attention, become aware of his surroundings. He dropped his arms and stepped away. His movements were so abrupt that she nearly stumbled. She might have if he hadn\u2019t clasped her shoulders to steady her.</p><p>Speechless, she stared up at him, unable to make sense of what had happened in the past few minutes. Under normal conditions, Cassie didn\u2019t give way to emotion, and certainly not in public. But Christmas, that little girl and the memory of losing her own father had struck her hard and there\u2019d been no stopping the barrage of deeply buried feelings. She told herself she was not going to react to that kiss.</p><p>\u201cI need a cup of coffee,\u201d she murmured. Despite her tears her throat was parched.</p><p>Simon nodded.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll change clothes and be right back.\u201d She was sure her voice sounded strained and unnatural. She hurried inside the ladies\u2019 room; once the door was closed she leaned against it and covered her face. Her whole body was trembling. Eventually, when she felt composed again, she straightened and began to dress.</p><p>To the best of her knowledge, this was the first time she\u2019d ever cried over her father. Peter Beaumont had simply walked out of their lives one day as if it meant nothing. As if they meant nothing. The event had forever marked her and Shawn and their mother, as well. And yet he seemed oblivious to the anguish he\u2019d inflicted on his wife and children. His excuse was that he needed to \u201cfind himself.\u201d Apparently he couldn\u2019t manage that and be a husband and father at the same time. His was a solitary path, and it didn\u2019t seem to matter how many hearts he crushed along the way. Cassie made every effort to cast all thoughts of him out of her mind. But he was there, as much as she wanted to deny his existence.</p><p>When Cassie had finished dressing, she left her outfit neatly on a ledge near the sink and wrote Daisy a note explaining why the shoes and tights were in the garbage. Then she brushed her hair and repaired her makeup. Simon was pacing in the hallway outside the door. He stopped when he saw her and even in the dimly lit hallway she could see that he wasn\u2019t quite himself, either.</p><p>With his hand at her elbow, he escorted her back into the mall and toward an exit. \u201cThere\u2019s a place close by where we can have coffee.\u201d He reached inside his pocket for his car keys. \u201cI\u2019ll drive.\u201d</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t know what was wrong with the restaurants that were within walking distance. However, she didn\u2019t have the energy to argue, so she just followed him.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t surprised to see that he drove a black sedan with a black interior, which was meticulously maintained; she wouldn\u2019t have expected anything less. Simon wasn\u2019t the type of man who\u2019d have hamburger wrappings and stale French fries littering his vehicle.</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak; he glanced at her for approval, then flipped on a CD. She recognized the calming strains of a Bach piano concerto. Again, she wasn\u2019t surprised, although she couldn\u2019t have identified the piece. She leaned back, eyes shut, letting the music flow over her. The restaurant wasn\u2019t really all that close, she noted a little later. It was perhaps a fifteen-minute drive along the Tacoma waterfront before he pulled into an exclusive housing development. He turned down several streets, then entered a driveway.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a restaurant,\u201d Cassie said.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt we\u2019d both appreciate privacy for this discussion.\u201d</p><p>He was probably right.</p><p>Simon ushered her inside. The house was spotless. It looked like one of those model homes with everything carefully arranged and color-coordinated, not a thing out of place. No Christmas decorations. Nor did she see a single photograph, and that seemed almost unnatural. Surely there were people in his life, people he loved and cared about. Family. Friends. Then again, maybe he preferred to keep his distance from others. Maybe he felt his job required it.</p><p>\u201cMake yourself comfortable,\u201d he said and gestured toward the sofa. Then he disappeared into the kitchen through a swinging door.</p><p>Cassie looked out over Commencement Bay, although her thoughts still churned and she hardly noticed the beauty before her. She had a distinct feeling that their professional agreement was about to come to an end.</p><p>Other than one brief interchange\u2014when he asked how she liked her coffee\u2014all was silent.</p><p>After a few minutes, Simon reappeared with two cups of coffee. He handed her one, careful to avoid physical contact, before taking a seat as far away as the room allowed. He stared down at his coffee. \u201cI would like to know what happened back at the mall,\u201d he said after a tense moment.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d It wasn\u2019t as if they could ignore the episode. \u201cWhich part do you want to discuss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were those tears about?\u201d</p><p>Now Cassie stared into her coffee. \u201cMy father,\u201d she began, then shook her head. \u201cThe last child in line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe little girl who was by herself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She came to Santa because...\u201d The lump in her throat made it necessary to pause and swallow before she could continue. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want toys or clothes or gifts, she...she wanted her daddy back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Simon\u2019s eyes softened with understanding and what looked like sympathy. \u201cShe reminded you of yourself at that age. You said as much, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Cassie nodded. \u201cMy father left during the holidays. So he not only broke our hearts, he made sure Christmas would never be the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sounds like a real jewel of a human being,\u201d Simon said disdainfully.</p><p>But Cassie didn\u2019t wish her father ill. He\u2019d paid for his mistakes; in his late sixties now, he was essentially alone. While she liked to think she\u2019d put all the bitterness behind her, she didn\u2019t really have a relationship with him, nor did she seek one. Every so often, Pete made the effort to contact her, but they had nothing in common, nothing to talk about, nothing to share. The conversation typically lasted a few minutes. Invariably Cassie felt sad afterward.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to assume I\u2019m the kind of woman who breaks into tears at the drop of a hat. I...It was like seeing myself all those years ago. Like feeling pain so raw it tore my heart out.\u201d Her voice quavered and she tried to conceal it by sipping coffee.</p><p>\u201cPain and the memory of pain\u2014which often amounts to the same thing\u2014don\u2019t really go away,\u201d Simon said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to learn to assimilate it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Simon didn\u2019t say anything else for some time. \u201cI believe it would be best if we...\u201d</p><p>He stopped speaking, which made Cassie look at him.</p><p>\u201cThat kiss,\u201d he murmured, shifting his weight.</p><p>Seeing Simon ill at ease was so unusual she couldn\u2019t help enjoying it, although that was probably unkind of her. At least it was a distraction from her own painful past. \u201cYes, the kiss.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI want to assure you I don\u2019t make a habit of kissing my clients.\u201d</p><p>She instinctively recognized that as the truth.</p><p>\u201cWeeping women don\u2019t generally affect me like that, either. I don\u2019t have any excuse and I wish to apologize.\u201d</p><p>His gaze held hers and she couldn\u2019t doubt the sincerity of his words. \u201cI was as much at fault as you,\u201d she felt obliged to admit. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will refund your money,\u201d he said, cutting her off.</p><p>It was what she\u2019d been afraid of. \u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stepped over the line. This is the only way I can rectify the...incident.\u201d</p><p>Cassie bit her lip. She conceded that the kiss shouldn\u2019t have happened. But that wasn\u2019t a good reason to ruin everything. \u201cWill I still meet John?\u201d she asked, then held her breath, almost afraid of what he\u2019d say. She was practically gasping for air by the time he replied.</p><p>\u201cConsidering that I was the one who initiated the...incident, I feel honor-bound to hold up my part of the bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then that kiss just cost you thirty thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look any too pleased with himself, but merely shrugged. \u201cSo be it. This was a lesson well learned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel I can let you do that.\u201d Tempting as it was for Cassie to accept, fair was fair. She hadn\u2019t exactly pushed him away. In fact, she\u2019d welcomed his kiss, welcomed his comfort.</p><p>\u201cI am not in the habit of arguing with my clients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr with anyone, it seems.\u201d</p><p>He blinked as if it took him a moment to comprehend what she\u2019d said. \u201cOr with anyone,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI appreciate the offer, Simon, really I do, but you weren\u2019t the only one who learned a lesson. How about if we both forget it ever happened and just move forward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cI would like your promise that you\u2019ll never mention our kiss again. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes. Of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll undertake to do the same thing.\u201d</p><p>She mimed zipping her lips closed. \u201cIt\u2019s gone, forgotten, cast into the deepest part of the ocean.\u201d The thought flashed into her mind that the ocean was filled with treasures\u2014treasures no one even knew were there. When it happened, Simon\u2019s kiss had felt like treasure, unexpected and...beautiful.</p><p>\u201cMy plan for the third task is to have you cook Christmas dinner,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>Cassie raised her hand. \u201cYes, I wanted to talk to you about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>She might as well be blunt. \u201cLike I told you before, I don\u2019t have the best neighbors.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat precisely is the problem?\u201d</p><p>Cassie sat up straighter. The Simon she recognized was back. He wasn\u2019t interested in listening to any excuses\u2014except that in this instance excuses were necessary. Cassie couldn\u2019t possibly invite her neighbors to Christmas dinner. She didn\u2019t really know these people, and what she did know unnerved her.</p><p>\u201cOut with it, Cassie. I don\u2019t have all day.\u201d</p><p>Hiding her smile would have been impossible.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that silly grin for?\u201d he demanded in the gruff voice she\u2019d grown accustomed to.</p><p>\u201cYou. You\u2019re back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did,\u201d she said. \u201cA few minutes ago, while we were discussing\u2014you know, what we promised never to mention again\u2014you seemed...almost human.\u201d</p><p>His left brow rose, mocking her. \u201cAlmost, you say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes\u2014and I rather liked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not to worry. I won\u2019t.\u201d She set her coffee aside and sat on her hands. \u201cAnyway, continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were discussing your third task.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel you should know that one of my neighbors, Mrs. Mullinex, is a thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a police record?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI...No, I don\u2019t think so. But who knows? Anyone who\u2019d purposely take my newspaper...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour newspaper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what she\u2019s been stealing for the last few months.\u201d Then, stricken by an attack of conscience, Cassie went on to explain. \u201cTo be honest, Mrs. Mullinex does return it, but she clips out the coupons. Then, a couple of weeks back, she went so far as to take the Sunday edition, and get this\u2014she likes to do the Sunday New York Times crossword puzzle. My crossword puzzle.\u201d She narrowed her eyes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have to invite her, would I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Mr. Oliver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Mr. Oliver?\u201d</p><p>Cassie had no qualms about detailing her other neighbor\u2019s faults. \u201cFirst, he\u2019s rude. More than once, Mr. Oliver has deliberately allowed the elevator doors to close on me.\u201d She wagged her index finger at Simon. \u201cI\u2019m positive he could see me, too. I saw that gleam in his eyes. The Sunday before last he left me standing there, loaded down with groceries, and he enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...see.\u201d Once more he seemed unimpressed by her tales of woe.</p> <p>\u201cThen there\u2019s the guy whose condo\u2019s next to mine. I don\u2019t know his name and I don\u2019t want to. He plays his music so loud it shakes my whole kitchen. It\u2019s horrible music, too. Rap and heavy metal.\u201d She paused. \u201cNow here\u2019s the interesting part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hardly wait.\u201d</p><p>Simon might be making fun of her, but Cassie forged on. \u201cI saw him in the hallway for the first time this week. All along I\u2019d assumed that whoever he was, he must be college age. This guy was old. He had to be sixty if he was a day.\u201d</p><p>Having laid out her case, Cassie felt certain that Simon would understand why she wouldn\u2019t want to go to all that effort for these people. \u201cSo you\u2019ll reconsider?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cReconsider what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiving me a different third task. Surely even you can see it would be impossible to put on a festive dinner for my neighbors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, after hearing this, I believe the third task will be perfect.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Simon says: The perfect neighbor is the one who\u2019s never home. \u201cY ou mean you won\u2019t reconsider?\u201d Cassie sputtered.</p><p>Simon was being totally unreasonable.</p><p>\u201cDid you or did you not agree to host this dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d she admitted with some reluctance, \u201cbut that was before I realized I\u2019d be obliged to fly through the air with my underwear showing.\u201d A little guilt on his part might not be amiss.</p><p>\u201cA small wardrobe malfunction.\u201d</p><p>He said it with a straight face and Cassie stared at him, wondering if this was meant to be a joke. \u201cI suppose you could call it that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you didn\u2019t have a television audience.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYeah, that makes it better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless, you are still required to complete a third task.\u201d</p><p>Cassie made a face. \u201cYou\u2019re a cruel man, Dr. Dodson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were well aware of the conditions of our agreement before you signed the contract. However...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Hope filled her.</p><p>\u201cHowever, I believe it might be advantageous if you served this dinner prior to Christmas. In other words, not on Christmas Day itself as I originally specified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdvantageous how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you agree to this new stipulation, I\u2019ll arrange for you to meet John before the twenty-fifth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Cassie had her suspicions. \u201cAnd when did you make this decision?\u201d She wasn\u2019t fooled; Simon wanted her gone and on her way to marital bliss so he wouldn\u2019t have to deal with her anymore.</p><p>\u201cWhy the dirty look? I would think you\u2019d be grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be a whole lot more grateful if I didn\u2019t distrust your motives.\u201d</p><p>Simon watched her steadily. \u201cAnd what is wrong with my motives?\u201d</p><p>Irritated, Cassie stood. She wasn\u2019t sure why his latest suggestion upset her\u2014the opposite should be true. It should thrill her, since she\u2019d be that much closer to meeting John. But it didn\u2019t. She walked over to the picture window. \u201cYou want me out of your life,\u201d she mumbled, her back to him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Cassie, and this is important. Don\u2019t fall in love with me. I\u2019m not good husband material. Furthermore\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re in greater danger of falling for me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself.\u201d He went into the kitchen with their coffee cups. When he came back, she guessed it was time to leave. Her clue was that he\u2019d put on his coat and scarf.</p><p>On the return trip to the mall, there was silence between them, no music, not even the radio. When they arrived, Cassie told him where to drop her off. Simon pulled up behind her parked car.</p><p>\u201cPlease let me know when you intend to serve the Christmas meal,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCan I get back to you?\u201d</p><p>He kept his hands on the steering wheel and gazed straight ahead. \u201cFine. But remember that all three tasks must be completed to my satisfaction. So far, you\u2019ve done well.\u201d</p><p>Was that praise? From the high and mighty Simon Dodson? She could hardly believe it. He must have an ulterior motive, no matter how much he claimed otherwise. Although, now that she considered it, he hadn\u2019t exactly denied her accusation. \u201cI\u2019ll call you later in the week with the date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I thought you\u2019d come around.\u201d</p><p>She opened the passenger door, then climbed out and banged it shut. \u201cGood,\u201d she mimicked. Seeing someone waiting eagerly for her parking space, Cassie hurriedly got into her car and backed out.</p><p>On the drive home she did her best to analyze why someone she disliked could affect her so profoundly. It troubled her that she\u2019d enjoyed Simon\u2019s touch and his kiss, that she felt invigorated by his\u2014occasionally annoying\u2014conversation.</p><p>Not until the following Wednesday was Cassie able to work out a date that was agreeable to all her neighbors, as well as Angie and Shawn. Dinner was scheduled for the Sunday before Christmas.</p><p>To her credit, Mrs. Mullinex seemed pleased by the invitation and offered to bring her special pickled brussels sprouts. Her mother\u2019s recipe, she said. Cassie declined, saying she\u2019d take care of everything.</p><p>Mr. Oliver gave a one-word answer. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just an invitation to dinner,\u201d Cassie said. \u201cI\u2019m doing all the cooking and...and it seemed neighborly to have a Christmas celebration.\u201d The explanation struck her as a bit lame, but she could hardly tell him her real reason.</p><p>\u201cWho else are you inviting?\u201d</p><p>She told him.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I could come,\u201d he said and closed the door. He made it sound as if he was doing her a favor. In retrospect, maybe he was.</p><p>The rap-music man was harder to catch. She rang his doorbell several times, then pounded hard, but either he didn\u2019t want to answer or he was so deaf he couldn\u2019t hear her. In the end she slipped a note under his door.</p><p>He responded in kind, placing a message under her door that said he\u2019d be delighted to join her for dinner. He signed it Bob, which seemed a rather inoffensive name for someone who listened to such belligerent music.</p><p>Now that the arrangements were made, Cassie was ready to contact Simon. She knew he kept evening hours a couple of days a week for the benefit of working clients, and this was one of those days.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not in the office,\u201d Ms. Snelling informed her. \u201cI don\u2019t see your name on the appointment list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to call.\u201d Or maybe she\u2019d volunteered; Cassie couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>\u201cI see. Do you wish to leave a message for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Cassie was emphatic about that. She preferred to speak to him personally. In her opinion, it was time that he learned the art of compromise. She was going to ask for one small concession, and if Simon had any common sense at all, he\u2019d agree.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me when he\u2019ll be available?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t. Dr. Dodson is home sick with the flu.\u201d</p><p>Simon was sick? Cassie felt immediate sympathy. \u201cHow long has he been out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days, and when he phoned in, he sounded absolutely dreadful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor man.\u201d Cassie hung up and went about her business. Her apartment looked Christmassy, thanks primarily to her brother\u2019s tree. She\u2019d draped it with merrily twinkling lights that brought a festive quality to the dark evening. Cassie had added a trio of angels to the fireplace mantel. A lovely wreath hung on the inside, rather than the outside, of her door because she didn\u2019t trust her neighbors (one in particular) not to steal it.</p><p>Even with Christmas music playing in the background and cookbooks strewn across the kitchen counter, all Cassie could think about was Simon, sick and in bed. He was alone. He\u2019d never mentioned family. She didn\u2019t know about friends, either. As far as she could tell, there was no one to check up on him. If she\u2019d had a special recipe for chicken noodle soup she would\u2019ve made him a pot of it.</p><p>Then it came to her\u2014why not make him some soup? Medicinal soup for a friend. Simon might not consider her a friend, but Cassie couldn\u2019t ignore the fact that he might need someone. She began paging through her cookbooks....</p><p>She didn\u2019t fool herself into believing Simon would appreciate the effort. But even knowing he\u2019d probably resent her dropping off the soup wasn\u2019t enough to change her mind.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to a lot of trouble for him,\u201d Angie told her the next morning at work, when Cassie brought in a full quart of her concoction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d she said, finding space in the lunchroom fridge for her plastic container.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you care? He\u2019s such a difficult man. I bet he\u2019ll bite your head off for making him get out of bed to answer the door.\u201d</p><p>Cassie nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know where he lives, anyway?\u201d</p> <p>Rather than launch into the whole complicated tale, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ll save it for when we have more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m holding you to that.\u201d</p><p>Fortunately, two colleagues joined them for lunch, so Cassie was spared the necessity of telling Angie what had happened on Saturday, when she\u2019d been an elf. After work she called Simon\u2019s office and learned he was still sick. Her decision made, Cassie drove to Tacoma. She had no problem locating the neighborhood but had to drive around numerous streets before she found his house.</p><p>By then, it was completely dark and the rain fell in sheets. Racing from the car to his front door, carrying her quart container, she shook the moisture out of her hair before she rang his doorbell. When no one answered, she was tempted to leave the soup on his porch and drive away.</p><p>Just as she turned to do exactly that, the door opened and Simon stood there in his housecoat and slippers. He looked even worse than she might have imagined, with a pale face, rumpled hair and rheumy eyes. Her sympathy was instantly aroused and it was all she could do not to reach out and test his brow for fever.</p> <p>\u201cCassie?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t planned what she\u2019d say, and now her tongue seemed to twist itself into knots. \u201cI heard you were sick.... I\u2014I brought you some homemade chicken noodle soup.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her as if he wasn\u2019t sure whether he was hallucinating.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d she asked, although the answer was obvious.</p><p>\u201cTerrible.\u201d He stepped aside, silently inviting her into the house.</p><p>Cassie hadn\u2019t expected that. In fact, she\u2019d been sure that he\u2019d be angry. She\u2019d expected him to growl and demand that she leave.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay long. Like I said, I wanted to drop off the soup and tell you the turkey dinner\u2019s set for Sunday.\u201d</p><p>Simon covered his mouth and coughed. It resembled a dog\u2019s barking and seemed to rack his entire body. She wondered if he had pneumonia.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen a doctor?\u201d she asked urgently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Don\u2019t fuss, Cassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone should. Now, lie down and I\u2019ll heat up this soup.\u201d Taking charge, she walked past him and into his kitchen, which to her shock was untidy. Dishes littered the counter and pots were stacked in the sink. She could see that he\u2019d made an effort to straighten up but had either grown too tired or was too sick to continue.</p><p>Before she started heating the soup, she placed the dirty dishes in the dishwasher and turned it on. Her soup warmed on the stove as she cleaned up the kitchen. Simon had disappeared and now returned dressed in slacks and a sweater. He\u2019d apparently showered, because his hair was wet and combed.</p><p>\u201cThis is thoughtful of you.\u201d He actually sounded grateful.</p><p>Dishcloth in hand, Cassie regarded him suspiciously. \u201cYou mean to say you\u2019re not angry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would I be angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m invading your privacy.\u201d</p><p>He acknowledged that with a slight tilt of his head.</p><p>The soup began to boil and Cassie removed the pan from the burner, poured some in a bowl and set it on the kitchen table with a spoon.</p><p>While Simon had his soup, she made them both cups of strong, hot tea, then sat across from him at the table. She declined his suggestion of soup, since she was too nervous to eat.</p><p>\u201cThis might surprise you, but I quite like you when you\u2019re sick.\u201d</p><p>He set the spoon next to his bowl and studied her warily. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>That must have sounded strange. \u201cYou\u2019re more human when you\u2019re vulnerable.\u201d He didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Cassie was gratified to see that he finished the entire bowlful of soup.</p><p>\u201cShall we have our tea in the living room?\u201d she asked, noting that the television was on, the volume low.</p><p>Simon nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve watched more television in the past three days than the previous three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jeopardy!\u2019s just starting. That\u2019s my favorite game show,\u201d she said, sitting on the couch. Simon sat beside her, a careful distance away\u2014not too close and not too far.</p><p>He picked up the remote and turned up the volume. The thirty minutes passed quickly. She couldn\u2019t resist shouting out answers\u2014\u201cWhat is the Battle of Gettysburg?\u201d \u201cWho are Sacco and Vanzetti?\u201d \u201cWhat is silver nitrate?\u201d She was pleased that she was almost always right, although she noticed that Simon didn\u2019t participate at all. He must be feeling very ill.</p><p>\u201cI should leave,\u201d she said after Final Jeopardy (\u201cWho was St. Nicholas?\u201d) and started to stand.</p><p>Simon reached for her hand. \u201cStay a while longer, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d The sudden surge of tenderness she felt shocked her. What shocked her even more was that his hand continued to hold hers. His touch was light, but sometime during the next thirty minutes he intertwined their fingers. It was hard to concentrate on the rerun of Frasier\u2014a Christmas episode she\u2019d already seen\u2014when her whole body was focused on his hand holding hers. Innocent enough on the surface, his action was highly sensual in its effect. She felt his touch in every part of her, in every sensitized nerve, every cell. She needed all her self-control not to turn into his arms and beg him to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cMy brother might be at the dinner,\u201d she said, hoping she didn\u2019t sound as breathless as she felt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d enjoy meeting him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would? Angie might be able to come, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy best friend. You met her\u2014and rejected her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, I remember her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d given her a chance,\u201d Cassie murmured.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t. She was in love with someone and refused to admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job. That\u2019s the point of such a detailed questionnaire. I explore people\u2019s responses and I read between the lines.\u201d He looked at her sternly, their hands still linked. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t discuss this with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her mouth had gone dry. If Simon could read others so well, she wondered if he was aware of the intense sensation she was experiencing. Did he feel it, too?</p><p>\u201cWill you come for dinner?\u201d she asked. This was the concession she\u2019d intended to request. She wasn\u2019t quite sure why. She\u2019d told herself it was so he\u2019d be able to judge the way she handled the third task, which would expedite her introduction to John. But now...</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his thumb along hers and it was all Cassie could do not to faint. Her eyes drifted shut.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d he finally agreed.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The argument between Frasier and Niles on the TV seemed to fade into the background. \u201cI should go,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said in a whisper. \u201cYou should.\u201d He released her and she clenched her fist to keep from grabbing his hand again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at three o\u2019clock on Sunday,\u201d she said hoarsely, staggering to her feet.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>He didn\u2019t walk her to the door.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Simon says: The perfect match lights a lasting fire. C assie pored over every cookbook she owned. They were all full of wonderful recipes. Even more encouraging, the instructions didn\u2019t seem too difficult. She had her menu set for this all-important dinner: roast turkey with a traditional stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy, fresh green beans with butter and sliced almonds, two different salads and three kinds of pie, apple, pumpkin and pecan. Her grocery list was two pages long.</p><p>Angie had offered to help with the shopping; she\u2019d also volunteered to set the table. This was by far the most elaborate meal Cassie had ever undertaken.</p><p>Her brother, too, seemed eager to help. Luckily, Shawn was in town for a benefit and he\u2019d promised to hand-letter the place cards. He said he\u2019d also do small drawings on each, which were sure to be highly collectible\u2014if any of her neighbors recognized her brother as the famous mural artist. Well, even if they didn\u2019t, they were bound to like the personal touch.</p><p>Reading over the stuffing recipe one last time, Cassie rested her elbows on the kitchen counter.</p><p>Unfortunately, her mind kept wandering from the page. She hadn\u2019t seen Simon since she\u2019d visited him in his home. He\u2019d fully recovered from his bout with the flu and gone back to work.</p><p>Cassie knew that because she\u2019d phoned and chatted briefly with his assistant who\u2019d told her Simon was indeed in the office. But when Ms. Snelling asked if Cassie wished to speak to him, she\u2019d declined and hurriedly got off the phone.</p><p>Simon hadn\u2019t called to thank her for the soup, not that she expected him to. He was coming to dinner on Sunday and she almost dreaded seeing him; at the same time, she could hardly wait.</p><p>She hardly thought of John\u2014John the engineer, John the perfect man\u2014anymore. Only Simon seemed to inhabit her mind. And her heart?</p><p>Something was very wrong.</p><p>The doorbell rang and Cassie left her kitchen. Angie breezed into the room as though floating on air. This wasn\u2019t unusual these days. Her friend was in love. Angie seemed like a different person; nothing upset her, nothing annoyed her. In fact, she glowed with happiness. And yet she remained secretive about this new man in her life. Still, Cassie had begun to have her suspicions. In retrospect, the night of her solitary tree-decorating should have been a giveaway.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Angie asked.</p><p>\u201cShawn phoned earlier,\u201d Cassie said and carefully watched her friend\u2019s expression.</p><p>Angie revealed nothing.</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother seems to have a fair amount of business in the Pacific Northwest lately,\u201d Cassie said, playing along. \u201cHe said he was here for some benefit, but if you ask me, the one who\u2019s benefiting is my brother.\u201d</p><p>Angie turned away and walked into the kitchen. She set down her purse, then removed her coat and draped it over the back of a kitchen chair. \u201cThis is your menu for tomorrow?\u201d she said, still avoiding eye contact. She studied the paper on which Cassie had written her menu ideas. \u201cThree different pies seems a bit ambitious, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted there to be choices.\u201d It didn\u2019t escape Cassie\u2019s notice how quickly Angie had diverted the subject from Shawn.</p><p>\u201cSimon agreed to come, right?\u201d</p><p>Switching the topic to Simon was a clever move. \u201cYes.\u201d Before she could expand or hint further about Shawn, the doorbell chimed again. Cassie opened the door to her brother, who hugged her enthusiastically. His eyes gleamed with a merriment that was due to more than the season, Cassie thought. When he saw Angie his expression sobered. He greeted her politely, even rather distantly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis dinner is becoming quite the affair,\u201d Shawn said, handing her the place cards. The artwork\u2014small watercolors, all individual, of Christmas trees and bells and stars\u2014was beautiful.</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d Cassie kissed his cheek. \u201cOkay, you two, sit down,\u201d she ordered. She indicated the sofa. \u201cBefore you say anything, I want you to know that I arranged for you to be here at the same time.\u201d</p><p>Shawn and Angie took opposite sides of the sofa while Cassie stood directly in front of them, her arms crossed. \u201cYou aren\u2019t fooling me, you know. I suspected the two of you were seeing each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wanted to tell you,\u201d Angie blurted out. \u201cWell, I did, but Shawn felt we should wait.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure this was going anywhere,\u201d Shawn explained, glancing at Angie.</p><p>\u201cWe wanted to keep it to ourselves for a while,\u201d Angie said in a small voice, glancing back at Shawn.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re upset, blame me,\u201d Shawn said, quick to defend Angie.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you want me to know?\u201d Cassie asked, directing the question to both of them. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just kind of happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe dated for a while a year ago after we met at your birthday party, and it didn\u2019t work out,\u201d Shawn said.</p><p>\u201cFor him, maybe, but it worked for me. I fell in love with Shawn.\u201d Angie looked down at her hands, which were neatly folded in her lap.</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness!\u201d Cassie brought one hand to her mouth. \u201cSimon wouldn\u2019t take you on as a client because you were in love with someone else. That someone was my brother, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Angie\u2019s ears turned red as she nodded. \u201cShawn and I went out last year, like he said, and just when everything seemed to be going well...I didn\u2019t hear from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was traveling a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cA relationship\u2019s hard when I\u2019m on the road so much. Besides, I was falling for Angie and it scared me. I\u2019d dated plenty of women but I didn\u2019t feel about them the way I did about Angie\u2014and I panicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was distraught when we broke up,\u201d Angie whispered. \u201cI wanted to tell you, but Shawn\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou never said a word.\u201d Cassie was embarrassed that she\u2019d been so oblivious. \u201cBefore or after you called it quits.\u201d</p><p>Angie shrugged apologetically.</p><p>\u201cI like my privacy,\u201d Shawn said. \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>Cassie couldn\u2019t help being a little hurt. \u201cFor crying out loud, I\u2019m your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Shawn did appear regretful. \u201cNeither of us meant to offend you or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter we broke it off, I tried to move on,\u201d Angie said. \u201cWhich is why I agreed when my mother wanted me to meet the matchmaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made an effort to get over Angie, too,\u201d Shawn confessed, smiling at her, \u201cbut I couldn\u2019t get her out of my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we met again just before Thanksgiving.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere,\u201d Angie clarified. They both nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd I realized how much I\u2019d missed Angie,\u201d he went on, \u201cand how foolish I\u2019d been to let our relationship end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I realized that Simon was right and despite everything, I was still in love with Shawn.\u201d</p><p>They slid closer on the couch and Shawn took Angie\u2019s hand. They stared into each other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Cassie wanted to kick them both for being so foolish, for not understanding what they had the first time around. They deserved a second kick for keeping it a secret from her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been so happy,\u201d Angie told her, \u201cand I was afraid that if we said anything, you\u2019d feel left out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeft out? If I feel left out it\u2019s because you guys\u2014two of the most important people in my life\u2014didn\u2019t let me in on something as big as this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did plan to tell you,\u201d Angie said.</p><p>\u201cAnd when would that have been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the big dinner party.\u201d</p><p>Cassie laughed. \u201cSo that\u2019s why it was so easy to convince you to make an appearance.\u201d</p><p>Shawn nodded. \u201cNow that you know, we don\u2019t have to show up, do we? Angie and I have better things to do than attend this crazy dinner party of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShawn,\u201d Angie chastised.</p><p>The hopeful expression on his face was enough to make Cassie laugh. \u201cNo, you two are excused. Angie, you don\u2019t need to help with the shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come if you want,\u201d Angie said.</p><p>She would, too, but Cassie could see that she\u2019d rather be alone with Shawn than spend the day in a crowded grocery store.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Do something productive with your time, though\u2014like shopping for an engagement ring.\u201d</p><p>Angie blushed again and Shawn cleared his throat. \u201cAs it happens, I have a ring picked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Angie asked with tears in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you get away from me again,\u201d Shawn said. \u201cThere\u2019s still plenty to discuss, but I can\u2019t see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, what?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll marry you and, yes, there\u2019s a lot still to be decided. But there\u2019s no obstacle the two of us can\u2019t overcome.\u201d</p><p>They left a few minutes later, so in love they couldn\u2019t keep their hands off each other.</p><p>Cassie had difficulty wiping the grin off her face. Shawn and Angie were perfect together. She wondered why she hadn\u2019t thought of it before\u2014or noticed what was going on. Angie would probably move away from Seattle once they were married, which was the only disadvantage to an otherwise ideal situation.</p><p>All of a sudden it became crucial to talk to Simon. She had his office number and as she suspected he had an answering service.</p><p>\u201cWould you please ask Mr. Dodson to return my call? It\u2019s...an emergency.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to wait long for him to call back. When his name flashed across caller ID, Cassie exhaled a huge sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cSimon?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Cassie smiled at his gruff, unfriendly tone. She felt better already.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a change in our dinner plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you phoned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. My brother and Angie won\u2019t be attending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your emergency?\u2019</p><p>\u201cThis might not be earth-shattering to you but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew they were secretly involved, or at least I guessed they were. It\u2019s wonderful for them. They make a fabulous couple. I couldn\u2019t be happier, even if it means I\u2019m going to lose my best friend.\u201d</p><p>Her outburst was followed by a short silence. \u201cI don\u2019t quite understand why you called me. And I suggest you think of it as gaining a sister-in-law,\u201d he advised wryly, \u201cnot losing a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s true, but she\u2019ll leave Seattle and the lab.... Anyway,\u201d she said in a more cheerful voice, \u201cI wanted to let you know you were right about her being in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I was right. Did you seriously doubt it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, perhaps not.\u201d She paused. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have called. You must consider me a nuisance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can agree on that,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI know you regret taking me on as a client and I apologize for being such a pest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve dealt with worse clients.\u201d</p><p>Funny how reassuring Cassie found even that faint encouragement.</p><p>He exhaled slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re upset. Is it because of your friend and your brother? Anything that upsets the status quo\u2014even a good thing like this\u2014takes time to accept.\u201d</p><p>Cassie wasn\u2019t sure why she\u2019d felt such an overwhelming urge to hear his voice. His certainty was comforting, she supposed. He always had an answer, a reason, a solution.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help?\u201d he asked, his tone almost gentle.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an idea,\u201d he said, his voice brightening.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you something else about John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man I\u2019ve matched you with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes.\u201d The man she\u2019d paid thirty thousand dollars to meet. He\u2019d completely slipped her mind.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d She felt guilty at the thought of interrupting him. \u201cBefore I called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was I doing?\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m being too much of a bother, I\u2019ll hang up.\u201d She viewed him as someone who operated with purpose. Someone whose day was filled with constant demands. He had too many responsibilities to be interrupted by such mundane matters as her doubts and insecurities.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m watching a college football game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou watch football?\u201d He couldn\u2019t have shocked her more had he said he was on an aircraft headed for the moon. Practically every day Simon surprised her with how...human he was.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you find that unusual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think football would interest you. It\u2019s so...so normal.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI am normal, Cassie. I\u2019m like every other man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t,\u201d she insisted. \u201cYou aren\u2019t like any other man I\u2019ve ever known, and now I\u2019m seeing this whole other side of you and it\u2019s confusing.\u201d</p><p>He muttered something under his breath; it sounded as if he\u2019d said he was confused himself, but Cassie couldn\u2019t be sure of that.</p><p>\u201cAbout John,\u201d he said, changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about John right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should. It\u2019ll adjust your focus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019ll be meeting him soon, won\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can arrange the meeting for Monday afternoon if you like. When I last spoke to him about scheduling a face-to-face, John was ecstatic. He\u2019s very eager to make your acquaintance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called it an early Christmas gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Silence stretched between them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get to your condo a few minutes early,\u201d Simon said, filling the empty space. \u201cI have your address. From your application\u2014and the check.\u201d</p><p>The thirty-thousand-dollar check...</p><p>\u201cSee you then,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cYes, for dinner.\u201d Not until she\u2019d hung up her phone, did she wonder why he wanted to come early.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>C assie was up half the night baking pies and getting everything ready for her final task. Her alarm went off at six on Sunday morning. She staggered from her bed, got the turkey out of the refrigerator and nearly dropped it on the kitchen floor. Who knew twenty pounds would be so heavy?</p><p>Because she\u2019d methodically planned every detail of the dinner preparations, she was right on schedule. She stuffed the turkey and it was in the oven and roasting nicely an hour later. She started on the salads next. The dining room table was set with a crisp white linen cloth. There were sprigs of holly beside each place card for a festive accent. She\u2019d arranged every detail with the hope of impressing Simon. She\u2019d dressed in a red and black velvet pantsuit and taken care with her makeup. For a final holiday touch she wore a ring with a large red stone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He arrived a full hour before her guests were due, carrying a huge, perfect poinsettia for the centerpiece.</p><p>He handed it to her almost as if he was grateful to be rid of it.</p><p>\u201cHow lovely,\u201d she said delightedly. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She put the poinsettia on the table and stepped back to examine it.</p> <p>\u201cI love it, Simon.\u201d Rising onto the tips of her toes, she kissed his cheek.</p><p>He was frowning when she stepped back. \u201cThat was inappropriate,\u201d he said disapprovingly.</p><p>She didn\u2019t point out that he\u2019d kissed her a few weeks ago. But to prove how wrong he was, she kissed his cheek a second time.</p><p>However, when she started to move away, Simon clasped her by the shoulders and pulled her into his embrace. Then he lowered his mouth to hers. Before she could account for her response, she threw her arms around his neck and kissed him back.</p><p>They both seemed to realize at precisely the same moment what they\u2019d done. They leaped apart; Simon shoved his hands in his pockets, while Cassie turned around in an effort to regain her composure.</p> <p>As they faced each other again, Cassie made a sweeping gesture toward the table, hoping to bring some levity to the situation. \u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ve done a wonderful job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to see the turkey?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. You\u2019re the one who told me I had to do this...and in retrospect I\u2019m glad you did.\u201d She led him into the kitchen, grabbed one of her oven mitts and opened the door. She basted the turkey and noted with pride how crisp and brown it looked. According to her calculations, it would be finished in forty minutes. Simon could remove it from the oven and it would sit for an additional fifteen minutes before being carved.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d he said, when she closed the oven door. \u201cSmells delicious, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave I surprised you?\u201d she asked and knew she had, which was what she\u2019d hoped.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI admit that you\u2019re one surprise after another.\u201d Which was exactly the thought she\u2019d so recently had about him....</p><p>She managed to restrain herself from dancing a small, gleeful jig.</p><p>She poured Simon a glass of eggnog while they waited for the rest of her company. \u201cStore-bought,\u201d she confessed as she joined him in the living room. They sat on opposite ends of the sofa.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the only similarity to the way Shawn and Angie had behaved the previous day. Like her brother and her friend, Simon and Cassie hardly looked at each other. Neither seemed inclined toward conversation, either.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking...\u201d Cassie began.</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me...\u201d Simon said.</p><p>They both stopped, then Simon gestured toward her to speak.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you first,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t get a chance because the doorbell rang just then. Eager to break the unexplained tension between them, she hurried to answer. As she might have guessed, Mrs. Mullinex arrived first. She stood in the hallway dressed in her finest. For the first time in Cassie\u2019s memory, her hair wasn\u2019t in curlers. In fact, this was the first time she\u2019d seen her neighbor\u2019s hair, period. It was...curly.</p><p>\u201cThis is so nice of you,\u201d the older woman chirped. Her eyes flew instantly to Simon and widened with womanly appreciation.</p><p>\u201cThis is...\u201d Cassie wasn\u2019t sure how to introduce him. \u201cSimon. My friend. Simon Dodson, Mrs. Mullinex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do?\u201d her neighbor cooed sweetly. \u201cPlease call me Phyllis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhyllis,\u201d Cassie repeated. She\u2019d lived in the building for three years and hadn\u2019t been aware of Mrs. Mullinex\u2019s first name, which didn\u2019t appear on the mailbox, not even as an initial. Her neighbor had never seen fit to share it with Cassie.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize Cassie had a male friend,\u201d Mrs. Mullinex said ever so coyly. \u201cShe is a sly one.\u201d</p><p>Cassie excused herself and disappeared inside the kitchen while she prepared the hors d\u2019oeuvres. She\u2019d leave Simon to fend for himself. When she heard the two of them chatting amicably, Cassie sighed. Simon possessed a few social graces, after all\u2014but none that he was willing to display for her benefit.</p><p>Mr. Oliver showed up next. \u201cThe Seahawks game starts at four. This isn\u2019t going to take longer than that, is it?\u201d he asked as he barreled past her and into the condo. He looked around and when he saw Phyllis Mullinex, a frown darkened his face.</p><p>\u201cMr. Oliver,\u201d Mrs. Mullinex greeted him stiffly.</p><p>\u201cPhyllis.\u201d</p><p>They glared at each other like alley cats with hackles raised, each waiting for the other to make the first move.</p><p>\u201cSo...you two know each other,\u201d Cassie commented, watching them carefully.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Mrs. Mullinex.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, we know each other very well,\u201d Mr. Oliver countered. \u201cWould you mind if I turned the TV on?\u201d he asked as he claimed the most comfortable chair. Not waiting for a response, he reached for the remote, leaned forward and pressed the on button. The television screen lit up and he immediately found the station he wanted. It featured another football game\u2014not the Seahawks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to introduce my friend Dr. Simon Dodson,\u201d Cassie said, speaking loudly enough to be heard above the roar of the sports announcer.</p><p>Mr. Oliver acknowledged Simon with a disinterested nod of his head.</p><p>Her doorbell rang again. Grateful for an excuse to escape, Cassie rushed forward to answer. Bob, the rap aficionado from next door, stood on the other side. He\u2019d apparently gone to some effort with his appearance; he\u2019d greased his graying hair back from his forehead and donned a fresh pair of jeans and a sweater. He grinned when he saw her and handed her a lone rose.</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d Cassie said and brought him into the room.</p><p>When he saw the others, Bob\u2019s face fell. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say there\u2019d be anyone else here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh...sorry. I assumed you knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, dinner isn\u2019t just for the two of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...no. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve met Mrs. Mullinex and Mr. Oliver,\u201d Cassie said, motioning toward her guests.</p><p>\u201cNo, and I don\u2019t particularly care to,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cThis is my friend Dr. Simon Dodson.\u201d</p><p>Bob\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cYou have a...friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, sort of.\u201d The last thing she needed was for Bob to think she was interested in his attentions. If avoiding that trap meant stretching the truth, then so be it.</p><p>The oven timer went off, and Cassie took the opportunity to leave and close the kitchen door behind her. After all her hard work, this meal was going to be a disaster. None of these people liked one another.</p><p>Simon followed her into the kitchen. \u201cShould the turkey come out yet?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said distractedly as he slipped his hands into her Santa-face oven mitts.</p><p>\u201cSimon,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see?\u201d she cried. \u201cMrs. Mullinex and Mr. Oliver can barely stand to look at each other, and Bob thought this dinner was going to be a private affair between him and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said soothingly.</p><p>Cassie sincerely doubted that.</p><p>Simon lifted the turkey out of the oven and set it on top of the stove.</p><p>Cassie thanked him. \u201cAccording to my cookbook, the turkey should sit for no less than fifteen minutes before being carved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need help with anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She\u2019d seen to everything before the guests were due. \u201cI just have to get the food into the serving dishes.\u201d</p><p>Bowls lined the counter. Cassie was pleased with her organizational abilities. The potatoes were cooked and ready to be mashed. Green beans simmered on the stovetop. She drained off the liquid, added the melted butter and almonds and placed them in the bowl she\u2019d chosen.</p><p>Simon returned to the living room with the others.</p><p>Then, picking up the bowl in which she planned to put the stuffing, she noticed something wrong. For a moment, all Cassie could do was stare at her hand.</p><p>No! Oh, dear. Now what?</p><p>Putting down the bowl, she opened the door slightly and peered out of the kitchen. \u201cSimon,\u201d she called in a deceptively casual voice. \u201cWould you come in here for a minute?\u201d</p><p>He gave her an odd look but did as she requested.</p><p>The instant he set foot in the kitchen, she took his arms and pulled him all the way in. \u201cHouston, we have a problem,\u201d she said in an urgent whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very big one.\u201d Splaying her fingers, she held out her hand. \u201cMy ring is missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my ring.\u201d</p><p>He seemed unconcerned. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s around here somewhere. Can\u2019t you look for it later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why not?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause the last time I saw it, I was stuffing the turkey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. In other words it\u2019s inside the bird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re positive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but where else would it be?\u201d</p><p>Simon rolled his eyes toward the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d A dozen scenarios played in her mind, none of them the least bit amusing. If someone bit into it and broke a tooth...\u201cI\u2019ll be sued!\u201d she said hoarsely, covering her eyes. \u201cSomeone might choke on it. My neighbors don\u2019t deserve to die, even if my newspapers do turn up missing now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDish the stuffing into the bowl. You might find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t panic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d she muttered as she transferred stuffing into the bowl, inspecting each spoonful closely.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Mullinex is a sweet lady,\u201d he was saying. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you think she\u2019d want to cause you any trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Mr. Oliver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably wouldn\u2019t even notice if he bit into the ring, especially if you left the football game on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Bob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d assume you were proposing marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Cassie, I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Mullinex stuck her head into the kitchen. \u201cAnything I can do, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no, thanks. Everything\u2019s fine,\u201d Cassie assured her.</p><p>\u201cSimon, come back and sit with me,\u201d the older woman wheedled.</p><p>Simon turned away from the counter and offered Mrs. Mullinex his arm, then threw Cassie a look that told her she was on her own.</p><p>A lot of help he\u2019d been.</p><p>No sooner had Simon left than the door opened again. This time it was Bob.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, leaning against the kitchen counter. \u201cIt\u2019s just the two of us now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well...\u201d Cassie inserted the spoon inside the turkey to finish taking out the stuffing, but with Bob watching every move, she couldn\u2019t make a huge production of plowing through it, searching for her ring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always loved stuffing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, me, too, but I\u2019m not sure this turned out that well. I was thinking I wouldn\u2019t serve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me taste.\u201d Before she could protest, he took her spoon and helped himself to a sample. After blowing on it, he popped it into his mouth. He smiled widely in approval. \u201cThis is fabulous! The best I\u2019ve ever tasted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just being kind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot at all. Here, I\u2019ll take it out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried and made an effort to stop him, but to no avail. Bob carried the bowl into the dining area.</p><p>When she followed with the salads, she saw that he\u2019d taken a forkful to Mrs. Mullinex. \u201cCassie says the stuffing didn\u2019t turn out to her liking. I disagree. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Mullinex gave it a dainty taste. \u201cPerfection,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re being modest, Cassie.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Oliver stood. \u201cWhat\u2019s a turkey dinner without stuffing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to ruin anyone\u2019s diet,\u201d Cassie said, searching for an excuse, any excuse, to get the stuffing off the table.</p><p>Mr. Oliver raised his hand. \u201cI\u2019m on a low-carb diet myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you won\u2019t want any of the stuffing,\u201d Cassie said thankfully.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d make an exception, this being Christmas and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s all help,\u201d Mrs. Mullinex suggested cheerfully. \u201cWe can bring out the rest of the serving dishes. We shouldn\u2019t leave all the work to Cassie.\u201d</p> <p>Cassie sent a pleading glance in Simon\u2019s direction. He, however, was looking elsewhere.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Simon says: A good matchmaker stays in the background, just like Santa\u2019s little helper, then swoops in at the opportune moment. C assie couldn\u2019t swallow a single bite as she carefully studied her guests enjoying their turkey with all the trimmings. Every time she saw a forkful of stuffing heading toward someone\u2019s mouth she had to restrain herself from leaping to her feet and yanking it away.</p><p>Simon revealed no such concern. Mrs. Mullinex had him engaged in a lengthy conversation. Judging by the attention he paid her, anyone would think she was the wittiest, prettiest woman on the face of the earth. Every once in a while, the older woman released a girlish trill that sounded, to Cassie\u2019s somewhat jaundiced ear, like a songbird strangling on too much seed.</p><p>\u201cMighty fine dinner,\u201d Bob told Cassie, eyeing her with far more appreciation than his meal.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She quickly looked away and offered Mr. Oliver more beans. More salad. More anything.</p><p>\u201cDo you always cook like this?\u201d Mr. Oliver asked. Before she could answer, he continued. \u201cYou probably have plenty of leftovers. No need to let \u2019em go to waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be a shame,\u201d Bob threw in. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to come over and help you finish them a few times a week.\u201d</p> <p>Cassie felt it was important to set him straight right away. \u201cSince I work and there\u2019s only me to cook for, I generally don\u2019t go to this much trouble.\u201d Generally\u2014like never!</p><p>Bob glanced at Mr. Oliver, whose plate was heaped high with large portions of mashed potatoes and gravy. \u201cI thought you said you were watching your weight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLow-carb\u2019s the only way to go.\u201d He reached across the table for the butter, which he slathered on a roll.</p><p>\u201cCassie, dear,\u201d Mrs. Mullinex said in the same high-pitched bird voice she\u2019d used since meeting Simon. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a long time since I made gravy. Does yours always have these lumps in it?\u201d</p><p>Cassie stiffened her shoulders at the frightening thought that the ring might have slipped into the gravy. Then she realized her neighbor was denigrating her gravy-making skills, although she wasn\u2019t sure why. Her gravy was flawless, and if there were any lumps, which there weren\u2019t, it was a fluke. \u201cNo, I added them for your benefit,\u201d she answered in an equally saccharine voice.</p><p>Simon\u2019s gaze narrowed.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mrs. Mullinex blinked as if gauging whether or not to be offended.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m joking, Mrs. Mullinex,\u201d Cassie said, feeling slightly guilty. \u201cI apologize if there are lumps in the gravy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can put lumps in my gravy anytime you want,\u201d Bob told her. He winked at her, then jiggled his eyebrows. Disgusting! The man was old enough to be her father.</p><p>\u201cI believe I\u2019ll have some more of that stuffing,\u201d Simon said.</p><p>Cassie sprang from her chair and grabbed hold of the bowl. \u201cI was going to take it back to the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGimme that when you\u2019re finished,\u201d Mr. Oliver said, grinning broadly.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Cassie looked helplessly at Simon, who gently pried the bowl from her hands. \u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty for everyone,\u201d Simon said and took a huge spoonful before passing it across the table to Mr. Oliver. \u201cLet me hand it around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t anyone want to save room for pie?\u201d Cassie asked brightly. She described each one, highlighting the fine qualities of the apple, pumpkin and pecan fillings.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I dare,\u201d Mrs. Mullinex trilled. \u201cOne must watch one\u2019s waistline.\u201d She paused, gazing around as if waiting for someone to tell her she needn\u2019t worry about such things.</p><p>Cassie volunteered in the hope that if her neighbor accepted the pie, she\u2019d skip the extra stuffing, which, to her horror, was being passed around the table. \u201cWhy, Mrs. Mullinex, you have a very good figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleasingly plump,\u201d Bob seconded.</p><p>The smile faded from the other woman\u2019s face. \u201cPlump?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleasingly plump,\u201d Cassie said. \u201cThat\u2019s another way of saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fat,\u201d Mrs. Mullinex cut in, frowning now.</p><p>\u201cI like to be direct,\u201d Mr. Oliver said, glaring at the older woman. \u201cPlump is plump, no matter how you try to fancy it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it to you to insult me, Harry,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou always were quick to take offense,\u201d Mr. Oliver snapped back. \u201cA man makes a simple comment and you jump all over him and ruin a perfectly fine friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Cassie raised her index finger, trying to get a comment in before the confrontation broke into a full-fledged argument.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone could even imply that you\u2019re overweight,\u201d Simon said, pouring everyone a little more wine.</p><p>Cassie managed a smile at his smooth handling of what was rapidly becoming an awkward situation. It also gave her an opportunity to make off with the stuffing unobserved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put on a pot of coffee,\u201d Cassie said, jumping up from the table. She grabbed the stuffing bowl and practically ran into the kitchen, convinced she was about to have a nervous breakdown. Once inside, she leaned against the wall and breathed deeply, wanting nothing more than this dinner to be over.</p><p>When she returned, Simon had collected the dinner plates. Cassie reached for the gravy boat and stared down at it. Lumps, indeed! She couldn\u2019t find a single one!</p><p>Thankfully, after coffee and dessert, Cassie started to relax. Again Mrs. Mullinex damned her with faint praise regarding the pie, but by then Cassie didn\u2019t care. Besides, she had to agree\u2014the apples were unevenly sliced.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything good to say?\u201d Mr. Oliver muttered. \u201cI thought the pies were great. All of \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent meal,\u201d Bob told her and tried to take her hand.</p><p>Cassie snatched it away before he had the chance. As far as she was concerned, the man should be arrested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know, Mr. Oliver, I\u2019ve paid Cassie several compliments,\u201d Mrs. Mullinex said righteously.</p><p>If that was the case, they\u2019d flown right over Cassie\u2019s head.</p><p>By the time she saw her last neighbor to the door, Cassie was exhausted. As soon as Bob left\u2014with obvious reluctance\u2014she collapsed into a chair.</p><p>\u201cYou look a bit out of sorts,\u201d Simon commented.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d The man had mastered the art of understatement.</p><p>He grinned and sat on the sofa across from her. \u201cActually, the meal went well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have got to be kidding. It was a disaster!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being too hard on yourself. You did an admirable job, and while it might not seem that your neighbors fully appreciated what you did, I believe they had an enjoyable afternoon.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a weak smile. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should be glad the ring didn\u2019t show up or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it valuable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I bought it in Hawaii a few years back. I hate to lose it, though.\u201d She raised her shoulders in a shrug. \u201cBut if it hasn\u2019t turned up by now, I doubt it ever will. For all I know, it might be in Mr. Oliver\u2019s digestive system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>Reaching inside his suit pocket, Simon pulled out the ring, displaying it proudly between index finger and thumb. \u201cIs this the ring you misplaced?\u201d</p><p>Speechless, all Cassie could do was stare at him. Once the shock wore off, she lunged forward and grabbed the ring. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me you found it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the kitchen counter. You must\u2019ve taken it off and forgotten. I tried to get your attention in the kitchen and then at dinner but you ignored me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t take it off.\u201d Cassie would\u2019ve remembered that.</p><p>\u201cThen it must have fallen off before you stuffed the turkey.\u201d</p><p>Cassie held the ring in one cupped hand, her relief overwhelming. Then, slowly, her suspicions started to rise. \u201cExactly when did you find this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust before Phyllis came into the kitchen. As I said, I tried to tell you but you were too flustered to notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhyllis?\u201d she echoed. \u201cMrs. Mullinex is now Phyllis to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a delightful mature woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Then again, she isn\u2019t stealing your newspapers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suggest you purchase her a subscription for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Cassie muttered. Then, remembering the ring, she glared at him. \u201cThat was cruel and unusual punishment, letting me worry that someone was going to swallow this ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to tell you I\u2019d found it,\u201d Simon said in his own defense. \u201cWhy else do you think I was passing the stuffing around?\u201d</p><p>Well, there was that. \u201cI\u2019m too tired to argue with you.\u201d She stretched her legs out and let her hands dangle at her sides. Unable to prevent it, she yawned.</p><p>Taking that as his cue to leave, Simon stood. \u201cI\u2019d better go.\u201d</p><p>Cassie realized with a start that she wanted him to stay. \u201cDon\u2019t go yet,\u201d she urged.</p><p>\u201cDo you want help with the cleanup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA drink or more coffee?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s a football game on,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cassie could see he was tempted.

Late afternoon.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t recall an appointment, but if they had one, she\u2019d certainly keep it.</p><p>\u201cJohn will be there.\u201d</p><p>Oh, my goodness. Cassie had forgotten she was supposed to meet John. \u201cCancel it,\u201d she said hurriedly.</p> <p>Simon frowned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready to meet John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve completed your three tasks to my satisfaction. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re hesitating. You\u2019ve worked hard and waited for quite a while, and so has John. I hate to disappoint him.\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s head was spinning with doubt and fear. \u201cI need to talk to you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me now,\u201d he said, none too patiently.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014I\u2019m tired, and besides, I...I need to think.\u201d</p> <p>He continued to frown, and she could see he wasn\u2019t happy with her. He left soon after.</p><p>Cassie sat on the sofa for at least an hour, trying to make sense of her relationship with Simon. Her feelings for him and her original expectations of John were scrambled in her mind. Eventually, when her whole life felt like a hopeless tangle, she called Angie.</p><p>Thankfully her friend was home.</p><p>\u201cI need help,\u201d Cassie whispered.</p><p>\u201cCassie?\u201d Angie said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done something foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She said the words out loud for the very first time. \u201cI\u2019ve fallen in love with Simon.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 15</p><p>Simon says: There\u2019s a perfect match for you; it just isn\u2019t me. B y the time Cassie reached Simon\u2019s office, she\u2019d worked everything out. She\u2019d rehearsed her speech all day. Her one hope was that Simon would own up to the fact that he shared her feelings.</p><p>His assistant greeted her warmly. \u201cHello, Ms. Beaumont. It\u2019s good to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, Ms. Snelling. Oh, nice tree.\u201d</p><p>That was the extent of the Christmas decorating in Simon\u2019s office\u2014a small Norfolk pine on the credenza, draped with tiny white lights. Simple, classy, elegant.</p><p>Given her previous experiences visiting his office, Cassie automatically took a seat and picked up a magazine.</p><p>\u201cDr. Dodson will see you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he told me I was to bring you into his office as soon as you arrived.\u201d</p><p>Cassie set the magazine aside and stood. It was now or never. The only thing left to do was forge ahead and pray they could discuss this with openness and honesty.</p><p>Ms. Snelling held the door for her. \u201cMs. Beaumont,\u201d she said, announcing Cassie.</p><p>As he had at their first meeting, Simon sat behind his desk, studying a periodical. He glanced up, acknowledging her with a nod, then resumed reading.</p><p>Cassie took a seat, crossed her legs, uncrossed them, then folded her hands as she waited. She knew Simon now and was familiar with his ways.</p><p>When he did finally look up, Cassie could see that he was on edge. She wondered if he\u2019d managed to sleep after he\u2019d left her apartment and suspected he\u2019d tossed and turned, the same as she had.</p><p>\u201cYou said you wanted to speak to me.\u201d His voice was expressionless.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>He checked his watch. \u201cYou have ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>That dictatorial approach didn\u2019t fool her. He wasn\u2019t going to intimidate her, nor was he going to scare her into being silent.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI doubt it\u2019ll take that long.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back and Cassie leaned forward. \u201cIf you\u2019ll recall, it was my friend Angie who suggested I make an appointment with you.\u201d</p><p>He indicated with a slight nod that he remembered.</p><p>\u201cYou turned her down, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He sounded bored. \u201cYou know very well I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor an excellent reason,\u201d she said, \u201cas you and I are both aware.\u201d</p><p>He checked his watch again, as if to point out that the minutes were ticking away.</p><p>\u201cEven though you rejected her, Angie thought highly enough of your skills as a matchmaker to recommend you to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know my business, Cassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get any argument from me.\u201d She grinned and looked down at her hands, surprised by how calm and controlled she sounded. While her heart continued to beat at an accelerated rate, she remained outwardly collected. \u201cAt first I thought the idea of those three tasks was ridiculous, but I complied. In fact, I was willing to do just about anything to prove my value as a wife.\u201d</p><p>Once more he glanced at his watch.</p><p>\u201cI understand now why you chose the tasks you did. Each one served a specific purpose. You knew all the facts I could list on a sheet of paper, and as a psychologist you could discern a great deal from that, but you didn\u2019t know the real me.\u201d She\u2019d given much thought to his motives. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to find out how I interact with strangers as a volunteer. You wanted to see how well I deal with children and then you were interested in my homemaking skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPractical aspects of any good marriage. But these tasks also told me that you have compassion and flexibility and a sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>She bowed her head to hide her pleasure at his words.</p><p>\u201cJohn is looking for a woman who\u2019s willing to have children with him. A woman who enjoys socializing and wants to be part of a community. You are all those things.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d introduced the subject of John, so she\u2019d better get that out of the way right now. \u201cOh, yes. John, the match you chose on my behalf. I do hope you cancelled the appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPer your request I did. However, I feel you should know John was extremely disappointed, as I expected he would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve been, too, if I\u2019d been waiting to meet my perfect match. Or as you\u2019d probably say, my most suitable match,\u201d she said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cAnd you aren\u2019t?\u201d Simon challenged.</p><p>\u201cNo, unfortunately I\u2019ve already made his acquaintance.\u201d</p><p>Simon\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cBefore you say anything else, I want you to think this through very carefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ.\u201d Simon spoke in the same unfriendly tones she\u2019d heard at the beginning of their relationship.</p><p>\u201cI brought up Angie\u2019s name for a specific reason. You knew after reading her answers to your questionnaire, and during your initial meeting, that she was in love with someone else.\u201d She paused. \u201cAs I told you on Saturday, that someone happens to be my brother. As I also told you, I was impressed by your insight in recognizing her feelings for Shawn so easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ve repeatedly said, I\u2019m good at my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew it would be wrong to introduce her to another man when she loved my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be just as wrong to introduce me to John when I\u2019m in love with...you.\u201d</p><p>Simon briefly closed his eyes, then stood. \u201cI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again. Don\u2019t do this, Cassie. I\u2019m off-limits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t keep still. I wish I could, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He reclaimed his seat. Looking exasperated, he informed her, \u201cThis happens far more often than you realize. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of women who believe they\u2019ve fallen in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s true.\u201d Simon was an attractive man. He had a strong sensual appeal and would turn heads wherever he went. She didn\u2019t assume for an instant that she was the only woman ever to fall for him.</p><p>\u201cThe thing you seem to forget is that you\u2019ve paid thirty thousand dollars to meet the man I\u2019ve chosen as your match.\u201d</p><p>Cassie hadn\u2019t forgotten.</p><p>\u201cI held up my part of the bargain,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve deposited the check and it\u2019s cleared your bank.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cIf you voluntarily decide not to meet your match, you should know there\u2019ll be no refund.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think there would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you walk away now, without meeting John, you\u2019ll forfeit your money.\u201d He said it again, as if he felt it necessary to remind her of what was at risk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be foolish for you to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been called a fool for lesser things,\u201d she said calmly.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have expected you to be an unreasonable woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She smiled, just a little.</p><p>He looked pointedly at his watch. \u201cYour time\u2019s about up. Is there anything else you\u2019d care to say...in closing?\u201d</p><p>This last part was said with emphasis, as though he was eager to usher her out the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost finished,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you how I feel so you can laugh at me, Simon.\u201d</p><p>His gaze held hers. \u201cI would never do that,\u201d he said, then added, \u201cany more than I did with the other women.\u201d</p><p>She tried to disguise a smile. \u201cNor do I wish to be humiliated.\u201d</p><p>He agreed with a nod.</p><p>\u201cI have reason to believe you share my feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you kiss other female clients?\u201d she asked, interrupting him.</p><p>He was silent.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so. How many have you taken to your home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d he admitted from between clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d she said. To her relief, he was being honest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had a woman...a client break down in tears and turn to me for comfort. Yes, I stepped over the line. I regretted it immediately and, if you recall, I apologized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realized it was a mistake to allow any client access to my personal life after you showed up at my home later with the soup. I should never have invited you inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you?\u201d</p><p>He refused to meet her eyes. \u201cI\u2019d been ill for several days and my resistance was weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResistance to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he countered sharply, \u201cresistance to impropriety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d So that was the excuse he\u2019d chosen.</p><p>\u201cAfterward, I was afraid you might have read more into that evening than was warranted, and I see now that you have. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t address the subject earlier. I wish I had. As I feared, you\u2019ve got the wrong impression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be best if we could forget that evening entirely, put it out of our minds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, she said. \u201cI can\u2019t forget that night. I can\u2019t make myself regret it, either. It was after our evening together that I knew, Simon. I\u2019d fallen in love with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Simon met her look unflinchingly and yielded no emotion. \u201cPlease don\u2019t continue. This is embarrassing for you and for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have one other comment,\u201d she said, striving to remain unemotional. \u201cActually, it\u2019s more of a question than a comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen out with it, and let this matter be laid to rest.\u201d</p><p>She thanked him with a brief nod. \u201cI can accept that a distraught female weeping on your shoulder might have caused you to offer comfort in a way you normally wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you. I appreciate your understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can even accept the fact that your resistance was low when I dropped by your home that evening.\u201d</p><p>Once more he nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut how do you account for the way you kissed me on Sunday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSunday?\u201d he repeated. The color seemed to drain from his face.</p> <p>\u201cCan you tell me what prompted that kiss?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer for a long moment. \u201cI have no excuse,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking for excuses, Simon, I\u2019m looking for honesty. It hasn\u2019t been easy to lay out my heart for you. If I\u2019ve misread the situation, then I apologize. In that case, I\u2019ll walk out your door right now and you\u2019ll never hear from me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would...be a shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it would,\u201d she agreed, hope seeping in for the first time since she\u2019d entered his office.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve paid me a lot of money and I\u2019d feel bad if you allowed this opportunity to slip by. John is awaiting an introduction, and I hate to disappoint him.\u201d</p> <p>Cassie closed her eyes, struggling to hold on to her poise. After a moment, she opened them and met his look head-on. \u201cI\u2019m not meeting John or any other man you deem the right mate for me. Or my \u2018suitable\u2019 mate or whatever word you want to use. I\u2019ve already found him and it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>Simon didn\u2019t acknowledge that comment in any way.</p><p>\u201cHave I misread your feelings, Simon?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>He refused to answer.</p><p>Reluctantly she stood; she\u2019d gone past her allotted ten minutes. \u201cI won\u2019t embarrass you further\u2014or myself for that matter. But before I go, I have one simple request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said tersely.</p><p>\u201cLook me in the eyes and tell me you don\u2019t love me. Do that and I\u2019ll leave and never trouble you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing word games with you, Cassie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a game. It\u2019s my life, my future\u2014our future.\u201d</p><p>He squinted up at the ceiling. \u201cWhy do women have such a flair for the dramatic? I suppose you\u2019re going to spend the rest of your life pining away for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d she told him. \u201cI love you and it\u2019s up to you to accept or reject that love. It\u2019ll hurt me, but I know I\u2019ll get over you in time. In every likelihood I\u2019ll marry someone else one day and perhaps even have children. Rest assured that if you reject me, I won\u2019t leap off a bridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d</p><p>She moved away from the chair, her heart pounding so hard she was astonished it didn\u2019t echo through the room. She gave him ample opportunity to stop her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>With her hand on the door, she turned back to look at Simon one last time. He sat at his desk, reading. She wasn\u2019t fooled. He might not admit it, but he loved her.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Simon.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up and his eyes flared as though he was surprised to see her still in the room. \u201cOh. Merry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for a response. Head held high, she marched out the door. Once on the other side, she closed her eyes, almost collapsing to the floor as a wave of deep loss hit her.</p><p>Ms. Snelling\u2019s chair scraped as she stood. \u201cOh, dear. Are you all right, Ms. Beaumont? You look like you\u2019re about to faint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m okay,\u201d she stammered. \u201cThank you....\u201d she added politely.</p><p>It was exactly as Cassie had feared. Simon Dodson, professional matchmaker, was an expert at finding love for everyone except himself.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>\u201cH old the elevator!\u201d Cassie shouted, rushing across the condo foyer on Wednesday afternoon. When she saw that the lone occupant was Mr. Oliver, she automatically slowed her steps. No need to rush; he\u2019d take sadistic delight in letting the doors shut in her face. To her amazement, he thrust out his arm and stopped them from closing.</p><p>Cassie hardly knew what to think. \u201cThank you,\u201d she managed as she hurried into the elevator, loaded down with her mail, the newspaper, her purse and a couple of last-minute Christmas purchases.</p><p>The newspaper.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t even realized Mrs. Mullinex hadn\u2019t \u201cborrowed\u201d it since their dinner together. That was progress.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d Mr. Oliver said as the elevator doors glided shut. \u201cCan\u2019t thank you enough for the great dinner.\u201d</p><p>It seemed wrong to confess that if it hadn\u2019t been for Simon she would never have thought to invite Mr. Oliver.</p><p>Try as she might, she couldn\u2019t get Simon out of her mind. She\u2019d given it her best shot, told him how she felt and done what she could to convince him that he shared her feelings. But she hadn\u2019t expected the strength of his conviction in denying his love for her. Nor could she understand why he fought it so hard.</p><p>What bothered her most was his inability to admit to her face that he didn\u2019t love her. If he had, she might have believed him. However, for reasons she\u2019d likely never know, he refused to accept her love.</p><p>\u201cNice young man...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Cassie said. \u201cI didn\u2019t catch what you said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Simon of yours. He\u2019s a fine young man. You\u2019ve chosen well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...thank you,\u201d she whispered. No need to explain that he wasn\u2019t \u201chers,\u201d or that she wouldn\u2019t be seeing him again. Cassie had been sincere when she\u2019d told him she wouldn\u2019t pine away for the rest of her life. He\u2019d made his decision and she\u2019d made hers.</p><p>The elevator stopped, and Mr. Oliver held the door for her to exit first. When they stepped into the hallway, Mrs. Mullinex opened her condo door and, seeing the two of them, waved cheerfully. Cassie noticed that the other woman\u2019s eyes immediately went to Harry Oliver.</p><p>\u201cOh, what perfect timing,\u201d Phyllis said. Her hair was brushed into soft waves and she looked lovely.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Harry,\u201d she purred.</p><p>\u201cHello, Phyllis.\u201d</p><p>Cassie hid a satisfied grin. Apparently there\u2019d been a breakthrough in that relationship. Wonderful!</p><p>\u201cI was hoping to see you,\u201d she said, smiling shyly at Harry. \u201cI thought I\u2019d invite my dearest friends over for eggnog on Christmas Eve. I do hope you can join me.\u201d As if she realized she\u2019d directed the invitation solely to Mr. Oliver, she turned to Cassie. \u201cI\u2019d like it if you could come, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy...thank you, I\u2019d be honored.\u201d Cassie\u2019s brother and Angie had invited her to spend Christmas Day with Angie\u2019s family. They\u2019d been generous to include her, and Cassie had gratefully accepted.</p><p>\u201cI wonder...\u201d Phyllis began. \u201cIf you\u2019d like to invite your young man, please do. That Simon is quite the charmer.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll mention it if I talk to him between now and Christmas Eve.\u201d That was highly improbable, but again she didn\u2019t feel it was necessary to go into details.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you be talking to him?\u201d Mrs. Mullinex pressed. \u201cTis the season and he\u2019s your sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Cassie glanced away. \u201cActually, he isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might\u2019ve had a spat,\u201d Harry suggested.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, dear, I urge you to settle it before Christmas.\u201d She looked at Harry and blushed. \u201cDon\u2019t let too much time elapse before you set things right.\u201d</p><p>Harry stepped closer to Phyllis. \u201cI couldn\u2019t agree with you more.\u201d</p><p>Rather than tell them there was nothing to settle, Cassie just thanked them for their advice.</p><p>They made an arrangement to meet, and Cassie let herself into her condo. The festive cheer of the season greeted her, and for a moment all she could do was stand and stare at her Christmas tree and the other decorations, at the Christmas cards lined up on her mantel and the pile of wrapped gifts. She struggled to ignore her heavy heart.</p><p>As she tossed the mail on the kitchen counter, Simon\u2019s bold handwriting, slanted across a business-size envelope, instantly caught her attention. She grabbed it with both hands. Two or three minutes must have passed before she mustered the courage to tear it open.</p><p>With her pulse hammering in her ears, she pulled out a refund check for the total amount of his fee. The check was wrapped in a single sheet of white paper. When she unfolded the sheet, she found it blank.</p><p>He\u2019d made the check out to her and in the memo line, he\u2019d written one word: refund. She had always assumed he\u2019d keep the money. Perhaps this was the only way he had of relieving his conscience. The only way of saying he had regrets, too. Not knowing just what she\u2019d do with it, Cassie propped the check against the base of a blooming poinsettia\u2014the very one he\u2019d given her. She\u2019d need to think about her response.</p><p>She could refuse to cash it out of pure stubbornness. That seemed foolish. When she\u2019d paid Simon, she\u2019d explained that the funds had come from a special savings account, which she\u2019d set up to pay for her wedding. Perhaps he was saying he wanted her to have that wedding.</p><p>No, she mused, shaking her head. She couldn\u2019t second-guess him, couldn\u2019t drive herself insane trying to analyze his motives.</p><p>The phone rang and, still absorbed in her thoughts, Cassie picked it up. \u201cHello,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d The male voice was unfamiliar. \u201cMy name is John Fitzsimmons and I was given your number by a...mutual friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, John?\u201d she asked, suspicion springing to life.</p><p>\u201cWell...I was hoping we could meet for coffee.\u201d He sounded nervous.</p><p>\u201cWhat friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Simon?\u201d she asked. It hadn\u2019t taken her long to catch on. The matchmaker in him was incapable of letting this go. He\u2019d found the man he believed to be her ideal match. Obviously, Simon was hoping to assuage his guilt by making sure she had the opportunity to meet John\u2014an opportunity she\u2019d already declined.</p><p>\u201cSimon suggested it might be better if I implied it was someone else, but I\u2019m not much good at prevarication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, either.\u201d</p><p>John chuckled. \u201cHe said you backed out at the last minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she confirmed.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s none of my business, but would you mind telling me why?\u201d</p><p>Cassie bit her lip and debated how wise it would be to reveal the truth, then decided she owed him that. \u201cI apologize because I realize I let you down, but...unfortunately I fell in love with someone else.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d She heard a world of disappointment in that one word.

It seemed far longer; it seemed like a lifetime.</p><p>John hesitated again. \u201cThen I don\u2019t understand why Simon was so insistent that I call you.\u201d</p><p>Cassie, however, was completely aware of his motivation. \u201cI\u2019m afraid...well, the man I fell in love with is Simon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d There was a wealth of meaning in his short response. \u201cI guess it would be safe to say he doesn\u2019t return your feelings?\u201d</p><p>Cassie believed he did. \u201cApparently not,\u201d she said softly, hoping the pain she felt wasn\u2019t obvious.</p><p>\u201cI guess that explains why he urged me to contact you.\u201d</p><p>She disagreed, but didn\u2019t voice her opinion.</p><p>\u201cI realize you...like Simon, but seeing that he doesn\u2019t feel the same way, it might help if we met. Simon spoke highly of you on several occasions and I thought the two of us might have a lot in common.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did he say about me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d He drew out the word. \u201cHe said that you\u2019re thoughtful and caring of others.\u201d</p><p>Despite herself, Cassie smiled. Simon had chosen to forget her negative attitude toward her neighbors and how she\u2019d done everything she could to get out of hosting the pre-Christmas dinner party.</p><p>\u201cHe said you\u2019re wonderful with children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d She closed her eyes and remembered the sad little girl who\u2019d come to visit Santa. All that child wanted for Christmas was for her father to come home. Even the hardest heart would\u2019ve been affected by such a request.</p><p>\u201cHe also said how generous you are to others.\u201d</p> <p>Cassie wasn\u2019t sure that was true.</p><p>\u201cAnd he told me you\u2019re one of the most beautiful clients he\u2019s ever had the pleasure of working with. He said your beauty is special because it\u2019s internal as well as external.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was kind of him.\u201d Simon would cringe if he heard her say that. He didn\u2019t receive compliments gladly.</p><p>\u201cActually, Simon couldn\u2019t say enough good things about you. He urged me to ask you out and not to take no for an answer. You will meet me, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She probably should but couldn\u2019t dredge up any enthusiasm for even a casual meeting. She needed time to deal with her complicated feelings for Simon. Her love was as strong now as when she\u2019d stepped into his office two days earlier, and yet it was useless to believe he\u2019d change his mind.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said honestly.</p><p>\u201cWhat would it hurt?\u201d John asked. \u201cAll I\u2019m suggesting is that the two of us have coffee together.\u201d</p><p>He had a point, but she hesitated. \u201cIt\u2019s, uh, nice that you\u2019d still like to meet, especially since you know how I feel about Simon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do. From everything Simon had to say, it sounds as if we\u2019re a perfect match. Or\u2014\u201d and she could hear the smile in his voice \u201c\u2014the most suitable one.\u201d</p><p>That might\u2019ve been true a few weeks ago, but it wasn\u2019t anymore. She loved Simon.</p><p>\u201cI think perhaps we should drop it for now,\u201d she said.</p><p>To her surprise, John laughed. \u201cSimon told me you\u2019d say that, but he also said I should be persistent.\u201d</p><p>Cassie straightened and a chill went down her spine. \u201cDid he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. In fact, he said I shouldn\u2019t listen to any arguments. He went so far as to say he\u2019s introduced dozens of couples over the past few years and in all that time he\u2019s never met two people who were a better fit for each other than you and me.\u201d</p><p>Cassie had to restrain a laugh. Simon was doing his utmost to push her into the arms of another man, and his determination only served to confirm that she\u2019d been right all along.</p><p>But telling John this would be touchy. \u201cWhy do you suppose he praised me so much?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019ve noticed that Simon isn\u2019t really one for flattery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I first met him, I wasn\u2019t sure what to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHe seemed way too dictatorial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear a lot of people have the same feeling. The friend who told me about Simon and his matchmaking business said I shouldn\u2019t take offense at his gruff manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid his attitude change?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid he start to react to you in a different way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2019s the reason you asked why he had so many wonderful things to say about you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think he\u2019s in love with you, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>John sighed. \u201cSeems funny, doesn\u2019t it, that a matchmaker would have such a hard time admitting he\u2019s in love.\u201d</p><p>Cassie wasn\u2019t exactly laughing. \u201cIn any other circumstances, you and I would probably have gotten along famously\u2014and maybe even decided to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he concurred. \u201cWho\u2019s to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for calling, John. I want nothing but the very best for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He paused and she could hear Elvis Presley\u2019s \u201cBlue Christmas\u201d in the background. \u201cI guess this means you\u2019re definitely not going out with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d She started to hang up when John stopped her.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCassie, I was wondering if you\u2019d take my phone number\u2014in case you have a change of heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in my phone, John. I have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t lose it, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t lose it,\u201d she promised. \u201cMerry Christmas, now.\u201d</p><p>Late the following day, Christmas Eve, Cassie was grateful for Mrs. Mullinex\u2019s invitation. She hated the idea of spending the evening alone.</p><p>Although she wasn\u2019t Catholic, she thought she might attend midnight mass at the cathedral after that. The beauty of the service and the music would lift her heart and infuse her with holiday spirit.</p><p>The small get-together at Mrs. Mullinex\u2019s was congenial, with Harry and Phyllis exchanging fond smiles over their fruitcake and eggnog. Love seemed to be blossoming all around her. First Shawn and Angie, and now her two cantankerous neighbors.</p><p>She toasted her newfound friends and after a respectable length of time made her excuses. They all hugged and wished each other a Merry Christmas, and she did the same.</p><p>As she left she saw a male figure heading toward the elevator. From behind he resembled Simon. He was about to step through the elevator doors when she called his name.</p><p>\u201cSimon?\u201d</p><p>He turned abruptly, a frown darkening his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you turn John Fitzsimmons down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you know,\u201d she said calmly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a stubborn woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019ve only noticed that now?\u201d She unlocked her door and entered the apartment.</p><p>After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Simon followed her inside.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Simon says: The perfect Christmas is the one I spend with you. S imon strode into Cassie\u2019s apartment but couldn\u2019t seem to stop moving, from door to window and back again.</p><p>Cassie wished she dared to throw her arms around him and halt his frantic pacing.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you agree to at least meet John?\u201d The anger seemed to radiate from him.</p><p>\u201cSimon, you know why. I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes slammed shut and he clenched his jaw. \u201cI don\u2019t want your love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you said.\u201d That didn\u2019t change the way she felt, though.</p><p>\u201cWhat harm would it have done to meet John?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone, I suppose,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cBut I felt I would\u2019ve been doing him a disservice.\u201d</p><p>It was as though he hadn\u2019t heard her. \u201cIn other words, despite your assurances that you\u2019re willing to move on with your life, you refuse to do so,\u201d he challenged.</p><p>Cassie sat on her sofa while Simon continued pacing. She tracked his movements with her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll date other men\u2014when I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>He whirled around and glared at her.</p><p>Cassie felt it was her turn to pose a few questions. \u201cWhy are you fighting this?\u201d she asked, looking up at him. \u201cAnd...why are you here at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to talk to you about John.\u201d Simon shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize marrying me would be a disaster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d It didn\u2019t escape her notice that he hadn\u2019t denied anything\u2014and that he\u2019d brought up marriage. Evidently the subject had been on his mind, which was encouraging. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Simon abruptly stood still. \u201cI suspect I\u2019m not telling you anything you don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not...comfortable with emotions on a personal level. I prefer to analyze and guide other people\u2019s emotional lives. I have a hard time admitting this, but I\u2019ve always steered clear of the intensity, the giving up of control....\u201d He sounded so unlike the confident, self-assured man she\u2019d come to know, and his vulnerability made him even more appealing.</p><p>\u201cI hate this confusion,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019m good at helping my clients sort through their feelings, good at writing about them\u2014but not good at experiencing them. It makes me...miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been pretty miserable myself,\u201d Cassie said.</p><p>\u201cThen we should both find ways of dealing with these emotions because I\u2019m not changing my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Cassie.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to argue. \u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, eyebrows raised. \u201cDon\u2019t be so agreeable. I\u2019m not used to it, and I don\u2019t know how to react when you\u2019re amenable to everything I say.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cSee? That\u2019s what I mean.\u201d He pointed accusingly at her. \u201cListen. I know what kind of man makes a good husband\u2014and I\u2019m not it.\u201d</p><p>Cassie had to smile. \u201cThat\u2019s something I don\u2019t agree with. You\u2019ve shown me truths about myself. Let me do the same for you.\u201d</p><p>Simon shook his head as if that possibility was beyond him.</p><p>Cassie wasn\u2019t about to let him assume he was incapable of love when she knew otherwise.</p><p>She stood and walked purposefully toward him. He was still pacing, so she caught his hand. Her fingers curled around his and he turned back to stare at her. Not giving him a chance to object, she leaned forward and placed her mouth on his.</p><p>Simon slipped one hand around the back of her head and kissed her with a hunger that thrilled her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start with teaching you to accept my love,\u201d she whispered when he broke off the lengthy kiss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Again he briefly closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cLove is one thing,\u201d he muttered. \u201cBut you want children. I don\u2019t know about children except in theory. I\u2019m not good with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey cry and make messes in their diapers and drool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why people willingly submit themselves to the uncertainty and stress of raising children.\u201d He splayed his fingers through his hair.</p> <p>Even as he spoke she heard the longing in his voice. Despite his claims to the contrary he desired a family, just like most people did. Just like she did. Unable to resist a moment longer, she slid her arms around his waist and hugged him close. He resisted at first and attempted to break free.</p><p>Cassie held tight. Smiling up at him, she stood on the tips of her toes, rested her hands on his shoulders and pressed her mouth to his. It was only a matter of seconds before he became fully involved in the kiss.</p><p>When her legs were about to give way, Simon tore his mouth from hers and stepped back, still holding on to her, which was a good thing. Otherwise Cassie would have collapsed in a heap on the floor.</p><p>He wagged a warning finger at her. \u201cNo more of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d She felt she should probably apologize but giggled instead. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself. Oh, Simon, you\u2019re right. I do want children\u2014your children. We\u2019ll have very special babies.\u201d</p> <p>His expression was wry. \u201cThey won\u2019t cry and make messes and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they will,\u201d she said, nudging him.</p><p>\u201cLike I already said, I have no skills in this area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t, either. We\u2019ll learn together, the way other parents do.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d convinced him or not because he continued to stare at her.</p><p>Then, as if he\u2019d noticed the Christmas decorations for the first time, he frowned and said, \u201cWhen you came to me, you talked about a perfect Christmas.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not big on Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s kind of a weak argument,\u201d she told him. \u201cSeeing how every assignment you gave me had to do with the holidays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because there\u2019s a surfeit of them at this time of year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but there are plenty of others and you chose the Christmas-related tasks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve found some hidden meaning in that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s obvious to me that you enjoy the holidays.\u201d</p><p>When he started to protest, she held up a hand.</p> <p>\u201cLet me amend that. You enjoy watching other people enjoy Christmas. You understand why it\u2019s important to them, the same way you understand\u2014in theory\u2014why love and marriage and children are important. If you don\u2019t like Christmas, it\u2019s because you\u2019re alone. You don\u2019t have anyone to share it with. But, Simon, that\u2019s about to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you making assumptions you have no business making?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this really so difficult?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he groaned.</p><p>Cassie gently laid her head against his chest and sighed meaningfully.</p><p>His sigh echoed hers. \u201cOh, I give up. You knew I\u2019d fallen in love with you.\u201d He drew her toward him and rested his chin on her head.</p><p>\u201cI hoped so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love you, Cassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and shattered what remained of her composure with a single kiss.</p><p>\u201cYou seriously want to marry me?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cMore than I\u2019ve wanted anything in my entire life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd children. You want children.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, knowing he wanted them as much as she did. \u201cTwo or three, at least.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be a wonderful father. And a wonderful husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur babies are going to inhabit my heart the same way you have. I see it happening already.\u201d He gazed down at her with such tenderness it nearly brought tears to her eyes.</p><p>\u201cInhabit your heart,\u201d she repeated. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve moved into mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t forget you for even a second,\u201d he whispered, holding her close and breathing the words against her hair. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what it is about you that\u2019s different from all the other women I\u2019ve met, the other women who fell in love with me...or thought they did. I just know you were right when you told me I loved you.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened around her. \u201cYou\u2019re right about Christmas, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I so easy to read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very good life together,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAnd every Christmas\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her phone rang, interrupting him. Cassie was content to let it ring until Simon released her.</p><p>Checking call display, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should answer it.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, she reached for the receiver. \u201cHello, Shawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d Shawn\u2019s greeting sounded happier than she could remember hearing in a long, long time.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d she said in return.</p><p>\u201cYou seem happy...Any particular reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Shawn hooted with laughter. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t hold out, could he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThankfully, no. Christmas came early for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Shawn said. \u201cCome and join us, both of you.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, the four of them sat in front of a crackling fire in Angie\u2019s small rental house in West Seattle. The clock above the mantel chimed midnight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas,\u201d Angie sang out as she leaned against Shawn.</p><p>Simon\u2019s arm was around Cassie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cChristmas,\u201d she echoed. Then she spoke softly into his ear. \u201cMy perfect Christmas, Simon. I have it right here, right now, with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
