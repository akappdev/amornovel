The paper covering the patient\u2019s exam table crinkled beneath her sweaty thighs. A cold breeze from the air duct wafted across her bare butt exactly where the itsy bitsy cloth gown gapped.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t as bad as having her lower half completely exposed, her knees spread wide, her feet in metal stirrups as she stared at the \u201cHang In There, Baby\u201d poster plastered to the ceiling.</p> <p>Skylar dreaded pelvic exams, pap smears, shots, and teeth cleanings\u2014anything resembling a medical procedure. So far she\u2019d been poked, prodded and they\u2019d taken a sample of damn near every bodily fluid imaginable; blood, urine, saliva, a throat culture, earwax, toe-jam\u2014not so much the last two, but it\u2019d sure seemed like it.</p><p>She\u2019d been cooling her heels in this sterile room for thirty minutes. Which gave her plenty of time to wonder: what the hell was wrong with her?</p><p>For the last month she\u2019d experienced constant nausea. Not enough to make her barf, but wooziness, usually worse at night. She didn\u2019t feel like eating, yet, according to the doctor\u2019s scale, she\u2019d managed to pack on five pounds since the last time she\u2019d weighed herself at home.</p><p>She could attribute her physical changes to stress. Owning her own business was nerve-racking, even when her all-natural, made-in-Wyoming beauty products contained aromatherapy properties. Construction delays caused her extra anxiety, but she\u2019d finally opened the retail store of Sky Blue in Sundance. The manufacturing plant outside of Moorcroft was in full swing filling holiday orders.</p><p>Still, stress wouldn\u2019t make her skin hurt to the touch. Tension might push her to the edge of exhaustion, causing her to sleep for twelve hours straight. She\u2019d missed two or three periods\u2014who kept track? She\u2019d always been irregular. But that didn\u2019t explain the weird vaginal discharge. Plus, she was moody. She couldn\u2019t regulate her body temp; she was either too hot or too cold. It was all so eerily familiar. She recognized the signs, though never on herself.</p> <p>Cancer.</p><p>Skylar closed her eyes. Please. Not cancer. She couldn\u2019t have cancer. The universe couldn\u2019t be that damn cruel. Eight years ago her mother had been diagnosed with uterine cancer. Her mom believed she\u2019d hit menopause. She\u2019d exhibited all the signs\u2014signs Skylar recognized because she\u2019d been experiencing them herself recently.</p><p>A cancer diagnosis would decimate her sister, India. Ironically enough, their father had been a victim of prostate cancer eleven years ago. Sky\u2019s thoughts flashed to the rounds of chemo and radiation. The endless trips to the hospital. If anything would send India back to the shady world of booze, drugs and random sexual encounters, it\u2019d be dealing with another cancer-stricken family member.</p><p>The door made a metallic snick and Skylar\u2019s stomach lurched. She peeled her eyes open to look at the doctor, a striking petite redhead.</p><p>\u201cThe tests are back,\u201d Doctor Monroe said.</p><p>\u201cAnd? Do I have cancer?\u201d</p> <p>Doctor Monroe frowned and studied the pages inside the file folder. \u201cWhy on earth would you think...oh, I see. A family history of cancer. Huh. A lot of cancer. But no. It\u2019s not cancer.\u201d</p><p>Skylar stifled the urge to weep with relief. \u201cThen what on earth is wrong with me? Is it a bug or something I picked up someplace? Is it contagious?\u201d For some reason the impulsive event from a few months back clicked front and center in her mind.</p><p>Contagious.</p><p>Kade McKay. That rat bastard. He\u2019d given her the clap.</p><p>\u201cI have to say, Skylar, I\u2019m not particularly surprised.\u201d</p><p>Skylar\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cNot surprised that I have an STD? I have unprotected sex one time, one freakin\u2019 time in all the years I\u2019ve been sexually active and you\u2019re not surprised that the jerk I slept with gave me crotch crud?\u201d</p><p>Doctor Monroe smiled\u2014grinned actually. \u201cOh, he didn\u2019t give you an STD. He gave you a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHAT?\u201d Skylar shrieked. \u201cI\u2019m...I\u2019m... Omigod. I\u2019m pregnant?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThree months, does that sound right?\u201d</p><p>Skylar nodded dumbly. Numbly.</p><p>Pregnant. Good God. She hadn\u2019t seen Kade since that blow up at Ziggy\u2019s three and a half months ago. The night they\u2019d done the deed in his pickup in the parking lot of a honky-tonk. Immediately after that romp she\u2019d found out he\u2019d tricked her. She\u2019d cut him out of her life, dodged his phone calls and eventually he\u2019d stopped calling.</p><p>Yet, recently she\u2019d found herself thinking of patient, sexy-as-sin Kade McKay at the oddest times, wondering if she hadn\u2019t gone off half-cocked. Although he\u2019d never corrected her assumption he was pretending to be his identical twin brother, the time they\u2019d spent together never seemed like a trick or a joke, or forced but something promising. Something real.</p><p>Right. It didn\u2019t get any more real than a baby.</p><p>A baby. Jesus.</p><p>\u201cAny excessive drinking or other substances I should be worried about that might\u2019ve affected this pregnancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My sister is a recovering alcoholic and she\u2019s been living with me, so I haven\u2019t had a drop of alcohol for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Doctor Monroe scooted forward and clasped Skylar\u2019s hands in her own. \u201cA surprise pregnancy isn\u2019t always a pleasant surprise. You understand as your physician there is no judgment on my part on the decision you make. You\u2019re a healthy thirty-four-year-old woman. Pregnancy and childbirth isn\u2019t a risk to you healthwise.</p><p>\u201cThat said, if this pregnancy isn\u2019t something you want, you\u2019ll need to schedule an appointment with the clinic in Billings or one in Denver within the next week to terminate it. After that, you\u2019re starting the second trimester and the health risks to you double.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m a third of the way through?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Monroe nodded.</p><p>A baby. Growing inside her. How weird. How...cool.</p><p>And suddenly Sky wanted this baby fiercely. \u201cWell, Doc, I\u2019m looking at this as a good surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re the same age and if I had the same surprise, I\u2019d be over the moon.\u201d</p><p>Sky definitely felt as if she\u2019d been launched into another galaxy, spawning a new life form inside her. \u201cGuess I\u2019d better bone up on Mr. Spock\u2019s pregnancy and childbirth books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor Spock, the baby expert. Not the Vulcan Star Trek character,\u201d Doc Monroe said dryly. She reached into a cabinet, pulling out a big white plastic bottle. \u201cPrenatal vitamins. I\u2019ll write you a prescription, but this should get you through until I see you next month.\u201d</p><p>Then she rattled off a spiel about unnatural bleeding, swollen tissues, tingling in arms and legs, when to come in\u2014Sky heard it all, but through a fog of disbelief.</p><p>The word pregnant kept repeating in her mind.</p><p>In a daze, she wandered to her car, keeping her coat wrapped tightly against the cold November wind.</p><p>Kade had a right to know about this baby. She\u2019d have to steel herself against his reaction\u2014most likely not positive. They\u2019d had sex one time. One. Freakin\u2019. Time. What were the odds she\u2019d end up pregnant? Would he even believe her that the kid was his?</p><p>Only one way to find out. She fished her BlackBerry from her purse and scrolled down the contact list.</p><p>Dammit. In a fit of anger she\u2019d erased his cell number. Last she knew he\u2019d temporarily moved in with his parents. Even if that was no longer the case, they\u2019d know how to get in touch with him.</p><p>Skylar punched up the local phone directory, narrowing it to Sundance before she attempted the surrounding Wyoming counties. McKay. A shitload of them were listed: McKay, Bennett</p><p>McKay, Calvin and Kimi</p><p>McKay, Carson and Carolyn</p><p>McKay, Carter and Macie</p><p>McKay, Casper and Joan</p><p>McKay, Charles and Violet</p><p>McKay, Chase</p><p>McKay, Colby and Channing</p><p>McKay, Colt</p><p>McKay, Cord and AJ</p><p>McKay, Quinn and Libby</p><p>No Kade. No Kane. Think, Sky. What were his parents\u2019 names? No clue. What was up with all the \u201cC\u201d names anyway? That was confusing as hell. She scrolled and started with the couple at the top of the list. Calvin and Kimi.</p><p>She dialed. Her heart jumped into her throat, nearly choking her when the phone was answered on the second ring. \u201cMcKays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello. I\u2019m looking for Kade McKay.\u201d</p><p>Deep male laughter. \u201cLook elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother is gone.\u201d</p><p>The man speaking had to be Kane, Kade\u2019s twin. \u201cGone? What do you mean gone?\u201d</p><p>Then Sky remembered Kade\u2019s cousin had died in a tragic ranch accident and the blood drained from her face. \u201cIs he...dead?\u201d</p><p>A snort. \u201cNo, he\u2019s gone, as in, he moved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree months ago.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Wasn\u2019t that a coincidence? Was that irony laughing in the background or just the rude man on the phone?</p><p>\u201cBefore you ask where he\u2019s gone, he might as well be livin\u2019 in Timbuktu because there\u2019s no way to get a hold of him. Try back late next summer.\u201d And he hung up.</p><p>Skylar stared at her cell phone in astonishment. How had she ever mixed up Kane and Kade McKay? They were different as night and day.</p><p>Which mattered not a single whit.</p><p>Call back next summer.</p><p>Right. Looked like she was on her own. Again.</p><p>Skylar patted her stomach. \u201cJust you and me, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>After five minutes of aimless staring at the gray nothingness outside her window, she laughed until tears poured down her face.</p><p>\u201cA case of mistaken identity with identical twins, unprotected sex in a pickup truck, and now, a secret baby. Heck, with your cowboy daddy MIA, if I moved into a trailer and bought a shotgun we\u2019d be living the redneck anthem.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The fluttery sensation in her stomach solidified as the baby gave her a good swift kick.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Nine months later...</p> <p>The door slammed hard enough to shake the whole house.</p><p>\u201cKade West McKay. I want to talk to you right now.\u201d</p><p>Kade sighed. He wondered what he\u2019d done to invoke his mother\u2019s wrath this time.</p><p>Left the toilet seat up? Parked in her spot? Forgot to wipe his boots? Did she know how mortifying it was to be treated like a naughty eleven-year-old boy, rather than a thirty-two-year-old man responsible for running a ranch the size of Rhode Island?</p><p>A thirty-two-year-old man who was living at his folks\u2019 house. Again. Temporarily, he silently amended. He\u2019d been back from the yearlong grazing experiment for just two days, and it felt as if he\u2019d gone back in time twenty years.</p> <p>All five-feet-one inches of Kimi McKay barreled around the corner into the living room. Whenever she got her mad on, he and his brother Kane snickered and called her the blonde tornado\u2014behind her back, of course.</p><p>Nothing about the mean glint in her eye invoked his secret chuckle today. Something serious had put the starch in her spine. Out of reflex, he sat up straighter. Rather than risk saying the wrong thing, Kade said nothing.</p><p>She bent close to him, her face a mask of fury. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell is wrong with you. I raised you better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get smart with me.\u201d</p><p>Count to ten. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you lie to me, neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa. Calm down. Lie about what? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Your behavior is what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about you being such a...\u201d She tossed up her arms. \u201cA McKay!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never pegged you as the love \u2019em and leave \u2019em type, Kade. I\u2019d hoped you were different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy is it so damn hard if you can\u2019t keep your damn pants zipped to remember to wear a damn condom?\u201d</p><p>Baffled, he just stared at her as she ranted and swore a blue streak.</p><p>\u201cSo you were caught up in the moment of passion, I understand that. But I expected you\u2019d do the right thing, Kade, not walk away. Or run away as the case may be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you lost your mind? What in the hell are you babblin\u2019 about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d she drilled his chest hard with her index finger, \u201c\u2014neglecting to tell me you\u2019d knocked up a woman and then flitted off to the north forty of the McKay ranch, leaving her to deal with the pregnancy and the baby all alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat woman? What baby?\u201d</p><p>Kimi McKay snapped upright. Her pale blue eyes searched his. A mixture of surprise and resignation replaced the anger on her face. \u201cOh, good Lord. You really don\u2019t know, do you, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow that you\u2019re a father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Run that by me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me right. You\u2019re a father.\u201d</p><p>Kade remained calm in light of his mother\u2019s delusions. \u201cRemember where I\u2019ve been the last twelve months. I\u2019ve barely seen a woman in that long, let alone touched one.\u201d</p><p>Why don\u2019t you just brag about your lack of a sex life to your mother of all people?</p><p>\u201cWhich fits, because that baby is over three months old.\u201d</p><p>Kade\u2019s heart damn near stopped. His mouth dried up like a summer stock dam as he did the math in his head. Last time he\u2019d had sex was last year with Skylar. In their single, spontaneous, passionate bout of lovemaking, they\u2019d forgotten to use a condom.</p><p>Not that they\u2019d talked about the \u201coops\u201d incident afterward. She\u2019d been livid when she learned of his duplicity; he\u2019d resigned himself to losing her for good after she wouldn\u2019t return his phone calls. He\u2019d left town within two weeks. Kade realized\u2014for the first time\u2014it was entirely possible that he might\u2019ve gotten her pregnant.</p><p>Oh yeah? If that\u2019s true, then why didn\u2019t she contact me after I sent her that letter?</p><p>Whoa. Talk about acting like a surly eleven-year-old.</p><p>\u201cKade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw Skylar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha!\u201d She shook her finger in his face. \u201cYou aren\u2019t denying it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you\u2019d better start at the beginnin\u2019 and tell me exactly how you came across this information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I popped into Sky Blue in Sundance for a bottle of hand cream. India always helps me. So imagine my surprise when I see the owner working the cash register.</p><p>Imagine an even bigger surprise when I see a sweet baby nestled in her arms. And that baby sports a shock of black hair and looks at me with blue eyes, McKay blue eyes. I\u2019ve seen my share of McKay babies in the last thirty-six years and there wasn\u2019t any doubt I was lookin\u2019 at one.</p><p>\u201cWhen Skylar saw the name on my check, she stammered and couldn\u2019t get rid of me fast enough. I knew that baby had to be yours. Or Kane\u2019s.\u201d A pause. \u201cBut Skylar is too classy and ambitious to be Kane\u2019s type. Then something triggered my memory. Kane mentioning after Dag died you\u2019d suffered a bad break-up with a woman. Is she the reason you were so eager to disappear last year and take a job in the boondocks that no one else wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartially, but I sure didn\u2019t know she was pregnant because I never woulda left.</p><p>Never. You know that, Ma.\u201d This was so unbelievable he was having a devil of a time focusing. \u201cDid you ask her if...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t ask her.\u201d She leaned forward again. \u201cDo you know how hard that was? To see that darlin\u2019 little girl baby, all pretty in pink ribbons and bows, smilin\u2019 and cooin\u2019 at me, knowin\u2019 she was my granddaughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkylar had a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Only the second McKay girl born in a hundred and twenty-three years. And she\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>His. He had a baby daughter. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d If Kade hadn\u2019t been sitting down, he\u2019d\u2019ve been falling down. He repeated inanely, \u201cA baby? Skylar had a baby? I\u2019m a father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEliza.\u201d</p><p>Eliza. Pretty. His head spun. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, son, but I suspect you\u2019d better find out.\u201d</p><p>Kade heaved himself out of the chair. \u201cDamn straight.\u201d He snagged his hat off the coat rack and stormed out to his truck.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>On the drive into town, Kade replayed his first meeting with Skylar Ellison. He\u2019d thought of her and his dumb mistake in the endless days he\u2019d lived alone up on the most remote part of the McKay ranch. He\u2019d obsessed about her to the extent he\u2019d memorized every damn word of every encounter. Every kiss, every touch.</p><p>That afternoon from last summer floated into his mind in perfect detail.</p><p>As Kade had stood on the sidewalk debating on whether to eat lunch before heading home, click click had sounded and he\u2019d turned to see a woman in heels hustling down the sidewalk.</p><p>Mercy. She was all curves: hips, ass, thighs, and breasts. He loved women who looked like women and not a skeleton with skin. Her straight brown hair had a hint of red in the bright sunlight. Kade tipped his hat to her and stepped out of her way, figuring she\u2019d pass right on by.</p><p>But Miss Sexy Curves bumped her pointy-toed purple shoes against his shit-covered boots and glared. \u201cYou were a total jerk to me the other night, Kane McKay. I don\u2019t appreciate you ditching me at the restaurant. What kind of shithead\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Wait a second. I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014the least bit sorry, yeah, I can tell. Why are you here? Trolling for a new woman who\u2019ll give you a piece of ass on the first date since I wouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>That fucker Kane was such an asshole. At times like this it plain sucked they were identical twins and few people could tell them apart. This woman must be Kane\u2019s date from the other night.</p><p>His brother was an idiot too. He\u2019d just up and walked away from such a smoking hot firecracker?</p><p>\u201cGot nothing to say, McKay?\u201d</p><p>A really good idea occurred to him on how to make this right.</p><p>No. It was a bad idea. A terrible idea, his conscience warned.</p><p>The devil on his shoulder screamed, Do it. You and Kane used to switch places all the time. You\u2019re not misleading her; you\u2019re protecting the McKay name from another round of nasty gossip</p><p>Big surprise the pitchfork side won the battle .</p><p>\u201cActually, I do have somethin\u2019 to say to you.\u201d What the hell was her name again?</p><p>Something hippyishly weird. Aha. \u201cSkylar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I lost your number or I woulda called to apologize for bein\u2019 a first class jerk. But I\u2019d...ah...taken some allergy medicine and did it do a number on me. Normally I don\u2019t act like that. Not that I remember a whole helluva lot besides goin\u2019 home and crashin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Skylar stared at him skeptically.</p><p>Crap. She wasn\u2019t buying it. \u201cCan I make it up to you? Buy you lunch? I swear I won\u2019t run out again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. You don\u2019t mind vegetarian?\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Kade slapped on a fake smile. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>She laughed; it made him think of bells. \u201cYou are such a liar. Your family raises cattle. You probably shoot vegetarians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if they\u2019re part of PETA protestin\u2019 inhuman treatment of our stock. That pisses us off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, I eat salad. Not crazy about tofu. Or beans ground up and passed off as burgers. A burger is supposed to be meat. Beans are only good in tacos and chili.\u201d Kade looked up. Damn. He\u2019d been babbling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her lips curled in a cat-like smile. \u201cToo bad you weren\u2019t this honest the other night.

Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d order the porterhouse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t eat beef twenty-four/seven. I eat lots of other things.\u201d He\u2019d sure like to nibble on her. Scrape his teeth down to the base of her neck where her throat curved into her shoulder. Flick his tongue across the pulse point beating beneath her jaw. Sniff back up to see if she dabbed perfume behind her sweet little ears or if it was just the natural scent of her skin that smelled so heavenly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gawking at me, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Kade glanced up at her eyes. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Skylar folded her menu. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to do this again, are we? Sexual innuendos and you ogling my boobs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t oglin\u2019 your boobs. I was oglin\u2019 your neck.\u201d</p><p>She blinked.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I meant to say, is you have a sexy\u2014I mean, a nice neck, Skylar. Wasn\u2019t my intention to make you uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>After the waitress took their order, Kade fiddled with his silverware, wondering how many more times he\u2019d stick his boot in his mouth over the course of the meal.</p><p>\u201cSo they let you off the ranch today?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhaddya mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other night, you made it sound like you never get to town, you\u2019re always stuck out in the middle of nowhere by yourself.\u201d</p><p>Kane would play the I\u2019m-such-a-lonely-cowboy-on-the-range angle, figuring she\u2019d be inclined to take a tumble with him if she thought he wasn\u2019t a horndog whooping it up all the time\u2014which is exactly what Kane was.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s enough guys workin\u2019 I can take off now and again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a family operation, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSort of. There are four separate spreads. Ours, my Uncle Carson\u2019s, my Uncle Casper\u2019s and my Uncle Charlie\u2019s. My cousins help my uncles, they\u2019ve all bought land of their own, but we do ranch together. So the original homestead is twenty-five times the size it was when my great-great-grandfather settled in Wyoming territory and it\u2019s spread out in three counties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, did you always want to ranch? Or was it another one of those family legacies where you didn\u2019t have a choice?\u201d</p><p>How did he explain to someone who didn\u2019t possess the same mindset that there was no choice? And it didn\u2019t bother him most days his path in life had been set the day he was born? \u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019ve always wanted to do. The only thing, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many acres do you guys have?\u201d</p><p>Kade shifted and reached for his water glass.</p><p>\u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t elaborate, she angled across the table. \u201cI\u2019m new here, remember?</p><p>Cut me some slack if I\u2019ve broken a code of the West or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruth is, you don\u2019t ask a rancher the size of his spread. Or how many head of cattle he runs. Kinda like askin\u2019 someone how much money they make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, crass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Tell me more about your family.\u201d</p><p>Did she suspect he wasn\u2019t Kane? \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig families fascinate me, since mine is so small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019ve told you don\u2019t even take into account my ma\u2019s side. The Wests have been ranchin\u2019 in Wyoming almost as long as the McKays. Sort of a Hatfield and McCoy rivalry goin\u2019 on there. But there\u2019s just me and my brother in our immediate family.\u201d</p><p>Skylar stirred sugar substitute in her iced tea. \u201cOlder or younger brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYounger.\u201d By about four minutes. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d After he asked, he kicked himself. She\u2019d probably told Kane. And wow, hadn\u2019t he been babbling like a spring creek? Did she really care about every damn member of his family and their sordid history? His cheeks grew hot.</p><p>\u201cI have one younger sister. India. She defines rebellious since she works in a tattoo parlor.\u201d Skylar grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s awesome. Now that I\u2019m settled and out of LA, she\u2019s relocating here from Denver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a lot of tattoo artists round these parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully that means her business will thrive. My mother grew up here and moved to the coast. Grandma died two years ago and left the small acreage to me and my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t leave the homeplace to your mother?\u201d</p><p>Skylar shook her head. \u201cMom died seven years ago. Dad four years before that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. After Gran passed on I needed a change from the rat race. The state of Wyoming offered me a financial incentive to expand my hobby into a business, so I did.</p><p>It\u2019s taken over a year to get it up and running.\u201d</p><p>Kade picked at his salad. \u201cWill you think I\u2019m a total jerk if I tell you I don\u2019t remember what business you\u2019re in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you didn\u2019t ask me.\u201d</p><p>His head shot up. \u201cThat makes me even more of a prick.\u201d</p><p>That sweet, bellish laughter sounded again. \u201cI\u2019d lay off the pharmaceuticals in the future before a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal. What is it that you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI created a line of all-natural beauty products made right here on my grandma\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSky Blue?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. That\u2019s why I\u2019m in Moorcroft. My ma sent me to DeWitt\u2019s to pick up a bottle of lotion. They don\u2019t carry it in Sundance.\u201d</p><p>Skylar\u2019s mossy green eyes lit up. Kade found himself staring at her again, absolutely taken by her earthy beauty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to rectify that by opening a store in Sundance. So, which lotion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Smells kinda like lemony dirt.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cSpoken by a man who probably washes with Lava soap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t knock Lava, darlin\u2019. It gets the dirt off. And I\u2019m plenty dirty at the end of the workday.\u201d</p><p>The food arrived. Instead of blathering on, Kade let the silence linger until they finished eating. Then the flirty waitress swung by with a tray of decadent desserts. \u201cThe chocolate cake looks good.\u201d He prompted, \u201cSkylar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone for me, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Kade frowned. He\u2019d swear she\u2019d been eyeballing that same piece of cake. \u201cYou don\u2019t like sweets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love sweets. I\u2019m trying to watch what I eat so I don\u2019t have more of a weight problem.\u201d</p><p>Being polite flew right out the window. \u201cWhat weight problem? You\u2019re perfect, all curvy and sexy and feminine like a woman oughta be. You\u2019re gorgeous and if I wasn\u2019t tryin\u2019 so damn hard to be a gentleman I\u2019d...\u201d Nice going, now she\u2019ll really think you\u2019re reverting to Kane-like behavior. Kade sighed. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>Skylar angled closer, her eyes burned with interest. \u201cNo. Tell me, gentleman McKay.</p><p>What would you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d feed you the cake just to see your lips wrap around the fork. Then I\u2019d watch your beautiful throat muscles work as you swallowed the sticky sweetness, fantasizin\u2019 about smearin\u2019 chocolate frosting down your neck so I could lick it off. Slowly. And when I finished feedin\u2019 you, I\u2019d press my mouth to yours for a thorough taste of you and the cake.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t draw back or recoil.</p><p>\u201cShocked, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than a little turned on, if you want to know the real truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for you I\u2019m willin\u2019 to share.\u201d He enjoyed the first few bites, then shoved the plate in the middle of the table. \u201cI wanna see you eat up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that an order?\u201d Skylar dug the tines of the fork into the mound of vanilla ice cream. \u201cIf I don\u2019t eat a bite will you force feed me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to force feed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I said yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be on your side of the table faster than you could blink.\u201d</p><p>Skylar said, \u201cYes,\u201d loud and clear.</p><p>Kade zoomed around and stretched his left arm along the back of her side of the booth, pressing his thigh to hers.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I never turn down the opportunity to share a taste of the sweet stuff in life.\u201d</p><p>He swirled the fork through the thick chocolate frosting and held it to her mouth. \u201cOpen for me.\u201d</p><p>Her full lips parted slightly.</p><p>He slipped the fork inside. \u201cSuck the sweetness off the tip. Just like that. Then I wanna see that pretty throat movin\u2019 as you swallow every bit of sticky goodness.\u201d</p><p>Kade broke eye contact only to watch her swallow. He groaned. \u201cAgain. Don\u2019t know why I\u2019m torturin\u2019 myself, but I can\u2019t help it. Lord, you have the sexiest neck I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst time a date has waxed poetic about the area above my nipples,\u201d she said huskily.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, you\u2019ve been datin\u2019 the wrong man.\u201d She didn\u2019t know how true that was.</p><p>\u201cI get that now.\u201d</p><p>Kade scooped on another forkful and teased it across the seam of her mouth. \u201cLick it a little.\u201d</p><p>Her tongue darted out.</p><p>\u201cYou want the whole thing, not just a dainty taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can take it. Open wide. You know you want to take it all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Those luscious red lips divided and her moist chocolate-scented breath drifted out.</p><p>He set the fork on her tongue. \u201cSuck it off. Oh yeah, just like that.\u201d His gaze zoomed to her throat. \u201cI wanna sink my teeth into that hot spot where I see your pulse poundin\u2019. I wanna lick it from bottom to top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He dragged his eyes back to hers.</p><p>\u201cI think the crotch on my nylons melted you\u2019ve gotten me so hot. And suddenly I could care less about cake.\u201d</p><p>Kade swept his thumb across the pouty swell of her bottom lip. He showed her the dab of chocolate he swiped before he brought it to his mouth and sucked it away.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the devil.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDevil\u2019s food, baby, the best kind.\u201d Kade allowed a smirk. \u201cThat mean I\u2019ve redeemed myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you go out with me again, Skylar? For coffee. To a movie.\u201d He smiled slyly.</p><p>\u201cOr just for dessert? Whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>She appeared to consider him carefully. \u201cHow about if you meet me out front of the feed store at seven the night after next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to pick you up at your place if it\u2019s a date.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Kade thought he\u2019d been making progress with her. \u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><p>Skylar nudged him so he scooted out of the booth and she stood next to him. \u201cAfter the way your sweet-talkin\u2019 activated more than my sweet tooth? I don\u2019t trust myself.\u201d</p><p>She swept her fingers over brim of his hat. \u201cStay out of the drugstore aisle, McKay, and don\u2019t be late.\u201d A swish of her hips and she was gone.</p><p>Kade shook the memory away. He parked and studied the revitalized Sandstone Building. On the far end was Dewey\u2019s Delish Dish, a family restaurant his cousin Carter\u2019s wife Macie managed. On the other end was Healing Touch Massage, owned by AJ McKay, his cousin Cord\u2019s wife.</p><p>Smack dab in the middle was Sky Blue and India\u2019s Ink. And inside that space was his child.</p><p>Sweet Jesus. He\u2019d never been so damn nervous in his life. He climbed out of his truck and sauntered up the wooden plank stairs. At the ornate metal door, he took a second to breathe, realizing the woozy sensation was from lack of oxygen to his addled brain.</p><p>A set of chimes tinkled when he entered the store.</p> <p>Scents bombarded him. Not heavy and cloying like expensive perfume, but simple and sweet. Natural. Reminiscent of the wildflowers on the wide-open Wyoming prairie.</p><p>Reminiscent of Skylar.</p><p>Speak of the devil... Right then Skylar came around the corner and froze.</p><p>They stared at each other in complete shocked silence.</p><p>Lord, she was easy on the eyes. An earth goddess in a floaty turquoise dress, which exposed her swan-like neck to perfection. A scarlet sash tied around her waist brought his attention to the sexy curve of her hips. Be-ringed bare toes peeped out from beneath the jagged skirt hem. Her auburn hair was longer, curling near the bottom of her full breasts, but it suited her gypsy image.</p><p>Kade cleared his throat and met her wary gaze head-on. \u201cIs it true, Skylar? Do we have a baby?\u201d</p><p>Her response was a long time coming. Finally, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to, Kade. I called your parents\u2019 house. You weren\u2019t there. I was told you\u2019d moved. I didn\u2019t know where. I didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d care.\u201d</p><p>Rather than snap bullshit at her, he expelled a frustrated sigh. \u201cThat means you didn\u2019t get my letter?\u201d</p><p>Her green eyes narrowed suspiciously. \u201cWhat letter?\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cI sent you a letter about a month ago. Tellin\u2019 you I was comin\u2019 back. Askin\u2019 if we could let bygones be bygones and start over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart over as in... Start dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t receive any such letter.\u201d She squeezed her eyes shut for a second. \u201cWhat else did it say?\u201d</p><p>Her expression clearly said she thought he was lying. He had sent the damn thing.</p><p>It\u2019d taken him nearly a week to pen a few lousy paragraphs. \u201cWe can talk about all that later. Right now, I\u2019d like to see my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. Wake her up.\u201d</p><p>Skylar\u2019s mouth opened. Then closed. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>That had to be the longest, most excruciating minute of Kade\u2019s life. His whole body shook. He even had to lock his damn knees to keep them from quaking like a newborn colt\u2019s. Sweat dripped down his spine and soaked the waistband of his jeans. He clenched his teeth and his fists.</p><p>Just when he thought he couldn\u2019t stand the wait another second, Skylar appeared.</p><p>She approached him cautiously, holding a bundle wrapped in a fluffy yellow blanket, nestled against her lush breasts.</p><p>Kade couldn\u2019t breathe. He couldn\u2019t think. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off that tiny bundle. Lord. It was so damn small. How could there be a living, breathing human baby in there?</p><p>When Skylar sidled up next to him and peeled back the blanket, revealing a sweet, perfect, beautifully pink face, Kade had a moment of utter pride and joy before his vision dimmed.</p><p>He swayed and everything went black.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Terrific. One glimpse of his fifteen-pound baby daughter and the big, tough cowboy had passed out cold. Skylar rocked Eliza side to side, waiting for Kade to come around on his own. She was half afraid to rouse him because he might come up swinging, as the McKays were rumored to do when backed into a corner.</p><p>Finally, he groaned. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fainted.\u201d</p><p>Kade pushed to his knees. \u201cCan you blame me? Ain\u2019t every day a man learns he\u2019s a daddy.\u201d</p><p>Huh. No macho posturing. No excuses for his swooning behavior. That surprised her. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. Good thing I gotta hard head.\u201d He rolled to his feet and snagged his hat.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEliza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEliza what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEliza Belle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What\u2019s her last name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell. That\u2019s the first thing that\u2019s gonna change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKade\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a second to think.\u201d</p><p>The more Kade paced and muttered to himself, the more nervous Skylar became.</p><p>Suddenly he stopped and was right in her face. \u201cFine. We have a baby. You can change her name the same time you change yours. We\u2019ll get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried. As in you and me are gettin\u2019 hitched as soon as possible.\u201d He looked down into Eliza\u2019s face and the hard line of his mouth softened. \u201cShe needs a mother and a father and luckily she\u2019s got both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re getting married, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Kade lifted those blue eyes, eyes identical to their daughter\u2019s. His dark gaze seemed to pierce a hole in her resolve.</p><p>\u201cBecause you cannot barge in here and make demands. It may work riding roughshod over cattle and horses but it won\u2019t fly with me. We don\u2019t even know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it. We had what? A dozen dates? We haven\u2019t seen each other in a year?</p><p>We are basically strangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrangers? We created a child together. That makes us one helluva lot more than strangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s behind whether you agree or not. This little gal,\u201d he pointed a thick finger at Eliza\u2019s dark head, \u201cain\u2019t gonna be a stranger to me any longer.\u201d That fiery blue gaze snagged hers again. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right. You don\u2019t know me. So let me tell you something. I ain\u2019t walkin\u2019 away from her. Ever. I take care of what\u2019s mine. Period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t wanna get married? Fine. We\u2019ll get to know each other better first, since that\u2019s what\u2019s got you all fired up, thinkin\u2019 that we\u2019re strangers.\u201d He paused. \u201cIn fact, that\u2019ll work out better anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just move in with you. We\u2019ll see how that goes first.\u201d</p><p>Warning bells clanged in her head. \u201cOh no. Absolutely not.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Kade sighed. \u201cLook. Be reasonable. This ain\u2019t about you and me, what we were, or weren\u2019t, or what we will be in the future. This is about her. I know it ain\u2019t easy bein\u2019 a single parent. I watched my cousin Cord struggle with it. You\u2019ve been doin\u2019 all this pregnancy and baby stuff on your own and for that I\u2019m truly sorry, Sky. I can\u2019t change the past. But I am here now. I will be a hands-on father, not to help you out, but because I wanna be in my daughter\u2019s life all the time, not just as a weekend daddy.</p><p>\u201cSo, for now, it\u2019d be best if we didn\u2019t pass her back and forth between us, until I get to know Eliza where you and she are both comfortable. And that is in your house, under your watchful eye so I don\u2019t do something stupid or wrong.\u201d He smiled shyly. \u201cTo be real honest? I don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about girls. Especially baby girls.\u201d</p><p>When Kade looked at her like that, she remembered how she\u2019d ended up pregnant in the first place. The man oozed an earnest sexuality that still packed a wallop. Evidently time away from his intense eyes and devilish grin hadn\u2019t made her immune to his considerable charms because she found herself agreeing. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Eliza squirmed and emitted a disgruntled cry.</p><p>Rather than retreat from her squawking, Kade tenderly touched Eliza\u2019s plump cheek.</p><p>\u201cHey there, beautiful girl. What\u2019s got you fussin\u2019? You hungry?\u201d</p><p>Skylar melted a tiny bit at his immediate acceptance and interest in his daughter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s always hungry when she wakes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine.\u201d He kept stroking Eliza\u2019s face, staring at her with an expression resembling awe.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna hold her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have held a baby before, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a long time. And never mine.\u201d</p><p>Sky shifted sideways and gently placed Eliza in his arms.</p><p>Kade stiffened.</p> <p>\u201cRelax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I doin\u2019 this right?\u201d His panicked gaze sought hers. \u201cOr am I squeezin\u2019 her too tight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing fine, Daddy. Just make sure you support her head.\u201d Sky fussed with Eliza\u2019s blanket and murmured,\u201d She likes to be snuggled close to your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d She studied his rapt face, bowled over by the raw emotion he didn\u2019t bother to hide. \u201cBe warned. She is squirmy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe don\u2019t weigh much, does she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be saying that when you\u2019ve been walking the floor with her all night because she won\u2019t stop crying. Those fifteen pounds feel like a hundred.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and brushed his thumb across Eliza\u2019s plump cheek. \u201cI can\u2019t wait. I can\u2019t wait to do it all. Good Lord, she\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Not the response Skylar expected and it brought a lump to her throat. \u201cI\u2019ll warm up a bottle.\u201d</p><p>That terrified look returned. \u201cYou\u2019re leavin\u2019 me alone with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the back if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>After grabbing a bottle from the mini-fridge, Skylar heated a pan of water on the hot plate. She considered Kade\u2019s suggestion of moving in with them. Much as she\u2019d been inclined to argue, it made sense. Not only could she use his help, she\u2019d never intended to deny Kade contact with Eliza. She\u2019d been too startled by his mother\u2019s unexpected appearance in the store this morning to ask Kimi McKay her oldest son\u2019s whereabouts.</p><p>But she\u2019d been thinking about it ever since. Wondering how she\u2019d react when she saw him again.</p><p>Skylar remembered every little detail of the last time she\u2019d seen him on that sultry evening last summer, sadness from a family tragedy had been weighing on him. They\u2019d been on their way to dinner and the heavy silence in his truck had gotten too much for her to bear. She\u2019d said, \u201cWill you think I\u2019m pandering if I say I\u2019m worried about you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. It\u2019d be nice to have someone worry about me for a change.\u201d He\u2019d shot Skylar a sheepish look. \u201cSorry. Just feelin\u2019 low. Never thought I\u2019d be thirty-one, single, and livin\u2019 back at home, wonderin\u2019 if my future is as bleak as it looks right now.\u201d</p><p>He seemed embarrassed by that admission as he parked at the far edge of the lot at the restaurant. \u201cHang tight. I\u2019ll come around and help you out. The damn interior light is broken. It\u2019s awful dark out here for you to be stumblin\u2019 around in them ankle breakin\u2019 shoes.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door. Skylar swung her legs to the running board, but didn\u2019t hop right out.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His hands tightened on her waist.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you could use a hug.\u201d She wreathed her arms around his neck.</p><p>Scooting forward, she trapped his hips with her knees, which brought them pelvis-to-pelvis, chest-to-chest and almost mouth-to-mouth.</p><p>\u201cSkylar\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh. It\u2019s okay.\u201d She kissed him, wanting to chase away his melancholy. He relaxed into her like she\u2019d given him exactly what he\u2019d needed.</p><p>He was so sweet. So big and solid and sturdy. Such a contradiction with his hungry kisses and tentative touches. And he smelled like a million bucks. If she could bottle that elusive manly scent, she\u2019d be filthy rich. He tasted of tobacco and toothpaste and Sky decided she could stay right there pressed against his firm body, secure in his strong arms, all night.</p><p>The kiss intensified. His rough palms slid up her thighs. She didn\u2019t bat away his roving hands. Neither did she protest when he cupped her breasts and stroked his thumbs across her hard nipples.</p><p>He kept touching her. Kissing her. God. She was dying for him to put his mouth to good use everywhere on her body. His lips tracked moist kisses down the sensitive line of her throat.</p><p>The stretchy material of her top gave way when he tugged. Her breasts popped free with one flick to the front clasp of her bra. Her bared skin was putty in his oh-so-capable hands. He sucked her nipples, one after the other until she couldn\u2019t think beyond the next thorough curl of his tongue around the puckered tips.</p><p>Amidst teasing bites to her mouth and throat, he rubbed his face over her neck and breasts, marking her with his suckling kisses and scratchy beard.</p><p>Reluctantly, he retreated to brush his lips across her hair. \u201cSorry for maulin\u2019 you. But you are so damn sexy you make me lose my ever lovin\u2019 mind. Give me a sec to clear it and we\u2019ll go in, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go in.\u201d</p><p>His head snapped up. \u201cThen what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. I want you. Right now. Like this.\u201d She whispered, \u201cPlease. Touch me. Don\u2019t stop this time.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her hard, as he eased her flat on the bench seat and slid her silky skirt up to the curve of her hips. He reached between her thighs and found her soaking wet, practically growling his pleasure. \u201cI want my mouth on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Now. Right now.\u201d</p><p>Never had a man been so forceful, so demanding of her submission. Never had she dreamed she\u2019d...love giving in.</p><p>He twisted her panties in his fingers and yanked aside the flimsy cotton. No easing her into the intimate kiss. His wet tongue lapped her slit from top to bottom. Swirling.</p><p>Tickling. Tasting. He tongued her relentlessly, jamming deep in her pussy, returning to flicker the very tip across her clit until her whole body shook. When he finally sucked that bit of protruding flesh, she came in a throbbing rush against his mouth.</p><p>As she attempted to regain her sanity, he feathered unbearably gentle kisses across the tops of her trembling thighs. He breathed heavily and muttered against her slick flesh.</p><p>Skylar lifted up on her elbows and looked down at his dark head nuzzling her.</p><p>His hot gaze met hers across the clothes bunched around her middle. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get inside you I\u2019ll go crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better hurry up, huh?\u201d</p><p>In record time he\u2019d stepped up on the running board, unbuckled, unzipped, shoved his Wranglers to the tops of his boots and levered himself over her.</p><p>Skylar circled her legs around his waist and canted her pelvis for easier and faster entry, mindful of not nicking him with the razor-thin heels of her red stilettos. Her fingers dug into his tight, muscular ass.</p><p>Witnessing the ecstasy on his face as he slowly sank inside her to the root was one of the sexiest things she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>He pressed his forehead to hers. \u201cDo you know how perfect you feel? Tight. All creamy wet, soft and hot for me? Do you know how long I\u2019ve been achin\u2019 to be with you like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so now you wanna talk, McKay? When we\u2019re naked?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, if a bit shakily.</p><p>\u201cTalk later. Sex me up me first. Kiss me. God, your kisses undo me.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her with the same vigor as he made love to her. The heat in the truck expanded, making for a sticky, hot and intense coupling, yet, retaining the balance of comfort they both needed.</p><p>His thrusts became more frantic. Deeper. Faster. He pulled away from her mouth to whisper, \u201cSkylar. Take me with you this time.\u201d Lifting her hips higher, he slammed home three more times.</p><p>When she came in a series of juicy ripples, he buried his face in her neck, repeating her name, and followed her over the edge.</p><p>She frowned. Now that she thought about it, she hadn\u2019t said his name. She\u2019d taken to calling him McKay on their previous dates. About an hour after that fateful incident, she\u2019d learned the truth about who he really was.</p><p>Wrong. His name may\u2019ve been different, but the man was the same.</p><p>Eliza cried, jarring Skylar back to the present.</p><p>Kade entered the small backroom. \u201cIs that bottle ready yet?\u201d</p><p>Damn. She\u2019d been so lost in the vivid memory of him, of them, of heat and sex and need and lust, she\u2019d forgotten all about the bottle. She popped it in the pan. \u201cJust about ready.\u201d</p><p>He took one look at her flushed cheeks and bright eyes and somehow knew she\u2019d been reliving their brief\u2014but glorious\u2014naked past.</p><p>Defiant, she raised her chin a notch. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Kade\u2019s look held more steam than the pan of boiling water. \u201cI think about it all the time too. Some days that\u2019s all I can think of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to feed her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater. I\u2019d best get back to my folks\u2019 place and pack up my stuff. What time will you get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAround five-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there earlier than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. You\u2019ll need a key.\u201d She removed the front door key from the massive key ring and set it on the counter. Skylar watched as Kade kissed Eliza\u2019s wrinkled forehead and murmured, \u201cLater, sweet baby,\u201d before he awkwardly snuggled her back in Skylar\u2019s arms.</p><p>Then he did the strangest thing: he kissed Skylar\u2019s forehead and whispered, \u201cLater, sweet baby,\u201d to her, snatched the key and took off like a shot.</p><p>She sighed and settled in the rocking chair. \u201cHe\u2019s in for it now, girlie girl. We\u2019ll see how long he lasts in this parenting gig.\u201d</p><p>But part of her knew Kade McKay wasn\u2019t a short-term kind of guy. He was the type to stick around for the long haul.</p><p>That scared her far worse than him not being around at all.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Twenty miles from Moorcroft, Kade turned off the main highway onto a gravel road.</p><p>He motored past the gigantic steel building, noticing an open gate to the parking lot.</p><p>Being a lifelong rancher, leaving gates open drove him crazy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He passed through another wide-open gate, which separated the Sky Blue factory from Skylar\u2019s private residence. The old ranch house was blocked from view by a row of scraggly trees.</p><p>Unlike most Wyoming residents, her front door was locked. Kade set his bags next to the staircase in the cool, dark foyer. He looked at the pictures lining the hallway, a mish-mash of snapshots, artwork, formal studio poses and old-time sepia toned groups of photos from a century past.</p><p>The items on the opposite wall were hand-stitched family samplers. Mini-quilts, needlepoint, delicate doilies; all fussy female handiwork encased in glass and gilded frames. He wouldn\u2019t have pegged Skylar\u2019s decorating taste as old-fashioned, Western and homey.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t snoop beyond checking out the rooms on the main floor. Baby stuff had overtaken the antique dining room table. Didn\u2019t look like Skylar did much entertaining, which filled him with an odd sense of relief.</p><p>The formal feeling of the front room\u2014matching floral couches, heavy velvet drapes, tasseled pillows, elaborately carved antique end tables\u2014was completely overpowered by more baby paraphernalia. A swing. A stroller. A half-barrel shaped thing camouflaged with a lace canopy. Piles of pastel-colored clothes were stacked on the coffee table next to every baby book imaginable.</p><p>Kade cringed when he finally caught sight of the tiny TV shoved in the corner by the dust-covered piano. After a year of no television, a big screen would be his first contribution to the household.</p><p>On impulse he picked up a pink, fuzzy one-piece outfit with snaps from the top down to the feet holes. The scent of soap and baby powder wafted up and his stomach clenched.</p><p>It smelled like Eliza, clean, soft and powdery-sweet. As much as he\u2019d loved just holding her, he couldn\u2019t wait to do all the corny things like count her fingers and toes, blow raspberries on her stomach and rock her to sleep.</p> <p>His cell phone trilled in his shirt pocket. No big mystery who was pestering him.</p><p>\u201cHiya, Grama. Look, I know you wanna see Eliza, but you hafta give Skylar and me time to work some things out first.\u201d He held the phone away to keep it from blistering his ear.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know how long. I\u2019ll be drivin\u2019 to and from the ranch everyday startin\u2019 on Monday. Absolutely not. Kane and Dad can handle it for a couple days without me.</p><p>Because I\u2019ve been gone a year and they\u2019ve done fine. Three more days ain\u2019t gonna make a difference. I\u2019ll keep in touch.\u201d He clicked the phone off. She\u2019d be too busy bragging about her granddaughter to everyone in Crook County to call him back, for at least a day, and sad to say, few others had his new number.</p><p>He glanced at the grandfather clock. Skylar and Eliza would be home in roughly two hours. Picking up a stray blanket, he returned to the kitchen.</p><p>Kade unfolded the blanket on the table and placed the twenty-pound bag of russet potatoes in the center. He stared at it for a good long time before he sighed and wrapped the fleece around it. \u201cGoddamn I hope nobody sees me doin\u2019 this.\u201d</p> <p>The potato baby didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Gently, Kade picked up the bundle and tucked it in the crook of his arm. He paced the first floor from room to room, keeping hold of the spud baby, bouncing it, rocking it.</p><p>Performing all the motions he\u2019d seen women doing with their infants\u2014short of crooning a lullaby. He felt like a darn fool, slinking around, hugging a plastic bag that smelled like dirt, but he was determined Skylar wouldn\u2019t know just how much of a greenhorn he was when it came to holding babies.</p><p>A loud crash out by the barn startled him. He tripped on the rug in the foyer and right before he hit the ground, his \u201cbaby\u201d squirted out of his arms like a slippery bar of soap.</p><p>The bag busted open and potatoes flew everywhere.</p><p>Damn. That didn\u2019t bode well. His face burned with shame as he gathered up the potatoes. First thing he\u2019d do was confess his ineptitude in the baby arena rather than risk hurting Eliza because of his stupid pride.</p><p>An hour later the front door slammed. Thundering footsteps echoed down the hallway. Before he turned around, an angry female voice demanded, \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing in my sister\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>Kade tossed in a can of beans in the enamel pot. \u201cI\u2019m makin\u2019 supper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s funny?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>Kade spun, giving his accuser a once over. Definitely a stunning woman, despite her unnaturally colored scarlet-tipped black hair. Despite her irate posture and angrily tapping a combat-booted foot. The motion rattled the chains attached to her purple leather mini-skirt. His gaze swept her colorful arms. Whoa. Was that tattoo circling her wrist a flesh-colored snake? Or a very large, very erect cock?</p><p>\u201cEyes off the ink, buddy. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>He met her angry gaze head-on. \u201cI\u2019m Kade McKay.\u201d</p><p>She actually stumbled back a step. \u201cHoly shit. You\u2019re Eliza\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, noticing the woman\u2019s arched eyebrow was pierced, as was her nose and her lower lip. Both ears were weighted with a variety of sparkly stones and shiny hoop earrings.</p><p>\u201cShe looks just like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I saw her today for the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the first time? She\u2019s over three months old!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard? How could you abandon my pregnant sister, you worthless piece of shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst off, no more name callin\u2019.\u201d He soldiered on despite the woman\u2019s mulish look.</p><p>\u201cSecondly, who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkylar\u2019s sister, India.\u201d India crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cSky knows you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you think gave me a key?\u201d Kade\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cDo you live here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore. I did while Sky was expecting, since the jerk-off loser who impregnated her vanished and someone needed to keep an eye on her out here in the middle of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you keep rippin\u2019 on my character, let me assure you that I didn\u2019t know Skylar was pregnant. If I had known, no way would I\u2019ve left her. No. Way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where\u2019ve you been that she couldn\u2019t call you up and tell you the news about her bun in the oven?\u201d With mock sweetness, she asked, \u201cPrison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really, what were you doing?\u201d</p><p>India was a nosy thing, but Kade appreciated she was protecting Skylar. \u201cRanchin\u2019.</p><p>We bought new grazin\u2019 lands about forty miles northwest of our place. Rugged country.</p><p>No phone, no Internet, no satellite TV. Don\u2019t have electricity in the cabin half the time.</p><p>Closest town is sixty miles further north up into the mountains, and the road leadin\u2019 to it is damn near impassable from the end of October to the end of March. I volunteered to stay to see if it was viable to keep a year-round cattle operation up there. I returned home two days ago after havin\u2019 been gone for a year. Today I find out that Skylar and me have a baby girl.\u201d</p><p>India stared at him for the longest time. \u201cYou said your last name is McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou related to all the McKays living around Sundance?\u201d</p><p>He resisted the urge to deny it. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose McKay men have reputations as wild men and womanizers, boozers and brawlers and I cannot believe my straight-laced sister would get mixed up with one of them.\u201d</p><p>Story of his life. \u201cI\u2019ve been out of the loop, so I have no earthly idea what some of my rowdier cousins might\u2019ve been doin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>India cocked her head. \u201cMy first thought when Sky became an unwed mother, was that she was embarrassed by who knocked her up, so that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t want anyone to know.\u201d</p><p>Very evenly, Kade said, \u201cDid you ask her who the father was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRepeatedly. Can\u2019t say I blamed her on keeping mum. I made no secret I\u2019d planned on tracking down the lowlife to beat him within an inch of his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go with the name callin\u2019 again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the spur fits.\u201d She smiled nastily. \u201cFar as I know, she didn\u2019t tell anybody else either. I didn\u2019t even know she\u2019d been seeing anyone, so her pregnancy was a complete shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I didn\u2019t even have time to get used to the pregnancy; I gotta wrap my head around my baby.\u201d Kade sighed. \u201cAnd like you said, my family has quite the reputation.</p><p>Maybe she was embarrassed. Can\u2019t say as I blame her since I wasn\u2019t around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat really happened between you two?\u201d India shifted from boot to boot.</p><p>Her nervous energy set Kade on edge. \u201cI did a dumb thing, she broke it off when she found out, wouldn\u2019t let me explain, and I ended up leavin\u2019 because of it. I wasn\u2019t happy, but she\u2019d left me no choice but to let her be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s good at pushing people away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sorta figured that out,\u201d Kade said dryly.</p><p>\u201cTell me this. If the misunderstanding between you two would\u2019ve been cleared up, would you have left?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cDoes she know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you plan on telling her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the time is right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou play your cards pretty close to the vest, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Kade thought that was better than wearing his heart on his sleeve.</p><p>An uncomfortable moment followed.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d India threw up her hands. \u201cPull that strong, silent cowboy crap. So what happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re askin\u2019 if my intentions toward your sister are honorable, I asked her to marry me today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe immediately said no, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYeah. How did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s been...\u201d India shook her head. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think she has a spontaneous bone in her body. She\u2019s always been that way. So, in addition to her all-pro status of pushing people away, Skylar excels at taking an eternity to make a decision, any decision. She\u2019s meticulous. She weighs every opinion, thought, word, action and deed from every conceivable angle before she really gets down to the nitty-gritty of making a final determination on a course of action.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He squinted at her and challenged, \u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like you like her much.\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s blue eyes nearly turned black with anger. \u201cI worship her, I\u2019d do anything in the world for her, and I\u2019m thinking about punching you in the mouth for suggesting I don\u2019t, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Kade held up his hands. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSkylar and I are polar opposites, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact she\u2019s the greatest person in the world and she\u2019s a wonderful mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is all good and well, even if she won\u2019t agree to become my wife, I am movin\u2019 in to help care for Eliza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Another pause hung in the air. Then India smiled like a loon. \u201cThat\u2019s hysterical. She won\u2019t marry you, so you just bulled your way into being her roommate?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprises me she allowed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Sky might be all kinds of reserved, but I am damn determined to have my way on this, India.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that. Since I\u2019ve already given you the 4-1-1 on her, I should also warn you Skylar is used to being in charge of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Then it oughta be interesting to see if she\u2019ll even let you be a father to Eliza.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me? I am Eliza\u2019s father. I ain\u2019t givin\u2019 her a choice. I\u2019m here for good. Eliza better get used to it. Sky\u2019d better get used to it.\u201d Kade sent Skylar\u2019s sister a half-menacing smile. \u201cYou\u2019d better get used to it too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. You don\u2019t scare me, cowboy. I deal with drunks and druggies and bikers all damn day. But one thing my sister and I do have in common? We\u2019re both fighters.</p><p>Hardheaded.You determined to get your way is not gonna be easy. For either of you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t rise to the bait. Nor would he back down. \u201cNothin\u2019 worthwhile ever is.\u201d</p><p>India considered him without malice. \u201cNo pain, no gain, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the phrase I\u2019d choose, but yeah, I suppose that fits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck, because, man, are you gonna need it.\u201d</p><p>Kade grinned. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t need luck. I\u2019ve got something even better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA strong set of ropes, an iron will, and all the patience in the world.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>The spicy aroma of tomato and chili powder greeted Skylar at the front door. She half wondered if she\u2019d stumbled into the wrong house, especially when a gorgeous man strolled down the hallway with a grin a mile wide. A grin aimed at her.</p><p>\u201cAnd here I was hopin\u2019 you\u2019d yell, \u2018Hey honey, I\u2019m home\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe next time. Lemme take her.\u201d He plucked the baby carrier from her arm like it weighed nothing.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Skylar kicked off her sandals and noticed Kade was barefoot. She also noticed he\u2019d changed out of his usual cowboy attire. Instead of Wranglers and a long-sleeved shirt, he wore faded black sweatpant shorts and a gray tank top, which showed off his muscular arms and broad chest.</p><p>\u201cSupper\u2019s done whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d He headed for the living room.</p><p>She followed him and bit back a groan. The view from the rear was just as good as the front view. His wide shoulders tapered into a narrow waist, ending with an ass so round and tight she could\u2019ve bounced a quarter off it. Or sunk her teeth into it to double-check if it was as firm and yummy as it looked.</p><p>Get control of yourself, Sky.</p><p>Why was she having this physical reaction to him again? Strictly hormonal on a biological level because he was the father of her child?</p><p>No. You\u2019re reacting this way because that man\u2014your new roommate\u2014is smoking hot.</p><p>He set the car seat on the floor. \u201cYou wanna show me how to get her outta this contraption?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Push the red button, move the handle up until it locks. Then unfasten the seatbelt. Just like that. See? Easy.\u201d</p><p>Eliza\u2019s eyes blinked open and she stared at Kade as he lifted her out.</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you a bright-eyed little thing?\u201d</p><p>Skylar watched him, chattering away to his daughter like it was an everyday occurrence. Her emotions shifted from jealousy to relief to flat-out amusement. The man was a goner for Miss Eliza Belle. He\u2019d taken to her faster than Sky ever imagined.</p><p>\u201cIs she always this good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sky glanced at the clock. \u201cGive her an hour. She gets really fussy around dinnertime. And then right before bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep her entertained if you wanna eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does have a baby bouncer. You don\u2019t have to hold her all the time.\u201d</p><p>Kade\u2019s eyes met hers. \u201cI wanna hold her. You\u2019re gonna have a devil of a time gettin\u2019 her away from me.\u201d When Skylar balked, he amended, \u201cThat didn\u2019t come out right. What I meant was...I\u2019m just pretty much stunned by her. Not only that I didn\u2019t know she existed, but if it\u2019ll ever sink in that she\u2019s really mine. And I\u2019m responsible for her for the rest of her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a daunting concept, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I really haven\u2019t been around babies all that much, if you wanna know the truth, so I\u2019m gonna need your help.\u201d</p><p>Skylar expected gruffness, not Kade to act as bewildered and awestruck as she\u2019d been. She touched his forearm, offering him reassurance \u201cGive yourself more than a day to process it all, Kade. I had six months to get used to the idea of a baby, while she was growing inside me. You\u2019ve had six hours. The more time you spend with her, the easier it\u2019ll get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trust me with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t. Besides, I didn\u2019t know all that much about babies either. To some extent, it is instinctive. Only way to learn is by doing.\u201d</p><p>Sky sidestepped him and wandered to the kitchen, shocked at how easy it was to leave Kade with their daughter.</p><p>He\u2019d cleaned the counters and washed dishes. A pot of chili simmered on the stove.</p><p>A round bakery box with a chocolate frosted cake sat in the middle of the table. She sagged against the doorway. He\u2019d remembered her favorite dessert.</p><p>Dammit. It\u2019d be easier to keep this situation impersonal if he was a complete dickhead.</p><p>Impersonal. Right. A little too late for that. They had a child. The man had proposed to her not four hours ago. Apparently, he\u2019d moved in. And apparently, she didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>She expelled a heavy sigh and muttered, \u201cMaybe I should\u2019ve just said yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe offer still stands, Skylar.\u201d</p><p>His deep voice next to her ear sent a shiver through her. \u201cYou scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Did he mean he knew sneaking up on her scared her? Or was he talking about his marriage proposal? Rather than dig herself into a hole, she bit back the demand for clarification.</p><p>During dinner she shared the abbreviated version of her pregnancy and Eliza\u2019s birth while Kade pored over the pictures and information in the baby book. When Eliza began to fuss, Skylar taught him how to mix formula, how to warm a cold bottle and how to test the temperature. After he finished feeding Eliza, Sky tossed him a spit-up rag and instructed him on burping.</p><p>Kade listened so attentively Skylar half-expected him to whip out a notebook and jot down notes. It didn\u2019t faze him when Eliza barfed all over him. Changing a diaper didn\u2019t make him turn green. He walked the floor until Eliza fell asleep in his arms, and he still wouldn\u2019t relinquish his hold on her.</p><p>\u201cSeriously. Put her in the bassinet. She\u2019ll nap for an hour and then she\u2019ll want to eat again before she\u2019s out for the night. Or part of the night. She still doesn\u2019t sleep straight through.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Kade laid Eliza on her back in the bassinet, tucked a blanket around her and flopped on the opposite end of the couch.</p><p>He expelled a long slow breath. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>She waited, half-afraid/half-curious about how this\u2019d play out.</p><p>A beat passed. \u201cFirst off, I wouldn\u2019t have taken the job if I woulda known you were pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have done? I didn\u2019t find out until the end of November. By then I was a little more than three months along. And I did call your parents\u2019 house to talk to you. I had no idea what I should do when your brother said you\u2019d be out of touch until the following summer.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cYou talked to Kane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriefly. I wasn\u2019t comfortable having him pass on the message about your impending fatherhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you kept the information to yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other choice did I have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat choice did you have? Jesus, Sky, that\u2019s the problem. You seem to think you get to make all the choices and keep all the control in this relationship. You have since day one.\u201d Kade shoved a hand through his hair. \u201cI\u2019ll admit I made a mistake in not tellin\u2019 you I wasn\u2019t Kane. But you cut me off without lettin\u2019 me explain my side of things.\u201d</p><p>She bristled. \u201cYou pretended to be someone else. I slept with you thinking you were Kane. How is that my fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least we agree on that point.\u201d</p><p>Kade sighed. \u201cSkylar. I don\u2019t wanna fight with you.\u201d</p><p>When it occurred to her he\u2019d used the word relationship, she looked at him oddly.</p><p>He stared right back, completely nonplussed. \u201cDoes anyone ever mix you up with your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Even before India became the tattooed woman we weren\u2019t hard to tell apart.</p><p>Different eye color, facial structure, body type.\u201d India was lean and muscular and sometimes Skylar resented that she\u2019d been cursed with a rounder, womanly physique, but they were easily distinguishable from one another.</p><p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t an excuse, but you don\u2019t have any idea how that feels. Not only am I saddled with an identical twin, but we also look just like our other McKay cousins in three counties. Some folks act as if we\u2019re all interchangeable. So I\u2019ve heard \u2018one of them McKay twins\u2019 or \u2018one of those wild McKay boys\u2019 my whole life. Seems I don\u2019t have an identity beyond my last name. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMight sound stupid, but I\u2019d convinced myself that for once, the name I had, the name you knew me by, didn\u2019t matter, because you were interested in the man inside.</p><p>Yeah, I realize it was dumb. But I didn\u2019t have any idea on how to go about making it right back then.\u201d</p><p>She waited, unsure of where he was going with this and unsure of how she\u2019d respond.</p> <p>Kade reached for her hand. \u201cExcept I can make it right now. Let\u2019s start over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never too late. Come on. I\u2019ll go first.\u201d He formally shook her hand. \u201cHowdy, little lady. I\u2019m Kade McKay.\u201d</p><p>Skylar laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou shore are purty. Anyone ever told you that you have a beautiful laugh? Like bluebells in springtime.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou maybe wanna go out with me sometime?\u201d He grinned and gave her an exaggerated wiggle of his eyebrows. \u201cOr do you just wanna skip all that normal datin\u2019 stuff and have my baby?\u201d</p><p>She laughed again. It\u2019d been a long time since she\u2019d made that carefree sound. She\u2019d forgotten how Kade had tried to cajole her out of a mood during their dates, if she\u2019d had a stressful day at the office. Not only was he sweet, he was the rare person who could make her laugh. She squeezed their joined hands. \u201cYou goof-ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d He tugged her until she fell across his lap. His arms came around her, keeping her close. \u201cYou looked like you could use a hug.\u201d</p><p>She twisted her neck to gape at him. \u201cYou remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember everything. I had nothin\u2019 but time to think about it. All of it.\u201d</p> <p>Even when her mouth said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a good idea,\u201d Sky\u2019s attempt to squirm away was half-hearted at best.</p><p>\u201cRelax. I ain\u2019t gonna maul you. We\u2019ll be less apt to argue if we\u2019re close like this.</p><p>Plus, if I have hold of your hand, you won\u2019t be tempted to take a swing at me, since rumor has it you\u2019re a fighter.\u201d</p><p>She wondered where he\u2019d heard that. Did she have a reputation around town as a hard-nosed business woman? Cold, efficient and emotionless? No matter, for now, she\u2019d let him soothe her with simple human contact, just for a minute or two.</p><p>\u201cYou take Eliza to work with you every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s usually pretty good and it helps I can set my own hours. I try to keep us both on a daily schedule. If I have to be on a conference call, or meet with salespeople and distributors, I can leave her with the onsite daycare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have onsite daycare at Sky Blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the one thing I insisted on. The women working for me all have kids. Since a large chunk of their paychecks would go for childcare, I set up an area onsite and have them care for each other\u2019s children so they can keep every penny they earn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSmart. But how\u2019s that work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI opted to have all employees rotate all positions. It cuts down on training time, since they are trained on every job. Every six days they rotate from the factory into the daycare. So even if someone is sick, we won\u2019t get behind on production because another employee can step in and do her job. Plus, it is a load off their minds that their kids are close by, and well-cared for, which in the long run means steady productivity and happier employees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many people work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have six full-time employees in the factory. One woman who helps me with office work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you have a waitin\u2019 list a mile long for potential employees, if any one of those women would be foolish enough to quit workin\u2019 for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that I\u2019m a mother, I know I made the right decision in setting up the business the way I did.\u201d</p><p>Kade was quiet. \u201cSo when it rolls around to quittin\u2019 time, you drive up the road and spend your nights carin\u2019 for Eliza? After bein\u2019 with her all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEliza isn\u2019t a burden, Kade, she\u2019s everything to me. I never knew I could...love someone that much.\u201d Her voice dropped. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m so overwhelmed by her, by what a perfect little being she is and how much she\u2019s become my life...\u201d Sky was still stunned every day by how much Eliza\u2019s birth changed her as a person. Now Kade was here, giving her the opportunity to bare all the emotions she\u2019d kept inside about how their miracle \u201coops\u201d was the best thing that\u2019d ever happened to her.</p><p>Would he understand? Or did it just make her seem pathetic that she had no one else to talk to? Especially when she knew he had support from his huge family?</p><p>Sure, Sky could spill her guts to India; God knew she\u2019d listened to India\u2019s issues for years. But India had already provided tons of emotional support during Sky\u2019s pregnancy and Eliza\u2019s birth. It seemed cruel to wax poetic about the sheer joys of motherhood and her beautiful baby considering the heartbreak India had suffered through a few years back. As much as Sky appreciated and genuinely liked her employees, there was a line of propriety between worker and boss she didn\u2019t feel comfortable crossing. Between setting up her business and birthing Eliza, she hadn\u2019t had much opportunity to get to know other women in the community or to make friends.</p><p>Did she just want friendship from Kade McKay?</p><p>\u201cSkylar? What\u2019s goin\u2019 on in that pretty head?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Emotional soup. Wanna bite? Sometimes it\u2019s hot; sometimes it\u2019s cold.</p><p>Kade turned her around to face him. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I had a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do now.\u201d He caressed her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll be here every night as soon as I finish up on the ranch. I ain\u2019t gonna let you do this alone any more.\u201d</p><p>Might make her a fool, but she wanted to believe him. She wanted to throw herself in his arms and weep with gratitude. But blind faith had caused more problems in her life than self-reliance, so she kept her shield of skepticism intact. \u201cJust like that? No arguing?</p><p>You\u2019re just accepting this? Accepting her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His thumb traced the dark circles she knew were visible beneath her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo doubt Eliza is my child. She\u2019s my responsibility. In my mind, that means you are, too. Believe me, that isn\u2019t a burden either.\u201d</p><p>Rational thought vanished when he touched her. His sweetly spoken heartfelt words, his gentle caress, the warmth in his eyes packed an emotional punch and she didn\u2019t attempt to dodge the blow.</p><p>Then the look in Kade\u2019s eyes changed from comfort to pure male sexual power. His thumb moved down and swept across her bottom lip. Over and over. Making it softer.</p><p>Wetter. He didn\u2019t say a word; he didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>Her mind screamed retreat. She felt the shift in him and tried to stop her body from answering in kind. His breath fanned across her cheek in an erotic stroke of heat. No man had ever looked at her the way he did. It scared the living crap out of her; it always had.</p><p>She tried to scramble away, but he clamped his hand around her upper thigh.</p><p>\u201cLet me speak my piece before you run off. This isn\u2019t what I came here for. But there\u2019s been a hot spark between us since the day we met. I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m gonna deny it\u2019s happenin\u2019 again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDenial would be easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe for you. Not for me. Never for me. I pretended with you once. I won\u2019t do it again. Ever.\u201d Then he released her, and walked out of the room.</p><p>Nice going, McKay. Tell her you\u2019re not going to maul her and what\u2019s the first thing you do?</p><p>Growl and go all Big Bad Wolf on her.</p><p>Christ. He was an idiot. One touch, one hopeful, coquettish look from Sky and he morphed into a horny toad. Kade inhaled several deep breaths and stared out the window above the sink.</p><p>His feelings for Skylar hadn\u2019t changed. Things had gone to hell between them last summer before he\u2019d mustered up the guts to confess he\u2019d fallen for her. Hard. And judging by the way she was acting, she wouldn\u2019t welcome any declaration of his feelings or his intent. At least not right now. Seemed he had no choice but to hang back and let this play out at her pace, not his. Luckily he was a patient man.</p><p>Calmer, Kade grabbed a bottle from the refrigerator. Eliza would be up soon, he may as well get ready to feed her.</p><p>Soft footsteps stopped behind him.</p><p>Kade spun around. \u201cLook. I\u2019m sorry. I touched you like I had a right to. I don\u2019t. The last thing I want is to make you uncomfortable in your own house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s forget it, okay? Chalk it up to being a stressful day. I\u2019m going upstairs to get your room ready. Eliza is still down here in the bassinet. Will you listen for her to wake up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Where am I sleepin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the guest bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere does Eliza usually sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s gonna be a problem when I get up with her in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it won\u2019t be. I\u2019ll just deal with the night feedings and get up with her like I always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you will. I\u2019m here to care for our child. That means day and night. If she sleeps in your room, so do I.\u201d</p><p>Skylar looked petrified for a moment before she regained her composure. \u201cFunny, McKay. You had me going there for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t kiddin\u2019.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest, knew it looked belligerent and didn\u2019t care. \u201cI\u2019d be fine if you moved her crib into the guest bedroom with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut all her stuff is in my room. I hadn\u2019t planned to decorate and put her into her own room for at least another month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019d be smart to keep her right where she is, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She blinked with the same owl-eyed expression Eliza had earlier. \u201cSo what you\u2019re saying, is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears you and I are gonna be roomies, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.

Right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how hard can it be?\u201d</p><p>The look on Skylar\u2019s face was priceless. He knew she wasn\u2019t convinced it\u2019d be no big deal having him in her bed.</p><p>And that\u2019s exactly what Kade was counting on.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Two weeks later...</p><p>\u201cWah. Wah. Wah.\u201d Pause. \u201cWaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.\u201d</p><p>Skylar groaned and rolled toward the edge of the bed. \u201cHang on, baby. I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>Kade placed his hand on her shoulder. \u201cStay put. I\u2019ll get her. Go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>She mumbled, \u201cThanks.\u201d The minute he was out of bed, she sprawled in the middle of the mattress and snagged his pillow.</p><p>What a bed hog.</p><p>\u201cWah. Wah. Wah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, child. Them lungs work fine at four in the mornin\u2019, don\u2019t they?\u201d Kade murmured, scooping Eliza out of her crib. He skirted the footboard and snuck out of the room.</p><p>Downstairs in the kitchen, he kept the lights dimmed as he reheated a bottle. Eliza rooted against his chest, making angry snuffing sounds. He brushed his lips across the top of her head, inhaling her sweet baby scent, rocking her back and forth. \u201cI know. Poor starvin\u2019 girl.\u201d</p><p>The timer dinged. Kade plucked the bottle from the pan, tested the temperature, shifted Eliza into the crook of his arm and popped the nipple in her mouth. Greedy sucking noises echoed in the quiet house as he headed for the rocking chair in the dark living room.</p><p>After he set the rocker in motion, he closed his eyes. He was tired. The third time he\u2019d been up with their fussy baby in so many hours. Usually he and Sky took turns, but the last two nights Eliza hadn\u2019t slept for more than an hour at a stretch. Didn\u2019t help Sky said Eliza wasn\u2019t napping during the day. She screamed bloody murder any time Skylar wasn\u2019t holding her, so Skylar had fallen behind at work.</p> <p>When Kade returned from a long day at the ranch, Sky passed Eliza off to him and snuck back to the office for a few hours. He\u2019d gotten into the habit of dozing when Eliza did, as it was his only chance for a little rest. How had Sky done this by herself for three months?</p><p>No matter. The important thing was Sky trusted him with Eliza. His darling Eliza\u2019s immediate and unconditional acceptance of him was damn humbling too. It filled him with pride that both mother and daughter had begun to rely on him, to need him, and it amazed him how quickly he, Sky and Eliza created a family routine.</p><p>So as exhausting as the past two weeks had proven, Kade didn\u2019t remember ever being so content.</p><p>He sure as hell didn\u2019t remember ever being so horny.</p><p>Damn. If he wasn\u2019t thinking about formula and diapers, or wondering how loud his daughter could howl, or what he wouldn\u2019t give for a full night\u2019s sleep, his thoughts focused on sex. Hot sex. Slow sex. Fast sex. Nasty, dirty, raunchy sex. Sweet vanilla sex.</p><p>Any type of sex, really. He\u2019d gone for long stretches without it in the past. When he tired of his own fist as a partner, he\u2019d find a willing woman to scratch the itch. Problem solved.</p><p>Now the problem was Kade couldn\u2019t fathom having sex with anyone besides Skylar.</p><p>Fearful of her rejection, he hadn\u2019t the balls to make the first move.</p><p>What the fuck had he been thinking, promising that gentleman crap? He didn\u2019t want to be her goddamn \u201cparenting partner\u201d\u2014he wanted to be her lover. The sexiest woman on the planet lay beside him, mere inches away, every night. Warming the sheets with her body heat. Surrounding him with her alluring scent so he couldn\u2019t breathe without thinking of her. And to make his descent into lust complete, the standoffish Skylar had started...snuggling up to him in her sleep.</p><p>Oh, she wasn\u2019t aware of spooning her body to his. She wasn\u2019t aware she hummed contentedly before drifting off. But he was aware. Acutely aware. Painfully aware.</p><p>Still, Kade never touched her. His hands ached from squeezing them into tight fists.</p><p>Some nights his cock was so hard he couldn\u2019t sleep, yet he couldn\u2019t force himself away.</p><p>He\u2019d close his eyes and breathe her in.</p><p>On those rare occasions Eliza let them rest for a few hours, Kade imagined waking Skylar with hot kisses. Peeling away the baby doll pajamas she favored. Running his hands down her long, slender throat, between her full breasts and over her belly, until his fingers brushed the curls covering her sex.</p><p>She\u2019d dreamily whisper, \u201cPlease,\u201d in the darkness as she opened her legs for his touch. With his mouth busy on her neck, or his tongue tasting her nipples, his fingers grew damp and sticky from her arousal. He\u2019d slide in and out of that sweet heat, deeper, faster, sweeping the pad of his thumb over her clit, building her excitement. When he sent her soaring over the edge, he\u2019d clamp his mouth over hers and swallow her cries as he mounted her.</p><p>He\u2019d stare into her eyes, pushing his cock into her, an inch at a time while she was still coming. Kade would fuck her with painstaking precision, keeping her teetering on the brink of another orgasm. She\u2019d whimper for more; he\u2019d deny her, keeping her body pinned beneath his. When he allowed her to climax, she\u2019d moan his name. He\u2019d ram into her, coming hard enough to leave them both gasping, sweaty, fucking her so completely she\u2019d never mix him up with another man again.</p><p>Tame, as far as fantasies went, but damn perfect in his mind.</p><p>He glanced at Eliza. She\u2019d finally crashed. He removed the bottle from her milk-slackened mouth and carefully repositioned her on his shoulder. Two pats on her back and she belched.</p><p>Wearily, Kade rose out of the rocking chair and climbed the stairs.</p><p>The bed dipped and Skylar rolled to her side.</p><p>\u201cShe asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. I\u2019m good at a lot of other things too.\u201d</p><p>The next thing she knew, the bedcovers were flung back and his hot, naked body was pressed against hers.</p><p>\u201cKade, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>He sank his teeth into the curve of her shoulder and her whole body shuddered.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t. I\u2019m dyin\u2019 to touch you, Sky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Eliza\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs sleepin\u2019. We\u2019re not. Maybe we oughta take advantage of that fact.\u201d</p><p>Rough hands skated from her collarbone down to her hip. His warm mouth left a trail of kisses up the back of her neck and his breath stirred her hair, making her shiver.</p><p>Making her realize how long it\u2019d been since she\u2019d felt this rush of need.</p><p>\u201cLemme make you feel good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKade\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh.\u201d Then he shifted so she was lying on top of him. Her back plastered to his immense chest. Her legs layered over his, the coarse hair and rougher skin of his thighs tickled the backside of her knees. Her arms were stretched high above her head. He\u2019d nestled his erect cock in the crack of her ass, lengthwise between her butt cheeks. A low, sexy chuckle burned her ear. \u201cKinda like a hot dog fittin\u2019 into a bun, huh?\u201d</p><p>She groaned softly at his strangely voiced observation and gave up any pretense of resistance. His callused hands traced her arms from her wrists, down past her elbows, over her biceps until his big palms cupped her breasts. He strummed her nipples with the pads of his thumbs while kissing the slope of her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI love your tits. So soft and round. Perfect for my hands and mouth. For buryin\u2019 my face in. Suckin\u2019 \u2019em for hours until you come.\u201d</p><p>Skylar turned her head to try and kiss him.</p><p>\u201cAh-ah-ah.\u201d Kade flattened his hands and dragged them oh-so-slowly down her belly to her hips. The first two fingers on his right hand breached her curls, and slipped down her slit to plunge inside her sex.</p><p>She hissed.</p><p>He stroked her several times, each thrust deeper, each thrust bypassed her clit.</p><p>\u201cTouch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d He sucked on the spot behind her ear that made her head swim. \u201cMaybe you oughta point out exactly where you want me touchin\u2019 you.\u201d Kade reached for her right arm, placing his palm over the top of her hand, gliding their joined hands down her torso to rest on the top of her pubic bone. \u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>Skylar pushed their joined fingers inside her pussy, pumping in and out, coating all four digits with her wetness. \u201cYou do that,\u201d she said, leaving his fingers. She slid her hand up, placing her middle finger on her clit, rubbing in circles, making sure he could feel her every movement. \u201cWhile I do this.\u201d Sky never remembered being so bold. So brazen. So confident with her sexuality.</p><p>Kade created a rhythm, setting her whole body tingling with anticipation. Then he tilted his pelvis slightly and his cock slid in her crack as he fucked her pussy with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cOh. That feels...good. Really good.\u201d She rubbed her finger faster over that engorged nub. Sweat made their bodies slippery. The room was filled with the sounds of skin scraping on fabric, heavy breathing, and a slight squeak of the bedframe.</p><p>\u201cClench your cheeks.\u201d Kade\u2019s beard rasped over her arched neck as he drove his fingers deeper and rolled his hips. \u201cCome on, darlin\u2019, bear down. Squeeze me hard.\u201d</p><p>Her internal muscles clamped around his thrusting fingers. Her butt cheeks tightening around his cock set off an orgasmic chain reaction, traveling from her pussy to the top of her ass crack and she moaned, \u201cYes, like that. Please, deeper.\u201d</p><p>The tip of his cock jerked, coating the small of her back with sticky warmth and he swore a blue streak in her ear.</p><p>She flung her arm over her eyes, rocking into him, slowing the strokes on her clit to prolong the moment. The blast of pleasure roared in her head, blocking out all sound but her stuttered gasps of orgasmic bliss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kade heard Skylar thrashing around in bed before he opened the door to peek inside.</p><p>It took a second for his head to decipher the images his eyes were relaying.</p><p>Skylar was in the middle of the bed. Pajama bottoms off. Her left forearm draped across her eyes. Her right hand stroking madly between her legs as she climaxed.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>He waited. If he burst in now she\u2019d probably die of embarrassment. But Kade realized Skylar wasn\u2019t aware of what she\u2019d been doing; she\u2019d been dreaming.</p><p>Jesus. Must\u2019ve been some damn good dream. What would he\u2019ve done if he\u2019d been in bed next to her when she indulged in a little self-love?</p><p>Woken her up and fucked her like a madman, convincing himself it was his way of making her dreams come true.</p><p>Kade paced the hallway a few more minutes before he snuck in and tucked Eliza in her crib. He stared at Skylar\u2019s half-naked body lolling on his side of the bed, in the ultimate pin-up girl pose. The ultimate temptation. No way could he crawl in there and not touch her. No way.</p><p>The clock blinked five a.m. Sun\u2019d be up soon. Might as well get an early start on his day. Right after he grabbed a shower.</p><p>A very cold shower.</p><p>Skylar was freezing. Disoriented, she sat up. At some point in the night she\u2019d whipped off the covers along with her pajama bottoms. Her gaze landed on Kade\u2019s empty side of the bed. Huh. She squinted at the crib and saw Eliza\u2019s dark head. Vaguely she remembered Kade getting up with the baby.</p><p>When?</p><p>And why in the world was she half-undressed? Carnal images bombarded her. Kade.</p><p>Stretching her out on top of him. Touching her. Bringing them both to a shuddering orgasm.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been a dream...had it?</p><p>The old pipes rattled, signaling Kade was in the shower. Why was he up so early?</p><p>Probably washing up after he came all over your back and his belly.</p><p>Her hand flew to the base of her spine. Dry. Not sticky. She patted the bed behind her. Warm. Not wet.</p><p>Not real. A dream.</p><p>Why did disappointment jab her in the gut?</p><p>Because you\u2019re too much of a chickenshit to admit Kade McKay turns you on beyond reason. And the last thing you want is a gentleman in your bed; you\u2019d prefer a wild man.</p><p>Not her first raunchy dream starring the hot rancher. She still remembered the hot dream from last week where he\u2019d stripped her naked, shoved her to her knees, and bound her wrists behind her back with a soft leather strap. Then Kade\u2019s hands impatiently twisted in her hair as his cock shuttled in and out of her mouth. Saliva poured down her chin, between her bared breasts, trickling down her belly to mix with the wetness glazing her inner thighs.</p> <p>Kade recited a play-by-play in that husky voice of how sexy that she was submissive before him, never allowing her a choice of what he expected from her. But even in the dream she\u2019d been greedy, lost in the slick feel of his cock rubbing over her tongue, scraping against the roof of her mouth, stretching her lips as she sucked hard enough to make him lose his mind.</p><p>And rather than give her the prize she\u2019d earned, he denied her his taste, pulling out as he climaxed, coming on her chest in long creamy spurts. His eyes glittered with satisfaction as his seed dripped off her hard nipples.</p><p>In the next dreamscape, she was blindfolded, straddling his thighs on a kitchen chair\u2014he\u2019d immobilized her hands with a thick rope. Kade fucked her slowly, sucking and biting her nipples, driving her insane with the heat and wetness of his mouth. Sky was on track to the most explosive orgasm of her life when she woke up.</p><p>Maddening. How sad was it that not only was she sexually frustrated in real life, but in her dreams too? And what was up with her kinky bondage fantasies?</p><p>She\u2019d never get back to sleep now. She shimmied into her pajama bottoms and scooted off the bed. After checking on Eliza, she crept down the hallway.</p><p>The bathroom door was ajar. Odd. Kade always closed it. Maybe she should see if he was okay.</p><p>See if he wants coffee.</p><p>See if he\u2019s naked.</p><p>See if he needs a towel.</p><p>Screw the towel. See if he needs you to lick the moisture off every square inch of his wet, ripped body.</p><p>Sky eased the door open. Rather than startle him by shouting over the sounds of running water, she\u2019d wait until he shut off the taps.</p><p>The clear shower curtain, dotted with red umbrellas and yellow ducks, offered very little coverage. Thank the shower curtain gods for that bit of foresight.</p><p>Speaking of gods... Man. She\u2019d never seen Kade completely bare-assed. She\u2019d seen him half-dressed in cut-offs and tight T-shirts. Lately he\u2019d strolled around bare-chested.</p><p>But she\u2019d never witnessed him wearing nothing but his skin.</p><p>Which was a damn crying shame.</p><p>He\u2019d braced his left forearm on the wall below the showerhead. Water streamed over his dark hair, dripping on the chiseled lines of his face. Rivulets trickled down the back of his neck, disappearing into the indentation of his spine. A few water droplets beaded on his muscular shoulders. Soapy drops flew off his wrist and splattered against the shower curtain.</p><p>Her gaze was drawn downward as his hips pushed forward. The muscles on his right side were strung tight, bunching and flexing with each movement of his arm. The long, thick muscle between his legs was clutched in his fist. His hand moved rapidly.</p><p>Rhythmically.</p><p>Oh wow. Kade was jacking off. Right in front of her. He was so intent on the task at hand he hadn\u2019t noticed her.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>She should leave, sneak out, forget she\u2019d stumbled upon such an intimate moment.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t tear her eyes away from him, lost in self-pleasure. It was the sexiest thing she\u2019d ever witnessed, the contour of his brawny body tensed in anticipation.</p><p>Hearing his indecipherable mutters as his hand flew faster and faster over his cock.</p><p>Her heartbeat spiked. Blood pulsed in her throat, and her nipples, but mostly between her legs.</p><p>The scent of lemon sage soap and steam and Kade swirled around her until she was dizzy with want. Why couldn\u2019t she climb in with him and finish the job? Using her hands, her body, her mouth to bring him over the edge?</p><p>Just as she\u2019d decided to doff her pajamas, Kade\u2019s neck arched. A low grunt bounced off the tiled walls and his movement slowed. Water beat on his face as he stilled and savored his orgasm.</p><p>Talk about sexy. But not nearly as sexy as when Kade said her name. Startled, her eyes zoomed back to his profile, expecting to be busted for her voyeurism. But Kade\u2019s eyes were squeezed shut. He\u2019d said her name, not because he\u2019s seen her, but because he\u2019d been thinking of her as he\u2019d masturbated.</p><p>Sexual need like she\u2019d never experienced dimmed her vision and thickened her blood.</p><p>Maybe the gentleman was a wild man.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019s exactly the kind of man you need.</p><p>Maybe you should quit dreaming and supposing and just flat-out ask him.</p><p>Skylar slipped out as quietly as possible.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t complainin\u2019 about bein\u2019 tied down with a kid and all that shit now?\u201d</p><p>Tied down. As if. Eliza had turned his world upside down, but she hung the moon and the stars as far as Kade was concerned. He was absolutely head over heels for his little Miz Eliza Belle Ellison McKay. Thinking about her sweet face, big inquisitive eyes, toothless grin and plump cheeks filled him with so much pride and love, he was damn close to bursting out in song.</p><p>\u201cNo complaints,\u201d Kade said.</p><p>\u201cReally? So how\u2019s diaper duty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t any worse than shovelin\u2019 hot cow shit.\u201d</p><p>Kane snorted. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>His brother\u2019s sarcastic comments about Eliza were getting tiresome. Kade rested his forearm across the posthole digger handle and tried to rein in his temper. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. Why you always sayin\u2019 shit like that, Kane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you oughta be askin\u2019 why you\u2019re so touchy about it. I can\u2019t say nothin\u2019 lately without you bitin\u2019 off my head, bro.\u201d Kane continued to fiddle with the coil of barbed wire and wouldn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Maybe I am a little touchy \u2019cause my only brother can\u2019t be bothered to drive sixty miles down the road to meet my baby daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t good with babies,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>Kade hadn\u2019t been either up until about two weeks ago. \u201cLook. I ain\u2019t gonna make you change her diaper.\u201d</p><p>Kane\u2019s mouth twitched.</p><p>\u201cBut I would like you to see her. Next to her mama, she\u2019s the prettiest thing in the whole world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI reckon she probably is. But you ever think it might not be the best idea for me to see her? Or for her to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidja hit yourself in the head with a hammer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause you ain\u2019t makin\u2019 a lick of sense.\u201d</p><p>Kane squinted at him. \u201cYeah? Did it escape your notice in the year you\u2019ve been gone that we\u2019re identical twins? That havin\u2019 two men who both look like daddy might be confusin\u2019 to her?\u201d</p><p>Hell. That hadn\u2019t occurred to him.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re bondin\u2019 with her, or whatever you wanna call it, and it\u2019d be just my luck if I\u2019d fuck it up somehow. I done that once with you and her mama. I ain\u2019t lookin\u2019 to do it again.\u201d</p><p>Kade had no idea how to answer. For once his brother had brought up a valid point.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your honesty. But it wasn\u2019t your fault I never came clean with Skylar about me not bein\u2019 you. I pissed away my chances to tell her and I gotta live with my stupidity.\u201d</p><p>A couple of minutes passed where the only sounds were bugs and birds and the grinding chink of tools against hard-packed soil.</p><p>A heartfelt sigh drifted up from where Kane worked in the dirt. \u201cDidja ever wonder why Ma named us Kane and Kade? Jesus. It ain\u2019t bad enough hardly anyone can tell us apart? We gotta have names that are damn close to identical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I wondered that. But neither of us has balls enough to ask the blonde tornado just what she was thinkin\u2019 when she popped out a matched set,\u201d Kade said wryly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrue.

Good thing Eliza ain\u2019t expectin\u2019 me to be a brilliant talker.\u201d</p><p>Kane clipped a section of wire. \u201cWhat about Skylar? Does she expect that from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell knows?\u201d Frustrated, Kade pounded his foot against the metal jaws of the posthole digger. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about nothin\u2019 except Eliza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s to be expected, ain\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. But it\u2019s been a few weeks since I moved in. I thought since I was up with the baby last night that Sky would be rested and we could talk about something else this mornin\u2019. But after I got out of the shower, she\u2019d already made up the bed. When I tried\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhoa whoa whoa.\u201d Kane held up a gloved hand. \u201cYou said she made the bed? As in\u2014you\u2019re sharin\u2019 a bed with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, man, why are you worried about talkin\u2019 if you\u2019re already nailin\u2019 her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not nailin\u2019 her, okay?\u201d</p><p>A stunned look crossed Kane\u2019s face and then he laughed so hard he fell over on the ground.</p><p>When Kade suffered enough of his brother\u2019s hysterics, he said, \u201cIt ain\u2019t funny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, it is. Jesus, Kade. The last year turned you into a Wyoming monk? You\u2019ve been sleepin\u2019 in the same damn bed with Skylar, the woman you have a child with, the woman you\u2019ve been crazy in love with for over a year, and you haven\u2019t tried to get busy with her? Not even once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the thought of screwin\u2019 her with the baby in the room...give you performance anxiety or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you mean, performance anxiety? No. I don\u2019t have any problem gettin\u2019 it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes havin\u2019 the baby listenin\u2019 to you squeakin\u2019 the bedframe freak her out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is just plain sad, man. Sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assumin\u2019 you still want her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t fuckin\u2019 believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why would you throw in the towel so soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d Kade kicked a clod of dirt into the ditch. \u201cI promised Sky I\u2019d be a gentleman. At first I needed to be in her room to learn how to take care of Eliza. I thought maybe after Sky got used to me bein\u2019 around and I rebuilt her trust, things might change.</p><p>We\u2019d use the bed for more than sleepin\u2019. Nothin\u2019s changed. I\u2019m waitin\u2019 on her to give me some kinda damn sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s your problem. Waitin\u2019 on her. Actin\u2019 like a lap dog, happy for scraps.\u201d</p><p>Kane stood and jammed the wire cutters in his back pocket. \u201cSee, women tell you they want a gentleman, when in reality, they want a man to take charge. Sexually speakin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear me out. A woman wants a man who can\u2019t keep their hands offa them. A man who can make them feel feminine, sexy and needed. Desired, but not in a way that diminishes their independence outside the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>He stared at Kane with his mouth hanging open. What\u2019d gotten into his brother?</p><p>Kane was worse than him when it came to talking about touchy-feely relationship crap.</p><p>Kane never thought about man/woman shit beyond the locker room trash-talking of, \u201cI fucked her\u201d or, \u201cI wanna fuck her\u201d or, \u201cIs she any good with her mouth?\u201d</p><p>Now Kane was channeling Dr. Phil? It shocked Kade to the point of speechlessness, leaving him no choice but to take note of his brother\u2019s opinion.</p><p>\u201cTake a woman like Skylar, who\u2019s used to callin\u2019 all the shots in her life,\u201d Kane continued, oblivious to Kade\u2019s shock. \u201cShe\u2019s ambitious. She\u2019s convinced herself she always has to be in charge\u2014of her business, of her family, and probably of her sexuality.\u201d</p><p>A strange sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu surfaced. That described Skylar to a T.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s secretly lookin\u2019 for man to render decisions in the bedroom. So, by you doin\u2019 nothin\u2019, she don\u2019t see you as a real man. She sees you as another person in her life she has to be responsible for.\u201d</p><p>Lord. He had a point. Sky\u2019d been teaching him how to care for Eliza, much like how she\u2019d taught her employees to do their jobs. Did she see him as just another project to finish? Get him up to speed in the parenting department and then merrily skip on to the next task?</p><p>Like hell.</p><p>\u201cI think the only way you can combat Skylar\u2019s way of thinkin\u2019 is to prove to her otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Kane actually blushed. \u201cWhat? Everybody in this family wants me to change and then when I do, I\u2019m told I ain\u2019t allowed to? Or they don\u2019t believe I can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Sorry. I just can\u2019t believe that Skylar would...\u201d Want the man Kade used to be. That idea was just beyond bizarre.</p><p>But worth a shot since nothing else seemed to be working.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you pick all this up, Kane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of time to reflect in the last year about what a first-class prick I\u2019ve been to women.\u201d He bristled as if the admission stung. \u201cBesides. It ain\u2019t all my fault.</p><p>Blame my roommate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Colt got to do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince our cousin quit drinkin\u2019, he\u2019s been doin\u2019 some soul searchin\u2019. Always bringin\u2019 home them self-help books. I ain\u2019t got nothin\u2019 better to do, so I\u2019ve been readin\u2019 up. Hopin\u2019 if I meet a woman I really like, I won\u2019t be an idiot and blow it like you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d Kane punched him in the arm. Hard. \u201cI missed you, you dumb fucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes.\u201d He followed Kane\u2019s lead and punched him in the arm. Hard. \u201cSo what do I owe ya for the advice? A buck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuck.\u201d Kane rubbed the back of his glove under his chin. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s a downright good name. Real cowboy. Real different from yours. That\u2019s whatcha can call me from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Now let\u2019s get this fence fixed so you can go home early and fix your love life so I don\u2019t gotta hear about it any more.\u201d</p><p>Every woman in the factory stopped when Kade McKay sauntered into Sky Blue.</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter his boots were muddy, his Wranglers were dusty, his chambray shirt had dirt smears across the chest, or his hat looked as if he\u2019d sat on it before he\u2019d placed it on his head. The man took total command of the place.</p><p>Dee and Bonita checked their reflections in the metal vats, but Kade only had eyes for her.</p><p>Skylar forced herself to stay put as he meandered over. When he hit her with that sexy smile, her stomach cartwheeled.</p><p>\u201cHey, boss lady. How\u2019s it goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019re off the ranch early.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cA rare slow day. What about you? What time you callin\u2019 it quits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need any help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d He moved closer. \u201cAnything at all I can do for you?\u201d</p><p>For me? Or to me? Oh yeah, cowboy. Go to the house. Strip out of those dirty clothes and wait for me in bed. Naked. With a piece of straw between your teeth and that wicked I-wanna-bend-you-over-the-closest-haybale grin.</p><p>\u201cSkylar?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She stared up at him. Lord. He was so tall. So big and broad. So intent. So thoughtful. So freakin\u2019 hot. So...here.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t really know.\u201d</p><p>Kade ran the knuckle of his index finger down her jawline. \u201cYou feel fine to me\u2014</p><p>very, very fine, but maybe you oughta be in bed.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth went dry as powdered milk.</p><p>\u201cLet me take you to bed and take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Yes! \u201cAh. Okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat say we get out of here?\u201d His voice dropped to a sexy growl. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>Before Skylar could drag him home, forcing him to fulfill the promises darkening his eyes, Annie shouted from the office. \u201cSky. Yellow Wheel Promotions. Line two.\u201d</p><p>She backed up so fast Kade\u2019s hand shot out to steady her. \u201cEasy. Didn\u2019t mean to spook you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d Liar, liar. \u201cI-I have to take that call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just wait and have a look around. Do you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>Then Dee was right there. Grinning and batting her fake eyelashes. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to take you on a tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be my pleasure, yes-sirree, a real pleasure. You look awful familiar to me, honey,\u201d Dee cooed. \u201cHave we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks familiar, Dee, because his daughter looks just like him.\u201d</p><p>Kade shot her a startled glance.</p><p>Skylar couldn\u2019t withhold a smirk. \u201cThis is Eliza\u2019s father, Kade McKay. Kade, Dee Bancroft.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNice to meetcha, Miz Bancroft.\u201d</p><p>When Annie yelled, \u201cSky. Did you hear me? Line two,\u201d Skylar had no choice but to dump him with Dee.</p><p>Ten minutes later, she found Kade and Dee chatting in the herb drying room. He turned around at her approach. His heated I-wanna-eat-you-up look made her nipples hard and her belly clench. Then his handsome face lit up when he noticed Eliza was in her arms.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s my sweet girl.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of his voice, Eliza\u2019s tiny feet kicked.</p><p>His grin widened. \u201cDidja miss me, baby? You been behavin\u2019 for your mama today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sweet girl hasn\u2019t slept for more than fifteen minutes at a time all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that means she\u2019ll sleep all night for a change.\u201d He nuzzled Eliza\u2019s pudgy neck. \u201cWhich ain\u2019t fair because it\u2019s your night to be up with her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy night? I thought we were taking turns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too, sweetheart. But I took all the turns last night. You didn\u2019t move when I got out of bed. At midnight. At two. And at four.\u201d</p><p>Dee chuckled. \u201cOh. I get it now.\u201d Still smiling, she said, \u201cNadia wants to talk to you before you leave. She says it\u2019s important.\u201d Dee disappeared around the corner.</p><p>Skylar withheld a groan. She liked Nadia. She liked that Nadia wasn\u2019t afraid to talk to her when she kept her distance from everyone else. She liked that Nadia wasn\u2019t a drama queen. But it bugged the heck out of her Nadia was so fickle, and Sky didn\u2019t have to guess what Nadia wanted to talk to her about. Again.</p><p>\u201cLemme take Eliza home so you can get back to work.\u201d Kade lifted her from Skylar\u2019s arms. \u201cCome on, girlie. You and me gotta date with a warm bottle and a hot bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to drive my car? Or just take the car seat out of it?\u201d</p> <p>He frowned. \u201cI have a car seat in my truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince the day after I moved in. I bought one, figurin\u2019 it\u2019d be easier if we had two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask. You assumed. I\u2019m findin\u2019 you do that a lot with me, Skylar.\u201d His eyes met hers. \u201cSee you at home.\u201d</p><p>Why was everyone acting so weird today?</p><p>The second Sky returned to her office, Annie, a forty-something, no-nonsense native Wyoming cowgirl, descended on her like a rabid coyote. \u201cSo Eliza wasn\u2019t an immaculate conception as you\u2019d led all of us to believe?\u201d</p><p>Sky snorted.</p> <p>\u201cGranted, that spectacular hunk of a man is pretty damn close to god-like.\u201d</p><p>No argument here.</p><p>\u201cNot that he had eyes for anyone but you. Lord, with the hot way he was eatin\u2019 you up, we all thought he was gonna nail you right there in the main room next to the coffee pot.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks heated.</p><p>\u201cEliza\u2019s daddy is living with you, and you couldn\u2019t mention it to me? For godsake, you\u2019re sleeping with him and you\u2019ve kept it to yourself?\u201d</p><p>Damn. News traveled fast around here. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you are an idiot, Sky. A freakin\u2019 idiot.\u201d Annie tossed up her hands and stormed out.</p><p>What was wrong with everybody today?</p><p>Thirty minutes later Nadia knocked and Skylar motioned her in.</p><p>Dark-haired, dark-eyed Nadia was a refugee from Bosnia who\u2019d immigrated to the United States through a local church.</p><p>Last year during the interview process, Nadia had referred to herself as the perfect peasant. Ugly, stick-thin, strong as an ox, uneducated, and an \u201ceyes forward, no-talking\u201d</p><p>kind of worker. The description haunted Skylar, as did the occasional evidence of physical abuse on Nadia\u2019s arms and face.</p><p>Despite repeated attempts of her coworkers to convince Nadia to ditch her husband, and Nadia\u2019s promises to follow through with it, Nadia stayed with the abusive man. A sad fact of life in rural America. With the lack of financial and social resources, many women didn\u2019t have a choice but to stay in a bad relationship.</p><p>The whole situation worried Skylar, and quite frankly, she\u2019d nearly called the damn sheriff herself, but as Nadia\u2019s boss, she couldn\u2019t interfere. The one time she\u2019d approached Nadia to offer whatever support she\u2019d needed, the woman tearily told her to mind her own business. And as much as it pained her, Skylar had done as Nadia asked.</p><p>So far, Nadia\u2019s son, four-year-old Anton, hadn\u2019t shown signs of abuse and was a well-adjusted little boy who played well with the other kids in the daycare program.</p><p>Instead of standing in front of the desk like she was facing a firing squad as she usually did, Nadia paced. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Nadia? Dee said it was important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d She paced to the far wall and back. \u201cI like working here. It is good for Anton, it is good for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like having you here. I\u2019m not flattering you when I say you are a great employee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Nadia stopped and looked at Skylar with haunted eyes. \u201cWhen I\u2019m here I work hard.\u201d She clenched her hands at her sides. \u201cI need to ask you a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf my husband calls, I\u2019d like you to tell him I\u2019m not here.\u201d</p><p>A thick silence hung in the air.</p><p>Sky\u2019s stomach churned. How many times in the last year had Nadia asked for this favor? A dozen, probably. The very next day Nadia would recant her request, claim she\u2019d been stressed out or tired and she hadn\u2019t meant it. Then she\u2019d vehemently deny her husband had anything to do with her decision. Skylar had suffered through this type of wishy-washy behavior before with her sister. India promising to get clean. To get sober.</p><p>To stop using and abusing her body and take control of her life.</p><p>Nadia was in the same holding pattern. It might be cynical, but Sky didn\u2019t think this was the time Nadia would stick to her declaration either and she tried damn hard to keep the doubt out of her voice. \u201cI know you\u2019re a private person, Nadia, but honesty is necessary for me to understand what\u2019s going on. Why should I lie to Rex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m leaving him. For real this time. A friend is letting us stay with her. I need this job and this is the first place he\u2019ll try to find me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs happy as I am that you\u2019re taking a positive step, do you think he\u2019ll believe you just up and left town? Especially when he knows how much you like working here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks I hate this job.\u201d</p><p>That was a new twist. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Nadia thrust out her chin. \u201cIt\u2019s not true. I lied to him. In the last couple of weeks I started complaining to him about this place and how bad it\u2019d gotten. How I hated everyone who worked here. I even hinted I was looking around for something else and I\u2019d found another daycare for Anton.\u201d</p><p>Smart woman, laying the groundwork, but it made Sky absolutely sick that Nadia had to go to this much trouble to get out of a horrid, unsafe situation.</p><p>\u201cWhen he realizes we\u2019re gone, hopefully he\u2019ll think I\u2019ve moved to Denver. I told him I have cousins there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t have any friends there either, so there\u2019s no way he can trace me. Except through here.\u201d</p><p>Skylar stayed calm and professional even as she wanted to ask more detailed questions on why Nadia was convinced this outlandish ruse would work. She tapped the pen on her calculator, contemplating issues Nadia might not have considered, but ones that affected everyone in her employ. \u201cIs the woman who\u2019s hiding you out another employee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019d never ask that of someone or put such a burden on you. You\u2019ve been very good to me, which is why I hate to ask such a big thing. Again.\u201d</p><p>Helpless to say no, Sky said, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll inform Annie since she fields most of the phone calls. But you have to promise me one thing, Nadia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anything changes, if you decide to return home, or if he threatens you, you have to tell me right away. I can\u2019t be flying blind in this situation when I have a business to run and other employees\u2014including children\u2014to consider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise. But this time it\u2019s for real.\u201d</p><p>Sky wanted to ask what\u2019d happened to force the change. She wanted to know if Nadia had enough money. If Anton had his favorite toys. If Nadia was scared. However, Sky did none of that. It\u2019d make Nadia even more self-conscious and might make her reconsider her plan if Sky questioned it.</p><p>She pretended to squint at the clock when she was trying to hold it together and follow Nadia\u2019s lead, remaining brusque and businesslike. \u201cTen minutes until quitting time. Maybe you\u2019d better fill in your coworkers on what\u2019s going on before you take off.\u201d</p><p>Nadia nodded.</p><p>Just as Skylar took a breath and dropped the mask of hard-ass boss lady, Nadia stopped at the door and turned around.</p><p>\u201cThat man who was here earlier? Is he Eliza\u2019s father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wasn\u2019t he around before, when you were pregnant?\u201d</p><p>Wow. That was an intensely personal question from mind-your-own-business Nadia.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a long story and one I\u2019d rather not get into. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he reminds me of my husband. A stubborn cowboy. A big man who\u2019ll use his fists to prove himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKade is not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself. They\u2019re all like that,\u201d Nadia said, and slipped out the door, leaving Skylar in stunned silence.</p><p>An hour later, Skylar entered the quiet house. No sign of Eliza or Kade in the living room. Maybe they were napping upstairs.</p><p>She rooted around in the freezer and threw a boxed casserole in the microwave. She set the plates and silverware on the ruffled placemats and poured two glasses of tea.</p><p>The stairs creaked and a freshly showered Kade entered the kitchen with an empty bottle. \u201cShe\u2019s scrubbed, fed and sleepin\u2019. I ain\u2019t gonna claim sleepin\u2019 like a baby, \u2019cause I\u2019ve learned that sayin\u2019 is a total lie.

Dinner\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That looks mighty tasty. Thanks for cookin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Weren\u2019t they civilized and polite? What happened to the heated looks and his suggestion of taking her to bed? Why didn\u2019t he suggest they skip supper and head straight for dessert?</p> <p>Why don\u2019t you take a chance and tell him what\u2019s really on your mind?</p><p>Kade shoveled in a forkful of rice and chewed. \u201cThis is good. What\u2019s the spice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI added fresh savory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. That it is.\u201d</p><p>He ate. She ate. They finished the meal in uncomfortable silence.</p> <p>She started to clean up the dishes and declined his offer to help.</p><p>Finally, he said, \u201cYou gonna tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She slammed the cupboard door. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you at least give me the courtesy of lookin\u2019 at me when we\u2019re talkin\u2019, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Skylar wheeled around. \u201cWe aren\u2019t talking, Kade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the problem?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one way to rectify that, Skylar. If you have some to say to me, spit it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. For lack of a better term, we\u2019ve been playing house for over two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlayin\u2019 house? Is that what you think we\u2019re doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it? And despite the fact you\u2019re living with me, you\u2019re in my bed, today you came into my plant and tried to charm the pants off me in front of my employees.\u201d</p><p>Kade lifted both brows. \u201cDoes that make you mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does. I sound like a total idiot, but yeah, it makes me wonder why you don\u2019t use that silver tongue on me when we\u2019re alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere exactly do you want me to use my tongue on you, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>Everywhere. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I meant. And it doesn\u2019t help my self-image when I realize we\u2019ve been sleeping in the same damn bed for almost three weeks and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>Just say it. Calmly. Confidently. With dignity. She blurted out, \u201cAnd why haven\u2019t you so much as laid a single hand on me?\u201d</p><p>He blinked several times. \u201cCome again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. You asked for honesty, there it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, I asked you to marry me, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I said no. That doesn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>Kade wiped a cloth napkin across his mouth with deliberate slowness. \u201cThe reason I haven\u2019t done anything more than sleep next to you in that bed is because I\u2019m followin\u2019 your lead, Sky. You never indicated that\u2019s what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t acted like you\u2019re interested, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. I would\u2019ve fucked you on the couch the first night I moved in. I would\u2019ve spread you out on every goddamn surface in this kitchen morning, noon and night. I would\u2019ve banged you on the concrete floor of your herb room until my knees bled the second I saw you today, in another one of them sexy-assed dresses you always wear.</p><p>\u201cI want you like crazy. It don\u2019t matter to me where, but it sure as hell matters when, because I ain\u2019t gonna start nothin\u2019 with you until you\u2019re ready to get into an intensely physical relationship with me.\u201d</p><p>Skylar\u2019s belly flipped at the words intensely physical relationship. \u201cBeing a true cowboy gentleman, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure as hell tryin\u2019, because that\u2019s what you told me you wanted from the get-go.</p><p>It ain\u2019t easy as I thought it\u2019d be.\u201d</p><p>Rather than admit she was wrong for demanding his stupid gentlemanly behavior, she taunted, \u201cSo is that why I caught you jacking off in the shower this morning?\u201d</p><p>His eyes glittered. \u201cMe jackin\u2019 off was in direct response to the show you were puttin\u2019 on in the middle of the damn bed about five minutes before that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to react when you\u2019re diddlin\u2019 yourself in your sleep?\u201d Kade leaned forward. \u201cI watched you come. It was hot as the Fourth of July. Made me hard as a fuckin\u2019 brick. And rather than risk wakin\u2019 up Eliza and goin\u2019 all caveman on you, poundin\u2019 your luscious body clear through that mattress, I took matters into my own hands. Because sweetheart, I\u2019ve had a lot of experience with that in the last year.\u201d</p><p>Kade thought her body was luscious? Skylar stared at him. Turned on, turned inside out. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been with anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since you...not since the night Eliza was conceived in my truck in Ziggy\u2019s parking lot.\u201d</p><p>She whispered, \u201cMe either.\u201d</p><p>Kade stood so fast the chair crashed to the floor.</p><p>\u201cNo one has touched me since that night.\u201d As he stalked her, she backed up until her lower back connected with the counter edge. \u201cWell, I mean, I\u2019ve been touched. I had to be when pregnant and giving birth, but no one...no man...except that one male nurse...oh God, I\u2019m not making any sense am I?\u201d</p><p>Her gentleman cowboy was right in her face. A sexy menace. A man out of patience.</p><p>\u201cSkylar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>And then he slammed his mouth down on hers and kissed her.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Kade kissed her as thoroughly as he\u2019d been dying to.</p><p>His hands were buried in her soft hair; his body was pressed tightly to hers until not a sliver of daylight remained between them. He ate at her deliciously sweet mouth, nibbling, licking, leaving tiny love bites on her lips. Sucking on her tongue. Drawing the scent and the taste of her down his throat and into his lungs like food and air.</p><p>Skylar opened her mouth wider, attempting to swallow him whole. Her tongue grew hotter, wetter, more insistent. She clutched his shoulders. Her nails dug through his T-shirt and gouged his skin. Whimpering noises vibrated from her throat into his mouth and traveled down his torso to settle in his already hard cock. His prick damn near saluted when she\u2019d confessed to spying on him as he\u2019d whacked off in the shower.</p><p>His hands untangled from her hair and Kade went straight for her tits. Still kissing her, he made short work of the buttons on her dress.</p><p>Kade trailed his lips down her flawless neck. \u201cYou taste as smooth here as I remember. Way better than chocolate cake. Remember what I said I\u2019d like to do with the frosting? \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always pick lousy times to have a conversation, McKay.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. Her abundant breasts were straining against the fabric and he couldn\u2019t get them free. \u201cUndo this damn bra for me, Sky, so I can put my mouth on you.\u201d</p><p>She batted away his fumbling fingers. Something snapped and those perfectly soft mounds fell into his waiting hands.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Gimme.\u201d Kade swept his thumbs across her rosy nipples, placing open-mouthed kisses on the upper swells of her breasts. Rubbing his cheeks and lips and jaw against her bared flesh, feeling her whole body quiver in response. Watching her face, he closed his mouth over her left nipple and sucked. Hard.</p><p>Sky arched back and released a strangled moan.</p><p>He worshipped the tits he\u2019d been fantasizing about for months. Teasing her, pleasing himself. He was in no mood to be rushed. He suckled her nipples softly, then with unrestrained zeal. Tweaked them with his fingertips. Nipped the tips with his teeth as he held the weight of them together. Squeezing and tonguing, imagining sliding his cock in the slippery valley of her cleavage. Kissing them, loving the fullness and her responsiveness to his every touch.</p><p>\u201cKade. Enough. I-I can\u2019t think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He scattered kisses up to her lips and stared into her eyes, letting her see the hunger raging inside him.</p><p>Don\u2019t be a gentleman; be a real man. Tell her straight up.</p><p>\u201cI wanna make love to you, Sky.\u201d</p><p>Make love? What the hell happened to \u201cI wanna fuck your brains out, baby\u201d ?</p><p>\u201cI want you too,\u201d she whispered against his mouth. \u201cIn a bed this time. Do you have a condom?\u201d</p><p>Kade tasted the smooth skin of her jawline. \u201cI have a whole goddamn box. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He guided her upstairs. They stopped in front of the door to the bedroom where Eliza was sleeping. Skylar\u2019s nervousness was obvious and he softly touched her cheek. \u201cHow about we do this in the guest bedroom across the hall?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll grab the condoms. And if you ain\u2019t in there, make no mistake, I will rip this house apart lookin\u2019 for you.\u201d Kade sprinted to the bathroom. He dug through his shaving kit for the stash and was back at the door to heaven in under a minute.</p><p>With the shades drawn and the hall light off, the room was completely dark when he stepped inside. \u201cWhere\u2019s the light switch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. The bulb is burned out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a lamp in here or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKade, I\u2019m in the middle of the bed completely naked. Do you really want to talk about the lack of lighting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He stripped to skin. \u201cBut I\u2019ll admit I\u2019d hoped to see more of you this time than last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can feel as much of me as you want.\u201d</p><p>He walked in a straight line until his shins hit solid wood. \u201cFuck. That hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome up here and I\u2019ll kiss it and make it better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m holdin\u2019 you to that.\u201d He crawled on the bed to find Skylar was indeed, totally buck-ass bare and in her usual position\u2014right smack dab in the center of the bed. \u201cYou do know you\u2019re a bed hog, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. See, a week or so back, you started snugglin\u2019 into me in the dead of the night.</p><p>At first I thought it was because you liked bein\u2019 close to me.\u201d Kade\u2019s fingers circled her ankle and he slid her right leg aside to crawl between her thighs. \u201cI hoped that was your way of sayin\u2019 you wanted me.\u201d He kissed the top of her foot, jangling the bells on her ankle bracelet. \u201cThen I realized you were used to havin\u2019 the bed to yourself and didn\u2019t wanna share. Snugglin\u2019 into me was your way of pushin\u2019 me out of your space.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The mattress shifted and Skylar sat up. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I liked havin\u2019 you next to me, no matter what your motives were. Don\u2019t matter right now.\u201d He fluttered his fingertips up the inside of her thighs. \u201cSpread your legs wider for me, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Kade caught a whiff of her arousal. Thick. Sweet. Warm. He wanted to taste her so damn bad his mouth was watering. Keeping his hands gripping her thighs, he leaned over and put his mouth on her belly button.</p><p>Her stomach muscles rippled beneath his lips.</p><p>He dipped his tongue into the indentation, then dragged it down to the top of her pubic bone. He blew softly across her damp curls.</p><p>Goose flesh broke out across her legs and she softly gasped.</p><p>\u201cAny objections about me kissin\u2019 you down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. No. Please.\u201d</p><p>Kade chuckled at her polite eagerness. After a couple of gentlemanly licks, he buried his face in her pussy, found her pulse with his tongue and began to suck her clit.</p><p>She moaned his name. His. Kade.</p><p>Oh yeah. This is what he wanted. Needed. Just Sky. Just like this. Pliant. Eager, and his.</p><p>Skylar\u2019s hands stripped the sheet from the mattress. She ground her wet sex into his face as she started to come, gasping, thrashing against him and the bed, trying to suppress the sounds of her orgasm. He kept sucking her sweet pussy until she sighed contentment and her legs stopped twitching.</p><p>\u201cGod, Kade, you make me crazy when you do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Grinning, Kade rose to his knees. He reached for the condoms, ripped open the box and tore a package free.</p><p>\u201cLet me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember how to do this part, although Eliza\u2019s existence might convince you otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t regret anything about her, Kade. Not a single thing.\u201d</p><p>That shocked him into stillness.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get to touch you anywhere last time. Let me. Please.\u201d</p><p>Couldn\u2019t say no to that. He admired her silhouette as she opened the package with her teeth. Sky smoothed her left hand up his thigh and he withheld a shiver at her tender touch. Placing the latex over the head of his cock, she rolled it down to the root. She curled her hand around the girth and stroked.</p><p>His cock jerked hopefully in her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou were pulling pretty hard and fast in the shower. Doesn\u2019t that hurt?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Another time I\u2019ll teach you the secret to a great handjob. Right now, lay back.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she was horizontal, Kade levered himself over her\u2014his legs brushing inside hers, his palms flat by her shoulders, matched pelvis to pelvis.</p><p>Sky touched his face with the tips of her cool fingers and passed her palms over his chest like she was sculpting him from memory. \u201cYou have such an amazingly hard body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome places are harder than others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been awhile. This probably ain\u2019t gonna last long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen awhile for me too, cowboy.\u201d She whispered, \u201cKiss me. I love the way you kiss me. Like I\u2019m the only thing in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m kissin\u2019 you, sweetheart, you are the only thing in my world.\u201d</p><p>Poised at the entrance to her body, he eased in as he took her mouth. He lost his mind in the glove-tight feeling of her pussy closing around his cock from tip to root.</p><p>He broke the kiss. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t very convincin\u2019.\u201d Kade noticed she wore a strange expression. \u201cWhat?</p><p>Am I hurtin\u2019 you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkylar, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is going to sound so stupid. Embarrassing.\u201d In a rush, she said, \u201cDoes it feel different for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know. Looser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I did push an eight pound baby out of there. And I\u2019ve heard the vaginal walls loosen and it doesn\u2019t feel as tight for men afterward\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a fuckin\u2019 perfect fit.\u201d He pulled out and pushed back in. Three, four, five hard, deep thrusts that bumped her cervix and made her bow into him with absolute abandon. \u201cPerfect in every way.\u201d He shortened his strokes. \u201cJesus. You feel so goddamn good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot half as good as you feel to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pick lousy times to have a conversation, Sky,\u201d he teased.</p><p>She groaned, \u201cI deserved that.\u201d Then she bit his earlobe.</p><p>A shudder worked through him. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can go slow.\u201d</p><p>Pressing her lips to the hollow of his throat, she said, \u201cSo don\u2019t. It\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t done this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like this we haven\u2019t.\u201d Something akin to a snarl burst from his mouth as he hammered into her. Pounding hips, flesh pounding flesh, his heart matched the rhythm of it all.</p><p>Sky arched her back, tilting her pelvis, allowing him a deeper angle. \u201cYes. Like that.\u201d</p><p>With her nails digging into his ass and her mouth sucking at his neck, Kade shoved hard, stayed buried balls deep and came with a long groan, sending her into another orgasm.</p><p>Still breathing with difficulty, he lifted his head and reconnected their mouths for another slow kiss. Then he whispered in her hair, \u201cMarry me, Skylar.\u201d</p><p>She whispered back, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was worth a shot.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Somehow in the following week Eliza settled into a routine, which made Kade happy. He and Skylar settling into a routine didn\u2019t make Kade happy. Not one iota.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that why he\u2019d moved in? What he\u2019d wanted?</p><p>No. Not like this. Every night was the same. They\u2019d put Eliza down. Skylar would sneak into the guest bedroom, strip, and wait for him. They\u2019d make careful love, only face to face, only in the absolute darkness, only on the bed.</p><p>While they were in the moment, it was damn good. But, afterward, when Skylar immediately got up and dressed, he questioned why she bothered with a sexual relationship with him. After they both got off, she\u2019d disappear, leaving him...lonely. At bedtime she\u2019d curl up on her side of the bed and he on his. They\u2019d take turns getting up with Eliza. Business as usual. Sky probably saw nothing wrong with the way things were going between them.</p><p>As the week progressed Kade became frustrated with the situation with Skylar and his incompetence in changing it. Or in his ability to be completely honest with what he needed from her. He\u2019d had enough empty sex in his life...well, to last a lifetime. He wanted more with her...for both of them.</p><p>For years, Kade had acted in the same manner as Sky did, confusing sex with intimacy. Now that he\u2019d learned there was a difference, he\u2019d hoped to take their relationship to the next level, beyond parenting partners and mattress monkeys.</p><p>So what was the problem?</p><p>From what he could tell, Skylar wasn\u2019t interested in them becoming more intimate on any level.</p><p>Had they taken advantage of Eliza\u2019s sleeping hours by spending time talking, beyond the basic chitchat? No. Had they cuddled up on the front porch swing to gaze at the stars and moon? No. Had they plopped on the sofa to watch TV? No. Hell, he\u2019d\u2019ve been happy as a pig in shit cleaning the damn house and folding laundry.</p><p>They did none of the normal couple things. She\u2019d allow him to touch her body within certain parameters, but it never ventured beyond the surface.</p><p>At some point, Kade realized his brother hit the nail on the head with his observation about Skylar\u2019s behavior. He\u2019d swallowed his embarrassment and asked to borrow the pop psychology book Buck had spoken of and it just confirmed his suspicions.</p><p>It was all about Sky\u2019s need for control. When it came to their relationship, she controlled the where, the when, and how much time they spent in the bedroom. And, she controlled the amount of time they spent out of the bedroom. She controlled...everything.</p><p>That didn\u2019t surprise him so much because as a successful businesswoman everything in her life was laid out. Scheduled. He\u2019d be damned if they\u2019d schedule sex. If he was just another thing she\u2019d mark off on her \u201cto do\u201d list.</p><p>In her tidy world was Eliza a constant reminder of the consequences of Sky throwing caution to the wind?</p><p>Maybe Kade could use that mindset to his advantage.</p><p>Eliza squeaked. She studied him somberly with those big blue eyes. His heart was a pile of mush when she looked at him like that. \u201cYou got me wrapped around your little finger, girlie, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>She blinked.</p><p>\u201cLike mother, like daughter, eh?\u201d</p><p>She appeared to be listening, so he kept talking.</p><p>\u201cI won you over, and I\u2019m gonna win over your mama too. It may take some doin\u2019.</p><p>Think Aunt Indy is right in the no pain, no gain school of thought? No? Me neither. But your mama ain\u2019t gonna like nothin\u2019 I do to force her hand, so I might as well start out balls to the wall. Desperate times call for desperate measures. And between us, sweet thang, I\u2019m desperate to make that woman mine. Body, heart, and soul. Just to make it interestin\u2019, I do believe I\u2019ll start with her body first.\u201d</p><p>In the last week Kade had taken to dropping by the shop on his way to the house.</p><p>Skylar found herself looking forward to hearing his gruff voice bouncing off the rafters.</p><p>Today he\u2019d meandered in and flirted with Dee, played a quick game of tic-tac-toe with Josie and the daycare kids, talked horses with Bonita, and checked the alternator in Vickie\u2019s truck. He tried to engage Nadia in conversation, but she went out of her way to avoid him.</p><p>Kade was unfailing polite with Skylar, never hinting that anything but a parental bond existed between them in front of her employees, which is what she\u2019d wanted.</p><p>So why did she secretly wish for his public display of affection? For that hunky cowboy to swoop in and kiss her madly? Spirit her up to her office, sweep everything off the desk and screw her silly on her day planner?</p><p>Probably because she was suffering from sleep deprivation. Passion like that only happened in the movies. Real life for her was spread sheets, diapers, sleepless nights and if she was lucky, a quick bout of nookie before the baby woke up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d never had much of a sex life, so the fact she was getting some good lovin\u2019 on a regular basis should\u2019ve made her swoon like giggling maiden.

Not only was she too chicken to take a chance on initiating sex with Kade, she was afraid he\u2019d balk at seeing her flab-ulous post-baby body and end all sexual contact. She kept all naked encounters in the dark, figuring so-so sex was better than no sex? Right?</p><p>Wrong. The niggling feeling that something was missing outside of the bedroom didn\u2019t help her frame of mind because she had no frame of reference for a situation like this\u2014sexually or personally. For the first time in a long time, she had no plan of attack, no earthly idea on how to go about implementing changes.</p><p>Sky left the office and headed home. The big screen TV in the living room wasn\u2019t on. Kade wasn\u2019t sprawled on the couch. The baby wasn\u2019t in the bassinet. She tracked Kade to the kitchen where he was slouched against the back door and yakking on his cell phone.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s such a good idea. Because it\u2019s been a long goddamn time since we done it together. Ah fuck you, I ain\u2019t forgot how to do it. Let\u2019s say, I\u2019ve been doin\u2019 some practicin\u2019 on my own.\u201d</p><p>She froze. Who was he talking to? What kind of practicing was he referring to?</p><p>\u201cRight. Nah, I guess I don\u2019t give a shit what people say about us either. So, tomorrow? Fine. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d Click.</p><p>Kade slipped the cell phone in his pocket and wheeled around with a guilty look.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey yourself.\u201d Her gaze scanned the kitchen. \u201cWhere\u2019s Eliza?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened in mock-horror. \u201cShit. I don\u2019t know. I guess I musta left her in the barn next to the bucket of rusty nails, the pissed off horse and the loaded shotgun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t think so if it was me constantly askin\u2019 you where our daughter was.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. He was a little testy. \u201cSorry. Habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne I wish you\u2019d break.\u201d Kade dragged a hand through his hair and flopped in a chair. \u201cAnyway, she\u2019s asleep. There\u2019s soup on the stove if you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou cooked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Ma sent it home with me, so you know it\u2019s edible and it ain\u2019t chili. Again.\u201d</p><p>Really testy.</p><p>Skylar dished up. She sat across from him and ate in silence. As she rinsed her bowl, Kade wrapped an arm around her waist.</p><p>He removed the clip holding her messy mane and draped the waves across her shoulders, burying his face in her hair. \u201cYou always smell so damn good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hair is beautiful. Don\u2019t ever cut it. I\u2019d like to feel it draped across my body as you\u2019re ridin\u2019 me. Bet it feels like silk on my skin.\u201d He angled her head and kissed her neck.</p><p>Immediately tingles raced from that spot straight to her core.</p> <p>\u201cSkylar. I want you so damn bad. Let me have you.\u201d</p><p>The man made her wet with just words. \u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Right here in the kitchen. Spread out on this counter so I can feast on you with the evenin\u2019 sun shinin\u2019 on your glossy hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with feasting on me in a bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d Kade\u2019s hands curled around her hips. \u201cCome on, sweetheart. Be spontaneous. Be adventurous. We\u2019re closer to the chocolate syrup here. I\u2019d sure like to drizzle it on your sweet spot and make you my Tuesday sundae.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck. \u201cMaybe some other time. Take me to bed, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Kade stepped back, way back, letting her arms drop to her sides. \u201cWhy are you so insistent on me makin\u2019 love to you only in a bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being so insistent on doing me in the kitchen in broad daylight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? Knockin\u2019 the dishes to the floor and havin\u2019 my wicked way with you on the table?\u201d</p><p>Her briefly liberating thought: Hallelujah! A man who cares enough to figure out what I want, was replaced with her usual paranoid thought: No way! It\u2019s neon bright in here and you\u2019d be disgusted with my cottage cheese thighs and jelly belly.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with it if you\u2019re into that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not?\u201d he demanded. \u201cIs makin\u2019 love only supposed to be done in the dark, at night, in missionary position?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the issue? You\u2019re discovering I\u2019m not sexually adventurous enough for you?</p><p>Or spontaneous enough for you?\u201d</p><p>His answering grin wasn\u2019t particularly pleasant. \u201cNo, the real issue ain\u2019t about me or what I want. The real issue is you\u2019re scared to death to lose control to get what you want, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Her heart began to pound. Dammit. Did Kade really know her so well in such a short amount of time? When no one other man bothered to really see her? To dig beneath the surface, to look beyond her dress size and the size of her bank account? To figure out her cool efficiency was a facade? \u201cKade\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see you\u2019re afraid to lose control to anyone, not just to me. See, I\u2019m pretty sure you think about us screwin\u2019 on this table. Goin\u2019 at it on the living room floor until we\u2019re covered in rug burns. You think about gettin\u2019 on your knees and suckin\u2019 me off. Or me pinnin\u2019 you to the shower wall and fuckin\u2019 you mindless while we\u2019re wet and slippery.</p><p>Or me bendin\u2019 you over the porch railin\u2019, and poundin\u2019 into you from behind. You think about doin\u2019 sixty-nine with me on the couch. Or how raunchy it\u2019d feel to have me in your ass. Or usin\u2019 sex toys on you. Or me tyin\u2019 you up. You think about me fuckin\u2019 you in all the ways you\u2019ve never let any other man fuck you.\u201d</p><p>With each accentuated phrase, Kade sidled closer.</p><p>\u201cBut know what I really think?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t wanna think. You wish I\u2019d take control of all sexual situations so you don\u2019t hafta worry about your response. You get to experience pure sexual satisfaction without guilt. You do what I tell you, knowin\u2019 full well that you\u2019ll love every damn minute of it. Because you know in your heart, I\u2019d never do anything to hurt or humiliate you. In private or in public.</p><p>\u201cYou crave that out-of-control feelin\u2019, Sky. I can give it to you. I can give you everything you\u2019ve ever wanted in bed and out of it. You gotta take a chance and trust me, sweetheart. You gotta take a chance a let go of your goddamned iron control and give yourself to me without boundaries.\u201d</p><p>Kade kissed her in a brutal show of male possession, of frustration, of absolute pure animal attraction, of a man choosing his mate and marking her his.</p><p>That raw power sucked her in like a drug. The ultimate aphrodisiac. Skylar kissed him with equal abandon, following his lead until he ripped his mouth free and backed away from her.</p><p>\u201cYour days of controllin\u2019 our sexual encounters end now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh-ah-ah. I ain\u2019t done. If you say yes to me havin\u2019 complete control over everything sex-wise, you don\u2019t get to change your mind. And you sure as hell don\u2019t get to say no, at any point, to anything I tell you to do once we start this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am, I\u2019ve never been more serious in my life. I\u2019m trying to prepare you for what bein\u2019 intimate with me means.\u201d</p><p>Skylar stared at him, almost as if she\u2019d never seen him before. The Kade McKay she knew would never make demands like this.</p><p>Maybe you don\u2019t know him as well as you thought.</p><p>Maybe you don\u2019t know yourself as well as you thought if you\u2019re considering saying yes to this craziness for one single minute, Skylar Blue Ellison.</p><p>She wished the prim and proper voice in her head would take a hike. Yet, his demands scared her to pieces. Maybe she could get him to back down a little. Redefine his laundry list of suggestions. Promise to ease into fun and sex games. Not start out at super-kinky and progress to wilder sexual scenarios from there.</p><p>Softly, he said, \u201cIt won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe deer in the headlights look. The puppy dog eyes. The female half-pout. There ain\u2019t no half-measures for either of us anymore, Sky. It\u2019s all or nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Semi-annoyed, she demanded, \u201cSo what? If I say no to being your sex slave you\u2019re leaving us?\u201d</p><p>He was in her space, dark, and dangerous, all pissed off primal male. \u201cI\u2019m not leavin\u2019. Eliza is my daughter and I\u2019m in her life. Period.\u201d He angled his head, letting his hot breath tease her ear. \u201cAnd aren\u2019t you clever, tryin\u2019 to change my focus to something besides the fact you didn\u2019t deny you\u2019d enjoy the hell out of bein\u2019 my sex slave?\u201d</p><p>Holy crap. She hadn\u2019t denied it. And why did just the feel of his mouth so close to her skin make her weak-kneed and brain addled, wondering if she should invest in palm fronds, grapes and silken scarves?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to decide changin\u2019 your whole approach to intimacy right now.</p><p>I\u2019ll give you a couple of days to think on it. Lettin\u2019 me know your answer by Saturday oughta be good enough.\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t respond, he teased, \u201cDisappointed I ain\u2019t bendin\u2019 you over and takin\u2019 what I want from you right now?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cJust trying to understand why you bombarded me with raunchy images that leave me\u2014\u201d craving what and who I could be with you \u201c\u2014stunned and then Kade McKay, gentleman cowboy, tips his white hat at me as he rides away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I was gonna play fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I just a game to you?\u201d</p><p>Kade shook his head. \u201cThis is for real. This is for keeps, Skylar. Just so you know how serious I am, I moved my stuff out of your bedroom and into the guest room for the time bein\u2019. I also put a new light bulb in the empty socket and in the lamps on the dressers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Crap. She should\u2019ve known he\u2019d figure that out. It was a silly ploy anyway and she was surprised it\u2019d worked as long as it did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll still get up with Eliza at night. I bought another baby monitor for my room so I can hear her. But you might wanna keep in mind I won\u2019t be back until late the next coupla nights.\u201d</p><p>Ask him where he\u2019s going.</p> <p>Like hell. The old, stubborn Skylar asserted herself and pointed out they weren\u2019t married. Kade could do whatever he wanted and damn him for not being satisfied with her in bed or out of it. But wasn\u2019t that just the story of her life? \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He pointed to the living room. \u201cUnless you\u2019re up for watchin\u2019 a little TV</p><p>with me now that we got that long overdue discussion outta the way?\u201d</p><p>Frustrated with him, but mostly herself, she half snarled, half growled as she stormed up the stairs.</p><p>She heard Kade say, \u201cI guess I can take that as a no.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\u201cHey, baby girl. Stop screaming. Ssh. It\u2019s okay. Mama\u2019s right here. Ssh.\u201d</p><p>Eliza kept right on wailing. For the fourth hour in a row. She wouldn\u2019t eat. She wouldn\u2019t sleep. She didn\u2019t have a dirty diaper. Or diaper rash. She didn\u2019t have a fever.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t thrown up. She didn\u2019t have gas. She didn\u2019t have diarrhea. She was beyond fussy.</p><p>And Skylar didn\u2019t know why. Made her feel like an awful mother. She\u2019d had to leave work before noon because Eliza wouldn\u2019t stop crying. She\u2019d tried putting her in the swing. The baby bouncer. She\u2019d tried rocking her and singing to her and reading to her.</p><p>She\u2019d strapped on the Snugli and walked up and down the driveway. She\u2019d soaked her in a soothing bath steeped with calming herbs. She tried rubbing her tummy. Rubbing her back. Nothing worked.</p> <p>On a whim, Sky packed Eliza in her car seat and headed for Sundance. Usually the rhythmic sounds of the tires clacking on the bumpy road put Eliza straight to sleep.</p><p>Today it didn\u2019t matter. Eliza cried all the way into town. All thirty miles.</p><p>Sky parked in front of Sky Blue, juggling the baby carrier\u2014complete with screaming, mad baby\u2014the diaper bag, the Snugli, her purse and her sanity. She trudged inside. It was one of the only times she was thankful the store was empty.</p><p>Eliza shrieked as Skylar set the carrier on the floor.</p><p>India barreled around the corner. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why are you here in the middle of a workday? Is Eliza sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She won\u2019t stop crying.\u201d Sky unceremoniously dropped everything else where she stood. \u201cI\u2019ve done everything I can think of and I\u2019m at my wit\u2019s end because nothing is helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you a little banshee today, Miz Eliza Belle? How about if Auntie Indy takes over for a while, hmm? Mama\u2019s ears need a break?\u201d</p><p>She watched as India lifted the angry baby out of the carrier and tried to calm her down.</p> <p>Eliza was having none of it.</p><p>Her heart clenched at her baby\u2019s continued distress. \u201cMaybe it is something serious.</p><p>Should I take her to the doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your call, Sis. She\u2019s your baby. You oughta know.\u201d</p><p>Skylar burst into tears. \u201cBut I don\u2019t! I\u2019m the worst mother on the planet!\u201d She knew it wasn\u2019t fair to bust in on poor India, making her deal with a hysterical mother and a screaming baby, but she had no one else to turn to.</p><p>What about Kade?</p><p>The thought of calling him, confessing her ineptitude with their daughter, letting him see how completely she\u2019d lost it...well, she cried even harder at exposing that flaw, when he already thought she had plenty of other flaws.</p><p>That was the other thing. Why didn\u2019t Eliza fuss around him? Not that he\u2019d been around the last two nights, and dammit she missed him. She sniffled and the sobs kept coming.</p><p>India was gently bouncing Eliza in her arms, eyeing Skylar warily.</p><p>\u201cSo what? I\u2019m crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never do a lot of things I should. I\u2019m so tired of everybody thinking I\u2019m some kind of robot. Of everyone thinking I can handle everything.\u201d She started bawling harder. \u201cI can\u2019t! How do women have cranky babies and demanding jobs and confusing relationships and run a household by themselves without going insane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m wondering if a stiff shot of whiskey wouldn\u2019t be the best thing for you right about now.\u201d</p><p>That caused Sky to laugh through her sobs and Eliza\u2019s wails. \u201cGreat advice coming from an alcoholic.\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cAt least I didn\u2019t suggest you snort a line of coke or smoke a joint.\u201d</p><p>A loud pounding sounded on the door that separated the business spaces. A muffled voice inquired, \u201cIndy? You okay?\u201d</p><p>India walked over and twisted the lock. The door opened and AJ McKay stepped through. \u201cI heard a baby crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrying is putting it mildly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor thing.\u201d AJ looked at Sky. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrustrated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine. Mind if I hold her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock yourself out. Or knock her out, whatever works,\u201d India muttered, and passed Eliza to her.</p><p>AJ placed one hand under Eliza\u2019s head and neck and the other on the baby\u2019s butt.</p><p>\u201cSuch a mad face on such a pretty girl. What\u2019s wrong, cutie-pie? Just having a bad day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with her. I\u2019ve tried everything. And I-I...\u201d More tears fell. She wanted to scream in misery right along with Eliza.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have.\u201d AJ nuzzled Eliza\u2019s cheek and cooed, \u201cYes, sweet baby, she\u2019s a great mama to you, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not very happy with her mama today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes those people who make us the happiest can also make us the most mad,\u201d</p><p>AJ said. \u201cIt\u2019s a trade off.\u201d</p><p>That observation startled Skylar.</p><p>India said, \u201cEliza\u2019s mad all right. Look at how hard she\u2019s shaking.\u201d</p><p>A thoughtful look crossed AJ\u2019s face. \u201cSkylar, do you mind if I try something with her?\u201d</p><p>Sky wiped her eyes and shook her head. \u201cPlease. If you can help her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d AJ sat in a chair and stretched Eliza out on her lap, belly up.</p><p>Holding her head with one hand, she rubbed her thumb from the base of the baby\u2019s skull to the bottom of her neck. She massaged the left side and right side, speaking softly to Eliza as she continued to gently rub and Eliza continued to shriek.</p><p>After several long minutes, which seemed a lifetime to Skylar as her precious baby wailed, the cries tapered to whimpers. The whimpers ended with a hiccup. It became quiet enough they heard Eliza sigh deeply.</p><p>Skylar felt that sigh clear to the marrow of her bones.</p><p>India peered at the infant. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle. What did you do?\u201d</p><p>AJ blushed. \u201cNothing, really. Massaged her neck. We learned when babies are learning to hold up their heads, it can create extra pressure on the tendons in their neck.</p><p>When they get all tense, they seize up, mostly in their neck, where their vocal cords are.</p><p>They scream, it hurts and they scream more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Skylar stared at the twisted Kleenex in her hand. \u201cI feel like such an idiot. I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d Tears welled up again. \u201cThere\u2019s lots I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I wouldn\u2019t have known if I hadn\u2019t gone to massage therapy school. Trust me, my sister had the same issues with all three of her kids, so it\u2019s not you.\u201d</p><p>Sweet words. AJ was the sweetest woman around.</p><p>AJ continued to rub Eliza\u2019s neck and the baby\u2019s long lashes fluttered closed. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re here...I have a bone to pick with you, Skylar Ellison.\u201d Those silver eyes locked on hers. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me Eliza was Kade\u2019s baby? All this time and I had no clue you were carrying a McKay?\u201d</p><p>Ooh. Not so sweet now.</p><p>\u201cKade didn\u2019t even know,\u201d India pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYou bet your behind he didn\u2019t, because no way would Kade have let you go through pregnancy and childbirth alone. I\u2019ve known him all my life and he is not that kind of man. Cord told me the only reason Kade took that job up in the north country was because he\u2019d had a bad break up with a woman. I never imagined that woman was you.\u201d</p><p>Skylar bit back the retort, I never imagined he\u2019d pretend to be his twin brother and knock me up, either.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you\u2019d bothered to tell any of us you were pregnant, we would\u2019ve made sure he received the message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I going to be defending my decision to the entire McKay family for the rest of Eliza\u2019s life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d AJ straightened Eliza\u2019s jumper. \u201cWe\u2019re all overjoyed because you birthed a girl McKay. Keely has been the only girl for four generations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKimi mentioned that.\u201d Kade\u2019s mother had called a couple of times to chat after Kade had taken Eliza to see her grandma. Kimi was a real spitfire. She claimed she had to be tough to survive being married to a wild McKay man and raising two more McKay hellions. Sky developed an instant rapport with Kimi, even when Sky shied away asking questions about Kade and his childhood, because she didn\u2019t want to seem nosy.</p><p>\u201cMy sisters-in-law have hope the next McKay out of the chute, so to speak,\u201d AJ</p><p>grinned cheekily, \u201cwill be the stem-less variety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, AJ? Since Channing and Macie have both birthed boys, you itching to be the one to break their streak?\u201d India teased.</p><p>\u201cGod no. Ky is plenty for us to handle right now. Besides, Cord and I\u2019ve only been married since December. We\u2019re breeding horses for the time being, not kids.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps echoed from the back room. A deep male voice asked, \u201cIndia? You seen my wife?\u201d Cord McKay crossed the threshold. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Skylar stared.

Isn\u2019t she the sweetest thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is. Least that\u2019s what her daddy says.\u201d Cord\u2019s eyes met Skylar\u2019s, almost in challenge.</p><p>Sky\u2019s mocking look challenged him back. \u201cKade is a sucker. He\u2019s already promised to buy her a pony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine so.\u201d He thrust out his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you around, and I know India, but we\u2019ve never been introduced. Cord McKay.\u201d</p> <p>She shook his hand. \u201cSkylar Ellison. Do all you McKay cousins and brothers look alike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wonder twins notwithstandin\u2019, I don\u2019t see the resemblance, but other folks do. I imagine we all oughta wear name tags tomorrow, so you don\u2019t get us mixed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe big rodeo. Kade and Colt are competin\u2019. Everybody\u2019s talkin\u2019 about it. I figured you\u2019d be there so Kade could show off the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t mentioned it, but he\u2019s been pretty scarce the last couple days.\u201d</p><p>An awkward moment followed.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure Kade\u2019ll tell you about it when he finds time.\u201d Cord set his hand on AJ\u2019s shoulder and squeezed. \u201cI came to remind you we gotta get Ky pretty quick.\u201d</p><p>AJ stood and handed the sleeping baby to her mother. \u201cThanks for letting me have my baby fix. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The couple barely cleared the backroom when AJ gasped and a low masculine laugh answered. The connecting door slammed.</p><p>\u201cThose two. I swear they\u2019re always doin\u2019 it in her studio. I think it\u2019s the only chance they have to be alone without rambunctious Ky underfoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKids do have a way of messing up the best laid plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you have some experience with that?\u201d</p><p>Rather than respond, Sky wandered. She was too restless to sit and half-afraid if she quit moving Eliza would wake up. Her thoughts wandered to Kade.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t he told her about the rodeo? Because he\u2019d planned on taking Eliza, but not her? Because he expected come Saturday she\u2019d pass on his intriguing offer and that part of their relationship would be over? They\u2019d be friends, Eliza\u2019s parents and nothing more to each other? That thought made her sort of ill.</p> <p>\u201cSky? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.Something\u2019s been brought to my attention and I\u2019m asking for your honest opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m controlling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean in control, or manipulative of others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn control.\u201d Sky faced her sister.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are in total control, at all times, of all things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that bad?\u201d</p><p>India shrugged. \u201cNot necessarily. Unless you\u2019re unwilling to bend a little, to loosen up once in awhile. We both know that\u2019s not in your type-A personality, especially given your past association with jerk-off men. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKade mentioned he thinks I have control issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s automatic agreement jarred Sky. \u201cYou\u2019re siding with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never side against you, Sis. Never. I am really proud of you for being such a great mom, even if I\u2019m surprised you aren\u2019t more controlling and psycho when it comes to Eliza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI honestly was scared you\u2019d become one of those mothers who obsesses over every little thing.\u201d</p><p>Sky\u2019s stomach pitched. \u201cYou saying I don\u2019t care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You love Eliza fiercely, but it\u2019s not an insane I-need-to-control-every-minute-of-this-kid\u2019s-life kind of love that I expected from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith most things, especially your business. Case in point: you\u2019ve finally hired an office manager after I nagged you incessantly, but do you let her manage? No. You still do it all, which drives me batshit. How long will Annie have to work for you before you decide to give her more responsibility?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me finish. I know you weigh pros and cons from every conceivable angle. You never jump headfirst into any situation.\u201d India cocked her and challenged, \u201cHow many baby books did you read when you were pregnant?\u201d</p><p>Forty. \u201cWhere is the relevance in that question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked for an opinion, I\u2019m giving you mine. So knowing how you are, how you\u2019ve always been, it really blew my mind when Kade came back into the picture and you trusted him with Eliza from the start. No second-guessing his parenting abilities. No</p><p>\u2018trial period\u2019 for him to prove himself to you or your daughter. You just flat-out accepted him.\u201d</p><p>That was an atypical reaction for her, and Sky admitted, \u201cHe\u2019s taken to fatherhood in a way I could only hope for. He is so great with her. Better than I am at times.\u201d Like today.</p><p>\u201cSo, how did the topic of you being controlling come up with Kade? Does it have to do with Eliza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s more...personal.\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cAre you sleeping with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean sharing a bed? Or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean, Sky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m sleeping with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he asked you to marry him again?\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Sky said, \u201cHow did you know about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I stopped in at your place, I ah...grilled him about a couple of things, he told me he asked you, and you said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the only reason he asks me is because of Eliza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsks?\u201d India repeated. \u201cAs in he\u2019s asked multiple times?\u201d</p><p>Skylar nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one hundred percent certain that the only reason Kade McKay is with you is because of your daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah! I think you\u2019re wrong. And here\u2019s where I\u2019m gonna piss you off. You\u2019re using Eliza as an excuse. After all the shit that\u2019s happened to you with men, you don\u2019t believe any man would want you without an ulterior motive.\u201d</p><p>Skylar snapped, \u201cExcuse me, but that has been the case in every goddamned relationship I\u2019ve ever been in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Kade know about Ted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I want to share that humiliation with him right off the bat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but he needs to know.\u201d India softened her tone. \u201cWould it really be so bad to open yourself up to Kade? To trust him? To let down your guard? And yes, let him have a little bit of control in your relationship?\u201d</p><p>For the first time since Eliza\u2019s birth, Sky wondered if she\u2019d ever be able to break that sheet of glass she kept between herself and the rest of the world. Why did the wall of defense she\u2019d built feel like a prison rather than self-protection?</p><p>\u201cSis?\u201d India prompted.</p><p>\u201cIt terrifies me to think of giving Kade control even temporarily. Part of me worries he\u2019ll keep it and I\u2019ll never get it back. I\u2019ve been there, Indy. I\u2019ll never make that mistake again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re making another mistake, maybe a worse one, by not giving Kade a fair shot at proving he won\u2019t abuse your trust. By holding yourself back from what could be the best thing that ever happened to you.\u201d India pointed at Eliza and got in Skylar\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cOh, I know you say Eliza is the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to you, but without Kade, there wouldn\u2019t be an Eliza. So in my mind, that makes him the best thing that\u2019s happened to you. Think about it.\u201d</p><p>The chimes jingled out front and India left.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>The late afternoon sun burned across the dirt, reflecting off the metal fence at the back of the corral. Been an eternity since Kade spent time in the chutes and barn behind the Boars Nest. Seemed a lifetime ago he\u2019d called this place home.</p><p>His brother and his cousin had been busy beavers in the last twelve months. Hauling away broken down equipment, replacing fences, painting outbuildings. The old place looked like a ranch, rather than a rural slum.</p><p>\u201cGetcha head in the game, cuz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt, we flat-out suck at this. Even another week of practice wouldn\u2019t help us none,\u201d Kade hollered over the stall.</p><p>\u201cKwitcher belly-achin\u2019. Watch the barrier this time.\u201d</p><p>Kane\u2014aka newly self-christened as Buck\u2014whooped, \u201cGentlemen, start your horses!\u201d and dropped the orange rope. The calf took off out of the chute in a red blur, Colt and Kade hot on its heels.</p><p>Dirt flew, saddles creaked, ropes twirled in the hot, dusty air. Both men let their ropes loose at the same time; Kade aimed for the head; Colt for the back feet.</p><p>Each rope hit the mark and the calf jerked to a stop. The horses knew the drill, backing up in opposite directions until the rope was pulled taut and the calf was stretched between them like a Chinese finger-pull.</p><p>Kade wiped his forehead as he waited the four seconds the calf had to be down for their time to even count.</p><p>\u201cTime!\u201d</p><p>Buck raced into the paddock and untied the calf. \u201cSeven point eight seconds. Not bad.\u201d</p><p>Colt coiled his rope after Buck released the calf. \u201cLeast we didn\u2019t break the barrier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeast we caught the goddamn thing,\u201d Kade said. \u201cThat piss-poor time ain\u2019t gonna win us a dime tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t about money.\u201d</p><p>Kade squinted at Colt. \u201cWhat the hell are we competin\u2019 for then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonor.\u201d Colt spit out a wad of chewing tobacco. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFor Christsake, Colt, that\u2019s the dumbest damn thing I ever heard.

They been travelin\u2019 the circuit team ropin\u2019 on a regular basis?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNah. But that don\u2019t mean they ain\u2019t been practicin\u2019 together down at the south end of the ranch when we\u2019ve been up here workin\u2019 on our separate sections. If you\u2019ll remember, they whupped our butts but good last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was damn near seven years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, ain\u2019t that the time Cam and Carter teamed up?\u201d Buck asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. Folks were laughin\u2019 at my brothers attempts at ropin\u2019 and wrestlin\u2019, instead of laughin\u2019 at the damn rodeo clown,\u201d Colt grumbled. \u201cSo it is about honor. The honor of kickin\u2019 our cousins\u2019 sorry butts in front of the whole county.\u201d</p><p>Kade loosened his grip on the reins and patted Colby\u2019s old rodeo horse on the neck.</p><p>\u201cDidja think that maybe folks\u2019ll be laughin\u2019 at us instead?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope, because we\u2019re gonna win and make \u2019em choke on our dust.\u201d</p><p>Buck snorted. \u201cYou know Trevor Glanzer and Cash Big Crow are competin\u2019? And they were both professional rodeo cowboys. If any team\u2019s got a leg up, it\u2019s them. Or Dag\u2019s old partner, Jess Barton.\u201d</p><p>Silence cut through the dirty air. It\u2019d be the first year without Dag or Uncle Harland.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, it\u2019s about honor.\u201d</p><p>Kade realized Colt\u2019s insistence on participating was a tribute to their cousin. That put the whole thing in a different light. \u201cOnly way we\u2019re gonna beat them guys if we keep practicin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me. Load up another calf, Buck.\u201d Colt spurred his horse back to the chutes and Kade returned to his side.</p><p>After the team roping practice, Buck nagged Kade into hazing for him while he attempted to steer wrestle. But none of the taunts from either of his crazy relatives would convince Kade to climb on the back of a bull at tomorrow\u2019s rodeo.</p><p>Two hours later, dusty, sore and tired, Kade, Buck and Colt were sitting on the tailgates of their trucks, drinking iced tea out of mason jars. The sun hung low in the purple sky.</p> <p>Talk turned from rodeo competition to cattle to ranch business to women. The conversation wasn\u2019t nearly as raunchy as it\u2019d been in years past. Kade didn\u2019t know whether it was because they weren\u2019t liquored up, or because they\u2019d all grown up.</p><p>\u201cYou bringin\u2019 that baby of yours to the rodeo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa says everybody\u2019s gonna be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat don\u2019t surprise me.\u201d It occurred to him Skylar hadn\u2019t talked to him about anything the last couple days. Maybe she didn\u2019t want to hang out with his kin at the rodeo. After his I-control-all-the-sex-and-you\u2019ll-give-it-to-me-anyway-I-want-it ultimatum, maybe she didn\u2019t want to hang out with him.</p><p>His conscience piped up. Can you blame her?</p><p>He shoved aside that guilty thought. He was trying to help Skylar access a side of herself that scared her. He was trying to give them both a shot at real intimacy without barriers. He\u2019d never do a blasted thing to hurt her and she knew it. She was just being stubborn. And controlling. Which brought him back to square one.</p><p>\u201cBeen a real baby explosion around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe McKay name ain\u2019t gonna die out any time soon.\u201d He smiled. \u201cExcept for our line, bein\u2019s I have a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s it like, havin\u2019 a kid?\u201d Colt asked.</p><p>\u201cWeird. Cool. Cool as hell, actually. Eliza is a lot of fun. She\u2019s growin\u2019 every damn day, which is a kick to watch. But she\u2019s a lot of work, feedin\u2019 her, changin\u2019 her, and holdin\u2019 her all the time. Mostly it don\u2019t feel like work. I like doin\u2019 it. When she looks at me...it\u2019s like I want to do everything in my power to protect her and make her happy.\u201d</p><p>Funny. That\u2019s how he felt about Skylar too. Still, at that honest admission, Kade braced himself for his brother and his cousin to rag on him about being baby-whipped, but they didn\u2019t make a smart ass remark.</p><p>In fact, Colt said, \u201cWe gonna be hearin\u2019 weddin\u2019 bells soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey ain\u2019t gonna be ringin\u2019 for me.\u201d He chugged the rest of his tea and passed the empty jar to Colt. \u201cLater.\u201d He climbed in his truck and went home.</p><p>The house was quiet. Skylar didn\u2019t wait supper on him, although she\u2019d left a plate in the refrigerator, which was so damn sweet it gave him a funny tickle in his chest. He ate the beef and mashed potatoes cold, barely tasting it. Damn lonely eating by himself. He\u2019d gotten used to his family\u2019s company in the last three weeks.</p><p>Kade showered. Checked on the baby and wandered downstairs. Skylar dozed on the couch. The baby monitor sat on the coffee table and the TV droned in the background.</p><p>For some reason, an odd sense of peace filled him at the domestic scene. He snagged the remote and settled on the floor, not wanting to disturb her rest.</p><p>An hour or so later Sky stirred behind him.</p><p>\u201cHey. How long have you been home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouple hours. Before you ask, she\u2019s fine. She\u2019s still sleepin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m that predictable, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you just think about her first. You\u2019re a good mama, Sky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t say that if you\u2019d seen me earlier today.\u201d</p><p>Kade turned around. Sky\u2019s face was blotchy. Her usually sparkling eyes were a red-rimmed and sad. \u201cWhy? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEliza screamed. I mean she really screamed. Literally for hours. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Skylar explained in such detail Kade found himself wincing at her obvious anxiety. She finished with, \u201cWhen I fed her right before I tucked her in bed, that sweet baby girl just looked at me with those big blue eyes, like she was...disappointed in me for being such a bad mom.\u201d A small hiccupping sob punctuated her distress.</p><p>\u201cAh, sweetheart. C\u2019mere.\u201d He crawled next to her on the couch, bringing her into his arms. Skylar curled her body into his and cried softly. He let her, even when it broke his damn heart. After she\u2019d calmed down, he brushed his lips across the crown of her head.</p><p>\u201cSorry you had a rough day. I expect Eliza Belle will give us both more than a few of</p><p>\u2019em.\u201d</p><p>She nodded against his chest.</p><p>As Kade ran his hands up and down her spine, he realized Skylar hadn\u2019t granted him much opportunity to just hold her. To soothe her. She hadn\u2019t shown her vulnerable side to him. Ever.</p><p>Now that she\u2019d finally lowered her guard, his earlier demand of her total sexual submission made him feel like a fucking heel. Maybe if he didn\u2019t bring it up again, she\u2019d forget about it, allowing him to gentle her like he\u2019d do with a skittish horse. Oh, he still craved her succulent body nine-ways-\u2019til-Sunday, no doubt about that, but he wanted her heart too.</p><p>And that took time.</p><p>Good thing Kade was a patient man.</p><p>He closed his eyes and breathed her in, matching his exhalations to hers and floating off to sleep.</p><p>Hours later a wailing cry startled them both. Skylar groaned.</p><p>\u201cStay put, I\u2019ll get her.\u201d Kade fed Eliza and rocked her back to sleep. He couldn\u2019t drum up the energy to climb the stairs so he nestled her in the bassinet. Then he snuggled behind Skylar on the couch, covering them with a blanket. He waited for Sky to wake up and protest, but she just burrowed deeper into his body and sighed.</p><p>Skylar woke with a start.</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d The warm body next to hers shifted. The very hard, very warm male body.</p><p>\u201cWhat...Kade?\u201d She blinked at the sun peeping through the lace curtains. \u201cWhy are we in the living room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust\u2019ve fallen asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve\u2014we\u2019ve been here together? All night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly, yeah. I ain\u2019t surprised you don\u2019t remember. You were pretty wrung out last night when I got home.\u201d</p><p>No kidding. Sky remembered feeling alone and inept after returning from Sundance.</p><p>Crying herself to sleep on the couch, missing Kade like crazy, wondering why she kept pushing the man away when she wanted him around.</p><p>When she woken up and saw Kade, she\u2019d been so relieved, she\u2019d blurted out every sordid detail of her bad day with Eliza. In the face of her complete meltdown, Kade had been amazingly sweet, not judgmental. He\u2019d made her feel safe. And competent. And cared for. Sort of...loved.</p><p>So how had she repaid his kindness? By blubbering all over the poor man and clinging to him all night so he couldn\u2019t escape to his own bed.</p><p>Her cheeks heated and she tried to wiggle free.</p><p>\u201cHey now, what\u2019s the rush?\u201d His voice was gravelly with sleep. \u201cI gotta admit I like wakin\u2019 up with you in my arms, Sky. I\u2019ve missed you the last couple of days.\u201d</p><p>A pregnant pause hung between them, as if he was waiting for something from her.</p><p>The truth, probably.</p><p>After all this man has done for you, he deserves your honesty. Face it: you deserve to be honest with yourself.</p><p>She relaxed into him and simply said, \u201cI missed you too.\u201d She felt him smile against the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>They stayed embraced in easy silence for a good long time.</p><p>Kade\u2019s hand lazily traced her spine. \u201cSo what time you comin\u2019 to the rodeo today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat rodeo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Devil\u2019s Tower Rodeo outside of Sundance. You know, the one me\u2019n Colt are team ropin\u2019 in? Seems my whole family is gonna be there, and everyone is chompin\u2019 at the bit to meet Eliza. It\u2019s gotten to be some kinda crazy big deal with a family reunion.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen why is this the first I\u2019ve heard of it, Kade McKay?\u201d</p><p>His hand froze. \u201cShit. I didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>Skylar lifted up to look at him. \u201cPositive. You haven\u2019t exactly been around the last couple days to tell me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh hell, Sky, I meant to. I\u2019m so damn sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Could he read between the lines and understand she was sorry for so many things that\u2019d gone wrong between them?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d understand if you didn\u2019t want to come on such short notice.\u201d</p> <p>His sheepish expression squashed her intent to keep teasing him. \u201cLucky thing Miz Eliza Belle and I don\u2019t have anything else to do so she can make her McKay family debut, huh?\u201d</p><p>Relief swept his face. \u201cLucky indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome. Why?\u201d</p><p>Sky could scarcely think over the clucking noises echoing in her head. Truth was, she might be totally confident when it came to running her business, but this social situation absolutely petrified her, especially when she\u2019d heard rumors about the wild, boisterous McKay family. She also feared they\u2019d circle the wagons around her, holding pitchforks, demanding an answer to the same question AJ McKay had posed: why hadn\u2019t she told Kade about her pregnancy?</p><p>\u201cSweetheart? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>That pesky \u201cbe honest\u201d voice appeared again. \u201cI\u2019m nervous, okay? I don\u2019t know anything about big families and if you won\u2019t be there I\u2019ll probably freak out and then people will think I\u2019m some kind of West Coast nutjob\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kade muffled her protests with a gentle kiss. \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right, I\u2019ll be around as much as I can. That said, I ain\u2019t gonna lie. My family is a bit overbearin\u2019. They\u2019ll ask all sorts of personal questions that quite frankly, ain\u2019t none of their damn business. But I\u2019ve seen you in action, Skylar. You can handle anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything but you, it seems,\u201d she murmured. Without conscious thought, she traced the dark stubble on his jaw; her fingers detoured to outline his full lips. \u201cYou have such an intriguing mouth. Even when you\u2019re scowling at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know you think you\u2019re just another one of those McKay men that populate three Wyoming counties, but you are different, Kade. From Kane. From your cousins.</p><p>Even your standard issue McKay blue eyes are more compelling...they draw me in.</p><p>Every damn time. Anyone who can\u2019t see the differences is a fool.\u201d Why haven\u2019t I seen it?</p><p>Why have I acted like such a fool?</p> <p>\u201cSky\u2014\u201d</p><p>Eliza squeaked once. Twice. Louder the third time.</p><p>\u201cOops, there\u2019s our alarm clock.\u201d Saved from further embarrassing admissions about his virtues, she rolled off the couch. Impulsively she leaned over and kissed Kade\u2019s forehead. \u201cThanks for last night.\u201d</p><p>She felt him staring as she cooed to their baby and got a jumpstart on the big day.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>\u201cSkylar! You\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She bit back a smile at the sight of Kimi McKay nearly skipping toward her. \u201cDon\u2019t you mean Eliza is here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, smarty. I\u2019m just as happy to see you as I am my beautifully perfect granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>Kade didn\u2019t get all his sweet-talkin\u2019 ability from the McKays. Sky had no doubt Kimi could charm the bees from the flowers. \u201cHere she is. All decked out for her first rodeo.\u201d</p><p>Kimi laughed with delight. \u201cWhere on earth did you find jeans that small? With rhinestones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt India. She goes a little insane buying Eliza clothes. Toys. Books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that...\u201d Kimi smiled. \u201cI sorta went hog wild too, but that cute girlie stuff is impossible to resist, especially since I\u2019ve never had the chance to buy it before. I keep reminding Kade to load it all up and take it to you. He keeps forgetting.\u201d</p><p>Casually, she asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you bring it over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Pick a day. If you want, I\u2019ll even put you on babysitting duties while I\u2019m at work and you can have Miz Eliza all to yourself. Of course, you\u2019ll have to hand her over when Kade gets home. He\u2019s a bit territorial when it comes to time with his girl.\u201d</p><p>Kimi made a frowning, blinking expression.</p><p>Had she said the wrong thing to Kade\u2019s mother? \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to presume\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPresume? Lord, girl, you really don\u2019t know how much I appreciate the invite.\u201d</p><p>It was Sky\u2019s turn to act surprised. \u201cYou don\u2019t need an invitation, Kimi. You\u2019re welcome any time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019ve been tickled the couple of times Kade has brought Eliza into Sundance so I could see her. But I haven\u2019t wanted to butt in and be a nuisance. Overstep my bounds. Meddle where I wasn\u2019t wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems we both have boundary issues,\u201d Sky murmured. \u201cAs far as meddling?</p><p>You\u2019re Eliza\u2019s grandma. Actually, you\u2019re her only grandma.\u201d A tiny burst of sadness broke inside her, thinking about her own mother never knowing her child and she looked away before she refocused on Kimi\u2019s all-knowing eyes. \u201cJust because Kade and I are...whatever we are, I didn\u2019t intend to keep Eliza away from him or any of her family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you tell anyone Kade is her father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Kade deserved to know first.\u201d She glanced at their alert daughter. \u201cThe way the situation played out wasn\u2019t ideal for anyone. But the bottom line is, Kade\u2019s a really great dad. You should be proud of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any idea how much that means to me. All of it.\u201d Kimi wiped a tear and laughed. \u201cLord. I\u2019m leaking.\u201d</p><p>Sky was leaking a little too. Flustered, she handed the squirming baby to her grandma.</p><p>\u201cWhat a little angel. Your mama did good, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Eliza cooed back her agreement.</p><p>Before Sky started leaking again, she said, \u201cSo I brought everything but the kitchen sink. Help me figure out what to load up.\u201d</p><p>Kimi eyed the pile in the back of the car. \u201cThings sure have changed since my boys were babies. I would\u2019ve loved to have one of them double strollers.\u201d She winked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe next time you and Kade will have a set of twins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m greedy, aren\u2019t I? Cal and I always wanted to have more kids, but it never happened, so feel free to overfill my arms and life with grandbabies.\u201d</p><p>Rather than feel put on the spot, Skylar laughed. She and Kimi chatted easily as Sky pushed the empty stroller across the bumpy ground while Kimi walked beside her holding Eliza. Family friends would stop and admire the newest McKay baby, congratulating both mom and grandma, and Kade in absentia. Another pleasant revelation was so many people knew about the Sky Blue store and already considered her part of the community. It made Sky wonder if she was spending too much time at the manufacturing plant and not enough putting a face with her products. If she should take India\u2019s advice and let Annie have more responsibility so she could focus on local marketing.</p><p>When they reached the entrance, Kimi said, \u201cI believe these tickets are for seats in the upper stands, but I didn\u2019t know how long you\u2019d want to stay up there. Gets mighty hot and it\u2019ll be a while before Kade competes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is he competing in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeam ropin\u2019 for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll rodeo events are dangerous, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a chance he\u2019ll get hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, the fun afternoon took on a more ominous slant. \u201cThen why would he do it?\u201d Sky couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of Kade purposely putting himself at risk. She couldn\u2019t stand it, dammit, it\u2019d hurt her to watch the big, tough cowboy get injured.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m thankful neither he nor Kane were obsessed with being a rodeo star like some of his cousins. Kade dabbled in events. Nothing serious like Chase is doing now and Colby and Dag done.\u201d A stark look flashed in Kimi\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Skylar placed her hand on Kimi\u2019s arm. \u201cSometimes I have zero tact. I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to bring up painful memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, sweetie, but it\u2019s unavoidable, especially on a day like today. Dag\u2019s death was hard on all of us. Then Dag\u2019s father, my brother Harland, died not a month later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I didn\u2019t know. How awful for your family. That\u2019s so sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a mess. Colt was in rehab. No one could get a hold of Cam. Chase was competing in a special PBR event in Mexico and he couldn\u2019t get home. Kade had only been up north for two weeks so Kane had to drive up there to give him the bad news and bring him home for the service. Poor Chassie was a zombie. Everything between Dag\u2019s funeral and Harland\u2019s funeral was kind of a blur.\u201d She shook her head as if to clear it.</p><p>\u201cBeen a really rough year for the Wests and McKays, which is just another reason we were all so tickled about Eliza.</p><p>\u201cSo to take the long way around answering your question, I suspect Kade is competing because Dag isn\u2019t here. Lots of Dag\u2019s rodeo friends are showing up today to lend support and engage in a little friendly competition.\u201d All at once an enormous grin lit up Kimi\u2019s face. \u201cSpeaking of...Chassie. Over here.\u201d</p><p>Skylar turned and watched as the woman sauntered toward them\u2014saunter being the operative word. Her gait screamed one hundred percent cowgirl. So did her clothes, she was no rhinestone belt wearing buckle bunny. She wore battered lace-up boots, skin-tight faded jeans and a long-sleeved T-shirt emblazoned with, \u201cReal Cowgirls Do It Best in the Dirt\u201d. Dark brown hair as long and glossy as a horse\u2019s tail was plaited in a single, thick braid that fell past her butt. An angular face\u2014apple cheekbones, pointed chin, broad forehead and a generous mouth that hinted of Native American ancestry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI tried calling you, but Uncle Cal said you were already gone. Is he coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect him any time now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh wow, is this who I think it is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep. This is Eliza Belle. Isn\u2019t she a doll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely precious.\u201d Chassie bent closer. \u201cWe girls are few and far between so we gotta stick together. Man. She does look like Kade. Bet he\u2019s struttin\u2019 around like cock of the walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he is.\u201d</p><p>Chassie straightened. Her liquid brown eyes sparkled, and her sweet, wide grin was infectious. \u201cAh. You\u2019d be the vessel who brought forth the long-awaited McKay girl baby?\u201d</p><p>Skylar smiled. \u201cAptly put.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSkylar Ellison, this is my niece Chassie West.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Chassie Glanzer now.\u201d She wiped her hand on her jeans before she offered it to Sky. \u201cNice to meetcha, Skylar. Congrats on the wee one and welcome to the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Chassie wasn\u2019t much bigger than Kimi and Sky felt positively Amazonian next to the petite, skinny women.</p><p>\u201cChassie just got married in February. She and her husband Trevor took over Harland\u2019s ranch after he passed on. How you doin\u2019 today, honey?\u201d</p><p>Chassie\u2019s smile faded. \u201cIt\u2019s weird being here without them. I keep expecting to see Dag hanging on the fence behind the chutes, waiting to ride. Or Daddy standing in line for a beer.\u201d</p><p>Her look of sadness prompted Sky offer, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for both your losses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI appreciate you sayin\u2019 so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat all is Trevor competing in today?\u201d Kimi asked.</p><p>\u201cEverything. Poor delusional man thinks he can win the all around title. I know he\u2019s doin\u2019 it in Dag\u2019s memory, which is unbelievably sweet, and yet stupid, because he\u2019s going up against hungry pups in their late teens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like Trevor is old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. And I ain\u2019t gonna complain about seein\u2019 him in tight chaps, sexy rodeo gear, swingin\u2019 a rope and buckin\u2019 hard.\u201d Her brilliant smile reappeared. \u201cBut they\u2019re still gonna kick Kade and Colt\u2019s ass in team roping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Wanna bet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hate to take your money, Aunt Kimi, but I will. Twenty says Cash and Trevor win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d</p> <p>Chassie cocked an eyebrow at Skylar. \u201cNot gonna bet on your man?\u201d</p><p>Was Kade her man? A possessive little voice piped up with a firm yes, so Sky said,</p><p>\u201cBring it. Twenty on the McKays.\u201d</p><p>Kimi whooped, \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heading to the reunion, Aunt K?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. We\u2019ll see you in there.\u201d</p><p>They wound their way through the crowd, stopping on the edge of the bleachers.</p><p>Kimi passed Eliza back to her and fussed with the collar of Sky\u2019s shirt. Smoothed a flyway strand from her cheek. Acted very motherly, which just made her like Kimi McKay all the more. \u201cYou are pretty as a picture. You ready?\u201d</p><p>Skylar blushed. \u201cReady for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo meet the West family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought we were meeting the McKay family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s later tonight and tomorrow. Lucky you gets a double whammy this weekend.</p><p>This is my side of Kade\u2019s family, the West side. You\u2019ll probably recognize some McKay family members, since my sister Carolyn married Carson McKay, Calvin\u2019s brother, making our kids double cousins.\u201d She grinned. \u201cConfused yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No wonder Cord said you should all wear name tags.\u201d Skylar squinted at the large cluster of people milling beneath a big tent. \u201cMaybe you should point out which ones are family members.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, they\u2019re all family members.\u201d</p><p>There had to be at least fifty people in there. \u201cOh. My. God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmile. And when Genevieve West starts talking about quilting, run like hell.\u201d</p><p>Talk about being in a fish bowl. Skylar wished Kade would\u2019ve been there, helping her navigate the waters. Faces blurred. She\u2019d never remember all their names. And this was only half of Kade\u2019s family.</p><p>After an hour passed, a feeling of panic started. A sense she was an interloper, even when everyone was friendly and went out of their way to include her. She and Kade and Eliza must\u2019ve gotten fifteen invitations to dinner. Several women promised to check out her Sky Blue products. It was unusual in that...no one thought it was strange to automatically embrace Skylar and Eliza as part of their family. Their immediate acceptance made her feel humbled. Grateful. Swamped by so many conflicting emotions, Sky feared she\u2019d break down, and wouldn\u2019t that leave a great first impression? Instead, she reverted to her normal behavior, keeping a polite distance as her eyes searched for an escape route.</p><p>Then Kimi was by her side again, soothing her, rescuing her. \u201cLooks like you could use some fresh air, sweets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I could. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Outside, Kimi said, \u201cWhat happened? Did Janet harangue you about you and Kade livin\u2019 in sin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Nothing like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>Before she schooled her tongue to stay still, Sky blurted out, \u201cI\u2019ve never met so many genuinely nice people in my life and it was like they were happy to meet me, not giving me the evil eye wondering who the hell I was crashing their party.\u201d</p><p>Kimi chuckled. \u201cNot used to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m used to people ignoring or sucking up because they want something from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it must\u2019ve been like growing up, always questioning people\u2019s ulterior motives. Must make it hard to trust not only yourself, but everyone around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatcha see is what you get with us, honey.\u201d Kimi tucked a loose hair behind Skylar\u2019s ear and murmured, \u201cI\u2019ll be damned. You are a little shy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout some things.\u201d She studied Kimi\u2019s kind eyes. \u201cIs it obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to me.\u201d</p><p>Skylar gave her a skeptical look and Kimi cracked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s partially mother\u2019s instinct, and partially Kade making me promise to look out for you because he can\u2019t be with you. He\u2019s worried about leavin\u2019 you alone to deal with our crazy family.\u201d</p><p>That man embodied sweet and something undeniably warm moved through Sky.</p><p>Kimi squeezed Sky\u2019s shoulder. \u201cEven knowing that, and as much fun as we\u2019re having, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve gotta leave you to your own devices for a bit. The rodeo is about to start. You better get settled and I\u2019ll meet you later.\u201d</p><p>Skylar climbed the stairs in the grand stand. Clouds covered the sun, blocking some of the heat. She secured her sleepy baby in the Snugli, strapping it to her chest and stood next to the railing. The noise or the crowds didn\u2019t bother Eliza. Sky took a minute to breathe it all in. The scents, the sights, the sounds of rodeo. Nothing like it in the world.</p><p>Saddle bronc riding ended and the steer wrestling\u2014bulldogging\u2014was set to begin.</p><p>She listened to the announcers extolling the qualities needed to be a great bulldogger, and couldn\u2019t fathom why any man would throw himself off a moving horse onto a moving horned animal.</p><p>\u201cSkylar?\u201d</p><p>Startled by someone calling out her name, she looked down and saw Chassie grinning up at her.</p><p>\u201cHey. You wanna come sit with us?\u201d Chassie pointed to a small group of people by the bottom railing.</p><p>Yes. \u201cOh. I wouldn\u2019t want to impose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. You\u2019re family and we\u2019d love to have you.\u201d Chassie winked. \u201cI\u2019m always lookin\u2019 for a leg up on McKay gossip. Plus, it\u2019ll be fun. I promise. Nothing like the chaos in the tent at the West family reunion. You were lookin\u2019 a little goggle-eyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d Sky followed Chassie and listened while she made introductions.</p><p>\u201cEveryone, this is Skylar Ellison, and the sleeping babe is the infamous Eliza Belle, who proud papa Kade\u2019s been braggin\u2019 on to everyone within spittin\u2019 distance. So who\u2019s next?</p><p>Name and family affiliation to make it easier on Skylar since she\u2019s already been subjected to the West family today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Macie McKay, we\u2019ve met at your store a few times.\u201d</p><p>They had met, but for some reason Sky hadn\u2019t connected her to the McKay family.</p><p>\u201cYou run Dewey\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOversee it since we live in Canyon River half the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCat does a great job. The food is wonderful and the place is so homey.\u201d</p><p>Macie beamed. \u201cThanks. Is India here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s holding down the fort. I hope we get lots of traffic because of the rodeo.\u201d</p><p>A long, lean man with McKay blue eyes and a riot of unruly curls waved. \u201cCarter McKay of the Carson McKay branch. I\u2019m Kade\u2019s cousin. Macie\u2019s my wife, and our son Thane is a couple months older than Eliza. They\u2019ll have a lot of fun growin\u2019 up together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaising hell together you mean. Thane and my twins, Rider and Ella, are napping in the camper under Velma\u2019s watchful eye.\u201d The older blonde woman, who appeared to be pregnant, thrust out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Gemma Big Crow. No relation to these McKay yahoos, except by marriage. My husband Cash, is team roping with Chassie\u2019s husband Trevor, and sorry to say it, hon, but they\u2019re gonna kick some major butt today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish,\u201d Carter said. \u201cKade and Colt are on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Dad and Trev rule.\u201d</p><p>Chassie leaned over. \u201cFYI, Macie is Cash\u2019s daughter from a previous relationship.</p><p>Carter is Colt\u2019s younger brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never going to keep all this straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt takes time, but you will. Despite their surface similarities they\u2019ve all got distinct personalities.\u201d</p><p>Sky thought of Kade\u2019s comment about feeling interchangeable with not only his twin, but his male McKay cousins and felt a punch of sympathy. If she didn\u2019t know him, she\u2019d probably be like everyone else and lump him in with his family. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The announcer\u2019s voice boomed. \u201cFirst up. Buck McKay. Not a McKay name I\u2019m familiar with.\u201d</p><p>Carter laughed. \u201cThe SOB really did it. Said he was gonna do something drastic to set himself apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSet himself apart from who?\u201d Macie demanded.</p> <p>\u201cFrom Colt, but mostly from Kade. Kane\u2014aka Buck\u2014is determined to get his new nickname to stick. Aunt Kimi is appalled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Kade his hazer?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. Poor Kade got roped into all sorts of events,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>Sky leaned over and asked Chassie, \u201cWhat in the world is a hazer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rider who keeps the steer in a straight line for the bulldogger is called a hazer.\u201d</p> <p>The chute opened, a steer bolted into the arena and two horses raced after it.</p><p>Skylar didn\u2019t see Buck launch himself onto the steer and flip it over. She was too busy staring at Kade\u2014all grace and control\u2014atop the sleek and powerful horse. It was the first time she\u2019d seen him duded up in full cowboy regalia. She was used to him coming home from work, dirty and tired, but she\u2019d never seen him look like this.</p><p>Was chasing down cattle on horseback part of his daily routine? A guilty feeling twisted her gut when she realized she knew nothing about his life as a rancher. Talk about self-centered. He\u2019d taken a big interest in her business, why hadn\u2019t she returned the favor?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking flushed.\u201d Gemma scooted over and thumped the bench. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Skylar rubbed circles on Eliza\u2019s back as she dozed in the front pack. The normally soothing motion did nothing to soothe Skylar because she was wound tight as a spool of thread.</p><p>After a minute or so, Gemma said, \u201cFirst time you\u2019ve seen Kade in the arena?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFirst time I\u2019ve seen him on a horse. Seeing how he moves and rides...I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>Gemma patted her leg. \u201cWe\u2019ve all experienced that bowled over feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to know, because I feel like the world\u2019s biggest idiot for being ignorant to this part of Kade\u2019s life. He doesn\u2019t talk about it and I\u2019m ashamed to say, dealing with Eliza and running my business I haven\u2019t even asked him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, honey, don\u2019t beat yourself up. Most men are like that\u2014especially cowboys.</p><p>You\u2019ve gotta pry information out of them.\u201d</p><p>Skylar nodded. It didn\u2019t help that Kade had to pry things out of her too.</p> <p>Kade made a sharp turn on the horse, bumping up in the saddle, and she caught a glimpse of his tight ass, his long muscular legs hugging the horseflesh as he stretched taller in the stirrups. Add in the contestant number flapping on his broad back, the cowboy hat shading his handsome face, making him look mysterious and dominant, and Skylar let out a purely feminine sigh.</p><p>\u201cI recognize that sound. There\u2019s something enormously appealing about a man who knows his way around ropes and reins and rides with confidence. But I think the attraction boils down to seeing a man control all that raw power of an animal, and the horse trusts him not to abuse it. Takes guts and finesse. Not an easy combination, but damn potent when it works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn potent,\u201d Sky muttered.</p><p>The steer wrestling ended and the team roping started.</p><p>\u201cWe have a great line up, folks. Only one go-round, which means only one chance for these cowboys to put a little jingle in their pockets today. On deck is a coupla brothers, ranchers from Weston County. Quinn and Bennett McKay.\u201d</p><p>More McKays?</p><p>The rope barrier fell, the calf ran out and two men on horseback thundered past. The ropes spun and snapped and hit their marks, head and heels. The crowd waited for the judge and the time. Eight point four seconds flashed on the scoreboard.</p><p>Carter said, \u201cNot bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGonna have to do way better than that to beat our guys.\u201d Chassie and Gemma high-fived each other.</p><p>\u201cChass, you lookin\u2019 to up our bet? Fine. I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>Macie slapped her hand on Carter\u2019s butt to keep him from reaching for his wallet.</p><p>\u201cWrong, moneybags. I\u2019m not covering your bets when you lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, I can\u2019t help it you\u2019re the breadwinner in our household.\u201d</p><p>The next competitors were announced. The header missed with his loop and the team received no time. The team after them broke the barrier and didn\u2019t score either.</p><p>\u201cNext up another set of McKays, Colton and Kade, local ranchers from right here around Sundance.\u201d The audience whooped and Skylar held her breath.</p><p>Again the calf raced out and dirt flew as Kade ripped past, left hand on the horse reins, his rope twirling above his head, his focus absolute. Colt brought up the rear, posture identical to Kade\u2019s. They weren\u2019t pretty, but they looked fast. The ropes were released at different times but each loop managed to snag the intended target. The calf bawled as it was jerked to the ground.</p><p>The judge trotted into the arena and nodded.</p><p>\u201cFolks, we have new leaders. Official time is seven point eight seconds.\u201d</p><p>Carter turned around and grinned at Skylar. \u201cSlap me some skin, sistah.\u201d</p><p>Skylar couldn\u2019t believe her giddiness that Kade and Colt had done so well.</p><p>Luck had it that Trevor and Cash were the last to go.</p><p>\u201cThe crowd is in for a treat today. Our next team is comprised of two former professional rodeo cowboys. Trevor Glanzer and Cash Big Crow. Both these fine men have made it numerous times, not only to the Dodge Circuit Finals, but to the NFR. Let\u2019s hear a big Sundance welcome.\u201d</p><p>Gemma, Macie and Chassie let out enthusiastic yells and wolf whistles.</p><p>Same drill as before. The calf shot out, the cowboys tore past, Trevor in the header position, Cash as the heeler. Even as a novice Skylar could tell the difference between the pros and amateurs. The two men were flawless. Perfectly synchronized. The calf stayed down through the judge\u2019s inspection.</p><p>\u201cTime recorded at four point two. Folks, give a hand to your team roping champions, Trevor Glanzer and Cash Big Crow.\u201d</p><p>They waved to the crowd and exited the arena.</p><p>As one, Macie, Chassie and Gemma held their palms out to Carter. \u201cPay up.\u201d</p><p>Skylar pulled a twenty out of the diaper bag and grumbled good-naturedly right along with Carter.</p><p>Eliza woke. \u201cThat\u2019s my cue. Thanks for letting me hang out with you guys. It was fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring more money next time,\u201d Chassie teased.</p><p>Sky exited the stands with a grin on her face and moved the stroller to a shaded picnic area. She changed Eliza, hoping the bottle was warm enough not to upset her stomach.</p><p>A shadow fell over the stroller canopy. \u201cNeed a hand with that beautiful baby, little lady?\u201d</p><p>Kade.</p><p>She straightened up and crashed right into him.</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d He curled his big hands around her biceps to keep her from stumbling.</p><p>\u201cCareful.\u201d</p><p>At that moment Skylar knew being careful with Kade McKay was no longer an option. She wanted a man who could soothe her with a simple smile. Inflame her with just one look. A man with guts enough to make the demand of complete sexual control over her, and with finesse enough to carry it off. A man who thought she was sexy. A man so freakin\u2019 hot that she was a fool for taking so long to come to her sexual senses.</p><p>She placed her palms on his chest. The cotton shirt was stiff and damp, the flesh beneath firm and warm. Lust surged through her.</p><p>\u201cSky? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She met his concerned blue gaze and it steeled her resolve. \u201cYou gave me until Saturday to make my decision about things changing between us in regard to our\u2014 my\u2014</p><p>previous intimacy issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sky briefly put her fingers over his lips. \u201cMy answer is yes.\u201d</p><p>Stunned silence.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever been more serious in my life, mister.\u201d</p><p>Then he said, \u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home and I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Right now.\u201d He kissed her fingertips and closed the gap between their bodies.</p><p>\u201cNo backin\u2019 out, Sky. Once you\u2019re mine, you\u2019re mine, exactly the way I want you, any time, any place. I\u2019ll make allowances for us takin\u2019 care of Eliza, but that\u2019s it. So, you\u2019re sure you understand all I\u2019m demandin\u2019 of you?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, that is good. So good.\u201d He teased his soft lips over hers. \u201cNow, say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember it, because that\u2019s the last time you get to say no to me.\u201d Kade smashed his mouth to hers. She clung to him just to remain upright in the wake of his possession.</p><p>Someone yelled, \u201cGet a room.\u201d</p><p>Kade murmured against her mouth, \u201cThat\u2019s a damn fine idea.\u201d</p><p>Eliza chose that instant to remind them of her empty belly.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Grama? She\u2019s been wantin\u2019 time with her granddaughter, here\u2019s her chance.\u201d Kade whipped out his cell phone, his hot eyes locked on Skylar\u2019s. \u201cMa. You busy? You wanna watch Eliza for an hour so Sky and I can wander around? We\u2019re at a picnic area by the east entrance.\u201d He closed the phone. \u201cShe\u2019s on her way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there much to see around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, the only thing you\u2019re gonna see is my cock. Up close and personal.\u201d</p><p>Skylar didn\u2019t say a word. She couldn\u2019t, actually.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s how it\u2019s gonna play out. Soon as Eliza is settled, we\u2019re takin\u2019 a walk.</p><p>Straight to Colt\u2019s horse trailer. It has a sleepin\u2019 compartment with a real nice bed and a door that locks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been in a horse trailer that has a bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we ain\u2019t gonna be usin\u2019 the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Because you are gonna be on your knees.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Skylar said yes.</p><p>Sure as hell not what Kade expected, but he wasn\u2019t about to look a gift horse in the mouth.</p><p>At best, he\u2019d imagined her trying to negotiate a different scenario. At worst, well, it involved her seeking revenge by tying him up to the four-poster bed.</p><p>That fantasy had taken on a life of its own the last couple days. In his triple X</p><p>version, Skylar wore PVC, blood red lipstick and a lewd smile as she disciplined him.</p><p>Both his folks showed up to watch Eliza. His dad wasn\u2019t the type to go gaga over kids. Kade doubted Calvin McKay had changed a diaper in his life. So it really shocked him when his gruff pops plopped down, eager to hold his granddaughter.</p><p>\u201cWhy you starin\u2019 at me, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wonderin\u2019\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014if I know anything about babies?\u201d His dad smiled. \u201cBeen awhile, but we did have two boys at once, so I\u2019ve done my fair share of holdin\u2019 and rockin\u2019 and feedin\u2019 babies.\u201d</p><p>Kade hadn\u2019t considered that. \u201cWell, call me on my cell if you need anything. We\u2019ll be back in an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time,\u201d Kimi said. \u201cHave fun, we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Skylar seemed reluctant to go.</p><p>Kade skimmed his hand down her arm, threading their fingers together. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t leave her, or ask you to leave her if I thought there\u2019d be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe clock is tickin\u2019. I want you.\u201d He nuzzled her ear. \u201cI want to feel your mouth on me.\u201d They wended their way through campers, horse trailers and trucks. For once he didn\u2019t run into anyone he knew, so he wasn\u2019t forced to make small talk.</p><p>Which was a good thing. His brain was stuck on the image of Skylar looking up at him with his cock deep in her throat.</p><p>At Colt\u2019s horse trailer, he lightly rapped on the door to the sleeping quarters. \u201cColt?</p><p>You in there?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Kade removed the key and unlocked the door. Skylar stepped up first and he followed. After he pulled the shades and flipped the inside lock, he reached for her.</p><p>She melted into him, into the steamy kiss. He sensed a change in her, an acceptance.</p> <p>It\u2019d be easy to back off and be the undemanding, patient lover he\u2019d been in the past. But he wanted so much more. For both of them. And he didn\u2019t want to wait.</p><p>His lips slipped to her ear. \u201cOn your knees.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even hesitate. She used her hands on his body to support herself on her way down until she was kneeling.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s real good. Now undo my belt.\u201d</p><p>A couple of tugs and the heavy buckle hung by his right hip and the strap by his left hip. She started on the zipper without asking. If he really was a controlling bastard, he\u2019d point out she hadn\u2019t followed his instructions. Instead he watched as she let her instincts take over.</p><p>Zipper undone, Kade peeled the Wranglers and boxers down his legs until they hit the tops of his boots. The tail of his long shirt covered his erection, and he hastily unbuttoned it so there were no barriers between them.</p><p>Skylar inhaled sharply at the sight of his hard cock slapping against his belly. \u201cI\u2019ll warn you. I\u2019ve never been very good at this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me decide that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t judge me too harshly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never judge.\u201d He tenderly brushed the hair from her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m gonna love everything you do to me. Touch me, sweetheart. Please.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t grab the stiff rod, instead, she delicately cupped his balls. He groaned as she rolled the tight sac between her slender fingers like she was weighing dice. Then with deliberate care, she swept her thumb up center of his dick, allowing her nail to gently scrape under the rim of the swollen cockhead.</p><p>His cock twitched shamelessly for her attention.</p><p>Sky feathered her thumb through the fluid leaking from the tip. Loosely curling her fingers around his girth, she started to stroke.</p><p>Kade palmed the side of her face, bringing her mouth closer. \u201cNo hands yet. Mouth first. Lick it.\u201d</p><p>That pink tongue shot out and lapped at the vein throbbing up the length of his cock, from his tight balls to the tip. And slowly back down. And back up. On the last, gradual, wet pass, she wrapped her lips around the cockhead and sucked.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. More. Suck it in.\u201d</p><p>Her tentative hands inched up his thighs. He looked down to see her full lips separate to impart the intimate kiss. Bit by bit his cock disappeared into the warm haven of her mouth.</p><p>Kade hissed.</p><p>Encouraged by his moans, she took him deeper with each teasing wet glide, her movements more rhythmic, more confident. The tip of her tongue flicked the sweet spot below the slit as he pulled out, making his breath stutter and his head spin like an unbalanced tractor tire.</p><p>She offered him a secret smile, sucked intently and that wicked tongue flickered all over the good spots she\u2019d discovered.</p><p>Tingles raced up the back of his thighs like a thousand electric fingers. If he closed his eyes, he\u2019d fall on his ass. The sensation of her avid mouth, the scrape of her teeth, the curl of her tongue working his cock were mind blowing. Shutting his eyes meant not seeing this earthy, sexy woman learning to pleasure him. Watching her discover that pleasing her lover was as powerful and freeing as being on the receiving end of complete sexual attention.</p><p>His balls tightened. \u201cYou\u2019re keepin\u2019 me nice \u2019n wet. It\u2019s so fuckin\u2019 hot feelin\u2019 your mouth all warm and slippery. You like doin\u2019 this to me, doncha?\u201d</p><p>Skylar nodded even as her head bobbed.</p><p>\u201cSee how deep you can take me.\u201d</p><p>She breathed through her nose as he eased in until her lips were pressed to his pelvis and he was buried in that beautiful throat.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He withdrew. \u201cAgain.\u201d His damn knees shook with the need to come. He returned to shallow, quick strokes. Kade grabbed her right hand and circled it around his dick at the base. He lifted her chin so he could see her eyes. \u201cJesus. You should see the look on your face. So goddamn wanton you steal my breath, woman.\u201d He swept his thumb across the tantalizing line of her jawbone. \u201cStroke me with your hand while you\u2019re suckin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d She pumped his shaft from root halfway up the length a couple of times.</p><p>\u201cNot so tight. There. Christ. Like that. Oh fuck, exactly like that.\u201d</p><p>When Sky brought her mouth into play with her hands, the hot, wet suctioning concentration on the sensitive cockhead, he began to bump his hips, needing this submission from her. He threaded his fingers into her soft hair and the cool scent of rain-soaked flowers, an aroma uniquely hers, filled his lungs.</p><p>\u201cGod your mouth is so... Almost there. Faster. Yeah. Come on come on come on.</p><p>Shit. There it is, open, wider, ahh, yes. Suck. More. Harder.\u201d Kade resisted thrusting deep into her throat by releasing her hair and clenching his fists at his sides. His head fell back as liquid fire shot out of his balls and up his throbbing shaft. His cock spasmed in hot bursts on her tongue that slid down her throat as she gulped every spurt.</p><p>Sheer heaven.</p><p>After the last pulse tapered off, Skylar let him slip from her mouth. She nuzzled his thigh and kissed the vulnerable skin between his hipbones on her way to rub her cheek against the inside of his other leg.</p><p>\u201cSkylar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her as she stared up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Her lips were fuller, redder, and ripe for kissing. They were also curved into what resembled a smirk.</p><p>\u201cWhy you smirkin\u2019 at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I never liked doing that before. Never thought I was very good at it.\u201d</p><p>He murmured, \u201cI beg to disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was different with you, Kade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that is, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you told me exactly what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>She thought about it and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou got nothin\u2019 to lose by bein\u2019 honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, sucking you off, making you go a little crazy, knowing I was taking you there was as much of a turn on for me as it was for you.\u201d</p><p>Her admission made him grin like a loon. \u201cYou still turned on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnbelievably.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her to her feet. She insisted on helping him get redressed, not in a sexual way, but in a sweetly intimate way. Buttoning, smoothing, straightening his shirt across his chest. The kind of fussy motions a wife might perform for her husband.</p><p>Kade managed a husky, \u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d He clamped his hands on her ass to make sure she stayed put. He took his time kissing her, loving the way she unconsciously rubbed and arched into him. After indulging himself with a thorough taste of her too-tempting neck, he whispered, \u201cI want you imaginin\u2019 all the places I\u2019m gonna touch you tonight when we get home. However I please. Wherever I please. As long as I please. You wonderin\u2019 where I\u2019ll start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be I\u2019ll spread you across the back of the couch and lick you from here\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kade ran his thumbs from her tailbone up to her nape, \u201c\u2014to here.\u201d</p><p>She shivered and released a tiny moan.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll start with bitin\u2019 your toes. Or maybe I\u2019ll be so crazy to feel your pretty snatch grippin\u2019 my cock that I\u2019ll pin you to the floor in the hallway and fuck your brains out. Right there on that flowered rug.\u201d He blew in her ear. \u201cNo matter what scenario I choose, Skylar, remember I get to decide when you come. Not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell you want to come right now. Can\u2019t you almost feel my fingers strokin\u2019 your wet pussy? One, then two pushin\u2019 deep? You ridin\u2019 my hand so my palm is teasin\u2019 your clit? Your moans are urgin\u2019 me to go faster, to press harder, to sink deeper?\u201d His teeth lightly scored the outside of her ear. \u201cAre you throbbin\u2019 between your legs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod. Kade.

He heard her swallow hard. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood enough.\u201d</p><p>Skylar\u2019s skin was so hypersensitive she feared a single touch, even an accidental brush of Kade\u2019s callused finger on her hand would send her careening into an orgasm. In public.</p><p>Her first thought was to put distance between them. Get Eliza and come up with an excuse to leave. Since Kade had to unload the horses at Colt\u2019s before he came home, she\u2019d have time to find a semblance of composure before the man set to breaking it down again.</p><p>\u201cSkylar?\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou wanna wander around and wait for the presentation of the buckles and awards?</p><p>Colt and I did finish in the money.\u201d</p><p>Her neck flushed in memory of Kade on a horse. Of Kade with a rope. His power, grace, concentration and speed. She could not wait to have all of that completely focused on her. \u201cI never said congratulations on second place. You\u2019ve gotta be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad for two ranchers who haven\u2019t team roped for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys looked damn good. Although, I did lose twenty bucks to your cousin Chassie.\u201d</p><p>Kade\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou bet on me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t gonna bet against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so damn sweet.\u201d He smiled. \u201cC\u2019mere and give me some sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. We don\u2019t need any additional rumors flying about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat rumors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides the one we\u2019re living in sin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is your fault, sweetheart, \u2019cause I\u2019ve asked you to marry me. More than once. Try again.\u201d</p><p>Crap. Good thing she hadn\u2019t said, living with their secret love child. She\u2019d never live that down. She took a different, flirty tack, which felt damn good. \u201cWith the hot and bothered way you\u2019ve left me? I can\u2019t guarantee I won\u2019t jump you, or sneak off to touch myself, earning myself a whole passel of trouble for doing either, without your permission, if I simply hold your hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s part that\u2019s hopin\u2019 the \u2018jumpin\u2019 on me\u2019 school of thought wins out.\u201d</p> <p>Outside the horse trailer, Skylar started toward the picnic area where Eliza was and Kade snagged her elbow. \u201cI thought we were gonna wander around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want your parents to see the presentation? Beings that you placed and all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot. I hadn\u2019t thought of that. I\u2019ll tell them meet us by the north end.\u201d After he made the call, he said, \u201cBeen a while since I\u2019ve had a beer and I sure could use one, how about you?\u201d</p><p>Now that Sky thought about it, she hadn\u2019t seen Kade touch a drop of alcohol since he\u2019d moved in. \u201cSure. I\u2019m curious, didn\u2019t you drink when we went out last year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsed to. Don\u2019t so much any more.\u201d They walked in silence until they were through the parking lot and standing in front of the beer tent. He paid for two drafts, gesturing for her to precede him into the seating area.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Kade sipped the foamy goodness, licked his lips and sighed.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know, if you want to keep beer in the fridge, I\u2019m fine with that. I\u2019m sure Eliza wouldn\u2019t mind if you had the occasional beer either.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows drew together. \u201cYou think the reason I\u2019m not drinkin\u2019 is because of Eliza? It\u2019s not. It\u2019s \u2019cause of Colt. And it ain\u2019t just about the drinkin\u2019 entirely. Other issues surfaced because of it, things that\u2019d been simmerin\u2019 for years.\u201d His thumb rubbed the lip on the plastic cup, as he seemed to struggle for the right words. \u201cI\u2019m talkin\u2019 about family stuff, fistfights, hard words, unspoken resentment that was pittin\u2019 brother against brother. I wondered if any of us was ever gonna be able to work together on the ranch again. I was glad to get out of there. Last year was the ugliest, lowest point of my life.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t interrupt.</p><p>\u201cColt\u2019s been sober for a year. I\u2019m proud of him and I respect his sobriety enough that I don\u2019t drink around him. I haven\u2019t been drinkin\u2019 at all in the last year anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot many honky-tonks up in the north forty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Funny thing is, Colt was supposed to head up the cattle grazin\u2019 experiment, not me. But after all that\u2019d gone down with Dag, and me messin\u2019 up so bad with you, and dealin\u2019 with the rest of the McKay/West family shit, I volunteered. I needed time to get my head on straight. Kane says Colt\u2019s had a rough go, mendin\u2019 fences with his brothers.</p><p>Guess we all learned some things take time to heal.\u201d</p><p>Skylar let her fingers drift down Kade\u2019s arm and she covered his hand with hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry and I\u2019m not blowing smoke up your chaps when I say I understand what you\u2019ve been through. My sister is a recovering alcoholic and a former drug addict. The last time they pumped her stomach? She coded twice. I thought I\u2019d lost her. And the worst part at the time? My guilty feeling of relief. My life had revolved around middle of the night phone calls\u2014from the hospital, or her scary drug dealer boyfriend, or the police, or trying to scrounge up cash for the bond agency, because she was in jail. Again.</p><p>With our parents dead, I was all she had. I had to witness her ruining her life and nothing I could say or do would change her behavior. Fortunately, India wised up. She\u2019s been clean for five years.\u201d</p><p>Neither said anything, they sipped beer in the stuffy tent, lost in thought.</p><p>Finally Kade said, \u201cAin\u2019t I just a barrel of fun? Maybe we could talk about something else? When\u2019s Eliza\u2019s next doctor\u2019s appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch as I love our darlin\u2019 baby girl,\u201d she grinned when he looked up at her mimicking his vernacular, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>Sex. Tell me what\u2019s in store for tonight. In detail. Maybe with a hands-on preview.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be getting to know each other, right? So, tell me about your day to day ranch duties.\u201d</p><p>Kade lifted both brows. \u201cWhy? You lookin\u2019 to take a nap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. I saw you on the horse today and I realized I don\u2019t have any idea what it takes to raise cows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney. Stupidity. Stubbornness.\u201d He sipped his beer. \u201cSorry. What we do depends on the season. Right now, we gotta make sure the cattle have water where they\u2019re grazin\u2019.</p><p>The cows have been pregnancy tested. The calves have had their vaccinations and aren\u2019t ready to wean quite yet. We start cuttin\u2019 hay in another week, that\u2019s long, hard work, pretty much sunup to sundown. Something\u2019s always broken, equipment wise. Then there\u2019s the fences. Lord. I could hire a crew of twenty and send them out seven days a week for the next year and never get all the damn fence mendin\u2019 done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. You must have a lot of land.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a sardonic look. \u201cOr a lotta bad fences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny. So do you ride horses every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Wish I could, but it\u2019s faster to take the truck or the four-wheeler. I keep my horse at my folks\u2019 place. He\u2019s an old work horse, not a rodeo horse like Colby\u2019s.\u201d He took another sip. \u201cWhat about you? Do you ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can ride, not very well. And I do like it, but I don\u2019t have a horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems a shame. You have a sweet setup with that big barn and the corrals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe someday, when life isn\u2019t so chaotic, I\u2019ll get a gentle horse. What do you do for fun when you\u2019re not working on the ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen so long, I don\u2019t remember. I used to like to do a little dancin\u2019 at the Golden Boot. Do you two-step?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been very good at dancing.\u201d</p><p>He angled over the table, a mere kiss away. \u201cYou said the same thing about blowjobs and you proved yourself wrong there, so I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 I\u2019d like to prove you wrong on the dance floor. There\u2019s something mighty enticin\u2019 about the thought of holdin\u2019 you in my arms in public, Sky, holdin\u2019 you without apology.\u201d</p><p>The molten heat in Kade\u2019s eyes made her knees quake.</p><p>The loudspeaker boomed with news of the presentations. He eased back, drained his remaining beer and stood. \u201cBetter get a move on.\u201d</p><p>Kade kept his hand pressed in the small of her back as they crossed the grounds to the stands. Several young women studied him with blatant sexual interest, from the tips of his boots to the brim of his cowboy hat, lingering on the fit of his Wranglers and the size of his belt buckle. A couple of brave rhinestone cowgirls were so happy to see him back in action, they approached him to offer to make up for lost time, in whatever capacity he chose. Suggestions were tossed out, without shame.</p><p>Not one of the pouty-faced women called him Kade. Every single one called him Kane. And Kade didn\u2019t correct their assumptions. He\u2019d probably gotten so used to it, he either didn\u2019t notice, or it didn\u2019t bother him.</p><p>It bothered the crap out of Skylar. Kade wasn\u2019t interchangeable. Kade was unique.</p><p>And dammit, these buckle bunnies could kiss her butt. Kade McKay was hers.</p><p>When an older brunette, with over-teased hair and an overbite, slid her fingers up the buttons on Kade\u2019s shirt, Sky wondered if she were somehow invisible. Would these same</p><p>\u201cride-me-cowboy\u201d buckle bunnies be so eager to throw themselves at him if he held Eliza?</p><p>Probably. Kade was damn fine-looking and one of the most eligible bachelors in three counties. His obvious physical attributes were a bonus, as far as Sky was concerned.</p><p>What made him irresistible to her these days? He wasn\u2019t afraid to show he loved his child to distraction. He rolled out of bed in the middle of the night so Sky could sleep. It was all the sweet, thoughtful, just plain nice things he did for her and Eliza, simply because he was that type of man and he enjoyed doing it, not because he had to or it was expected. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Throughout the conversations, Kade remained polite to his admirers. Skylar also noticed his warm hand remained firmly planted on her back. Even after they\u2019d made their escape.</p><p>She spied Kimi and Eliza. Kade ambled up. Eliza took one look at him and her feet churned with glee. He grinned, stealing her from Kimi\u2019s arms. \u201cThere\u2019s my girl. Didja miss us, sweet thang?\u201d He bussed the top of her bonneted head.</p><p>\u201cShe was an absolute angel,\u201d Kimi said. \u201cSkylar Ellison, meet my sister Carolyn McKay. She had to skip out on the West reunion earlier because her daughter-in-law Channing got sick.\u201d</p> <p>As they shook hands, \u201cYour last name is McKay too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. We\u2019re sisters who married brothers. Long story we\u2019ll no doubt bore you with at some point. Anyway, I just wanted to tell you how much I love your Sky Blue products. Kimi has me hooked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always love to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must not work at the shop in Sundance much?\u201d</p><p>Sky shook her head. \u201cI trust it to India while I\u2019m running the manufacturing plant outside of Moorcroft.\u201d</p> <p>Kade moved to block the sun from Sky\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou oughta see her setup. It\u2019s something. Way beyond anything else goin\u2019 around here.\u201d He rattled off a bunch of things that Sky was surprised he remembered from the brief tour. And he almost sounded...proud of her.</p><p>Carolyn whistled. \u201cKade, are you driving from Moorcroft to the ranch? Every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Ain\u2019t no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixty miles is quite a stretch, especially when you\u2019re tired from working.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cYou sound just like Ma, Aunt C.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worry about all my family members, Kade, not just the ones I gave birth to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d say the same thing to Colby or Cord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they were driving one hundred and twenty miles round trip every day, I\u2019d ask them to be careful too.\u201d</p><p>Skylar got right in his face. \u201cYou\u2019re driving that many miles? Every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d Bewildered, she could only stare at him and feel more guilty. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. No wonder you\u2019re so tired. You shouldn\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave to don\u2019t enter into it at all.\u201d He lowered his voice so only she heard him.</p><p>\u201cBecause it don\u2019t matter. I want to. I\u2019d drive twice that to be with you and Eliza every night.\u201d</p><p>She melted and only managed a humble, \u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, oh. This ain\u2019t a temporary thing for me, so I figured I\u2019d better get used to it early on.\u201d</p><p>This ain\u2019t a temporary thing for me.</p><p>The announcer listed the program order and team-roping trophies were second on the list. Kade passed Eliza to Sky. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta help Colt, then I\u2019ll be right home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s a get-together at Colby and Channing\u2019s place tonight,\u201d Kimi said.</p><p>\u201cEveryone in the family is gonna be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone except us.\u201d Kade exchanged a hot look with Skylar and a wave of anticipation flowed through her. \u201cEliza\u2019s had enough excitement today. She\u2019s had a rough week and she needs an early bedtime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. But you are comin\u2019 to the brunch at Carolyn and Carson\u2019s tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Kade winked at her. \u201cLater, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Kimi and Carolyn moved closer to the action, while Sky watched from the fence.</p><p>She swallowed her jealousy at the legions of women who surrounded Kade and Colt.</p><p>Strange thing was, neither man seemed particularly interested in any of them.</p><p>Cash Big Crow and Trevor Glanzer hammed it up for the crowd. After the all-around title was announced, with Trevor as the winner, Trevor and Chassie took the stage. A buzz filled the air.</p><p>Trevor commandeered the microphone. \u201cLast year due to an accident, my wife lost her brother, Dag West, and I lost a good buddy. Dag left behind many family members and friends. So in honor of Dag, his love of rodeo, and his love of this community, the Devil\u2019s Tower Rodeo Association has created an annual award in Dag West\u2019s memory.\u201d</p><p>Murmurs of approval and a smattering of applause.</p><p>\u201cEvery year this award will go to the cowboy or cowgirl, who\u2019s shown heart, guts, and a whole lotta try at this event and others around the area. Someone who\u2019s overcome obstacles and still embodies the ideals and western way of life.\u201d</p><p>More buzz reverberated through the crowd as folks speculated who\u2019d win.</p><p>\u201cChassie and I are happy to announce that this year\u2019s winner is a man well-versed in the cowboy way, a man who has thrived in spite of it.\u201d Trevor paused for the laughter to die down. \u201cThe First Annual Dag West Memorial Award goes to...Colton McKay.\u201d</p><p>Happy whoops rent the air. Colt lumbered across the dirt, the tattered fringe on his chaps flapping, clearly in shock. He hugged Chassie, clapped Trevor on the back, and studied the award. After a second or so, he faced the audience and raised it above his head. He seemed too choked up to speak.</p><p>The crowd went wild. A lump rose in Skylar\u2019s throat when the McKays and the Wests ran across the arena to celebrate with Colt. Maybe Kade would rather be with his family tonight, instead of sixty miles away.</p><p>She loaded Eliza in her car and headed home.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>The rodeo didn\u2019t wear Eliza out. She\u2019d just put the baby down a few hours later when Kade\u2019s truck pulled up.</p><p>Perfect timing.</p><p>Thump sounded on the porch as Kade removed his dirty boots, like he always did.</p><p>The man was so thoughtful. The door squeaked open and shut. He paused on the rug, after hanging up his jacket and saw her standing in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cHey. Got done and got gone as quick as I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might call and say you were hanging out with your family tonight.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>In two strides he had her face cupped in his rough hands and was kissing her like he planned to eat her alive. Several minutes of tongue-tangling kisses that left her bare toes curling into the wooden floor, he broke his mouth free. \u201cDoes that seem like I\u2019d rather be with anyone besides you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Hang tight. I need to wash the grime off. I shouldna been touchin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Eliza sleepin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown for the count. She\u2019s in her crib.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll poke my head in and check on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to come upstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Go on into the living room. I\u2019ll be down lickety-split.\u201d</p><p>Sky heard the shower turn on. She tried to sit but that lasted all of thirty seconds before she was up and pacing again. Her emotions ranged from nervous to excited, back to nervous.</p><p>The day\u2019s events played in her mind. Kade taking control. Dictating to her. Not by humiliating her, but teaching her with not-so-gentle determination. And it was sexy as all get out, being in the position of giving him pleasure, watching the ecstasy on his gorgeous face, bringing that violent response to his body. She hadn\u2019t been angling for false praise when she\u2019d admitted her inadequacies regarding oral sex. But Kade acted as if she was a blowjob master and she couldn\u2019t wait to do it again.</p><p>The stairs creaked. She saw Kade striding toward her buck-ass nekkid.</p><p>She was so staggered all she could do was stand and stare. And drool. Oh man.</p><p>Broad. Muscled. Big. Everywhere. Kade McKay was a perfect male specimen.</p><p>What would he think when he saw her? With her less-than-perfect body?</p><p>Again, he brought his mouth down on hers, intoxicating her with another bone-melting kiss. He murmured, \u201cI wanna see you, Sky. All of you. I\u2019m settin\u2019 the nekkid rule in place right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe naked rule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I say \u2018get nekkid\u2019 and you do it. That\u2019s the rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d</p><p>Kade nibbled at her lips and jaw as he unbuttoned her lace blouse. Once it was completely undone, he peeled it down her arms and it fluttered to the floor.</p><p>Her stomach fluttered in response.</p><p>His callused hands slid down the sides of her body to rest on her hips. Work-roughened fingertips traced the skin beneath the waistband of her skirt to the zipper in the back. Zzzz sounded as her skirt hit the rug, leaving her standing in a pair of turquoise bikini panties and a plain white sports bra, which she realized didn\u2019t match the panties at all.</p><p>Skylar wanted to protest her near nakedness, to hide her body against his, but Kade was having none of it.</p><p>\u201cLose the bra.\u201d</p><p>She eased away and lifted it over her head. Soon as she finished, her chin dropped to her chest and her hair fell over her face.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>It took all her courage to meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know you\u2019re gorgeous? Ripe and lush and beautiful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel beautiful, Kade. I\u2019ve always been a little too round, a little too soft, a little too womanly. It just got worse after Eliza was born and now I\u2019m still carrying around this extra baby weight...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><p>Sky couldn\u2019t help it; she snorted.</p><p>He smoothed a section of hair from her hot cheek. \u201cIs that why we\u2019ve been makin\u2019 love in the dark?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to see me naked. I thought you\u2019d...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Jump on you like a horny toad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I thought you\u2019d be disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. I\u2019ve been dyin\u2019 to see you completely nekkid since the first time you barreled up to me wearin\u2019 them wicked purple heels. I thought about you standin\u2019 in front of me, wearin\u2019 nothin\u2019 but them sexy-ass shoes and a big ol\u2019 smile.\u201d He kissed her so sweetly tears prickled behind her lids. \u201cTrust me, the last thing I am is disappointed. The last thing I\u2019m gonna do is spend time talkin\u2019 when I could be touchin\u2019 you. Or tastin\u2019 you.\u201d He put his mouth against her ear. \u201cYou been thinkin\u2019 about this afternoon?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was amazingly fuckin\u2019 hot to see you goin\u2019 down on me.

Turn around slowly, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Skylar complied.</p><p>\u201cKeep your eyes open. No more hidin\u2019 from me. Ever.\u201d Kade punctuated his last command with a nip to her earlobe.</p><p>He dropped to his knees behind her and tapped her ankles. \u201cWider. Like that.\u201d</p><p>She held her breath, even as her heart raced, and her blood pumped faster. She was pretty sure her face was the same color as a tomato. Kade\u2019s magic fingertips danced up the back of her calves to stroke the vulnerable area behind her knees. Her trembles increased when his warm mouth followed the same path, first up her right calf, from the tight tendons above her heel, to bestow a teasing lick to that sensitive crease. She gasped.</p><p>He chuckled and repeated the erotic process on the other side.</p><p>When he started in on butterfly flicks of his tongue across the backs of her thighs, especially the line where her legs met the lower curve of her ass, her knees buckled.</p><p>Kade latched onto her hips to keep her from falling. \u201cEasy.\u201d He stood. His thumbs rubbed back and forth across the dimples at the base of her spine.</p><p>\u201cNever woulda pegged you as the tattoo type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. It was India\u2019s doing. She needed a guinea pig for her Celtic scroll designs and she volunteered my skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re braver than I am, because I hate needles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but this sure is pretty.\u201d More tantalizing stroking over the design with the edges of his rough thumbs. \u201cSexy as hell. Can\u2019t wait to run my tongue across it.\u201d</p><p>Heat radiated from his skin, making her crave more contact. Like the rasp of his chest hair on her bare shoulder blades. Or the bump of his erection against the crack of her ass. Or his big palms covering her breasts. But the only place his body touched hers was where his hands clutched her hips.</p><p>He didn\u2019t budge for the longest time. The tension inside her coiled tighter, driving her desire higher. Her panties were soaked to the point she smelled her own arousal. She was pretty sure Kade had gotten a whiff too.</p><p>\u201cKade\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatience, sweetheart.\u201d His breath on the curve of her shoulder was the only warning before his firm lips landed on the spot and gently sucked.</p> <p>Tingles shot down her arm. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou anxious for more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. No rush, \u2019cause I\u2019m so enjoyin\u2019 the view.\u201d Those warm, soft lips brushed the exact same damp spot. Twice more.</p><p>Then he backed off slightly and his wet tongue slid up the arc of her spine, from the tattoo above her butt to the base of her skull. Even as another round of tremors rolled through her, Kade lightly sank his teeth into the tender spot on her neck.</p><p>Skylar nearly came unglued.</p><p>\u201cFace me.\u201d</p><p>She spun around so fast she became dizzy.</p><p>Kade had retreated a few steps. His hands were at his sides clenched into fists. His eyes. God. His blue eyes were ablaze.</p><p>\u201cWatch me lookin\u2019 at you. Don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>And again, Kade took his sweet time dragging his gaze across every inch of her body. It was exciting, witnessing his arousal. His high cheekbones were flushed a soft pink. His bare chest rose and fell rapidly from his erratic breathing. He licked his lips.</p><p>Repeatedly.</p><p>Then there was his cock. Fully erect, the head shiny-red, the tip jerked against his belly, leaving behind a slick kiss. Finally his eyes met hers again.</p><p>\u201cTake off your panties.\u201d</p><p>Did he mean in a slow, sexy strip tease? Or in one passionate rip? Oh, who the hell cared as long as they were off? Skylar hooked a finger in each side and shimmied them down her legs, kicking them away.</p><p>The second she was unencumbered, Kade dropped to his knees. He grabbed her hands, placing them on her mound, demanding, \u201cHold yourself open for me. I wanna taste you inside and out. I wanna bury my face in your pussy and feel you come against my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Desire warred with her natural embarrassment. But she wanted his tongue burrowing inside her. She wanted his mouth suctioned to her clit. She wanted his lips and teeth and tongue everywhere, all at once, until she exploded in a burst of pure pleasure. She wanted to surrender to this man.</p><p>Skylar spread her legs and used her fingers to bare every inch of her weeping sex to his hungry gaze.</p><p>With something akin to a growl, Kade dove right in. He clamped his hands to her butt cheeks, pulling her closer yet as his mouth fastened to her sex. His tongue lapped and licked and plunged deep. He suckled the swollen pink folds until his groans of approval reverberated into her tissues, zinging through her blood, heightening her need for release.</p><p>\u201cOh. It\u2019s so close...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome for me, baby. This is gonna be the first of many.\u201d</p><p>Many? She didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d survive.</p><p>Her legs shook as he fucked her with his tongue. He held her tighter, pushed her closer to the edge. That heated melting sensation swirled in her belly and she whimpered.</p><p>Kade pressed his mouth to the top of her pubic bone and sucked her clit between his lips. The hard rhythmic pulls against his teeth and tongue sent her from almost there, right into a full-blown orgasm that left her stunned, throbbing, gasping his name even as she forgot her own.</p><p>Once she\u2019d regained some semblance of sanity, she felt Kade rubbing his face over her belly.</p><p>He looked up at her. \u201cYou are so fuckin\u2019 sexy, Sky. You make me crazy with wantin\u2019 you.\u201d He rolled back on the balls of his feet and stood. \u201cStay right there.\u201d Thirty seconds later he returned with a box of condoms. Without a word, he led her to the couch and sprawled in the middle. He removed a single foil pack from the box, opened it and slipped it on.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d Kade reached for her hands.</p><p>\u201cWait. What are we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo questions, remember? Straddle me on your knees.\u201d</p><p>Skylar carefully positioned herself, keeping her focus on his cock. Just as she was about to impale herself, Kade stilled her motion and tipped her chin up with a finger.</p><p>\u201cDid I say you could do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t your job to think, it\u2019s mine. Now relax and sit on my lap, not on my dick.\u201d</p><p>Her protest, \u201cBut I\u2019ll break your legs,\u201d earned her a sharp smack on the ass.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever let me hear you say nothin\u2019 like that again.\u201d</p><p>It was her nature to act indignant. To question him. She did neither. She waited. And watched him.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d With their gazes locked, Kade\u2019s hands smoothed up her thighs. Paused on her hips. Traced the contour of her belly. Lingered on the swell of her breasts, finally cradling her face. \u201cGimme this mouth.\u201d He tugged her until their lips met.</p><p>The kiss was urgent. His tongue danced against hers, he angled her head to where he wanted it, taking her to a whole new level of soul kissing. His chest was firm and hot beneath her palms. As his mouth shifted, she tasted her own musk, a hint of mint, and the heady, masculine flavor she recognized as wholly his.</p><p>When she\u2019d started to relax into the kiss, he pulled away and licked a path to the valley of her cleavage. \u201cOffer these big beauties to me. Like you did with that pretty pussy. Hold \u2019em up so I can taste \u2019em as long as it suits me.\u201d</p><p>Her heart thumped as she cupped her palms under her breasts, pushed them together and lifted for his perusal.</p><p>\u201cLook at you. So obedient.\u201d Kade\u2019s hands were braced on her upper back and he angled her closer, so he could suck both nipples. One right after the other. A very low, very satisfied male noise rumbled across her flesh and she trembled.</p><p>Every wet pull of his mouth reawakened the buzzing tingle between her thighs. Sky found herself rocking into him, searching for any friction as his sex rubbed against hers.</p><p>Not that the man could take a hint. He ignored her subtle signals and did as he pleased, which if Sky was completely honest, pleased her to no appreciable end.</p><p>But still, she was dying for him to progress to the next stage of this drawn-out seduction. She must\u2019ve made a disgruntled noise because he muttered, \u201cImpatient?\u201d as he nibbled the ticklish curve by her left armpit.</p><p>\u201cYes. Please. More.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s in control, Sky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember that. Next time I ain\u2019t gonna be so nice about remindin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>Oh wow. She had the tiniest desire to disobey him just to see what type of</p><p>\u201creminder\u201d he employed.</p><p>Kade suckled her nipples deep and hard, using his teeth to skirt the edge of pain that bordered on bliss. He\u2019d back off and nuzzle the fleshy mounds, gently lapping at the reddened peaks, blowing a soft stream of air over the damp tips to see them constrict.</p><p>Then he\u2019d begin again.</p><p>It was the most delicious torture she\u2019d ever experienced.</p><p>He placed her hands to his shoulders and pressed his forehead to hers as he scooted her hips forward. \u201cTake me in slowly. I want you watchin\u2019 as my cock sinks inside you.\u201d</p><p>Skylar looked down as Kade thumbed his erection away from his belly. She saw the thick head circle her opening, and become slippery with her arousal. After the first couple inches she couldn\u2019t see anything so she closed her eyes and lost herself in the feeling of all that thick male hardness filling her.</p><p>\u201cJust a little more. Goddamn that feels good,\u201d he panted against her throat. \u201cYou\u2019re so wet. It\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 turn on.\u201d</p><p>This verbally explicit side of gentleman cowboy Kade McKay turned her on to epic levels.</p><p>She paused when he was fully seated inside her, tilting her pelvis to grind against his.</p><p>Perspiration coated her skin. Her pulse pounded in her throat, in her nipples, between her legs. A single bead of sweat trickled down the side of Kade\u2019s neck and she dipped her head to catch the droplet on her tongue. Mmm. Salty. She licked the wet trail back up to his ear. \u201cTell me what to do, Kade.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRide me, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways thinking like a cowboy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t help what I am. Oh yeah. I like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSee? I don\u2019t need a horse when I have you around to ride.\u201d</p><p>His chuckle turned into a groan when she began to lift and lower faster. Kade\u2019s mouth sought hers, as his hands seemed determined to touch every millimeter of her damp skin.</p><p>Time stopped as they moved together. Two lovers locked in passion. Fast. Frantic.</p><p>Needy.</p><p>Kade\u2019s hips thrust up on her every downstroke. Her clit vibrated and pulsed in response to the grinding motion. \u201cYes. Oh yes. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d She barely withheld a scream as the climax knocked her sideways.</p> <p>He groaned against her throat. \u201cI\u2019m right behind you. Come on, baby, squeeze me tight with your cunt muscles. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s so it.\u201d</p><p>With their bodies plastered together, she reveled in the slick feel of his rougher skin scraping on her softer curves. The urgency of his pumping hips.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d His head dropped back on the couch cushion. His cock throbbed and jerked inside her, she swore she could feel his heat through the latex as he came. She shamelessly watched the concentrated look on his face morph to satisfaction.</p><p>After his last drawn-out groan, Sky buried her face in the curve of his neck, letting her lips travel along the strained muscles, tasting the sweat on his skin.</p><p>\u201cYeah. See, makin\u2019 love on the couch ain\u2019t so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m likin\u2019 this nekkid rule.

Marry me.\u201d</p><p>She whispered back, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>A pause lingered and he sighed. \u201cGive me a reason why you\u2019re always sayin\u2019 no?\u201d</p><p>Should she deflect? Lie? Or buck up and admit the truth?</p> <p>\u201cSee? Even you can\u2019t think of one good reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong.\u201d Skylar lifted her head and looked him straight in the eye. \u201cI keep saying no, because I\u2019ve been married before.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Kade looked at the embarrassment and truth warring in Skylar\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve been married before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t the happiest time in my life, okay? I swore I\u2019d never dwell...forget it.\u201d Skylar tried to maneuver off him, but he clamped his hands on her hips, keeping her in place, keeping his cock imbedded in her.</p><p>\u201cNo fuckin\u2019 way. You don\u2019t get to blurt out something like that and then run off like a scared bunny, Sky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared.\u201d In response, she looked down at her hands braced on his chest, as if she\u2019d just realized she was pushing him away.</p><p>\u201cThen talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Let me go.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled a deep breath. \u201cIf I let you up, will you promise to stay here and tell me about it?\u201d His hand slid up her arm to her shoulder. He twined his fingers in a section of her silky hair. \u201cYou gotta know nothin\u2019 you tell me is gonna make me change my opinion of you. And you can trust me to keep my mouth shut. Lord, I seem to be well-versed in keepin\u2019 secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I never have heard you talking trash about anyone. Not even your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? It\u2019s because I\u2019m trustworthy.\u201d</p><p>Skylar didn\u2019t look up. \u201cWould you have a glass of wine if I opened a bottle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me climb off this ride, cowboy, before we get permanently stuck together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure wouldn\u2019t complain about that, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Sky lifted off his softened cock. She scooted back and stood between his legs.</p><p>Kade snagged her hand before she ran off. \u201cJust so you don\u2019t get any ideas about puttin\u2019 them clothes back on, the nekkid rule still applies. Even while we\u2019re talkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re drinking wine in the living room...nude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. And I wouldn\u2019t mind if you walked into the kitchen nice and slow, so I can get all hot and bothered starin\u2019 at your luscious ass.\u201d</p><p>She blushed before she headed out of the room.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, baby, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about. Shake it a little more. Mmm. Mmm.</p><p>Damn, Sky, you are one smokin\u2019 hot mama.\u201d</p><p>She gifted him with a \u201ccome and get me\u201d grin over her left shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna pay for that look, woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>Kade ditched the condom and tried to wrap his head around Skylar\u2019s unmentioned marriage. These days it wasn\u2019t a big deal to be divorced. They\u2019d gone out a dozen times last year; it should\u2019ve come up in conversation at least once. So why hadn\u2019t she told him?</p><p>Why didn\u2019t you tell her you were Kade, not Kane?</p><p>Shit. He hadn\u2019t thought of that. Man, it seemed they were both good at telling half-truths. Haunted by memories they\u2019d rather push aside than openly discuss.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the happiest time in my life.</p><p>He understood the desire to move on from the past. He\u2019d done it, sending himself on a sabbatical to straighten out the mess his life had become. During the time away from family and friends, he decided he wasn\u2019t going to live his life full of regret for time and opportunities lost. Nor would he wait around for happiness to float into his life. He was going after it like a rodeo junkie chases the gold buckle: full throttle.</p><p>Watching his cousins living the life of home and hearth, the life Kade had always wanted, made him more determined to make that happen for himself. On his terms. Yeah, he knew exactly what he wanted. And she walked in the room stark naked holding a bottle of wine and two glasses.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you smiling at, Kade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. What a pretty picture you make completely buck-ass nekkid.\u201d</p><p>She poured the glasses full of ruby-colored liquid, then sat on the opposite end of the couch with her knees tucked under her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t comment when she downed nearly half the contents in one long swallow.</p><p>A couple of minutes passed before she spoke. \u201cYou know I grew up in California.</p><p>Graduated top of my college class. I scored a primo job at an ad agency in LA right out of college. Big money. Lots of prestige. I had my career all planned out. It never bothered me to be one of those women who are really successful in their work, but a total failure when it came to personal relationships.</p><p>\u201cAt a party I met this older guy named Ted. He was a real laid-back kind of guy, which was very appealing to me. We\u2019d been dating for a month when my dad was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer. Doctors told us he had less than three months to live. I\u2019d always dreamed of my dad walking me down the aisle, and I was about to lose the chance forever. When Ted suggested we get married right away, I agreed.\u201d She laughed bitterly. \u201cIt was the only impulsive thing I\u2019d ever done in my life.\u201d</p><p>Had she loved Ted? It tied a knot in his gut to think she\u2019d married for less than the total love and adoration she deserved.</p><p>\u201cTurns out my dad had less time. He died three weeks after the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSky. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She knocked back a mouthful of wine. \u201cAnyway, my mother went into a deep depression and decided to \u2018find herself\u2019 at a monastery on some damn island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shittin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople really do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom was a bit of a free-spirit, hippie type. She could do pretty much whatever struck her fancy because my father had left us well off.\u201d Her troubled gaze met his. \u201cVery well off. She vanished and I didn\u2019t hear a word from her for two years.\u201d</p><p>Kade cringed. He\u2019d essentially done the same thing, disappeared without a word. No wonder Skylar had sported the attitude that he might not care about Eliza\u2019s existence. Or that he intended to become a permanent part of her life.</p><p>\u201cAt the time, India was a drug addict and a drunk, in and out of rehab. I\u2019d used my grief to bury myself in work and advanced to the level of vice president. Ted had a fairly low-stress job so he handled everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Skylar closed her eyes. \u201cAll the finances, all the household stuff. Some nights I\u2019d come home from the office an emotional basket case and he took care of me too. I trusted him. I let him have total control of every single thing in my life.\u201d Her voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cAnd he fucked me over. Big time. I didn\u2019t know he wasn\u2019t who he said he was. Ted wasn\u2019t a real estate developer as much as he was a con man.\u201d</p><p>No wonder she\u2019d freaked out so badly about him pretending to be Kane. No wonder she was taking her time on deciding whether she\u2019d marry him.</p><p>\u201cI also didn\u2019t know he\u2019d taken half of the inheritance from my father and squirreled it away somewhere. I didn\u2019t know he\u2019d helped himself to half my earnings over a two-year period. I only found out when he hit me with divorce papers. There were very little liquid assets, where we should\u2019ve been drowning in them.</p><p>\u201cCalifornia is a community property state, which entitled Ted to fifty percent of what I had. My house, my cars, my pension, my assets\u2014assets that had dwindled to damn near nothing in the time we were married. Everything I\u2019d worked for, all the money my dad left me...gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh baby, c\u2019mere.\u201d Kade put their wine glasses on the coffee table and enfolded her in his arms. She didn\u2019t cry, this tough, independent woman who\u2019d had every man in her life let her down. She just melted into him. That broke his damn heart. He didn\u2019t speak, partially because he didn\u2019t know what to say, but mostly because he now understood her need for absolute control.</p><p>\u201cIt was the most humiliating thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. So yeah, I have some issues with trust.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI imagine so.

I moved into her new place, which ended up being a good thing because not four months later she was diagnosed with uterine cancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. Are you serious?\u201d</p><p>Sky nodded. \u201cSounds like a soap opera, doesn\u2019t it? Of course, my mom had let her health insurance lapse while she was in seclusion, so all the payments to the hospital and doctors came out of her pocket. India actually cleaned up her act for a while and helped me care for Mom. My grandma, my mom\u2019s mother, Elizabeth, came to help.\u201d</p><p>A warm feeing unfurled in his chest. \u201cEliza was named after her, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She was a remarkable woman. It fascinated me she was part Cheyenne since my mother had never mentioned that part of our background. Grandma mixed up herb ointments for my mother that actually worked. When I asked her about them, she gave me the basics until she realized I had more than just a passing interest. We created batches of new soaps and lotions made from all-natural ingredients. I decided someday I would start my own company using her formulas. After she passed on and left us this land, I knew this was where I was supposed to be. Everything had come full circle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve done her right proud, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know so. Know what else I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Kade brushed his mouth over her ear and was tremendously pleased when Sky trembled. \u201cThat Eliza has a long line of strong women behind her to look up to. She\u2019s a lucky girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sweet, Kade, you\u2019re going to make me cry and I swore I wouldn\u2019t, not ever again. Not over him or what he did to me or anything from that awful part of my life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo ahead and cry, baby, I gotcha.\u201d</p><p>Skylar didn\u2019t sob, but she allowed him to hold her and settle her, stroke her wherever he wanted. Her arms. Her breasts. Her belly. Up and down her thighs. Her breathing had become erratic, even as she relaxed against him.</p><p>Time to make his move.</p><p>\u201cThanks for tellin\u2019 me the truth. You gotta know I wouldn\u2019t ever do what that bastard done to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretend to be someone else? Take something from me? Use me? No offense, but I\u2019ve heard that line before, from every single man who\u2019s been in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? Would you be here with me if it weren\u2019t for Eliza? Especially since she\u2019s the rare McKay girl child?\u201d</p><p>When Kade paused, she assumed it was a guilty pause. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, but it don\u2019t change a damn thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChange what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I still wanna marry you. I\u2019m gonna keep askin\u2019 until you\u2019re so sick of it that you\u2019ll say yes just to get some peace.\u201d</p><p>She smiled slightly. \u201cNot happening, McKay. Once burned, twice shy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see. I\u2019m not Ted. I\u2019ll never be the man who wants more from you than you\u2019re willin\u2019 to give. But I\u2019d be lyin\u2019 if I told you I didn\u2019t want it all.\u201d He turned her around so he could kiss her full on. He loved the way their mouths fit together, hunger fed sweetness. The kiss changed from slow and easy to hot and heavy.</p><p>Kade traced the line of her body from her neck to her knee. His fingers inched up the inside of her thigh until they reached that warm wetness between her legs.</p><p>Skylar made a soft moan when his first two fingers pushed inside.</p><p>He rocked them in and out in a steady rhythm. She began to undulate and whimper, clenching and unclenching her thighs, kissing him with more force. Kade twisted his wrist so the heel of his hand rested on her clit. As he plunged his fingers in, he pressed on the swollen bit of flesh.</p><p>She jerked her mouth away, placing her own hand on top of his. \u201cMove side-to-side.\u201d</p><p>Encouraging, that Sky\u2019d become willing to teach him how to satisfy her. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Exactly like that. Oh. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d She threw back her head and came on a low, throaty moan.</p><p>It was hot as hell, the way she looked, the sounds drifting from her beautiful throat when she let go. The fact she\u2019d let go with him only made him want more of the same.</p><p>While Skylar was still tingling from orgasmic aftershocks, Kade reached for a condom and put it on. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>He led her to the hallway. Specifically to the antique armoire with a wooden bench seat located above the compartment used for storage. Metal coat hooks decorated the ornately carved top and both sides. What made the piece unique was the full-length mirror along the back.</p><p>They stopped in front of the mirror. Once Sky caught sight of her naked reflection, she immediately tensed up and tried to turn around. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver done it in front of a mirror?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She tried to twist away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t a request,\u201d he growled, holding her against his body at a sideways angle.</p><p>\u201cWatch.\u201d Kade reached for her right hand, and brought it up, placing it behind his neck.</p><p>\u201cLook at you. See the way your body curves here?\u201d He trailed his fingers from the outside of her thigh up to her hip. \u201cAnd here.\u201d He flattened his palm, gradually dragging it up the bend in her waist, his fingers barely brushing her quivering belly.</p><p>He stopped at the bottom of her rib cage and moved his lips closer to the arch of her neck. \u201cLook how havin\u2019 your arm lifted like this draws attention to the swell of your breast. One exquisite curve flowin\u2019 from bottom to top, creatin\u2019 this long sexy line. A sexy line just beggin\u2019 for my touch.\u201d His fingertips followed the inside of her biceps up to her elbow. \u201cYou have a gorgeous body, Sky. Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThen look at your face. Your cheeks are flushed, your eyes are bright. Your lips are fuller, a little redder from kissin\u2019 me. See how fast you\u2019re breathin\u2019, makin\u2019 your chest rise and fall so my eyes are drawn to your breasts? See how hard and tight your nipples are, makin\u2019 my mouth water to taste them? If I touch you like this\u2014\u201d he dragged a fingertip from hipbone to hipbone, \u201c\u2014your belly quivers. Makes me crazy, rememberin\u2019 how you quiver when I\u2019m balls deep inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can.\u201d He zigzagged his tongue up the column of her throat and blew softly on the wetness just to have her trembling in his arms. \u201cBecause you are as temptin\u2019 as sin. Because you\u2019re beautiful. Because this is how I see you. In my head. In the dark.</p><p>In the flesh. So when I fuck you every way my sex-addled brain can dream up, you\u2019ll know I wasn\u2019t kiddin\u2019 about how hot you can make me burn.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and turned her head to kiss his chin. And his throat. Kade allowed it, sensing her surrender.</p><p>He nuzzled the inside of her arm and gave a love bite on the tender flesh. She yipped and opened her eyes. \u201cBend over and hold onto the back of the bench.\u201d Sky appeared to be weighing her options, of which she had none. He said, \u201cDo it. Now.\u201d</p><p>In a sensuous move that made his cock harder yet, she untangled from him and angled forward, sticking her backside in the air, letting her tits swung free.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the roundness of her ass, the wavering line of her spine, the way her long hair hung past her shoulders. Mostly how her gaze locked on his.</p><p>\u201cTilt your pelvis up. That\u2019s good.\u201d Kade dipped his upper body and licked Sky from her tattoo up to the nape of her neck, layering his chest to her back. He breathed in the sweet scent of her hair. \u201cI\u2019m gonna fuck you hard and I want you to watch me. Watch me enjoyin\u2019 every damn second of you and your body. Don\u2019t look away.\u201d</p><p>Kade snapped upright, latched onto her hips and plunged inside her.</p><p>Skylar gasped.</p><p>\u201cLike that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Do it again.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew and slammed in. Over and over. Hard and deep. Glorying in the pleasure on her face, feeling the welcoming wetness of her pussy with each thrust. His legs shook, sweat trickled down the side of his face, but he never once looked away from her passion-darkened eyes.</p><p>When she rocked her hips back to meet his thrusts, he said, \u201cCan you come like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaster.\u201d</p><p>He thrust four times more, prolonging her pleasure and their intimate connection.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She threw her head back and came apart.</p><p>He hissed when he felt her pussy muscles clamping down on him. His last thread of control snapped. A surge of heat flashed and Kade hammered into her, his balls damn near crawled inside his body and his cock jerked as pulse after pulse of hot seed shot out.</p><p>When the primal roaring in Kade\u2019s head lessened, he met her gaze.</p><p>She murmured, \u201cI\u2019m never gonna look at this mirror the same way again.\u201d</p><p>Once again, he was at an utter loss for what to say. Sky deserved some kind of sweetly romantic words, but his brain was lazy, his body sated, and it took every ounce of control for him not to yawn.</p><p>Kade smoothed his hands up her back, past her shoulders and curled his hands around hers on the bench. He nestled his face next to hers as they both struggled for breath. He kissed her temple and slipped out of her body, helping her upright. She faced him, twining her arms around his neck. He was dying to know what was going through her mind, but he didn\u2019t ask. He just held onto her and was grateful she hadn\u2019t bolted in a fit of modesty.</p><p>A loud screech sounded from the baby monitor in the living room. Immediately Skylar pulled back. \u201cI\u2019d hoped she\u2019d sleep all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on and get her. I\u2019ll get the bottle ready and bring it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I allowed to get dressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether you\u2019re wearin\u2019 silky pajamas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen them eye-poppin\u2019 baby doll ones will do just fine.\u201d</p><p>She blinked with surprise. \u201cYou like those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d His fingertip journeyed from the dimple in her chin over the tip of her right nipple to the shallow dent in her navel. \u201cBut I like you in no pajamas much better.\u201d</p><p>Another loud screech echoed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d Without turning around, Skylar said, \u201cYou\u2019re staring at my ass again, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a damn fine ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? I\u2019m gonna kick yours if you don\u2019t get that bottle ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019.\u201d Kade cleaned up in the bathroom and grabbed a pair of sweatpants from the laundry room as he waited for the bottle to heat.</p><p>Upstairs, the small lamp in the corner of Skylar\u2019s room was on. She sat against the headboard with Eliza in her arms. He passed her the bottle and climbed next to her on the bed.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s our girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprisingly alert.\u201d</p> <p>Kade leaned over and grinned at their owl-eyed baby. \u201cWhatcha thinkin\u2019 about?</p><p>Wonderin\u2019 what Mama and Daddy have been doin\u2019? Tryin\u2019 to keep us from makin\u2019 a brother or sister for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite your tongue, Kade McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when I\u2019m on the pill and we\u2019ve been using condoms every time.\u201d Immediately, she chattered at Eliza while fussing with her blanket.</p><p>So, the little sneak neglected to tell him she was on the pill. Interesting. Her nondisclosure was another layer of control. Being covered on the birth control front opened up a whole new realm of possibilities in teaching Sky about spontaneity.</p><p>Kade reached for Eliza\u2019s bare foot poking out of the blanket. \u201cHer toes are so tiny.</p><p>Her ears too. She has your cute little turned-up nose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hopin\u2019 she gets your freckles too. And your laugh. I love your laugh. When she wraps those little fingers around mine, I know I\u2019m the one who\u2019s wrapped around hers.</p><p>Sometimes when I\u2019m feedin\u2019 her I just stare at her because she is so amazin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she is.\u201d</p><p>It was one of the most perfect moments of Kade\u2019s life. Contentment filled him, cuddled into Skylar as they admired their creation.</p><p>Eliza finished the bottle and Sky handed her to Kade. She was fully awake even after he burped her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we gonna do with you, sweet girlie? You ain\u2019t gonna go to sleep anytime soon, are ya?\u201d He looked at Sky. \u201cIf you wanna get some shut-eye I\u2019ll take her downstairs and keep her entertained until she falls asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tired. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s had a tough day with all that roping, riding and rodeoing. I\u2019d understand if you want to crash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feelin\u2019 energized if you wanna know the real truth.\u201d</p><p>Sky blushed.</p><p>\u201cWe could watch TV or something in the livin\u2019 room?\u201d</p><p>The look on Skylar\u2019s face indicated she was thinking about the \u201cor something\u201d</p><p>activities they\u2019d been involved in on the couch just a little while ago. Her clothes were still scattered everywhere. The wineglasses were on the coffee table. Would those reminders make her uncomfortable? Or have the opposite effect and make her as crazy to have him again as he was crazy to have her?</p><p>When she didn\u2019t answer, he scooted off the bed. \u201cI\u2019m takin\u2019 her downstairs. Get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on. I\u2019m coming with you guys. Might as well pick a movie since we have that ridiculously large big screen TV. I\u2019ll make popcorn.\u201d</p><p>We. Kade loved the sound of that. He leaned down and kissed her square on the mouth. \u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>The McKay family was overwhelming, to say the least. Add in the two dozen or so West aunts/uncles/cousins and Skylar didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d ever remember anyone\u2019s name. It didn\u2019t help that Kade had deserted her.</p><p>He promised he\u2019d come back. He did not desert you, her inner romantic chastised.</p><p>Good Lord, with all the voices in her head clamoring for attention and offering advice, her mother would\u2019ve been better served naming her Sybil, rather than Skylar.</p><p>Late morning was surprisingly cool for the beginning of September. Wispy white clouds covered the big Wyoming sky. The aroma of barbecue smoke and the occasional whiff of the barnyard overpowered the ever-present scent of sage.</p><p>Skylar shifted in the wicker rocker. She\u2019d attempted to hide in the house, but Kimi insisted on setting her up under a small white tent. One of the three tents needed to house the vast numbers of McKays. Clusters of people filled the other tents. The one she and Eliza inhabited was devoid of activity and Skylar didn\u2019t know whether to be thankful or embarrassed about that fact.</p><p>Horseshoes clinked in the background, competing with the twang of country music drifting from a boom box. Males shouting, females laughing, babies crying, doors slamming, vehicles zooming up the driveway in a cloud of dust\u2014Sky fought off a full-blown panic attack.</p><p>She should\u2019ve invited her sister along. No one would\u2019ve noticed another body among the throng of cowboys and cowgirls. Then again, with India being the tattooed and pierced lady, she\u2019d stick out like a circus performer.</p><p>Eliza squirmed. Sky adjusted her so she laid across her lap, loosening the blanket to keep her from overheating. When she looked up, a little boy around the age of four stared at her curiously. Black hair, vivid blue eyes. His genetics were obvious.</p><p>\u201cWhich McKay are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKyler. Is that really a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally and truly.\u201d</p><p>He peeped at Eliza, practically nose to nose. \u201cSo she\u2019s my cousin? \u2019Cause I ain\u2019t ever had a girl cousin before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many cousins do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout a billion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Just kiddin\u2019. Thane and Gib are both babies. Well, Gib is walkin\u2019 now so he\u2019s kinda cool, but Thane don\u2019t do nothin\u2019 but drool. Kinda borin\u2019 if you ask me, I don\u2019t see the big deal about babies. And Grama is all excited because we\u2019re gonna have another baby in the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think all babies are pretty cool.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cKnow what I think are cool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorses? Do you got a horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. A pony and a horse. And a bb gun. I\u2019m a good shot.\u201d He studied her.</p><p>\u201cUncle Kade\u2019d probably buy you a horse if you asked him real nice. Her too.\u201d</p><p>Skylar bit her cheek to keep from laughing. \u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. He used to come over all the time and ride horses and shoot. How come you don\u2019t let him come over no more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKyler McKay, I\u2019ve been looking for you!\u201d</p><p>The boy muttered, \u201cCrap,\u201d under his breath.</p><p>AJ strode toward them.</p><p>\u201cHiya, Mom. You sure smell good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharm isn\u2019t gonna work, buster. And you\u2019re only saying that because I smell like cookies.\u201d She smiled indulgently and ruffled the dark hair on Kyler\u2019s head. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell Grama you\u2019d pick green beans this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo excuses. Get going, she\u2019s waiting. There\u2019s a bucket hanging on the fence post by the garden gate.\u201d</p><p>The boy crawled under the bottom of the tent and disappeared.</p><p>\u201cI hope he wasn\u2019t a pest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was grateful for the company. He\u2019s an entertaining kid. He was looking for Kade. Have you seen him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe and Colt and Blake were headed for the barn. Why? Do you need me to track him down for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it wouldn\u2019t be too much trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheesh. It\u2019s no trouble at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAJ. There you are.\u201d Macie loped toward them, a dark-haired, brown-eyed baby boy planted on her hip. \u201cCan you take Thane? Carter and his dad are off somewhere and I need to lay down before I throw up again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d AJ cocked Thane on her hip. \u201cAre you doing too much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done cooking for now. I\u2019ll be fine if I can just close my eyes for a bit.\u201d Macie looked at Skylar and Eliza. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s nothing contagious. Carter knocked me up again. I swear that damn virile man intends to keep me barefoot and pregnant for our entire marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr he\u2019s competing with Cash,\u201d AJ said. \u201cHave you met Macie\u2019s dad, Cash Big Crow and his wife, Gemma?\u201d</p><p>Skylar nodded.</p><p>\u201cTheir twins are fifteen months and Gemma is pregnant again. Damn, maybe it is contagious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanning would be happy about that.\u201d</p><p>AJ grinned. \u201cI take it Channing is still going through with the plan to seduce Colby?\u201d</p><p>At Skylar\u2019s blank look, Macie said, \u201cChanning had sort of a rough pregnancy with Gib, so Colby is gun-shy about her getting pregnant again so soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is Gib?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would Channing want to get pregnant again when she already has a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike me, she wants to have kids close together. Besides, once you have a baby, your life is chaos, how much harder could it be to add one more?\u201d</p><p>Skylar hadn\u2019t thought of it that way.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, since Channing is nursing and can\u2019t take the pill, Colby is adamant about using condoms. We all know how...insistent these McKay men are,\u201d Macie said dryly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s managed to hold out on him for the last week. So the next couple of nights she\u2019s pulling out all stops to drive him wild and into having sex without a condom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they haven\u2019t had sex for a week, he\u2019s toast,\u201d AJ said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d</p><p>Skylar froze. Not only were these women confiding something incredibly personal in her, neither of them realized Eliza\u2019s existence was due to lack of a condom. Which meant Kade hadn\u2019t told anyone the down and dirty details about their initial encounter.</p><p>\u201cOh, crap.\u201d Macie clapped a hand over her mouth and raced out of the tent.</p> <p>\u201cPoor thing. I\u2019ll see if I can\u2019t track Kade down for you,\u201d AJ said.</p><p>Skylar\u2019s respite was short-lived. A gorgeous woman with legs up to her armpits, sporting the dark McKay hair and sparkling blue eyes approached her.</p><p>\u201cThis is the girl muscling in on my territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I hold her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you oughta introduce yourself first,\u201d Chassie suggested from behind her.</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m Keely McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. The prodigal McKay daughter,\u201d Skylar said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe any of it. All lies perpetrated by my brothers and cousins to distract everyone from their wild ways.\u201d</p><p>Skylar handed Eliza to her and Keely cradled the baby like a pro.</p><p>\u201cOh, lookit you, beautiful girlie-poo. Whoa, she really looks like Kade.\u201d Keely displayed a dazzling smile. \u201cNo offense.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNone taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Skylar, you own Sky Blue? I love that store, especially the essential oils. I always stop and load up whenever I\u2019m in town. I never see you in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m usually at the manufacturing plant in Moorcroft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, India rocks. She is amazingly talented to boot.\u201d</p><p>Talented was always the tip-off. \u201cWhere\u2019d she tattoo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my butt.\u201d Keely mock-whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t tell. My mother would have a cow if she heard about the big red lips tattooed on my derri\u00e8re.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour secret is safe with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. Don\u2019t mention the McKay brand inked on my hip either.\u201d</p> <p>Sky motioned zipping her lip. \u201cYou said whenever you\u2019re in town. You don\u2019t live here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Right now I live on the road. Middle of September I\u2019ll be back in Denver to finish my sports medicine degree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSports medicine? What kind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m specializing in physical therapy for cowboys who participate in the various pro rodeo tours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means Keely is in her glory, surrounded twenty-four/seven by hot bull riders, bronc busters, and cowboys wickedly good with ropes. And she gets to put her greedy hands all over their sweat-slicked, muscled, half-naked bodies all the time. Bitch,\u201d</p><p>Chassie added good-naturedly.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s rich, Chass, coming from the woman who\u2019s married to one of the hottest guys in the world. Now that he\u2019s off the market I\u2019ll never get to do him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuh-lease. You know I\u2019ve had it bad for Trevor my whole life, since he\u2019s best buds with Colby. And you had to go and marry him. So now he\u2019s essentially my cousin, and I\u2019ll never know firsthand whether he\u2019s as good at ridin\u2019 out of the saddle as he\u2019s rumored to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, the rumors don\u2019t do him justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d Keely shot back.</p><p>Chassie laughed. \u201cNow lemme hold her.\u201d</p><p>Skylar\u2019s head spun. She didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or run. How would she ever get a handle on this family\u2019s dynamics? It seemed they were in each other\u2019s business all the time. Talk about boisterous. And nosy. Did any of these people hold back any personal emotions or thoughts? Or was everything common knowledge?</p><p>Kade isn\u2019t blabbing near and far about the two of you, a prim voice reminded her.</p><p>And if she was totally honest, she was utterly charmed by this wild, crazy and fiercely loyal family.</p><p>\u201cSo when are you and Kade getting married?\u201d Keely asked.</p><p>\u201cUm. I-I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s asked you.\u201d</p><p>Skylar\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s Kade. He\u2019s never brought a woman to a McKay family function before. He\u2019s Mr. \u2018Do the right thing\u2019 more so than any of my brothers, well, except for Cam. Plus, he\u2019s been waiting for the right woman to settle down with for years. He\u2019s always wanted a family of his own. If anyone deserves it, Kade does.\u201d</p><p>What makes you think I\u2019m the right woman? Would I be here if not for Eliza?</p><p>A man sauntered in, garnering Keely\u2019s attention, keeping his back to Skylar. \u201cWay to ditch me, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brothers giving you a hard time again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYa think? Started out with arm wrestlin\u2019. Then I hadta prove my skill with a rope, and a horse, and a rifle, a pistol, and a shotgun. This was all after I did crack of dawn chores with Cord, Colby, Colt, and your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor baby.\u201d Keely kissed him. \u201cCarter cut you some slack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because he\u2019s friends with Jack, who\u2019d happily kick his butt for messin\u2019 with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? My money is on Carter. Your brother Jack is such a know-it-all, pompous, self-righteous, jerkwad, asshat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, now, that\u2019s my kin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I didn\u2019t call him Jack- off like I usually do.\u201d</p><p>Skylar couldn\u2019t help but grin. Keely reminded Sky of India, that same in-your-face personality laced with a rapid-fire wit.</p><p>The man pointed at the baby in Keely\u2019s arms. \u201cWhose kid is that one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousin Kade\u2019s. This is Eliza\u2019s mother, Skylar. Skylar, my boyfriend, Justin Donohue. He\u2019s suffering through the McKay family dramas for the first time too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleased to meet you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Skylar didn\u2019t know if she was more taken aback by his chivalrous hat tip, or that the cowboy was one of the best-looking men she\u2019d ever seen. Blond-haired, green-eyed, with a smile to rival the devil\u2019s. Chiseled features envy of the Marlboro man, and a muscular frame that\u2019d make a body builder jealous.</p><p>When Keely saw Skylar\u2019s thoroughly justified inspection of Justin, she waggled her eyebrows and gave a thumbs up behind Justin\u2019s back.</p><p>Chassie rolled her eyes.</p><p>Sky withheld a chuckle. \u201cWhere are you from, Justin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSouth Dakota, originally. Now I spend my time in Texas when I\u2019m not on the tour.\u201d</p><p>Tour? Was this guy a musician? He sure looked like he\u2019d be at home on the stage in front of thousands of adoring female fans. \u201cWhich tour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Professional Bull Riders tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustin is bull rider, ranked twenty-three in the world standings. He\u2019s my cousin Chase\u2019s traveling partner. We met when I did my stint with the PBR and I worked on his injured shoulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely saved my season. I\u2019d be out if not for her. Except, I suspect her brothers are tryin\u2019 their damndest to kill me, not just re-aggravate my injury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter not mention me sneaking out to see you in the bunkhouse last night, huh?</p><p>They\u2019d really be putting the boots to your very fine ass.\u201d</p><p>Justin hissed, \u201cWill you keep it down? They have loaded guns. And I know they ain\u2019t afraid to use me as target practice.\u201d</p><p>Keely balanced on the tips of her funky cowboy boots decorated with flames and rhinestones, to whisper something in Justin\u2019s ear. His face burned beet red. He grabbed her hand and hauled her outside.</p><p>\u201cBefore you ask, yes, she\u2019s every bit as wild as you\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChass, hon, you have a minute?\u201d Trevor yelled into the tent.</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d Chassie passed Eliza back to Skylar. \u201cDuty calls. See you later.\u201d</p><p>Skylar was alone again. It was a bizarre feeling to consider these people were Eliza\u2019s family; yet, they weren\u2019t Sky\u2019s family.</p><p>They could be if you\u2019d say yes to Kade\u2019s proposal.</p><p>She had been thinking about it, but like India had pointed out, Sky never did anything impulsively. And what was the hurry? They were already living together. She meandered into the yard and saw groups clustered everywhere. A few she recognized\u2014</p><p>Kade\u2019s father and his uncles. Older women. A few guys a decade younger than Kade with the same coloring who had to be more cousins she hadn\u2019t met yet.</p><p>\u201cAmazing, isn\u2019t it? All these good-looking men. Most of them still single. Makes you wonder what\u2019s wrong with them, doesn\u2019t it? Besides the fact they\u2019re ornery cowboys.\u201d</p><p>Sky turned. The woman was as plain looking as she was plainspoken. Stick straight mousy brown hair nearly hid her heart-shaped face. She wasn\u2019t tall; she wasn\u2019t short. She wasn\u2019t fat; she wasn\u2019t skinny. She was sturdy. A woman who\u2019d blend into the background. The typical Wyoming ranch wife. \u201cHave we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ve heard all about you. I\u2019m Libby McKay. Quinn is my husband. I\u2019d introduce you to him, but he abandoned me like he always does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKade disappeared too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter get used to it. Then again, you\u2019ve proven your worth by popping one out, and a girl McKay at that. Wow. Quite an accomplishment.\u201d</p><p>Skylar didn\u2019t know how to respond. It made her wonder if she\u2019d acted aloof when talking to Kade\u2019s assorted family members. Was constantly searching for Kade\u2019s familiar face considered rude? Is that why this woman felt she\u2019d found a kindred spirit? Or was there another reason behind her bitterness?</p><p>\u201cSorry. That was totally uncalled for. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into me lately.</p><p>Quinn always complains that I wouldn\u2019t say shit if I had a mouthful.\u201d Libby smiled and it was genuinely sweet. \u201cCongratulations on your baby. She\u2019s gorgeous. You must be thrilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, thank you. Do you have children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Probably why I\u2019m so defensive about it, huh?\u201d</p><p>Again, Sky kept quiet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll fill you in, since I see the questions in your eyes but you\u2019re too polite to ask, which will change once you\u2019re firmly in the bosom of the buttinsky McKays. Quinn and I have been married the longest of any of his cousins and we\u2019re the only ones without kids.</p><p>So at family functions I hear that question over and over, until I snap at perfect strangers.\u201d She smiled again. \u201cIgnore me. Everyone else does.\u201d Her eyes focused on an object over Skylar\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWell, well, speak of the ignorant devil. There\u2019s my darling husband now. I\u2019ll head him off at the pass and spare you from our marital spat.\u201d</p><p>Libby met a stocky man with his hat pulled down so low Sky couldn\u2019t see his face.</p><p>They fought. Not loudly, but body language spoke more than words anyway. The fight didn\u2019t last long. Libby stomped off and her husband didn\u2019t chase her down. He just watched her go. Didn\u2019t appear airing family grievances was better than keeping them bottled up for Quinn and Libby. The scene bothered Sky enough that she knew she\u2019d forego her usual none-of-your-business mantra and ask Kade about his cousin\u2019s situation later.</p> <p>At loose ends, she spied Carolyn and Kimi taping down tablecloths on the long picnic tables and headed that direction. \u201cNeed help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Soon as I finish I\u2019m gonna take my granddaughter off your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>Kimi\u2019s smile died when she looked at Carolyn, who\u2019d gone absolutely still.</p><p>\u201cCaro? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>Carolyn took off like a bat out of hell and ran across the yard.</p><p>All conversation everywhere ended abruptly.</p><p>A lone figure loped down the driveway. The duffel bag in his hand dropped to the dirt as Carolyn launched herself at him. He spun her around and she was sobbing so loudly they all heard her.</p><p>Kimi gasped softly. \u201cOh my God. That\u2019s Cam.\u201d</p><p>Carson hurried past. Keely shrieked and she was running down the driveway.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Cam?\u201d Skylar asked.</p> <p>\u201cCameron McKay. Carolyn and Carson\u2019s son who\u2019s been in Iraq.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t know he was coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Carter, Colby, Cord and Colt hustled by. As soon as the group finished their private reunion, the remaining family members rushed to meet him.</p><p>Although it made her feel like a voyeur, it was one of the most poignant scenes Sky had ever witnessed and she turned away in embarrassment to hide her tear-stained face.</p><p>Damn hormones.</p><p>But Sky also realized that no matter what happened between her and Kade, Eliza would always be welcomed with open arms in this loving, tight-knit family.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p> <p>Kimi bounded back to the seating area where Skylar hung on the periphery. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see Cam home in one piece, even if it is only for a few days. Every time he\u2019s gotten leave in the last few years, something awful happens over there and it\u2019s cancelled.\u201d</p><p>Skylar searched the McKay crowd for Kade. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetie, I know that look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe, \u2018I\u2019m a new mother and I\u2019m always exhausted\u2019 look. The \u2018who in the heck are all these people\u2019 look. The \u2018where did my man wander off to\u2019 look.\u201d</p><p>Even through her melancholy, Sky was mightily amused by Kade\u2019s mother. \u201cYou recognize all those looks on me already, Kimi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, and this time Kade had nothing to do with it. Here, lemme take Eliza for a bit.</p><p>Why don\u2019t you sneak into the house where it\u2019s quiet?\u201d</p><p>Touched that Kimi seemed to be looking out for her once again, she said, \u201cThanks. I do feel a little lost in the crowd today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s them durn hormones. Having a baby messes you up physically and emotionally for months afterward.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you young women do it all these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had two babies at the same time. I don\u2019t know how you did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth, I don\u2019t either.\u201d She laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a blur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>Kimi made a shooing motion. \u201cNow go on, scat. Eliza and Grama have serious showin\u2019 off to do.\u201d</p><p>Inside the big, old farmhouse, Sky wandered upstairs. Although the styles were the same, this one was much bigger than her house. Six bedrooms ringed a long, wide hallway. At the end opposite the staircase was a small bathroom. She snuck inside and shut the door, half-wishing she, Kade and Eliza could just go home.</p><p>Home. This area was Kade\u2019s home. She\u2019d bet this house was as familiar to Kade as the house he\u2019d grown up in. She stared out the window at the shadowed ridge of mountains in the distance. The hilly prairie, heavy with tall, dry grass, clumps of scrub cedar. Little black specks she assumed were cows. A landscape completely foreign to her, which fit since the ranching lifestyle was equally foreign to her.</p><p>After washing her hands, she\u2019d decided to call India, feeling guilty for her unintentional family neglect of her only sister, when two raps sounded on the door.</p><p>\u201cSkylar? Sweetheart, you all right?\u201d</p><p>Kade.</p><p>She stepped out and resisted throwing herself into his arms. Streaks of grease dotted his face. He looked cute and surprisingly, a bit perplexed.</p><p>\u201cHey. Sorry. I got roped into helpin\u2019 fix an old tractor with Blake and Chet and Remy. Then when Cam showed up I realized I\u2019d left you alone for a coupla hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable. It\u2019s also understandable that I want to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSky\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I know it\u2019s your family time. I won\u2019t whine and make you come with me. You can stay. No big deal. I\u2019ll call my sister to come get me, if you and Eliza wanna hang out.\u201d</p><p>Kade bent down until they were nose to nose. \u201cThat\u2019s what you think? I\u2019d be pissed off about you tryin\u2019 to get me to leave here?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t meant to sound petulant. She hadn\u2019t meant to make him mad either. \u201cI realize you want to be with your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. You are my family.\u201d</p><p>Before she could respond, footsteps echoed up the stairs. Kade grabbed her hand and towed her into the next room and quietly closed the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFindin\u2019 someplace private where we ain\u2019t gonna be overheard by everyone.\u201d Kade crowded her against the wall. \u201cYou wanna tell me why you\u2019ve got that lost look in your pretty eyes and why you\u2019re hidin\u2019 out in the damn bathroom?\u201d</p><p>Because I was adrift until you showed up.</p><p>\u201cSky?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired, I\u2019m so tired all the damn time and it\u2019s been stressful meeting your whole family at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine. Despite what you think, we can go home right now, if you want to.\u201d</p><p>She was ridiculously thrilled he considered her place home. She reached up to wipe a grease smudge from his nose. \u201cGot a little dirty playing with your big boy toys, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. It looks good on you.\u201d Sky let her fingertips wander over the angles of his face, cheekbones, jaw and up to his forehead. \u201cVery, very good.\u201d</p><p>Kade stared at her in that way which made everything feminine inside her go all soft and moist.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Grama Kimi just absconded with Princess Eliza and she\u2019d probably throw a fit if we attempted to leave.\u201d Skylar brushed a piece of hay out of his hair. He smelled good. Like earth and animals and machinery. Like home.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t have Grama disappointed,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She continued to stroke his temple and the smooth section of skin in front of his ear, loving the chance to touch him however she pleased.</p><p>The air in the room seemed heavier, thicker with intent. His. Hers. For once, she didn\u2019t fight it. She embraced it. Encouraged it.</p><p>\u201cKnow something, Mr. McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, Miz Ellison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, I looked lost and lonely because I was lost and lonely. I missed you.</p><p>Even though everyone has been really nice and welcoming, it\u2019s not the same if you\u2019re not with me. Then I really seem like a whiner for feeling that I don\u2019t belong here with these people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lumpin\u2019 me in with \u2018these people\u2019, Sky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen where do I fit in, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Hoping to lighten both their moods, she teased, \u201cYou fit in me perfectly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheeky woman.\u201d Kade turned his head and kissed her forearm. Then lightning fast, he pinned both wrists above her head with just one of his rough-skinned hands.</p><p>She squeaked with surprise. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnforcin\u2019 a new rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this like the naked rule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. If you touch me, I get to touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are touching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot where I wanna be touchin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>She wet her lips just to watch his eyes flare with desire. \u201cAnd where would you like to be touching me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverywhere. But I can get real specific in a helluva hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d She arched into him as he nuzzled her neck. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, Sky, I want you so fuckin\u2019 bad I can\u2019t think beyond hikin\u2019 up your skirt and nailin\u2019 you against this wall.\u201d</p><p>Her silent chant of do it, do it, do it throbbed in her blood so loudly she hoped he\u2019d hear it.</p><p>Kade breathed in her ear, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinkin\u2019 about last night all damn day. Have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. It was the hottest sex ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I get you home, I\u2019m gonna try my damndest to turn it up a notch or ten.\u201d</p><p>His mouth was like liquid fire on her skin. \u201cKade. I-I don\u2019t want to wait until we get home. I want you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jesus. I was wonderin\u2019 how fast and sweet I was gonna hafta talk to do this.\u201d He tugged at her skirt until it pooled around her ankles and he crushed his mouth to hers. His hand was between her legs, stroking her through her panties. He broke away momentarily to whisper, \u201cI love the skirts you always wear. Not only do you look sexy as hell, nothin\u2019 like easy access to this hot body I can\u2019t get enough of.\u201d He kissed her again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Skylar whimpered at the contrasting sensations.

Help me get these damn jeans off\u2014\u201d</p><p>Laughing softly, he said, \u201cI love that you\u2019re impatient,\u201d and stripped the denim to the tops of his boots, clamping his hands on her ass. \u201cWrap your legs around my waist as I lift you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too heavy\u2014\u201d earned her four sharp smacks on her ass that stung like a bitch.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore where that came from if you say shit like that again.\u201d</p><p>He hoisted her against the wall. His cock impaled her in one swift movement.</p><p>Skylar gasped.</p><p>\u201cSsh.\u201d He kissed her and began to thrust slow and steady.</p><p>She wreathed her arms around Kade\u2019s neck and held on.</p><p>They moved together, lost in each other, straining closer to that point of no return.</p><p>His cock seemed harder, thicker, hotter as he didn\u2019t pull completely out. Made for a very intense intimate connection and one she knew she\u2019d searched her whole life for.</p><p>Or did the hurry hurry hurry feeling stem from the chance they might get caught?</p><p>Maybe, but sex with Kade had an edge. His hands gripped her butt, pushing, pulling, grinding and the constant contact with her clit sent her spiraling into a short, intense orgasm.</p><p>Kade swallowed her cries, never missing a stroke.</p><p>When she quit gasping, he put his mouth on her ear. \u201cI love to make you come. It gets me off.\u201d His hips pistoned faster and he groaned against her throat. She felt each hot pulse as his cock emptied inside her. She realized she could feel it because he hadn\u2019t worn a condom.</p><p>Ah. So he had noticed her admission she was on the pill. It was just like him not to comment.</p><p>Even as Kade was trying to catch his breath, he panted, \u201cSkylar. Marry me.\u201d</p><p>She whispered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWorth a shot.\u201d</p><p>He smothered her laugh and set her back on her feet. Her underwear was ruined so she used it to wipe up the milky liquid trickling down the inside of her thigh.</p><p>Kade\u2019s eyes glittered possessively as he fastened his belt. \u201cIs it chauvinistic to say I like seein\u2019 my seed runnin\u2019 down your leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Then I\u2019m really a pig because I sure like makin\u2019 love to you without a condom.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her skirt up, wondering why she wasn\u2019t icked out by going commando. In fact, it primed her for more sexy and naughty fun. \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t tell I was on the pill\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had an unplanned pregnancy, Sky. You don\u2019t gotta explain nothin\u2019 to me. But I\u2019d like to think you woulda told me at some point.\u201d</p><p>Certainly not the reaction she\u2019d expected. But she was slowly figuring out that just because Kade McKay was even-keeled, he wasn\u2019t the most predictable man she\u2019d ever known, and maybe that wasn\u2019t such a bad thing.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say we get our girl and head on home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d</p><p>They snuck back downstairs like a couple of guilty teens.</p><p>Outside, dinner was in full swing.</p><p>\u201cAunt C ain\u2019t gonna let us leave without eatin\u2019 first,\u201d Kade said.</p><p>\u201cI am kinda hungry. We can stay, if you want.\u201d</p><p>A look of gratitude flashed in his eyes and he kissed her cheek. \u201cWe\u2019ll go right after, I promise.\u201d</p><p>After they loaded their plates, Kade was called over to talk to his dad, who was proudly holding Eliza. She ended up sitting with Kade\u2019s cousins, Remy and Chet West.</p><p>She knew them since their construction company had remodeled her store in Sundance, but for some reason, she hadn\u2019t made the West/McKay family connection.</p><p>The beefy guys were as equally fine-looking as their McKay counterparts, but fair-haired, fair-skinned, bulky, like a band of Viking warriors, rather than the \u201cblack Irish\u201d</p><p>looks associated with the McKays.</p><p>Chet said, \u201cHello, Skylar. Our lucky day. I was hopin\u2019 a single woman would join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne that isn\u2019t related to us,\u201d Remy added. \u201cSpeaking of related to us...Aunt Kimi has been cartin\u2019 around your beautiful baby.\u201d Remy leaned forward, his hazel eyes dancing with humor. \u201cYou could\u2019ve told us Kade is her daddy. We can keep a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this family? Right.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, flashing his dimples. \u201cYou\u2019re catching on quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousins are socially inept, so I\u2019ll introduce myself. Blake West.\u201d</p><p>The man at the end of the table had a halo of golden curls adorning his deeply tanned face. His eyes were the color of melted milk chocolate. \u201cNice to meet you, Blake.</p><p>Explain the family affiliation, even though I\u2019ll probably forget. Apparently pregnancy and childbirth has sucked out all my memory brain cells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father, Darren West, is Kimi and Carolyn\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in the construction business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI help them out occasionally, but my main occupation is raising sheep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheep? Is it a family operation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust me and dad. We ain\u2019t land barons like the McKays, got a small spread that barely supports us. So my older brother, Nick moved to Denver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? My sister just moved here from Denver. What does your brother do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a cop. Upgraded to detective last year.\u201d</p><p>Ironic, considering India had spent time in the slammer in Mile High City, not that she\u2019d share that tidbit, despite the McKays wouldn\u2019t think twice about tossing that in the conversation.</p><p>After a few minutes of polite chitchat, Remy said, \u201cSo what\u2019s going on with you and Kade? I hear he\u2019s living with you?\u201d</p><p>Chet groaned. \u201cJesus, Rem. You\u2019re as bad as Aunt Genevieve. I can\u2019t take him anywhere, I swear.\u201d</p><p>A large shadow fell across the table. Sky looked up, expecting to see Kade, but Cam McKay hovered over her. The man was huge; he had to be at least six-foot-five. His shoulders were damn near as wide as the picnic table, yet not an ounce of fat clung to his enormous biceps and flat stomach. With his buzz haircut, camouflage pants and tight T-shirt, he epitomized the lean, mean, fighting machine depicted in the army ads on TV.</p><p>\u201cPull up a chair, Cam,\u201d Chet said.</p><p>Cam plopped down. He offered her a smile. \u201cHave we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m Skylar Ellison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Skylar.\u201d He offered his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Cameron McKay.\u201d</p><p>Sky tried not to stare, but Cam didn\u2019t look much like his brothers, beyond having those same blue eyes. With dark blond hair, he resembled Chet, Remy and Blake more than the McKays, except for Carter. Still, he was striking looking, if a bit menacing.</p><p>\u201cWho are you here with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here with me, Cam, and if you don\u2019t let go of her hand I\u2019m gonna hafta break yours,\u201d Kade said.</p><p>Cam brought her hand to his lips and took his own sweet time kissing her knuckles.</p><p>Kade growled.</p><p>\u201cJust kiddin\u2019, K, sit down and chill out.\u201d Cam grinned. \u201cCongrats are in order on your daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Kade sandwiched himself on her other side. \u201cGlad to have you home, cuz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to be here, although it\u2019s a little weird seein\u2019 all the women and babies around my brothers.\u201d</p><p>She listened while the guys chatted, at obvious ease with each other on a level Skylar didn\u2019t understand. The only person she\u2019d ever shared that kind of connection with was India, and only in the years since India became sober. When Kade put his hand on her leg and squeezed, she was touched he\u2019d sensed her mood.</p><p>\u201cIf we set it up for Wednesday night, everybody oughta be able to come right?</p><p>Kade? You in?\u201d Cam asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Golden Boot? Yeah. I could swing by. We ain\u2019t gonna start hayin\u2019 until Thursday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to celebrate. That part of ranchin\u2019 sucks ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why we\u2019re very glad we aren\u2019t ranchers,\u201d Chet said, and clinked his beer bottle to Remy\u2019s.</p><p>Cam added his longneck to the toast at the last second and said, \u201cAmen.\u201d</p><p>Sky noticed Kade looking at Cam oddly. Was it surprising to him that Cam admitted he didn\u2019t want to ranch?</p><p>\u201cYou think Colt will come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. He ain\u2019t stepped foot in the place in the year since he quit drinkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we oughta go someplace else, so he don\u2019t feel uncomfortable,\u201d Cam said.</p><p>Sky faced him. \u201cThat\u2019d make him feel worse. Just invite him like you normally would. Either way, it\u2019s his choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the advice. I appreciate it. Six o\u2019clock, Wednesday night, at the Golden Boot.\u201d Cam leaned over to give Kade an intimidating stare. \u201cSkylar\u2019s smart, beautiful and throws good fillies. Remind me again, why she ain\u2019t got your ring on her finger?\u201d</p><p>Chet and Remy both went, \u201cOoh.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause she keeps sayin\u2019 no.\u201d</p><p>Skylar blushed.</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019s even smarter than I thought,\u201d Cam said with a wink.</p><p>Amidst the sounds of more laughter, Sky heard Eliza crying. Kimi approached and Kade scooped Eliza in his arms before Sky stood.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our cue to get home.\u201d Kade held out his hand to Sky. \u201cReady, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s just tired, son. If you want to put her down with the other babies...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, she\u2019s been a handful this week. Skylar and I are both beat. Tell Aunt C </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>thanks.\u201d He kissed Kimi on the top of the head. \u201cSee ya, Grama.\u201d</p><p>Once Eliza was in her car seat in the back of the deluxe cab, and they were driving down the dusty road, Skylar scooted across the bench seat to sit right next to Kade. She set her head on his shoulder and sighed.</p><p>Kade didn\u2019t say a word. He just wrapped his arm around her and smiled like he knew exactly what she was thinking.</p><p>Her last thought before she floated into sleepy contentment was maybe she wasn\u2019t so smart to keep saying no to this man.</p> <p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>The second they walked in the door, Eliza was all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.</p><p>When it became obvious the baby wasn\u2019t interested in napping, Skylar begged off to finish paperwork at the manufacturing plant.</p><p>Kade had noticed a few things outside Skylar\u2019s place that needed further inspection.</p><p>He tied a hat on Eliza\u2019s head, and dressed her in an outfit which completely covered her lily-white skin. Took him some time to decipher how the baby pack worked. Once he\u2019d strapped her to his belly, facing forward so she could see the world, her legs kicked like a frog\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cYou like bein\u2019 outside. I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re gonna be a tomboy.\u201d He adjusted his ball cap and wandered to the old wooden barn. The building listed to the right in a bad way, presenting a serious hazard. It could collapse at any time. He\u2019d talk to Skylar about knocking it down before the first snowfall.</p><p>A long prefabricated metal barn was kitty-corner from the house. It wasn\u2019t in too bad of shape, but it\u2019d been jam-packed with all sorts of junk\u2014antique machinery, tools, rusted paint cans and empty feed sacks. Rope. Lots of rope.</p><p>He unhooked a chunk of rope that wasn\u2019t too thick or too thin. He jerked a foot-long section of it between his hands. Plenty of give. Could use it for quite a few things. Might come in handy.</p><p>A flash of inspiration struck him. He knew exactly how he could put the rope to good use. He draped it over his shoulder.</p><p>Kade always did things with purpose, so it was nice just to meander, no destination or agenda in mind, talking to Eliza as they wallowed in the lazy afternoon. It pleased him Skylar hadn\u2019t cultivated the stereotypical suburban lawn, but allowed the landscape remain natural. Rugged. A backdrop of long, gold and brown grasses, stubby groundcover the color of cinnamon, sagebrush, and the occasional yellow daisy popped up, all blended seamlessly past the barbed wire fence and across the pasture.</p><p>An oak tree with gnarled branches grew in the middle of the backyard. Usually only scrub oak survived and they never reached that size. He stopped under the canopy of shade and looked up. A sturdy branch stuck straight out from the thick trunk.</p> <p>\u201cWhatcha think, Eliza? Nice and peaceful in this spot. Shady. That\u2019d be a perfect place for a tire swing, wouldn\u2019t it? Made outta one of them big tractor tires?\u201d</p><p>She grunted.</p><p>\u201cNo? Would you rather have a wooden swing so you didn\u2019t get your pretty pink clothes coated with black rubber?\u201d Her feet moved. Kade laughed and wrapped his hands around her chubby calves. \u201cWooden it is, though it\u2019ll be a few years before I\u2019ll let you swing on it, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>If you\u2019re even around.</p><p>He refused to consider he might not be living here in the future. He was making progress with Skylar, slow, but it was still progress. Whether she\u2019d admit it was a whole</p><p>\u2019nother story. Then again, earlier today, she\u2019d admitted she wanted him. And she\u2019d been willing to toss caution to the wind to have him. One week ago he couldn\u2019t fathom Skylar banging his brains out in a strange house, with strangers around, and chance they\u2019d get caught.</p><p>Man. It\u2019d been hot as hell, hoisting her against the wall. Feeling the hot, tight caress of her pussy around his cock without a layer of latex. Sky\u2019d matched him thrust for thrust, move for move, kiss for kiss. Those noises she\u2019d made in his mouth when she came...damn.</p><p>The self-assured Skylar hiding in his aunt and uncle\u2019s upstairs bathroom had knocked him for a loop. When she\u2019d reached out, touching him so sweetly, telling him, and showing him she did need him on an emotional level as well as a physical one, he\u2019d been tempted to blurt out\u2014 Baby, I love you, right then.</p> <p>Luckily he\u2019d refrained. Talk about spooking the woman. India might be of the no pain, no gain school of thought, but these days, Kade was more inclined to follow the old saying slow and steady wins the race.</p><p>Kade circled the perimeter from the house to the barns, to the granary and machine shed. He\u2019d been pleased to find the chicken coop in relatively decent shape. He rested his boot on the bottom rung of the fence, scrutinizing the field. He studied the green patches of high grass, noting cattle or horses hadn\u2019t grazed in it for a number of years. It looked healthy. How much land did Skylar own? He racked his brain trying to remember if she\u2019d told him.</p><p>\u201cBaby girl, what\u2019s your mama\u2019s acreage?\u201d</p><p>Eliza grunted.</p><p>\u201cI know, never ask a cowgirl the size of her spread. If I could fence that area off, it\u2019d be a perfect place for your pony. Still want a white one?\u201d</p><p>She grunted again. Then Kade knew why she\u2019d been grunting.</p><p>\u201cWhoo-ee, are you Miss Stinky Britches. Let\u2019s go in and get you changed.\u201d</p><p>How one little thing could poop so much boggled his mind. By the time he\u2019d bathed her, dressed her, changed his clothes and fed her, they were both yawning. Kade stretched out on the couch. Eliza was sound asleep on his chest and he didn\u2019t have the energy to move. Truth be told, he didn\u2019t want to move. It was an ideal way to spend an afternoon, at home with his family.</p><p>He tucked the blanket around her, kissed her sweet-smelling head and drifted away.</p><p>That\u2019s how Sky found them. Father and daughter snuggled together like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>It is. He belongs with her. He belongs here. He could belong to you.</p><p>But would he? Despite what he claimed he\u2019d written in the missing letter, part of her believed Kade wouldn\u2019t be here, with her, if it wasn\u2019t for Eliza. Another part of her believed the reason he\u2019d become so sexually demanding was not in an effort to get her to open up to new sexual experiences, or to give him control of her pleasure, but so she\u2019d willingly provide him with enough sexual variety that if she did accept his marriage proposal, he wouldn\u2019t be tempted to look elsewhere for the kind of kink he needed in bed.</p><p>If that\u2019s true, then why did he ask you to marry him before he revealed that side of himself?</p><p>Still, she couldn\u2019t deny Kade had lovingly brought out a side of herself she\u2019d ignored her whole life\u2014her sexuality. And the man hadn\u2019t exploited it; he\u2019d reveled in it.</p><p>Sky was judging him harshly on either scenario. Why? So she covered her bases for when he (invariably) took what he wanted and bailed?</p><p>Lord. India was right. She could over-think everything.</p><p>One thing Skylar couldn\u2019t deny was Kade\u2019s commitment to Eliza. His actions spoke louder than words. She leaned against the doorjamb and watched them sleep for a good long time before she turned away.</p><p>An hour later she heard them stirring. She warmed up a bottle and put the finishing touches on supper.</p><p>Kade came around the corner, barefoot, wearing ratty surfer shorts, a threadbare tank top, sporting a five-o\u2019clock shadow and his hair stuck out every which way. He looked so damn cute she grinned at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. You hungry?\u201d</p><p>Eliza cried.</p><p>\u201cGuess that answers that.\u201d Sky reached for her. \u201cGotcha covered, baby girl. Let Daddy eat.\u201d</p><p>She popped the bottle in Eliza\u2019s mouth and looked up to see Kade looming over her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d He slid his tongue over the seam of her lips, until she opened her mouth for him fully. His kiss pacified and inflamed, both sweet and spicy. Kade eased back without a word, which was A-okay with Sky, since she was thunderstruck anyway.</p><p>The evening passed uneventfully, which was fine by her. She never dreamed she\u2019d be so...happy to sit on the porch swing, holding hands and admiring the stars. When Eliza dozed off Kade put her to bed.</p><p>But the man who returned downstairs didn\u2019t look like Kade, the sweet, loving father.</p><p>He looked like Kade, the dark, demanding lover.</p><p>Desire rolled over her like a hot summer breeze.</p><p>\u201cSkylar. C\u2019mere.\u201d</p><p>She walked to where he stood at the bottom of the staircase with his legs braced apart, his arms behind his back.</p><p>\u201cPick a hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Do you have a present for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA present of sorts. Pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Okay. The left hand.\u201d</p><p>Kade\u2019s instant grin was decidedly predatory. He thrust out his arm. A length of rope dangled from his fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think it\u2019s for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA new clothesline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. Try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tie something up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. You.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach pitched. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause it\u2019s gonna be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. Where is this private rodeo event going to happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour room because that\u2019s what a four-poster bed was designed for, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Eliza\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs sleepin\u2019 in the guest bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cWhat was in your other hand?\u201d</p><p>He grinned again and held out...another length of rope.</p><p>\u201cHey! That\u2019s cheating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already warned you I wasn\u2019t gonna play fair. Get upstairs. The nekkid rule is now in effect.\u201d</p><p>Her bare feet shuffled on the rug.</p><p>\u201cOr would you rather I trussed you up, tossed you over my shoulder and we played out my pirate and the wench fantasy?\u201d</p><p>Skylar\u2019s mind created the image of Kade in a billowy white shirt, his gleaming chest muscles rippling like the sea. Knee-high glossy black boots gave way to tight breeches, which accentuated the size of his big...sword. His visage was topped off with a silky black eye patch and a shark-like smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He said, \u201cThat\u2019s a fine choice, me hearty lass,\u201d and started toward her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going. But I don\u2019t mind telling you I\u2019m a little nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be, darlin\u2019, \u2019cause I am a force to be reckoned with when it comes to ropes.\u201d To prove it, he snapped one rope low to the floor, and a crack reverberated through the air, loud as a gunshot.</p> <p>Skylar took off like a bullet.</p><p>Kade waited a full five minutes before he followed her, as he let the scenarios run in his head.</p><p>Nothing painful. Nothing degrading. Nothing but her at his mercy.</p><p>A dark thrill zipped through him, potent as whiskey.</p><p>The bedroom door was ajar. Lamplight spilled across the carpet into the hallway. No candles. He\u2019d been half-afraid candles would cast the room with a dungeon-like vibe and he didn\u2019t want her to be scared. Kade wanted Skylar turned on beyond compare.</p> <p>She sat in the middle of the bed, knees drawn up to her chest, eyeing the ropes attached to the wooden posts, not with curiosity, or fear, but with resignation.</p><p>Before Kade spoke, or touched her, Skylar blurted, \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to whip me are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless you aren\u2019t cooperatin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKade!\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and placed his hands on her tense shoulders. \u201cNo whippin\u2019s, sweetheart, I promise. I\u2019d never hurt you. Lay back.\u201d When she didn\u2019t obey right away, he nudged her.</p><p>Kade stretched her arms in a \u201cY\u201d, taking the opportunity to feel that soft, warm flesh beneath his callused hands. He tied her left wrist first, then her right and moved down to tie each of her ankles. He sat back and admired Skylar spread-eagled before him.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t strain against the ropes or you\u2019ll get a nasty rope burn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy to say, not so easy to do when you\u2019re touching me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t even started touchin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>He crawled up her body. Bracing himself on all fours above her, Kade kissed her.</p><p>And kissed her. And kept kissing her until she relaxed into the mattress.</p><p>He pushed up on his knees and whipped off his shirt. As he returned to softly brush his lips over her cheeks and eyes and forehead and temple, he allowed her nipples fleeting contact with the hair on his chest.</p><p>Skylar moaned softly. \u201cI like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He kept the same amount of friction on her breasts as his mouth journeyed down her throat. Scraping his teeth over the graceful arch. \u201cHave I ever told you how much I love your neck? But especially this spot right here.\u201d Kade traced his tongue up her collarbone. \u201cYou usually push me away. Drives you so crazy that you can\u2019t stand it.</p> <p>Hard to push me away when you don\u2019t have use of your hands, ain\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you come like this? If I suck\u2014\u201d he let his breath drift above the area, \u201c\u2014</p><p>right here?\u201d Kade lightly flickered his tongue on the magic spot, sank his teeth into that tempting flesh and sucked hard until she bucked into him.</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>Kade smiled against her throat, continuing to use his breath and lips and tongue and teeth. The only places he touched her were the tips of her nipples rubbing on his chest and his mouth on her neck. He\u2019d tease her and retreat until a fine sheen of sweat coated her skin and he could smell that sweet, sweet cream gathered between her trembling thighs.</p><p>He hopped off the bed.</p><p>Skylar lifted her head. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re naked and at my mercy? No place.\u201d Kade stripped off his remaining clothes. He reached for the spare ropes and brought them back on the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are those for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d He took the thickest one, a tan rope about two inches in diameter, made of coarsely twisted twine and snapped it between his hands. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 to be scared of, I promise.\u201d</p><p>The moment her eyes were shut, Kade dragged the rope over her naked body.</p><p>Starting with the underside of her arms. Winding it around her tits. Across her belly.</p><p>Between her hips. Knowing by the way her spine arched she enjoyed the contrasting tactile sensations of the bristly rope sliding against her soft skin. He didn\u2019t rush. The weight and texture of the rope left light pink stripes from her neck to her knees.</p><p>Kade swirled the softly frayed end over her clit.</p><p>\u201cThat tickles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must not be doin\u2019 it right then.\u201d He flicked faster. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He kept up the movement until her thighs became rigid and she cried out,</p><p>\u201cOh God, oh, don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>He pinched her left nipple as she started to come, and she bucked her hips up, begging for more than the feather light touch of the rope\u2014his fingers, his mouth, his cock. He watched her self-consciousness disappear as she lost herself in her body\u2019s response.</p><p>Finally she opened her eyes. \u201cWow. You are good with ropes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t seen nothin\u2019 yet, baby.\u201d He tossed the thick rope to the floor and picked up the lighter, white cotton one.</p><p>\u201cKade. What\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d He crawled off the end of the bed and stood between her spread-eagled legs. He slithered the thinner, softer rope down the tops of her thighs, from the crease of her hip to her kneecap. Up and down. Back and forth. When he journeyed further south and touched her toes, she jerked hard. He murmured, \u201cAre your feet ticklish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Yes.\u201d</p><p>Kade threaded the rope through each one of her toes. Then he gently pulled the rope as his mouth connected with the vulnerable skin on her foot just inside her ankle. He tongued and suckled, while swirling the rope through her outstretched toes.</p><p>Her leg shook and her chest rose and fell rapidly.</p><p>Good thing Sky was tied up, otherwise she\u2019d be kicking him in the face. He said,</p><p>\u201cTime for the other foot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. I-I can\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><p>Kade ignored her. This time after winding the rope through her toes, he nibbled the top of her foot as he tugged, lightly licking the tips of her cute little piggies. He watched as gooseflesh rippled up her calves. When his gaze reached above her knee, he noticed the inside of her thighs were wet and slick with her juices.</p><p>He abandoned the rope with a growl. He flattened himself between her legs, slapped his palms on the inside of her thighs and set his mouth on her. Feasting on her moist, soft folds. Inserting one finger into her pussy, then two, then three. Feeling her cunt muscles pulse around his fingers as they plunged deep. Losing himself in the taste of her against his lips and tongue, her essence flowing down the back of his throat. Her scent settling on his skin, filling his lungs. His head, his heart, and his soul rejoiced with her pleading cries and sexy moans as Sky repeated, please Kade over and over. Kade hummed as he sucked her clit and she came in a gush of sweet, sticky warmth.</p><p>When she quit thrashing and throbbing, she lifted her flushed face to look at him, still lying between her legs. Kade licked his lips and said, \u201cMmm. I love doin\u2019 that to you. I love that you\u2019re tied up and I can do anything I want. I love...\u201d</p><p>You. Baby, I love you so damn much it\u2019s killin\u2019 me to keep it inside. I wanna tell you.</p><p>I wanna whisper it in your ear while I\u2019m lovin\u2019 you. I wanna shout it to the world.</p><p>\u201cKade? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never finished the sentence. You love, what?\u201d</p><p>Kade stared at the two spots of color the last orgasm had left on her cheekbones. Was that hope shining in her eyes? Or fear? Rather than chance ruining the moment, he grinned cagily. \u201cI love that you\u2019re gonna return the favor right now, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>He shimmied up her body, placing his knees on either side of her ribs. \u201cI\u2019ve got a hankerin\u2019 to do a little sixty-nine action with you, but it\u2019d be a mite difficult without usin\u2019 your hands.\u201d He ran his knuckles down the smooth skin of her face. \u201cEver had a tongue in your pussy while you were suckin\u2019 on a cock?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cEver had your tits fucked?\u201d</p><p>Again, she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThese are perfect. Watch.\u201d Kade cupped her breasts in his hands and clasped them together tightly. \u201cArch up, baby, yeah, just like that.\u201d He slid his dick in the valley of her cleavage and grunted. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d While strumming her nipples, he rocked his hips, slowly sliding in, dragging the sensitive underside of his cock over the hard bone at the base of her throat, then pulling back and surrounding his rock-hard shaft with soft, warm tightness. It was sexy as hell seeing the dark purple head of his cock vanishing into the creamy white flesh and peeping out the other side.</p><p>His eyes met hers. \u201cDo you like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d like you coming on my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not gonna come on you. I\u2019m gonna come in you.\u201d He shifted back. \u201cI want your mouth on me now.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Skylar licked her lips.</p><p>\u201cTastin\u2019 you has got me so turned on. With as close as I am to blowin\u2019, this is gonna be a little rougher than last time.\u201d He reached for the headboard with one hand and held his cock in the other as he angled his pelvis over her face. \u201cOpen up.\u201d</p><p>She flicked her sassy tongue across the slit bubbling over with pre-come.</p><p>The tip of his cock passed over her teeth and her lips closed around the head.</p><p>Instantly, the wet heat made his whole body shake. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Don\u2019t arch your neck. Take me in. All of it.\u201d</p><p>A devilish gleam entered her eyes and she hummed around his knob. It sent an electric charge straight to balls.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Sky, you tryin\u2019 to make me shoot first thing?\u201d</p><p>Her head bobbed, warmth enveloped his dick, followed by a cool rush of air as she released him. Time and time again. Her mouth moved up and down the length in a continuous slide of heat and wetness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kade\u2019s thighs were clenched tight as he pumped his hips into her face. He loved to watch his cock tunneling in and out of her mouth. Loved to see the flush on her cheeks.</p><p>Loved the feminine look of power and surrender in her eyes.</p><p>When she began to suck hard, hollowing her cheeks, well, Kade went a little crazy.</p><p>He pushed a bit deeper, thrust faster at the visual of her lips stretched around his girth.</p><p>\u201cSkylar.\u201d Careening over the edge of insanity, he plunged in and gripped her head, keeping it still as his cock emptied down the back of her throat. He groaned at the sensation of those strong throat muscles working as she swallowed until he had nothing left.</p><p>He slipped his cock from her mouth, and rested his head on her belly, catching his breath.</p><p>Her voice was just above a whisper. \u201cI wish I could touch you. Kade, untie me. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Kade scattered kisses over her stomach, surprised his dick was raring to go again. \u201cI\u2019m gonna fuck you like this. Putting my hands, my mouth, my tongue and my cock anywhere I want to.\u201d</p><p>Skylar was unnaturally quiet.</p><p>He glanced up at her. \u201cWhat? No secrets between us, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Where all do you plan on sticking that big cock of yours?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou\u2019ve liked where I\u2019ve put it so far.\u201d Kade curled his hands around her hips, and slid them to her spine and down to cup her butt cheeks. \u201cYou know how much I love this ass. Touchin\u2019 it, squeezin\u2019 it. Kissin\u2019 it. Does it make you excited to think about me slidin\u2019 my cock in your ass?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something wickedly dirty and raunchy about doin\u2019 that. I\u2019d be the first man to have that part of you, wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Skylar nodded.</p><p>Kade moved so they were face to face. \u201cThen I want it. I\u2019m gonna take it, Sky, and you\u2019re gonna love every fuckin\u2019 minute of givin\u2019 it to me. Not tonight. But soon. Very soon.\u201d His lips grazed her cheek. \u201cFor now, I need you again.\u201d Bracing his hands by her head, he slipped inside her in a single smooth thrust.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes.\u201d</p><p>He fucked her hard and fast. Followed by slow and easy. Kissing her throat, her lips, tasting himself on her tongue. He built her higher and higher, holding back his darker needs to meet hers. When she came, the sweet aftershocks pulled him under, swamping him with such a mix of emotion he could scarcely keep in check.</p><p>While Kade\u2019s body still pulsed with pleasure, he whispered, \u201cSkylar. Marry me.\u201d</p><p>She nipped his earlobe hard and said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I oughta keep you tied up until you say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be fair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t think straight when I can\u2019t feel my arms or my legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because all your focus is on how great I make your pussy feel, which ain\u2019t so bad, near as I can figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCocky man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it.\u201d He lifted up and was surprised to see worry in her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt you, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me feel things I never thought I would, Kade. Things that are way scarier than being tied up and tied down and subjected to your every sexual whim.\u201d</p><p>Kade knew that confession wasn\u2019t easy for her to make. Rather than say the wrong thing, he said nothing as he gently untied her arms. He winced at seeing the red rope marks and feathered kisses over her wrists. He did the same thing for her ankles.</p><p>As he kissed her and she melted into him, he realized he\u2019d been going about asking Sky to marry him in the wrong way. Of course she\u2019d keep saying no, when she was naked and sweaty and on the downhill slide from an orgasm. That\u2019s not exactly the special moment they could share with their grandkids anyway. So Kade would wait and ask her again after he\u2019d created a romantic scene, something she\u2019d never forget.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>When Sky parked in the driveway after work the next day, she was surprised to see Kade sprawled on the wicker chaise on the front porch, with his working hat pulled over his eyes. He didn\u2019t budge when she started up the steps with Eliza in her arms. \u201cKade?</p><p>You okay?\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cTired. You wore me out last night, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Her entire body flashed with pure heat in remembrance of their bedroom antics.</p><p>Kade tying her up and demanding her total submission. Him gorging on her until she whimpered and begged. Bringing her beyond the point of rational thought where nothing existed but his single-minded concentration on her sexual pleasure.</p><p>And what mind-blowing pleasure it\u2019d been.</p><p>Even after he\u2019d untied her and they\u2019d seen to Eliza\u2019s needs, he\u2019d been so sweet and so...loving. Cocooning his big, warm frame around hers as they fell asleep. A few hours later he\u2019d woken to have his wicked way with her again. As they lay spooned together, he\u2019d brought her top leg back over his hip as he entered her from behind. Kade\u2019s hand clasped hers, stretching their arms so they could grasp the headboard for stability as he steadily fucked her. His free hand roved, plucking her nipples, stroking her clit, while he licked and kissed the side of her neck. It still brought a delicious tingle when she recalled the masculine growls he\u2019d uttered against her skin as he\u2019d climaxed.</p><p>\u201cGaa!\u201d</p><p>Kade removed his hat and his eyes flipped open. \u201cIs that Eliza speak for get up?\u201d</p><p>Her arms flailed uncontrollably.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cCome give Daddy some sugar.\u201d</p><p>Skylar passed Eliza over and Kade lifted her to blow a raspberry on her little round belly.</p><p>The baby squealed with delight. He murmured something to her that set her legs in motion.</p><p>\u201cYou are a really great father, Kade.\u201d</p><p>Without taking his eyes from Eliza\u2019s face, he said to Skylar, \u201cAre you surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Last year when we were dating you mentioned how jealous you were of all your cousins who were having babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNumerous times. I thought you were feeding me full of bull since I\u2019d never met a man who admitted he cared about that kind of stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. I remember hintin\u2019 around that I was ready to settle down and have a family of my own. But you never took the hint. Then or now.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach flip-flopped.</p><p>Kade sat up. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m a little punchy and too tired to rustle up anything to eat.</p><p>How about if I take my best girls out for supper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, my treat. Steak and a cold beer sounds mighty tasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mind drivin\u2019? I\u2019ve been in my truck enough today and I\u2019m really beat.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t reminded her of the long haul he drove every day to make her feel bad, but she did nonetheless. \u201cI worry about you making that drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Promise me you\u2019ll be careful. Promise me if you\u2019re too tired to drive by yourself you\u2019ll call me to come and get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d Kade stood and curled his hand around the back of Sky\u2019s head and kissed her. \u201cI\u2019m not complainin\u2019. It\u2019s just the road home to you seems to get longer every damn day.\u201d</p><p>The road home to you. Right then, her day, her world felt complete. \u201cCome on, cowboy. If you play your cards right, I might even bring home a slice of chocolate cake so I can fulfill your frosting fantasy.\u201d</p><p>Eliza slept on the way into Moorcroft, allowing them to share their respective days.</p><p>Unfortunately, Eliza\u2019s nap meant she was wide-awake in the restaurant. Wide-awake and extremely fussy. They passed her back and forth, but nothing soothed their cranky daughter. Sky ate quickly while Kade bounced and cajoled Eliza. Then Skylar held the baby while Kade wolfed down his steak. The second Eliza let loose a shriek of distress, they exited the restaurant to the dirty looks of patrons who\u2019d left their children at home so they could enjoy a quiet dinner out.</p><p>\u201cGuess a candlelight dinner for three ain\u2019t her cup of tea,\u201d Kade said dryly.</p><p>The drive home wasn\u2019t any better. Eliza screamed in her car seat. She screamed in the house. She quieted down long enough to drink a bottle, but she threw most of it up on Kade. She was red-faced and mad during her bath. Her legs were kicking, her back arching as Kade put clean clothes on her.</p><p>During the two hours of nonstop crying, Kade didn\u2019t try to pass the unhappy infant to Skylar. And it wasn\u2019t due to his male stubbornness, but Kade\u2019s desire to figure out for himself how to deal with Eliza when she wasn\u2019t all sweet smiles and cute baby coos.</p><p>Which only made Sky more crazy about him because the man never gave up, never took the easy way out, even when he was exhausted.</p><p>After Eliza finally crashed, Kade flopped on the couch next to Skylar and groaned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m whupped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine. What time did you leave to go to the ranch this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour-thirty. I was already up after we...you know.\u201d</p><p>Sky smiled. Kade? Shy? After everything they\u2019d done together? \u201cAfter we did the wild thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the fourth time, woman. I think I deserve to go to bed early tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor baby.\u201d Skylar grabbed his hand and kissed his knuckles. \u201cCome outside and sit on the swing with me. The moon is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He cracked an eye open. \u201cJust moon gazin\u2019? No hanky-panky? You\u2019ll be a perfect gentlewoman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>They strolled onto the porch, hand in hand, and stared at the big, fat moon, a golden orb that rolled across the midnight blue sky. A gentle breeze stirred the persistent scent of sage as they set the swing in motion.</p><p>Kade exhaled on a sigh. \u201cOne good thing about you not havin\u2019 cattle around here yet.</p><p>No barnyard scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d She paused. \u201cYet? You planning on bringing barnyard animals home, McKay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure. I promised Eliza a pony. I think I promised to buy her a Corvette when she turned sixteen to get her to stop bawlin\u2019 tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it didn\u2019t work, so I don\u2019t think it counts. Anyway, I thought I\u2019d talk to Cord about gettin\u2019 us a coupla horses so we can go ridin\u2019 when the mood strikes us. And that chicken coop is in good shape if you wanna try your hand at raisin\u2019 chickens. Ma has some great setters.

Night sounds surrounded them in a soothing outdoor lullaby.</p><p>He asked, \u201cCan you smell that sweet scent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of flower is that?\u201d</p><p>She inhaled. \u201cWhich one? The faint floral of the petunias? The pungent pepper of the marigolds? The sugary sweetness of the sweet peas? Or the heavy perfume of the clematis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell the difference between all of them? That\u2019s amazin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. It\u2019s what I do. I\u2019ll bet if we drove by a field of cattle you could tell me which variety every one was and whose brand they wore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. But I can tell you, with how the air feels and with the wind pickin\u2019 up, it\u2019s gonna be rainin\u2019 before too much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d probably better do this before we get soaked.\u201d Skylar gathered her skirt up and swung a leg over his lap, straddling him, pressing her chest against his and her lips on his surprised mouth.</p> <p>Didn\u2019t take Kade long to get with the program. Didn\u2019t take him long to try to wrest control, either. He patted her ass in a signal to lift up. He yanked down his sweat bottoms and all that smooth male hardness rested against his belly.</p><p>She wiggled closer, proving she wasn\u2019t wearing panties.</p><p>\u201cI like this naughty side of you. Maybe I oughta institute a no panties rule, like the nekkid rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m game. Especially since I know how much you like the skirts I wear. Every time you see me you\u2019ll wonder if I\u2019m going commando.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed his answering groan as his hands cupped her face. Rubbing his length against her cleft made her wet enough to push him inside.</p><p>\u201cJesus. That\u2019s always so good.\u201d</p><p>Sky sank her teeth into his bottom lip and tugged. \u201cSee? You aren\u2019t too tired. I\u2019ll do all the work. You just have to keep the swing in motion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said no hanky-panky?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said no hanky-panky. I agreed to be a gentlewoman. And I\u2019ll be very, very gentle, I promise.\u201d</p><p>She kissed the strong line of his jaw up to his ear. \u201cLet me rock your world, Kade, like you rock mine.\u201d</p><p>And amidst the creaking of the swing and the approaching storm she did just that.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>It poured all day. Coming to work on a rainy Tuesday depressed everyone in her employ.</p><p>But it was impossible to be depressed when Skylar relived Kade\u2019s glorious rainy morning wake-up call. Long, thorough kisses. His rough-skinned hands bestowing sweeping caresses over her bare skin.</p><p>Their naked bodies rolled and twisted in an unhurried lover\u2019s dance. Kade worshipped her breasts with his fingers, teeth and lips. Squeezing, suckling, nipping, dragging his morning beard across the hardened tips of her nipples. Circling open-mouthed kisses over every swell and curve until she damn near came just from the erotic heat of his mouth.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t close to done.</p><p>Nothing was a lovely as the dreamy feeling of his tongue lazily penetrating her pussy in the hazy gray predawn. His silky hair teasing the inside of her thighs as he licked and lapped at the thick cream pouring from her sex. His fingers digging into her ass cheeks as he brought her to a gasping orgasm two times, before gently turning her over on the cotton sheets.</p><p>A cool breeze floated in the window, heavy with the dark scent of moist soil drenched in rain. The humid air settled on Skylar\u2019s heated skin, as soft and welcome as Kade\u2019s kisses.</p><p>Kade stretched her arms above her head and hiked her hips up, trailing his wet tongue down her spine a vertebra at a time. That naughty, wicked tongue kept right on going, between her cheeks, across her tailbone, down to the puckered rosette. The tip of his tongue teased the nerve-rich tissues, drawing tighter circles, wetter circles, probing her ass completely. He\u2019d chuckled at her moan of approval.</p><p>Then Kade widened her stance and rose to his knees behind her, adjusting her pelvis higher, to his height and to his liking.</p><p>No hard, fast thrust. His entry was slow and sweet. Once his cock was fully seated, he began to stroke, a long withdrawal, a quick snap of his hips and he pushed that thick, hard cock in deep again.</p><p>She\u2019d rested the left side of her head toward the window. A soft draft stirred the scents of rain, damp sheets, and Kade\u2019s sweaty masculine tang into an intoxicating aroma that left her mindless. Breathless.</p><p>His hands moved from gripping her hips to gripping her ass. He separated her cheeks, baring that tight little hole and whispered, \u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>Skylar looked over her shoulder as he sucked his middle finger into his mouth, hollowing his cheeks. He slowly pulled it out, showing her it was good and wet. Then he placed it against her puckered flesh and slipped it in her ass.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Kade never missed a stroke as fucked her with his finger and his cock. Pleasure beat at her from all angles. When a second finger joined the first and he began ramming into her both places, she sank her teeth into her upper arm to keep from crying out as another climax erupted as fast and furious as a windstorm.</p><p>The sounds of skin slapping skin stopped abruptly as Kade stiffened. Liquid male heat coated her spasming interior walls in strong bursts, and his low grunt of male satisfaction made everything inside her preen. After he was spent, he layered his chest over her back and nuzzled the back of her head. \u201cGood mornin\u2019, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkylar. Did you hear me?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at Annie glaring at her in the doorway. Crap. \u201cNo. Thinking about something else. Sorry. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhone. Line two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She picked up the receiver and hit the flashing button. \u201cThis is Skylar Ellison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck is my wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play stupid. Where\u2019s my wife? And my kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know goddamn good and well who it is. Now lemme talk to that bitch Nadia right fuckin\u2019 now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, but Nadia isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fuck she ain\u2019t. She ain\u2019t been home in three damn days. The only places she ever goes is work and home and she sure as shit ain\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to stay calm. \u201cI suggest if you think your wife is missing, you contact the sheriff\u2019s department and file a missing person\u2019s report.\u201d Skylar hung up.</p><p>Jesus. That man was a piece of work.</p><p>Nadia\u2019s words, they\u2019re all just like him, rang in her head.</p><p>Wrong. Kade wasn\u2019t like that. Not at all. He\u2019d never shown a single sign of violent behavior.</p><p>She looked around her office and groaned. She\u2019d fallen behind since Eliza\u2019s birth in keeping up with the piles of paper clutter. A dozen cardboard boxes were stacked against the wall. Suppliers\u2019 catalogues, trade magazines, junk mail, all stuff she needed to go through before she tossed it in the shredder.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t she the boss? Couldn\u2019t she make someone else do the drudgework for a change? Congratulating herself on her sneaky cleverness, Sky dialed Annie\u2019s extension and said sweetly, \u201cCould I see you for a minute?\u201d</p><p>Annie swung open the door, propped herself against the doorjamb. \u201cI know that look, boss. No way. You\u2019ve been puttin\u2019 off cleanin\u2019 this office for two months. I ain\u2019t doin\u2019 it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit. How did you know? Please? I\u2019ll pay you extra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh, not worth it. Besides, I already went through all this junk once and sloughed it off to you because I didn\u2019t know what the hell to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuck up, little camper. This is why you get paid the big bucks. Don\u2019t forget, tomorrow is your day in the kiddie ward and you ain\u2019t passin\u2019 that off on me, neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did I hire you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a snappy dresser and I can smell bullshit a mile away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of bullshit...The last phone call. Did you know that was Nadia\u2019s husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Caller ID. Third time he\u2019s called today, but he finally asked for you.\u201d Her eyes glittered. \u201cMean motherfucker needs to die. I offered to help Nadia pull a \u2018Good-bye Earl\u2019 on him, but she wouldn\u2019t go for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou offered to kill the man with poisoned black-eyed peas?\u201d</p><p>Annie grinned. \u201cOr a poison kiss with a black powder Smith and Wesson. Whatever works.\u201d</p><p>Sky shook her head. \u201cForget I asked.\u201d</p><p>With a resigned sigh, Skylar plopped on the floor in front of the first box. An hour later ninety-nine percent of it was in the trash. She eyed the other eleven boxes. Maybe she ought to save herself a bunch of time and just chuck the whole works.</p><p>Nah. If she tackled one box a day, she\u2019d be done in two weeks. Easy. Doable.</p><p>A visit to check on Eliza in daycare and she returned to work, steering clear of any more distracting wet daydreams about her favorite naked cowboy.</p><p>Kade returned home later than usual. Quieter than usual too. Looking exhausted again. He changed into an outfit similar to hers, ratty sweat shorts and a tank top since they were both out of clean clothes. He lavished attention on Eliza while Skylar caught up on mountains of laundry. They were running low on baby supplies and groceries.</p><p>She frowned. When was the last time she\u2019d been to the store to stock up? At least a month ago. Before Kade moved in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Had Kade ever picked up diapers and formula? She wandered into the living room and saw Eliza on a blanket on the floor and Kade lying on his side next to her.</p><p>He said, \u201cI think she\u2019s gonna roll over soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s too young.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot accordin\u2019 to Brazelton. Lookit how fast she\u2019s kickin\u2019 them legs. Any time now she\u2019s gonna be rockin\u2019 and rollin\u2019, ain\u2019t you, baby girl?\u201d</p><p>Eliza grinned and made a goo noise.</p><p>That girl was shameless when it came to charming her daddy.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I think she\u2019s teethin\u2019, that\u2019s why she\u2019s been so cranky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she supposed to be gettin\u2019 another round of shots at four months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I haven\u2019t made the appointment yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Well, we don\u2019t want her fallin\u2019 behind schedule. Be best if it was taken care of right away.\u201d</p><p>Skylar crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take care of it? Eliza sees Dr. Monroe. She\u2019s in Moorcroft. Set it up in one of the convenient Monday through Friday, nine-to-five timeslots, wait with other sick kids for two hours for an appointment that lasts ten minutes. This time you can hold her when she screams as they poke needles in her legs, since I know how much you love needles. And you can walk the floor with her for two days afterward because the shots always make her sick and cranky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, now. Don\u2019t get defensive. I was just sayin\u2019\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what you were saying, Kade. You want to be involved with every little thing? Here\u2019s your chance. And while you\u2019re at it, why don\u2019t you pick up diapers and formula because we\u2019re almost out. And we\u2019re running low on food and laundry soap and cleaning supplies and everything else it takes to run this household.\u201d She spun on her heel and stomped to the laundry room.</p> <p>Thwack. She threw the sopping wet clothes in the dryer. Stupid spin cycle wasn\u2019t working. Might as well wring the damn clothes out by hand or it\u2019d take forever for the load to dry. She couldn\u2019t hang them outside since it was still raining.</p><p>By the time she\u2019d squeezed out the excess water in the laundry tub, hung up the drip-dry items, started another load and swept up the last of the powdered detergent she\u2019d spilled all over the floor in her fit of anger, Skylar had calmed down some. And realized she\u2019d been a total jerk to Kade. The man always did everything she\u2019d asked, a lot of times he did things before she even thought of them. He was nothing but sweet and cheerful, helpful and kind to her and to Eliza, and she\u2019d snapped at him like a fishwife.</p><p>Wife.</p><p>Dammit, that wasn\u2019t a word she should use to describe herself or her relationship with Kade. She was not Kade McKay\u2019s wife.</p><p>And doesn\u2019t it bother you just a little? He hasn\u2019t asked you to marry him after he\u2019d made love to you? Not since the night he tied you up.</p><p>No. That was not it. Unhappy if he asked her; unhappy if he didn\u2019t ask her. She was not that psycho and controlling.</p><p>Was she?</p><p>Yes, it appeared she was.</p> <p>Argh.</p><p>Sky sucked it up and went to apologize to him. She found the living room empty.</p><p>She dashed upstairs. No Kade. No Eliza.</p><p>Oh hell no. He hadn\u2019t gotten pissed off and taken off with their baby, had he?</p><p>Can you blame him if he did? Haven\u2019t you been afraid all along he\u2019d take her or sue for joint custody?</p><p>She flung open the front door. Sure enough, his truck was gone. Sky unearthed her phone and dialed his cell number, a number she\u2019d programmed in, but never called.</p><p>Didn\u2019t that just speak volumes about how much she wanted to prove she didn\u2019t need him?</p><p>Argh.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKade? Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in my truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Eliza with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s with me. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoin\u2019 to the store.\u201d Pause. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you were anglin\u2019 for when you threw that hissy fit, not more than a half hour ago?\u201d</p><p>Shit. Shame heated her cheeks. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a hissy fit.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cYeah, sweetheart, it was.\u201d</p><p>She managed a smile. \u201cFine, it was. But I didn\u2019t expect you to drop everything and go right then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t doin\u2019 nothin\u2019 else and it needed to be done, or else you wouldn\u2019t have made such a big deal about it, right?\u201d</p><p>The man was so damn even-keeled. Why wasn\u2019t he barking at her for being such a bitch to him? Demanding an apology?</p><p>\u201cSkylar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it needed to be done. I\u2019m sorry I snapped at you. Thank you for taking care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? That wasn\u2019t so hard. And you\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just not used to help of any kind, especially not immediate help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another thing that\u2019s gonna change. Look, I wanna help out, but I need direction. I\u2019m a longtime bachelor, darlin\u2019. I\u2019d live on chili and ramen noodles and wash clothes only when I was completely out of \u2019em if I was in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing you have me, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good thing, but you\u2019re foolin\u2019 yourself if you think the only reasons I\u2019m with you is because you can cook and do laundry.\u201d</p><p>Are you with me only because of Eliza?</p><p>\u201cBesides, sweet thang told me she had a hankerin\u2019 to ride in the truck.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cShe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. She loves Gretchen Wilson. She already knows all the words to \u2018Redneck Woman\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Sky pressed her forehead to the rain-slick wooden pillar on the porch. She resisted asking him if he\u2019d grabbed the diaper bag. Or if he\u2019d bundled Eliza up since the night air was damp. Or if he knew what kind of formula and diapers to buy. She really resisted asking him why he hadn\u2019t asked her to come along.</p><p>Because the sobering truth was, Kade didn\u2019t need her to come along. He could handle anything when it came to Eliza, with or without her.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t that thought make her happy?</p><p>Because she wanted him to need her, the way she was beginning to need him.</p><p>\u201cSky, we\u2019re at the store. We\u2019ll see you in a bit.\u201d</p><p>She clicked the phone shut and stayed on the porch, absorbing the warm rain, feeling bewildered, and a little bereft.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>Lights bobbed up the driveway. Kade\u2019s truck rolled to a stop. The door opened and a baby wailed. Skylar dashed down the porch steps before Kade had Eliza out of the car seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mad at me for some reason. She screamed all the way home. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not you personally, Kade.\u201d Sky unbuckled Eliza, picked her up, and right away Eliza snuggled into her and quit crying.</p><p>Kade froze. \u201cWhat did you do to get her to stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing magical. Must be luck.\u201d She draped the blanket over Eliza to keep the rain off. Inside, while she waited for the bottle to warm, she changed Eliza\u2019s diaper and put her in her fuzzy pajamas.</p><p>After sucking down the bottle, Eliza fell asleep as if she\u2019d been drugged, rosebud mouth slack, dark head thrown back. Sky settled her in her crib and returned to the kitchen.</p><p>Kade was drinking a beer, gazing out the back door. She saw six canisters of formula, three bags of diapers, a gallon of milk, a bag of apples, a six-pack of beer and a chocolate cake.</p><p>Hmm. She hadn\u2019t given him a list, but still, slim pickin\u2019s. \u201cKade? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I never knew how damn hard it was to shop with a baby. Like a dumbass I took her out of her car seat, thinkin\u2019 the car seat would take up too much room in the cart. So I\u2019m holdin\u2019 her, tryin\u2019 to steer the cart with one hand. I made it to the baby aisle and loaded up her stuff. By the time I reached the bakery, she was screamin\u2019. She screamed in the dairy aisle. She screamed in the produce section. All these people were starin\u2019 at me like I was the worst parent ever\u2014or glarin\u2019 at her like she was one of them bratty kids you hear all over the store. I grabbed beer and booked it to the check-out.\u201d</p><p>He drained the bottle and set it on the counter. \u201cAnd Eliza was the damn Energizer Bunny\u2014she just kept on a goin\u2019. The checker couldn\u2019t wait to get rid of us. I loaded the pitiful amount of groceries in the cart and realized I couldn\u2019t push it, hold her, and unlock the truck door, even if it hadn\u2019t been rainin\u2019. I had to ask the carryout boy to help me.</p><p>With five lousy bags.\u201d</p><p>Skylar circled her arms around his waist, pressing her face into the middle of his back, hoping she was giving him half the effortless comfort he always offered her.</p><p>\u201cShopping is hard. I usually leave Eliza with India when I go to the store to stock up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish I\u2019da known that. No, I\u2019m glad I learned firsthand how hard it is just to do simple things when you\u2019re cartin\u2019 around a baby.\u201d Kade turned into her embrace and tilted her face up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t around, Sky. For everything. For your pregnancy and her birth, but mostly because you\u2019ve had to do all this stuff yourself and it ain\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop beating yourself up. Let\u2019s move forward, not back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Does that mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>A blinding reflection of headlights flashed in the window behind Kade. Skylar looked over her shoulder. A car had pulled up by the outside fencepost and cut the lights.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is dropping by at ten at night? Were you expecting anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this. Not at all.\u201d She scurried out of the house and made it halfway up the gravel driveway, when the rear car door opened. The chink chink chink of glass bottles hitting rocks echoed back to her.</p><p>\u201cHey! What are you doing?\u201d She began to run. \u201cThis is private property!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The car was thrown into reverse, narrowly missing the fence. The engine gunned, muddy water and gravel sprayed her from head to bare toes as the vehicle fishtailed down the driveway and out of sight.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit!\u201d</p><p>A large hand landed on her shoulder and spun her around. \u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you see that car? They were dumping garbage and who knows what else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you ran out here to confront them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were trespassing. What if they\u2019d tried to break into the plant? Or tried to dump something toxic that\u2019ll cost me thousands of dollars in clean up costs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Skylar, what if they would\u2019ve pulled a gun out and shot you?\u201d</p><p>She went utterly still.</p> <p>\u201cBustin\u2019 a couple of underage kids for drinkin\u2019 ain\u2019t worth your time and sure as hell ain\u2019t worth your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever do anything like that again, do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Feeling like an idiot, Skylar twisted out of his grip and raced back to the house.</p><p>She\u2019d reached the tiny strip of grass in front of the porch, when again, she was jerked around. This time Kade hauled her to her toes. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until you answer me. Don\u2019t you ever take chances like that, do you understand?\u201d He shook her a little. \u201cDo you have any idea what the thought of anything happenin\u2019 to you does to me?\u201d</p> <p>She whispered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt rips me clean apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Just don\u2019t.\u201d He dragged her into his arms and squeezed her so tightly she couldn\u2019t breathe. He kissed the top of her head as he muttered in her wet hair. His mouth grazed her forehead. Her temple. Her cheek. But when he reached her lips, his mouth didn\u2019t graze; it devoured.</p><p>Sky kissed him back as ferociously. With need. Frustration. Every negative emotion fed their passion. Fueled their urgency.</p><p>Kade released her. He yanked her tank top over her head. Dragged her shorts down her legs. Tore off his own clothes.</p><p>\u201cJust like this. Dirty, angry and wet.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for her response. They half-fell to the soggy ground with a splash.</p><p>In the downpour of the cool rain, Sky swore she could see steam coming off their heated bodies. Kade pinned her hands above her head. She was lost to any kind of reality beyond his solid weight pressing into her. She shrieked when his mouth latched onto her nipple and sucked it with enough force it hit the back of his throat.</p> <p>Skylar said, \u201cPlease, please, please,\u201d and hooked her ankles in the small of his back, pumping her hips to urge him higher.</p><p>The slick head of his cock slipped over her clit and then all that thick rigid maleness surged inside her.</p><p>A gasping sob burst from her lungs.</p><p>Kade put his mouth on her ear. \u201cI wanna hear you.\u201d</p><p>Sky knew neither of them would last long, it was too intense. The need too sharp.</p><p>She craved that orgasmic rush, she burned for it. She arched and bucked and thrashed against his thrusting body demanding, \u201cMore. Kade, please.\u201d</p><p>His cock jackhammered into her. Hard. Fast. Deep. Water sloshed around them. He growled, \u201cLet me hear you. Scream for me.\u201d</p><p>That did it. The tight coil unraveled. She screamed until every throbbing pulse slowed to nothing more than a dull throb. She blinked away the rainwater and opened her eyes, to see Kade staring at her.</p><p>\u201cGod. Skylar. I-I\u2014\u201d His whole body convulsed as he came with a roar. Afterward, he buried his face in her neck even when he still shook.</p><p>The rain fell steadily. It was startlingly peaceful, in the aftermath of such an emotional storm, hearing the water droplets pinging on the metal downspouts. Smelling the parched earth beneath them soaking in every drop of moisture. Feeling Kade\u2019s rough fingers braceleting her wrists. Feeling him hot and hard inside her. Listening to their labored breathing returning to a normal cadence.</p><p>Yes, there was a certain contentment accepting that not only had she given this man control of her body, he\u2019d taken control of her heart.</p><p>Kade had fucked Skylar like an absolute animal, in a mud puddle, on the front lawn.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>A primal sense of satisfaction howled inside him and he couldn\u2019t wait to take her again. Mark her as his.</p><p>He released her wrists and lifted his upper body to look down at her.</p><p>She brushed the wet hair stuck to his forehead and palmed his cheek, allowing the pad of her thumb to trace his lips. She didn\u2019t say a word. She didn\u2019t make any move to...well, move.</p><p>Kade opened his mouth to speak and she shook her head. Then Sky kissed him with sweetness and passion, which got him all hard and needy and desperate again.</p><p>She preferred this be a wordless encounter? Fine. What he planned to do to her would probably make her pretty damn speechless anyway.</p><p>He eased his cock out of her body and rolled to his feet. Kade helped her up, then snatched their discarded sodden clothes, leaving them on the porch. He led her up the stairs, past her bedroom and straight into the bathroom.</p><p>With the hall light on and the door cracked open, there was no need to turn on the overhead lights. She stepped in the shower and cranked the handle, giving him time to snag what he needed from his shaving kit.</p><p>Kade pulled the shower curtain back and joined her under the warm spray.</p><p>As she rinsed her hair, he lathered up a washcloth with lemon sage scented soap and began to wash her. The graceful line of her neck. Then her full breasts. Her belly. The flare of her hips. Down each leg.</p><p>Wordlessly, he urged her to turn around. Kade swept the suds across her shoulders.</p><p>Over her back and spine. When he reached her pear-shaped butt that drove him insane with lust, he pressed closer to her. The water cascaded over them, sending soapy swirls to their feet and down the drain.</p><p>He pushed her hair to the side and spoke against her wet skin. \u201cSkylar. Your ass is mine tonight. I\u2019m gonna fuck it, right here, standin\u2019 up in the shower.\u201d His teeth tugged on her lobe and she shivered. \u201cI\u2019ll make it so good for you you\u2019ll be screaming again.</p><p>We\u2019ll go as slow as you want, but goddamn I need you like this. I need a part of you that\u2019s just mine.\u201d</p><p>Sky released a soft sigh and rubbed her face against his razor-stubbled cheek. \u201cWill it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little at first.\u201d Kade kissed the tender skin below her ear. \u201cAre you worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I\u2019ve got plenty of lube.\u201d His excitement caused his stuttered breath to drift across her damp skin. She shuddered and made that little squeaking moan that drove him insane with lust. \u201cYou liked havin\u2019 my fingers and my tongue teasin\u2019 you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d She paused. \u201cWould you let me do the same thing to you?\u201d</p><p>Whoa. Not the question he\u2019d expected. \u201cYou mean, strap on a rubber cock, stick it up my ass and fuck me with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, if that\u2019s something you wanna try, I\u2019m game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. Ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 wrong with doin\u2019 anything that brings us both pleasure.\u201d He whispered, \u201cWhat happens in our bedroom or in our shower or on our front lawn ain\u2019t nobody\u2019s business but ours.\u201d</p><p>She laughed the bellish sound he loved and his heart damn near burst.</p><p>\u201cLet me have you like this, all warm, soft and slippery wet.\u201d</p><p>When Kade dropped the bar of soap Sky looked at him with a mischievous grin. \u201cIs this where you tell me to bend over and pick it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart ass.\u201d He sucked her lower lip and bit down gently before releasing it. He\u2019d crowded her to the back of the tub. \u201cTurn around and brace your hands on the wall.\u201d</p><p>Soon as she did, Kade placed her right foot up on the corner ledge. He took his time smoothing his hand over the outside of her ankle, up her muscled calf and the curve of her thigh. He reached for the lube and squeezed a good amount onto his fingers. Pressing his chest to her back, he licked the water beading on her shoulder as he fingered her hole.</p><p>Skylar\u2019s body tensed as he inserted the first finger, followed quickly by the second.</p><p>Kade thrust in and out, stretching her, spreading the lubrication high and wide, kissing her neck. His cock ached as her muscles automatically clamped down on the intrusion.</p><p>\u201cBreathe. Push out. That\u2019s it.\u201d He twisted deeper, fluttering his fingers open and closed, loosening.</p><p>\u201cDo it, I\u2019m ready. I wanna feel all of you. Please.\u201d</p><p>Carefully, he removed his hand.</p><p>As the water beat down on the sexy arch of Sky\u2019s back, he grabbed the lube again, generously coating his shaft from root to head. Once again he was behind her. Breathing hard, anticipation thundered in his blood. Aligning the tip of his cock to that hidden entrance, he pushed just the thick head in past that rigid ring.</p><p>\u201cOh. Wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. No rush.\u201d Right. Kade\u2019s legs shook with the need to slam into her until every inch of his dick was buried balls deep in that tight channel. He slid his hand around her hip, down to her pouting clit, slicking his fingertip through her juices. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch. I love the way you touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is a good thing because I love touchin\u2019 you, Sky.\u201d He sank his teeth into the slope of her shoulder, flicking his finger over her sweet spot, as bit by bit he breached her resistance, sliding his cock up that hot, vise-tight channel. The scrape of those untried anal walls on every throbbing inch of his hard cock caused him to grit his teeth and keep it slow and steady.</p><p>She moaned.</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019m in all the way. Relax. I\u2019ll let you get used to it before I move. How does it feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFull. Burns a little. But in a good way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow how you feel to me?\u201d Kade put his mouth on her ear. \u201cIt\u2019s so fuckin\u2019 hot, havin\u2019 my cock in your ass. Knowin\u2019 no other man has been here. Feelin\u2019 these muscles grippin\u2019 me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A shiver moved through her and gooseflesh broke out across her body.</p><p>He rocked his hips. Each thrust followed by a slow retreat until just the cockhead remained inside. The words slow slow slow repeated in his mind.</p><p>\u201cI need to move faster. Like now. You\u2019re so damn tight...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen move faster.\u201d Skylar turned her head and licked the droplets caught on his stubble. \u201cThe water is getting cold anyway. Keep me warm, Kade. Make me burn. Don\u2019t be a gentleman, be a wild man. Show me.\u201d She placed her fingers over his on her clit and slid their joined hands into her wet, clenching sex.</p><p>He plunged harder. Over and over. Never pulling completely out, but not holding back.</p><p>Sky gasped and thrust against his invading cock as she fucked her pussy with their entwined fingers.</p><p>The constant push/pull of his shaft, and the tight ring of her anal muscles squeezing his glans on the downstroke had his balls drawing up. But it was Skylar\u2019s orgasm that sent him over the edge. He came so hard when her cunt and ass spasmed around his fingers and his dick, that he felt his cock had split in two and he was fucking her both places at once.</p><p>\u201cFuck. Oh fuck. That\u2019s so fuckin\u2019 good.\u201d Kade\u2019s forehead dropped onto her shoulder as another short orgasm blindsided him and shorted out his brain.</p><p>Icy needles on his spine roused him. The water was freezing and he was still buried in her ass. He angled around to kiss her as he pulled out his softened cock.</p><p>She hissed in his mouth but returned his languorous kiss.</p><p>Kade ran his hands over her wet body, gorging his senses on the tactical contrast from her soft, sweet-smelling skin to her slippery skin. He loved making love to Sky in a bed, but there was something very erotic about the heat and slickness of making love in water.</p><p>\u201cLet me dry you off and then we\u2019ll go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you mean to sleep, because I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m up for another round.\u201d</p><p>He smiled against her shoulder. \u201cI mean sleep. But I ain\u2019t gonna lie. I want you in my arms. I wanna hold you until mornin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Sky angled her head and kissed his temple. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too, sweetheart. I\u2019d like that a whole lot.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>Another good thing about having a baby: no need for an alarm clock. Skylar yawned, set her feet on the floor and glanced over her shoulder at Kade...who was staring at her, a sleepy, goofy smile on his rugged face.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Her insides melted. Lord. It should be illegal to look that good at the crack of dawn.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019, handsome.\u201d</p><p>His grin widened. \u201cHandsome? Why, Miz Ellison, I do believe that\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve ever called me that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah? Well, you are handsome, McKay, but don\u2019t get a swelled head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late, dependin\u2019 on which head you\u2019re talkin\u2019 about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha.\u201d She hopped up and lifted Eliza from her crib. Once again Skylar experienced that melting sensation, seeing her sweet baby\u2019s face. \u201cOoh, aren\u2019t you all charming smiles like your daddy this morning?\u201d She kissed the top of Eliza\u2019s head and hugged her close.</p><p>\u201cBring her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know she\u2019d be squawlin\u2019 if she was.\u201d Kade rolled to his side and patted the mattress. \u201cHey, baby girl. Come see Daddy.\u201d</p><p>Eliza turned her head and grinned at him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s shameless.\u201d Sky crawled on the bed and set Eliza on her back between them.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say? She loves me.\u201d</p><p>So do I.</p><p>Her body, her mind, even her blood went absolutely still. Kade didn\u2019t notice. He was smooching Eliza\u2019s cheeks, blowing raspberries on her neck, and letting her pull his hair.</p><p>Oh God. It was true. She loved Kade McKay.</p><p>Her skeptical side demanded, since when?</p><p>Maybe from the start when he\u2019d fainted upon seeing Eliza. Or when he\u2019d insisted on moving in. Or when he\u2019d proven his love for their daughter had no boundaries. Or when he demanded Sky\u2019s complete sexual surrender to him and never abused her trust. Or when he showed with actions, not just words that he understood her, accepted her, and still liked her. Or because he was an eternal optimist, he kept asking her to marry him, even when she kept saying no.</p><p>Dammit. Except Kade hadn\u2019t asked her again last night. After making love to her in the rain. After he initiated her not only into the dark pleasure of anal sex, but showing the side of himself that was closer to an animal than to a man. Revealing a harsher, darker side she suspected he tried very hard to hide. Yet, he\u2019d shared it with her.</p><p>\u201cSky? Ah. A little help here?\u201d</p><p>Eliza had two fistfuls of Kade\u2019s hair, her arms were flailing, her feet randomly kicking him in the chin and neck. Sky peeled Eliza\u2019s fingers open and the baby made a protesting squeal. \u201cI know you like to pull Daddy\u2019s hair, but he shouldn\u2019t let you, because we don\u2019t want you to get a bad reputation at daycare, do we?\u201d She gave Kade an arch look. When he smiled smugly, she refocused on Eliza. \u201cSpeaking of...shall we get a start on our day, snooks? Since I have to be in early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I was hopin\u2019 you could crawl back in bed for a bit.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her eyes to his. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways serious when it comes to gettin\u2019 you nekkid and between the sheets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d When he opened his mouth to institute the naked rule, Sky held up her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll take a rain check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe already did it in the rain once, but I\u2019m up for another round.\u201d</p><p>Such a satisfied male smirk. She smirked back. \u201cYou know what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sore this mornin\u2019, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little. But it was worth it. Man, was it ever worth it.\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes became heavy-lidded with pure lust. \u201cI\u2019ll say. One of the hottest nights of my life. Here I was hopin\u2019 you\u2019d play hooky and we could laze in bed. All. Damn.</p><p>Day.\u201d</p><p>She blushed. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to the ranch?\u201d</p><p>Kade squinted at the rain beating on the window. \u201cI told Dad and Kane I wouldn\u2019t be over if it was rainin\u2019. Not that I\u2019m complainin\u2019 because we need the moisture in a bad way. No point standin\u2019 around doin\u2019 nothin\u2019 there when I could be here. You want me to hang at home with the hair-puller?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Actually, today is my turn in daycare. Even though I\u2019m woefully behind on office work, it wouldn\u2019t be fair if I didn\u2019t pull my weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many munchkins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight including Eliza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I ain\u2019t doin\u2019 nothin\u2019. How about if I do your stint in daycare so you can get caught up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d His gaze narrowed on her. \u201cWhy? You think I can\u2019t do it?\u201d</p><p>Crap. \u201cIt can get kind of crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazier than takin\u2019 care of a couple dozen newborn calves in the snow and havin\u2019 them and their mommas all bawlin\u2019 at the same time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I can do it, do you?\u201d</p><p>Lie lie lie. \u201cIt was sweet of you to offer, Kade\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet, my ass.\u201d He bounced off the bed. \u201cI\u2019m doin\u2019 it. I\u2019m gonna be the best damn daycare worker you\u2019ve ever seen. And I\u2019m so gonna make you eat your words at quittin\u2019 time, boss lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna bet?</p><p>She snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s a sucker bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you put your money where your mouth is?\u201d Kade leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cIf I win, you do something for me. If you win, I do something for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. What do you want if you win?\u201d</p><p>His wolfish grin appeared. \u201cI want you to blow me in my truck while we\u2019re drivin\u2019 down the road.\u201d</p><p>Skylar blinked at him. \u201cOh. My. God. You didn\u2019t just come up with that off the cuff, did you? How long have you been planning something kinky like that, Kade McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you? Since the day we met. The fantasy has just gotten more specific since I know how damn good you are with that sexy mouth of yours.\u201d Kade wrapped a section of Sky\u2019s hair around his finger. \u201cWhat about you? What do you want if you win?\u201d</p><p>For you to ask me to marry you again.</p><p>Dammit. She could not, would not, sound that damn needy. Sky considered him for a second before she smiled. \u201cI want to tie you to the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is unclear about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe specific, \u2019cause if it\u2019s tie me down and leave me there without playin\u2019 any naughty sex games, well, darlin\u2019, that ain\u2019t happenin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be sex games, cowboy, don\u2019t you worry about that.\u201d</p><p>Kade kissed her square on the mouth. \u201cDeal. Now excuse me, I gotta get ready for work. I hear my boss lady is a real hard ass.\u201d</p><p>Sky said, \u201cBaby girl, I think I created a monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s great with kids.\u201d</p><p>If one more person said that to her today, Skylar was going to scream.</p><p>Annie said, \u201cInstead of doin\u2019 arts and crafts, he\u2019s teaching them to throw a rope. And at naptime, he had them drape their blankets over the desks and pretend they were camping out, Old West style. He even got Joey to fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>She growled.</p><p>\u201cAnd, he promised to bring them a pony to ride next time.\u201d</p><p>Sky slapped her hands on the desk. \u201cAnnie. Why are you barging in here and telling me all this when I have work to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I knew it\u2019d drive you crazy.\u201d Annie offered her a benevolent smile. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you oughta tell Kade how you feel about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No. Hell, I don\u2019t know. I mean, I will when it\u2019s not so complicated.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t seem so complicated to me, but then again, I\u2019m just a country girl.

Like he was casing the joint.</p><p>The behavior raised Kade\u2019s hackles. Still, he decided to give the guy the benefit of the doubt. The man disappeared inside the truck cab, then sat up. He tipped a bottle of booze and took several long swallows. Then he jumped out of the truck, puffed up his chest and all Kade\u2019s doubts were fully realized.</p><p>This guy was trouble.</p> <p>Kade intercepted the man about thirty feet from the front entrance. \u201cSomething I can help you with, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t your fuckin\u2019 buddy. Move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Then how\u2019s about you tell me who you are?\u201d</p><p>The man sneered. \u201cHow\u2019s about you back the fuck off, and lemme handle my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s where I have a problem. What goes on in that buildin\u2019 is my business so you\u2019re gonna hafta tell me yours before I let you step another foot on this property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife is in there.

Move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is it to you?\u201d</p><p>Kade was beyond pissed. \u201cWrong answer. Get in your truck and go home.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s beady black eyes shrunk to pinpoints. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep me from my family. She took our kid and she\u2019s hidin\u2019 out in there and I got rights.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a good goddamn about your rights. Get off this property. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt involves my boot in your ass, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet you\u2019d like that you fuckin\u2019 pervert.\u201d</p><p>The steel door banged open and Skylar stormed out. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d The guy brushed past Kade, menace in every ounce of his posture.</p><p>Rather than take a chance this idiot might hurt Skylar, Kade jerked him to a stop by the back of his shirt.</p><p>The man twisted, leading with his fist. He clocked Kade in the jaw with enough force that Kade stumbled back. The guy came after him again, swinging and missing, then driving a punch straight to Kade\u2019s sternum.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Kade launched himself at the idiot. They fell to the soggy ground and Kade landed a solid right to the man\u2019s mouth. Blood burst from the guy\u2019s lip. Kade followed through with another right, but the guy rolled and Kade\u2019s fist connected with mud. Before Kade regained his balance, the man hit him in the side of the head.</p><p>Even though he\u2019d gotten his bell rung, Kade automatically swung low and heard the whump of air as he punched the guy in the stomach. A splash followed as the man fell into a puddle.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d</p><p>When Skylar moved to stand between them, Kade jumped up and blocked her from the man\u2019s long reaching arms, even when the guy was curled up on the ground. \u201cStay back. You have no idea what this guy is capable of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea that you were capable of this kind of behavior.\u201d</p><p>Stung, he said, \u201cHe took the first swing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. Step aside. I\u2019ll handle this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you will.\u201d Kade dropped his voice. \u201cGet in the goddamn building, Skylar, right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time I checked, I owned this place and you do not get to dictate to me here. So back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I will not let you put yourself in a dangerous situation because you think you can handle it.\u201d</p><p>Skylar\u2019s eyes were as cold as he\u2019d ever seen. \u201cI\u2019ll handle it my way and it won\u2019t be with physical violence like you\u2019ve handled it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere ain\u2019t any other way.\u201d</p><p>She sidestepped Kade and addressed the prone man. \u201cRex. Get off my property and don\u2019t come back. If I see you within fifty feet of the front door, I\u2019m calling the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>Mud-covered Rex scrabbled to his feet and shuffled back to his pickup, amidst mutterings of lawsuits. He gunned the engine and was gone.</p><p>Kade seethed. Hadn\u2019t she learned her lesson last night about purposely putting herself in danger? How did Skylar know the idiot didn\u2019t have a gun in his truck? He could\u2019ve pulled it out and started firing at her and gone after everyone in the building. He growled, glaring at her for her short-sighted decision to let the guy go.</p><p>Without turning away from Kade, she pointed to the building. \u201cSee those kids plastered to the window? Kids you spent all day caring for? They\u2019ve been watching you beat the shit out of another man. Every single one of them has had to deal with domestic violence in some form. This is the one place they shouldn\u2019t have that fear. You brought that fear to them today in Technicolor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. He showed up here lookin\u2019 for a fight. I gave him one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve walked away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do a damn thing that was outta line. I\u2019d do it exactly the same way if I had to do it over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that macho cowboy bullshit supposed to impress me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was supposed to protect you. I was just defendin\u2019 myself, and you, and what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to defend me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think you would\u2019ve stood a chance at keepin\u2019 that guy under wraps if he\u2019d\u2019ve come after you? Were you gonna try to reason with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a goddamned break,\u201d Kade snapped. \u201cThat guy was pissed off, outta control and lookin\u2019 for trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re out of control. You\u2019re a hundred times more trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like I suspected, the little bit of control I allowed you wasn\u2019t enough. Now you want all the control in my life and take it at the first opportunity.\u201d Skylar spoke through clenched teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re not content to call the shots in the bedroom any more. You want to do the same here. Guess what? Not happening.\u201d</p><p>Kade could not believe she\u2019d thrown that in his face. Control wasn\u2019t the issue and she damn well knew it. \u201cWell excuse the fuck outta me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put aside your ignorant, wrong and just plain damn petty insult and give it to you straight. This is about safety, not control. And guess what? Your security measures are piss-poor, darlin\u2019. First, that guy shouldna been able to get that close to the building.</p><p>Second, he coulda waltzed right in the front door. Know how I know that? Because I\u2019ve done it several times. No one stoppin\u2019 me, no security inside or out. You, or whoever is in control doesn\u2019t even lock the goddamn door during workin\u2019 hours.\u201d</p><p>Skylar\u2019s icy glare continued.</p><p>\u201cThis is a business. If you\u2019ve hired women with a history of domestic violence issues, you oughta be more vigilant about security issues than normal, not less. Alarms on the doors and windows. A gate with a code box to keep out trespassers. You already have a damn gate, hell, you have two gates, why would you leave them open night and day?</p><p>You\u2019ve got kids in there, Sky. You\u2019ve got my kid in there. And the way it sits, ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 stoppin\u2019 an angry ex or a pissed-off boyfriend from stormin\u2019 the joint with a gun and killin\u2019 every last person in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t happen. Not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. It happens all the time and you know it. So you\u2019d better fix your security problems pronto, because after this incident today, I ain\u2019t about to let you put my daughter in danger any more.\u201d</p><p>Skylar bristled. \u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what I said. Fix the problems or I\u2019ll yank Eliza out of here so fast it\u2019ll make your head spin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuckin\u2019 push me on this because I\u2019d do it in a fuckin\u2019 heartbeat. And yeah, if you wanna be technical, I\u2019m exercisin\u2019 my parental control and right to remove her from a potentially dangerous situation. I\u2019ll make sure my kid don\u2019t become another tragic statistic because you have too much pride to admit you are wrong.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps splashed up next to them. \u201cYou two oughta take this inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone? What the hell do you mean done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, you have a gash on your jaw,\u201d Annie said to Kade. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in and I\u2019ll take a look at it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Probably had worse.\u201d Kade rubbed the sore spot and his fingers came away bloody. Sucker did hurt. \u201cI gotta take off pretty quick anyway.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother to hide the anger in his eyes. \u201cThink about what I said. And don\u2019t wait up for me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>He said, \u201cOut,\u201d and walked away from her without looking back.</p><p>Out.</p><p>Damn him.</p><p>Why did he make her feel like she was in the wrong when he was the one who\u2019d been involved in a fistfight, with her employee\u2019s husband, in the parking lot of her business, in front of her employees? And then he had the balls to tell her how she\u2019d been putting everyone\u2014including their child\u2014in danger? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d threatened to take Eliza away, just like she\u2019d feared.</p><p>Why had she believed Kade would be different from any other man who\u2019d been in her life?

It\u2019s five o\u2019clock.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid everyone see what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.

Embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to her and try to calm her down before she leaves.\u201d</p><p>As she trudged inside, Skylar wondered who was going to calm her down.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna talk about it.\u201d Kade signaled the waitress and held up Cord\u2019s bottle of Budweiser.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Buck?\u201d Cam asked with a snicker. \u201cI gotta admit, it\u2019s funny as shit he\u2019s changed his name after all these years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sick as a dog. I wasn\u2019t at the ranch today and he didn\u2019t answer his cell, so I called Ma and she said he\u2019s got a bad cold, chills, fever, the whole works. Been in bed since yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks. But I\u2019m glad he stayed away. I don\u2019t need to drag that shit back to Iraq with me.\u201d</p><p>Chet said, \u201cWhen you leavin\u2019 again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDay after tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Blake whistled. \u201cDamn short trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but what can you do? Better\u2019n nothin\u2019, since Ma threatened to hop a flight to Baghdad if I didn\u2019t get my ass home soon. Been damn near three years since I\u2019ve been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lotta shit\u2019s happened since then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kiddin\u2019. Good and bad. I almost made it for Carter\u2019s weddin\u2019.\u201d He knocked back a swallow of beer. \u201cDidn\u2019t know about Dag until the day before his funeral. Same with Uncle Harland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much longer you think you\u2019ll be over there?\u201d Colby asked.</p><p>\u201cAt least six months. Then I hafta decide if I wanna re-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck would you wanna re-up if you had the choice not to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Remy, way to be a prick,\u201d Chet said. \u201cCam\u2019s like platoon commander. A real war hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHero. Right.\u201d Cam concentrated on peeling the label off his beer bottle. \u201cEatin\u2019 sand, gettin\u2019 shot at, arrestin\u2019 soldiers, filin\u2019 a million fuckin\u2019 reports, patrollin\u2019 hopin\u2019 I don\u2019t get shot at some more, serious hero shit there.\u201d</p><p>No one said anything while the waitress brought another round.</p><p>Kade took a long sip of beer. It loosened some of the tightness in his shoulders from his huge blowup with Skylar. His pride stung way worse than his jaw and his gut, not that he\u2019d share that with anyone. \u201cI take it Colt ain\u2019t comin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Colby shook his head. \u201cA.A. meetin\u2019 tonight. He don\u2019t miss \u2019em. And thank God for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink maybe you oughta be thankin\u2019 Kade. If it weren\u2019t for him, who knows what might\u2019ve happened to our wayward brother,\u201d Cord said.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my doin\u2019. I just drove him to rehab. Colt made the decision to go there and get sober all by himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I appreciate it, and if I haven\u2019t said thanks for lookin\u2019 out for him, I\u2019m sayin\u2019 it now. Not knowin\u2019 what was goin\u2019 on around here, especially after what went down with Dag, really sucked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSucked pretty bad watchin\u2019 it happen, so in some ways, Cam, you were lucky not to be around.\u201d</p><p>Quinn and Bennett walked in and Cord waved them over.</p><p>After they were seated, Quinn leaned over and said to Kade, \u201cWhere\u2019s your ropin\u2019 partner in crime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis meetin\u2019 night, I guess. He ain\u2019t gonna make it.\u201d</p><p>Bennett pushed his hat back a notch and smirked. \u201cQuinn almost didn\u2019t make it tonight either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Q, why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Ben. Nobody fuckin\u2019 cares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, bro, it\u2019s a funny story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me. It ain\u2019t funny at all.\u201d</p><p>Kade noticed the grim set of Quinn\u2019s mouth and had the perverse hope his cousin had a fight with his wife. Be nice if he wasn\u2019t the only one at the table with woman troubles. He cast a covert look at Cord and Colby, both happily married to sweet women who wouldn\u2019t snap at them for anything, least of all for acting like a man protecting what was his. Skylar\u2019s words echoed in his head: is that macho cowboy bullshit supposed to impress me?</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be that bad,\u201d Cord said.</p><p>Colby laughed. \u201cI recognize that hangdog look, we\u2019ve all been there, you longer than all of us combined. Spill it. What was it Libby wanted you to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s on this kick where she\u2019s tryin\u2019 to find an activity we can do together as a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex is a couple\u2019s activity,\u201d Chet said. \u201cHell, you shouldn\u2019t need nothin\u2019 else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Cord said, chinking his bottle to Colby\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSpoken like a single man, Chet,\u201d Quinn replied. \u201cLibby says what we do on the ranch don\u2019t count. So ridin\u2019 horses, four-wheelers, checkin\u2019 cattle, and cookin\u2019 ain\u2019t a possibility for couple time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>Quinn chugged his beer. \u201cThis is so damn embarrassin\u2019, can we drop it?\u201d</p><p>A chorus of no\u2019s broke the smoky air.</p><p>\u201cHow long you been married again?\u201d Kade asked.</p><p>\u201cSeven years. Been together since high school, so it\u2019s like twelve years and that just proves that she knows how to push my damn buttons. The woman ain\u2019t gonna let up on me \u2019til she gets what she wants, which is my total humiliation.\u201d</p><p>Remy angled closer. \u201cShe ain\u2019t makin\u2019 you wear funny clothes in the bood-war is she? Dressin\u2019 you up like an Indian chief? Or makin\u2019 you wear a saloon girl costume with fishnets, spiked heels and pantaloons while she straps on a six-shooter and plays the part of the gunslinger?\u201d</p><p>Dead silence.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Remy, what the fuck is wrong with you tonight?\u201d Chet hissed.</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot for the mental image of Quinn dressed up as Mae West,\u201d Cam said dryly. \u201cMy cousin as a drag queen\u2014worse than combat nightmares for me for sure.\u201d</p><p>Cord shook his head. \u201cMy brain sort of froze up at the word \u2018strap on\u2019, to be real honest.\u201d</p><p>Kade choked on his beer.</p><p>\u201cPantaloons?\u201d Colby frowned. \u201cWhere\u2019d you even hear that word, Remy? A John Wayne movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBein\u2019s Remy is freely usin\u2019 the words pantaloons and boudoir in casual conversation, I\u2019m wonderin\u2019 just how deep his western whorehouse fantasy goes,\u201d Blake said.</p><p>\u201cFuck you all very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, compared to the weird shit they\u2019re thinkin\u2019 up, the reality ain\u2019t that awful, Q.\u201d</p><p>Bennett hid his smile behind his beer bottle. \u201cSo, you tellin\u2019 \u2019em, or am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Quinn blurted, \u201cLibby signed us up for some damn hippie pottery class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike in... Writin\u2019 love words an\u2019 shit?\u201d Chet asked with horror.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Quinn said, \u201cPot-ter-y.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPottery?\u201d Cord repeated. \u201cLike makin\u2019 flowerpots outta clay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>They all tried not to laugh, but once Cam\u2019s infectious whoops of laughter rang out, then it was pointless to stay somber.</p><p>Blake clapped him on the back. \u201cAt least you got out of it tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think Libby ain\u2019t gonna be makin\u2019 me pay for it. So, Cam, I hope you appreciate me bein\u2019 here, \u2019cause I ain\u2019t gettin\u2019 any pussy for the next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Least your wife didn\u2019t trick you into fuckin\u2019 her without a condom so you\u2019d knock her up again.\u201d</p><p>All eyes turned to Colby.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Channing cut me off for over a week, then bam, nailed me but good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you complainin\u2019 about gettin\u2019 nailed?\u201d Chet asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause she didn\u2019t have an easy pregnancy with Gib. Don\u2019t know why the hell she wants to take a chance again so soon.\u201d</p><p>Cam said, \u201cI figure she\u2019s tryin\u2019 to keep up with Gemma and Macie on the baby races. Them two, I swear. Tryin\u2019 to populate Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep \u2019em away from AJ.\u201d Cord gave a mock shudder. \u201cMuch as we wanna have another kid or two someday, that ain\u2019t to-day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tellin\u2019 us everything is perfect between the newlyweds?\u201d</p><p>Cord grinned. \u201cAbsolutely fuckin\u2019 perfect.\u201d</p><p>Kade wondered if they noticed he hadn\u2019t tossed in his two cents. Probably not, he\u2019d always been the quiet one of the boisterous McKay/West bunch. Preferring to listen rather than to talk, letting his twin muscle his way into the spotlight while he remained in the background.</p><p>As Chet, Remy and Blake yammered about the single life, Kade made wet rings on the table with the bottom of his beer bottle. Being stuck in limbo with Skylar was worse than dating. Might make him pussy-whipped, but he\u2019d gladly take a damn pottery class with the woman he loved, even if he hated the idea. If it was important to Sky, then it was important to him.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t Quinn see that? No wonder he and Libby were having problems.</p><p>Much as he hated family gossip, it\u2019d shocked him when Skylar relayed the conversation she\u2019d had with his cousin\u2019s unhappy wife during the barbecue. In fact, Sky seemed pretty damn shocked at how much private information his family disclosed to her in a few short hours. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What she didn\u2019t realize?

That caveman behavior would go over like a club to the head.</p><p>\u201cKade? Buddy? You still here?\u201d Cord asked.</p><p>He looked up guiltily. \u201cSorry, just thinkin\u2019 about something else. What\u2019d I miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen said Chase scored a ninety-one in the final go round in Lewiston on Sunday afternoon. Ended up in third place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. Which circuit is that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDodge. The PBR had an off week, but you know him. He\u2019s obsessed with bull ridin\u2019 so he found another event to feed his habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to see my little cuz is keepin\u2019 the McKay name alive in the world of rodeo,\u201d</p><p>Colby said.</p><p>\u201cRumor has it Keely\u2019s makin\u2019 quite a name for herself on every circuit too.\u201d</p><p>Dead quiet.</p><p>Cord slowly lowered his beer. \u201cYou\u2019d better be explainin\u2019 that statement, Bennett, right fuckin\u2019 now.\u201d</p> <p>Cam and Colby shot him menacing looks too.</p><p>\u201cWhoa whoa whoa, guys, I ain\u2019t trash talkin\u2019 your little sister. I\u2019m sayin\u2019 cousin Keely is gettin\u2019 a reputation as a miracle worker when it comes to non-surgical physical therapy alternatives with rodeo injuries. Chase said Justin Donahue told him that the Wrangler Sports Medicine team wants her to quit school and go to work for them full time for a helluva lot of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t Keely tell us about that this weekend when she was home?\u201d Colby demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe told me.\u201d When they all turned and gaped at Cam, he said, \u201cWhat? You guys don\u2019t listen to Keely most of the time any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I always have. She\u2019s been too damn smart for her own good since the day she was born.\u201d</p><p>Must be a girl McKay thing, Kade thought, because he knew even at four months, Eliza understood everything he said to her. He and Sky would have their hands full for the next two decades if Eliza was anything like Keely.</p><p>Chet, Remy, Ben and Blake drifted to the back room to shoot pool and were suckered into a tournament. Luckily the various women who\u2019d been circling their table like sharks in a feeding frenzy followed the single guys into the back room. Quinn ended up talking to an old friend up at the bar, then he took off, leaving Kade with Colby, Cord, and Cam.</p> <p>They discussed upcoming cattle sales, the start of haying, Carter\u2019s impending art show, the hunting season, military life and horses. Kade was surprised to see two hours had passed.</p><p>Cam wandered into the back room to watch the pool games.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it goin\u2019 with Eliza?\u201d</p><p>Kade smiled at Colby. \u201cShe\u2019s something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it goin\u2019 with Skylar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShitty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat don\u2019t sound too good.\u201d Cord set his forearms on the table. \u201cYou wanna tell us what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, no offense, guys, but I doubt either of you had to go through any of the junk Sky and I are dealin\u2019 with right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kinda junk do you mean?\u201d Colby asked. \u201cDealin\u2019 with havin\u2019 a baby type stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, figurin\u2019 out relationship stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would you say we don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about that?\u201d</p><p>Kade scowled at Cord. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell us that everything between you and AJ is perfect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant now. It sure wasn\u2019t always that way, especially not on my end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out. AJ\u2019s so sweet sugar wouldn\u2019t melt in her mouth.\u201d</p><p>Cord snorted. \u201cThat tongue of her can be laced with arsenic, and she ain\u2019t afraid to put me in my place. You weren\u2019t around, but I about did the dumbest thing ever and let AJ get away from me.\u201d</p><p>Colby nodded. \u201cChanning disappeared for damn near three months after I got busted up in Cheyenne. I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever see her again or if she\u2019d even want a crippled-up former rodeo star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know why you think we had it easy. Hell, none of us, includin\u2019 Carter had a smooth go of it with our wives. Fact is, I\u2019d say most men are dumbasses when it comes to this sort of relationship junk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s encouragin\u2019. Maybe I do need another beer,\u201d Kade muttered.</p><p>So, armed with a liquid courage, Kade gave his cousins a run-down on everything that\u2019d happened\u2014from dating Skylar the previous summer, to the recent confrontation at Sky Blue.</p><p>Both men were quiet until Kade couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight. You\u2019ve been crazy about Skylar for over a year, when you found out you knocked her up, you moved in with her to learn how to be a father to Eliza, the sex is off the charts good, and you\u2019ve asked her to marry you numerous times, and you\u2019re lookin\u2019 out for her safety?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuddy, I hate to tell you this, but there ain\u2019t a whole lot more you can do,\u201d Cord said.</p><p>\u201cGeez. Thanks a fuckin\u2019 lot for that stellar advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor once I agree with Cord,\u201d Colby added. \u201cIt seems you ain\u2019t the one with the problem. Skylar is. And if she can\u2019t see what\u2019s right in front of her face, K, then maybe you oughta give her some distance so she gets a different perspective.\u201d</p><p>Kade blinked. \u201cWhat do you mean? Walk away? Move out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. I\u2019d miss her and Eliza like crazy, and goddammit they both need me, even if that stubborn woman won\u2019t admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t ready to admit I needed AJ until she left me,\u201d Cord offered.</p><p>\u201cWith Channing and me, time away just reinforced the truth that we belonged together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys ain\u2019t kiddin\u2019, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many years was AJ right in front of my damn face and I didn\u2019t notice her?</p><p>And even after I\u2019d fallen for her I didn\u2019t want to admit it to her or anybody else, but mostly to myself how I felt about her. We can be our own worst enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll betcha Skylar would figure it out pretty damn quick how she feels about you if you weren\u2019t around. It don\u2019t hafta be permanent, just for a coupla days. Besides, ain\u2019t we startin\u2019 hayin\u2019 the south section tomorrow? You ain\u2019t gonna wanna drive sixty miles at ten o\u2019clock at night after you\u2019ve been on a tractor for sixteen hours, just to turn around eight hours later and do it all again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby\u2019s right.\u201d Cord pulled his ringing cell phone from his shirt pocket. \u201cHey, baby doll.\u201d He grinned. \u201cReally? Don\u2019t move. Ah-ah-ah, no buts. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Cord stood and threw a twenty on the table. \u201cGotta go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen your wife calls and says the kid\u2019s sound asleep and she\u2019s naked in bed, sorry guys, you lose every time. See ya tomorrow and good luck, K.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Colby squinted at the bar clock. \u201cI\u2019d probably best get on home. See what trick my darlin\u2019 wife has up her sleeve for tonight\u2019s sexcapades. Funny thing is, she thinks I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s up to, so I\u2019m not playin\u2019 hard to get.\u201d He clapped Kade on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>Kade pondered their advice as he finished his beer. Why did men and women have to play games?</p><p>Then again, being straightforward and honest hadn\u2019t done him a bit of good either.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>After saying his good-byes to his cousins, Kade walked down the street to his truck.</p><p>The promise of an early fall teased and the evening air was chilly. Clouds covering the moon made the night seem even darker than normal. He\u2019d hunkered into the collar of his coat and didn\u2019t see the man step out of the shadows until it was too late and Kade smacked right into him.</p><p>\u201cHey. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better be sorry, you son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo excuse for you because I know you were fuckin\u2019 my wife, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Was this man drunk?</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of loser fucks another man\u2019s wife?\u201d</p><p>Kade attempted to back up. \u201cWait a second, pal, you\u2019ve got the wrong man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I do.\u201d The big bear of a man pressed closer. \u201cI followed her, so I know she was meetin\u2019 with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Since when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo months ago I saw you and her laughin\u2019 and jokin\u2019 in that restaurant downtown.</p><p>Then you two snuck into that massage parlor and didn\u2019t come out for a coupla hours. We all know what kinda shit happens in them places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, now I know you\u2019re mistaken, buddy, because I\u2019ve been livin\u2019 out of town for the last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes it convenient when she sneaks away to meet you, which I know she\u2019s still doin\u2019 \u2019cause she ain\u2019t around at night. And when she is she\u2019s damn secretive, which pisses me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tellin\u2019 you, it wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>That information didn\u2019t calm the man down; it incensed him. \u201cI know what I saw.</p><p>And I saw you.\u201d</p><p>Shit. This was where family resemblances sucked. The man this had seen might\u2019ve been any one of Kade\u2019s cousins. The man could\u2019ve been Kane. That was the most likely explanation, even when Kane had a strict no married women policy. It was unlikely the guy would buy the laughable \u201cI have an identical twin\u201d argument, but that didn\u2019t matter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kade wouldn\u2019t roll on his brother or his cousins anyway.</p><p>Before Kade uttered another denial, the man hauled off and punched him in the eye like a champion boxer.

That\u2019ll teach you to keep your eyes off my wife.\u201d</p> <p>While Kade was trying to regain his equilibrium, the guy delivered a wicked uppercut that rocked his jaw so hard his teeth clacked together and he bit his tongue.</p><p>\u201cKeep your mouth offa her.\u201d</p><p>Kade curled his arms around his head, attempting to protect it, when the guy slugged him in the gut with enough force to knock the air from his lungs. Through the pain Kade realized he was getting his ass kicked and he couldn\u2019t stop it. He dropped to the pavement in defeat.</p><p>\u201cStand up and fight me, you fuckin\u2019 pussy.\u201d</p><p>A car door slammed, followed by bootsteps thumping down the sidewalk. \u201cHey!</p> <p>What the hell is goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalk away. This ain\u2019t your concern,\u201d the man said.</p><p>\u201cThe fuck it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Colt.</p><p>Why was Colt here? Kade tried to say his name but nothing came out.</p><p>\u201cLast chance to get gone or I\u2019ll give you some of what he just got.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBig talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than talk, sheep-fucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it on, cocksucker.\u201d</p><p>More bootsteps scuffled on the cement, preceded by loud shouts. Kade heard it all through a haze of pain.</p><p>\u201cColt? What\u2019re you doin\u2019 here? Oh, shit. Kade? Man, you all right?\u201d This from Blake.</p><p>Colt said, \u201cI was on my way inside the Golden Boot and I saw Kade get sucker-punched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this the fucker who did this to him?\u201d Cam demanded.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>The man said, \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that. You started it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna finish it. Still feelin\u2019 tough?\u201d Ben taunted.</p><p>\u201cNot when the odds are six against one.\u201d</p><p>Kade pushed himself to a sitting position and said, \u201cLet him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Remy said. \u201cWe all wanna take a shot at him so he knows he messed with the wrong fuckin\u2019 family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all McKays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, some of us go by the name West. Heard of us?\u201d</p><p>The man said, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re all a buncha fuckin\u2019 psycho cowboys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know we ain\u2019t gonna let this slide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough. Let him go. He thought I was someone else.\u201d Kade tried to look up at the guy. Shit. He couldn\u2019t see. \u201cHis choice. He walks away and stays away from all of us or we go to the sheriff\u2019s office and I file charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis some sort of all for one and one for all bullshit?\u201d the man sneered.</p><p>\u201cYou bet your ass.\u201d</p><p>Cam shook the big man like a rag doll. \u201cWhat\u2019s it gonna be, hoss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019.\u201d After Cam released him, the guy slithered into the darkness.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Kade.

It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your mouth bleedin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. He didn\u2019t knock any teeth out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s reassurin\u2019.

I\u2019ll get him home,\u201d Colt said. \u201cI owe him.\u201d</p><p>Murmurs of agreement followed and Kade knew they\u2019d all left. Although, after two fights in one day, he couldn\u2019t muster the energy to wave good-bye.</p><p>Lighter footsteps approached, accompanied by click click of metal chains.</p><p>\u201cWhatcha think, Indy?\u201d Colt asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s bleeding like a crack whore and looks like dog shit. What is it with you cowboys and fighting all the damn time?\u201d</p><p>Kade cracked open his good eye. Great. Skylar\u2019s sister. \u201cWhat the devil are you doin\u2019 here?\u201d He saw India shoot Colt a look and managed to turn his head to see Colt\u2019s response.</p><p>Colt mouthed something to her and she shook her head.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a trick question,\u201d Kade said.</p><p>India sighed. \u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019m Colt\u2019s A.A. sponsor. Tonight was the first time he planned on going into a bar since he sobered up last year. I hung out in his truck so we could talk about it afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were his sponsor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows. Colt wants it kept confidential information, which is his choice, so you can\u2019t tell anyone, not even Skylar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019ll be easy since she\u2019s pissed as hell at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you ain\u2019t goin\u2019 to her place tonight?\u201d</p><p>Kade gestured to his bloody and mud-covered clothes. \u201cNo choice. All my stuff is there. You guys go on. I\u2019ll be fine to drive myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t see out of your right eye, how are you supposed to drive thirty miles? In the dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need my truck tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Colt can drive your truck. I\u2019ll drive my car. He needs to follow someone who knows the way in case you fall asleep and I\u2019ll bring him back to town.\u201d</p><p>Colt said, \u201cToss me your keys.\u201d</p><p>Kade dug them out of his pocket and pushed off the building to follow Colt to his truck.</p><p>India\u2019s hand on his chest stopped him. \u201cHuh-uh. You\u2019re riding with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>India didn\u2019t speak until they were halfway home. \u201cYou know Sky is going to freak out when she sees you all bloody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured she might since it\u2019s the second time she\u2019s seen me like this today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is one of the reasons she refused to date cowboys when she first moved here because they\u2019re always getting in fights.\u201d</p><p>His laugh was more grunt-like than humorous.</p><p>She shot him a look. \u201cSo it shocked the hell out of me when you and I crossed paths\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrossed paths? You cornered me in Sky\u2019s house like I was a stray dog in the chicken house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the shitkicker fits...\u201d</p><p>Kade snorted. \u201cSky still doesn\u2019t know about your threatening little chat with me that day, does she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You think she\u2019s gonna get pissed off that I was doing my sisterly duty? Wrong.</p><p>But it was damn shocking to learn that Eliza\u2019s father is not only a cowboy, but one of the notorious McKay cowboys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s me, one of the damned.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019d crash someplace else tonight if I could, but everything I own is at her place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell knows? She\u2019s mad. Thinks I overstepped my bounds today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>Kade explained as neutrally as possible.</p><p>A full minute passed before India responded. \u201cLemme ask you this: do you know the real reason why she\u2019s so upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I bucked up and pointed out the security issues with her business and she thinks it\u2019s none of my business to be worryin\u2019 about hers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose. But no cigar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s break it down and see if you can\u2019t put it back together correctly.\u201d She offered Kade an impish smile. \u201cAs an A.A. and N.A. counselor, I\u2019m big on folks finding their own solutions. The answer means more if they figure it out themselves.</p><p>\u201cNow, I\u2019m sure my sister has told you about Ted, and how he used her and robbed her blind. Once he\u2019d gotten what he\u2019d wanted from her\u2014most of Sky\u2019s money\u2014then he divorced her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut see, that\u2019s where what happened today don\u2019t fit. I don\u2019t want anything from her.\u201d Immediately after he voiced the denial, he made the connection. His queasy feeling multiplied. \u201cGoddammit, I threatened to take Eliza from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDing ding ding! Give the man a prize for guessing the correct answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist. How could I be such a fuckin\u2019 idiot? I\u2019d never take Eliza from her. Never. I just wanted Sky to see how seriously she oughta take the safety issues at the plant. I\u2019ve been tryin\u2019 my damndest to make the three of us be a real family, not tear us apart. To show her I ain\u2019t goin\u2019 anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can talk until you\u2019re blue in the face and she won\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s the type who needs what she calls \u2018tangible proof\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked her to marry me so I could put a damn ring on her finger. What kinda concrete proof could be better than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is one thing that you could do...never mind.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cYou thought I was joking around with the no pain, no gain comment? I wasn\u2019t. Come talk to me when you\u2019ve figured it out.\u201d</p><p>Great. More games. More puzzles. More reasons for him to take his cousin\u2019s advice and lay low for a while.</p><p>India didn\u2019t speak further until she pulled into the driveway and parked. \u201cI knew you were a different kind of man when you barged into her life and offered her everything she never thought she\u2019d have. After I figured out the McKay family connection, I asked Colt about you. He told me you\u2019re the most honest, kind, and forthright man he\u2019s ever known.</p><p>He says you cared enough to save him when no one else did.\u201d</p><p>Embarrassed, Kade looked away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSkylar doesn\u2019t need saving in the same way, but she needs you.

It\u2019s true. Been true my whole life.

She paused in the doorway until she recognized India\u2019s car. What was her sister doing here at eleven o\u2019clock at night? Then Kade\u2019s truck pulled up, but Kade didn\u2019t jump from the cab. Colt McKay did.</p> <p>What the heck?</p><p>The sight of Colt helping Kade out of the passenger\u2019s side of India\u2019s car finally spurred Sky into action.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Omigod, Kade, you\u2019re bleeding!\u201d Her heart rate kicked up, her stomach lurched as she looked at his battered face. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we get him inside first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d She held open the door.</p><p>Kade shrugged off Colt\u2019s help. \u201cI can walk.\u201d</p> <p>He passed by without looking at her and headed to the kitchen.</p><p>She followed him, even when it was apparent he didn\u2019t want her to.</p><p>Colt said, \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a first aid kit, please get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She turned but India snagged her arm. India\u2019s eyes searched Sky\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t be stupid. This man is hurting and not just because he was in a fight. He needs you tonight. Forget whatever else happened today, be there for him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndy?\u201d Colt called.</p><p>\u201cComing.\u201d</p><p>By the time Sky brought the kit, a bag of ice rested on the upper right half of Kade\u2019s face. She scrutinized his swollen mouth, the bumps and bruises on his jaw, the deep gash above his eyebrow. Her gaze tracked the splotches of dried blood on his cheek and the long line of brownish-red trailing down his neck.</p> <p>Don\u2019t cry, be strong. She inhaled slowly and was amazed her voice didn\u2019t shake.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d Sky\u2019s stomach made a seesawing sensation as she inspected the deep cut. \u201cI take it you opted for no doctor and no stitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t seem that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it sure isn\u2019t good.\u201d She brushed a bloody clump of hair from his forehead, over and over, at a loss for what else she could do to fix this for him. \u201cI probably need to clean it before I can put on a bandage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Colt dropped Kade\u2019s keys on the table. \u201cSince you\u2019re in capable hands, we\u2019re gonna head back to town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Both of you. I appreciate your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d India turned to Sky. \u201cIs Eliza sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s upstairs in our room, if you want to take a peek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t wake her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait outside,\u201d Colt said.</p><p>Sky ripped open an antiseptic wipe and lowered the ice pack. She winced. His eye was completely swollen shut and his eyebrow had a deep gash, which was still oozing.</p><p>She dabbed around the area. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA guy jumped me outside of the Golden Boot. He thought I was someone else. And before you ask, no, I wasn\u2019t drunk and pickin\u2019 fights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to ask that.\u201d But Sky wasn\u2019t surprised Kade was defensive. She\u2019d taken him to task on his violent behavior earlier in the day and she knew he wouldn\u2019t appreciate her apology now. \u201cWhat\u2019s the other guy look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a scratch. He caught me off guard. I\u2019d be in much worse shape if Colt hadn\u2019t come along when he did. My cousins showed up at the end.\u201d He hissed. \u201cShit that stings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Sky wiped the area three times before she was satisfied it was clean. She attached the bandage. \u201cIt should stop bleeding now. You want something for the pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m good, thanks.\u201d</p><p>She used a warm washcloth to gently clean his face and neck. Rather than relax into her touch, he tensed up. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to hurt you, Kade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much a given that you will, even when you don\u2019t think you are.\u201d</p><p>Her hand froze. Was he referencing something besides his injury? \u201cKade, please listen to me. Can we talk about this? I\u2019m so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. That\u2019s probably good enough anyway.\u201d</p><p>Stung into silence, Sky dumped water out of the Ziploc, adding more ice, and rewrapped the cold pack in a clean kitchen towel. \u201cHere. This should help with the swelling.\u201d</p><p>Kade stood. \u201cThanks for patchin\u2019 me up. I\u2019m tired and I\u2019ve gotta be up early so I\u2019m headin\u2019 to bed.\u201d</p><p>While Sky paced alone downstairs, pretending to clean the kitchen, wondering why she was such an idiot about this relationship stuff, she heard Eliza fussing on the baby monitor. After she picked her up, she realized Kade wasn\u2019t in their bed. She wandered into the hallway. The door to the bathroom was open, but the door to the spare bedroom was closed.</p><p>So, he\u2019d opted not to sleep with her tonight.</p><p>Can you blame him?</p><p>A loud thump sounded from inside the room. What if he\u2019d hurt himself because he had too much pride to ask her for help?</p><p>You would know about being too proud.</p><p>The stupid voices in her head always offered advice way too late.</p><p>She took a chance and knocked. \u201cKade? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Hang on a second.\u201d</p><p>Eliza squawked.</p><p>Kade opened the door. His gaze landed on Eliza and he smiled softly. \u201cHey, baby girl. What\u2019s the ruckus?\u201d</p><p>At the sound of his voice, Eliza turned her head.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably hungry. She didn\u2019t finish her last bottle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry I didn\u2019t hear her. She okay? Not sick or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as far as I can tell, besides her crying jags the last couple days. I think you were right. I think she\u2019s teething.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d offer to take the midnight shift, but I thought she\u2019d shriek if she caught sight of my ugly, beat-up mug in the middle of the night. And to be honest, I\u2019m in more than a little pain right now.\u201d</p><p>Sky didn\u2019t respond; she was too busy staring at the duffel bags next to the bed. He stiffened when he realized she\u2019d seen them. Somehow, she swallowed the lump in her throat and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna be busy at the ranch for a few days.\u201d He shuffled his feet and looked anywhere but at her. \u201cAfter what happened earlier today, and now with this, I decided we could both use a break.\u201d</p><p>You decided? What about me? Don\u2019t I get a say? Don\u2019t we? Her hold on Eliza increased.</p><p>\u201cYou can reach me any time on my cell. I probably won\u2019t check my messages until late, but if it\u2019s an emergency, you can call my mom and she\u2019ll track me down.\u201d Kade stroked Eliza\u2019s cheek. \u201cGonna miss you bad, sweet thang. Be good for your mama, okay?</p><p>I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to try and take her with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His pain-filled eyes searched hers. \u201cI\u2019d never take her from you, Skylar.\u201d</p><p>Oh no. What was going on with them? When had they returned to polite strangers?</p><p>\u201cI thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you thought and you were wrong. Some things that were said in the heat of the moment shouldn\u2019t have been said at all.\u201d</p><p>Immediately she wondered, things like , marry me?</p><p>Eliza protested her hungry state and Skylar took a step back. \u201cI, ah, need to feed her.\u201d She started down the hallway. The door closed softly, but it echoed in her head as loudly as if he\u2019d slammed it.</p><p>After Skylar got up with Eliza again for her two o\u2019clock feeding, she couldn\u2019t go back to sleep. She paced in the hallway outside Kade\u2019s room, wondering if it was the best thing for him to be sleeping alone. What if he had a head injury? Weren\u2019t you supposed to check on concussed patients every few hours? Rather than risk waking him by knocking, she quietly opened the door and tiptoed into his room just to double check on him.</p><p>Kade was splayed in the middle of the bed. His right hand held the bag of ice on his right eye.</p><p>Sweat beaded on his skin. She leaned over to place her hand on his forehead. Damn.</p><p>His skin was hot to the touch. The poor man was burning up, no wonder he was completely naked. Sky went to the bathroom and returned with two wet washcloths.</p><p>She perched on the edge of the bed, which woke Kade up. \u201cSkylar? What\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to wake you. I came in to check on you and your whole body is feverish. How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I got the crap kicked out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did. I thought you might like it if I cooled you down a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I want to. Please. Let me do this for you, okay?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Well, he hadn\u2019t barked no. That was a good sign. \u201cDo you feel nauseous?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and groaned. \u201cExcept when I do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t do that,\u201d she half-chided. \u201cHold still. I\u2019m going to move this ice bag aside for a bit.\u201d She sucked in a harsh breath and it froze in her lungs. Oh man. He was on track to a serious shiner.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Just relax. This cloth might be cold at first.\u201d</p><p>Skylar began with his forehead. Avoiding his swollen eye, she sponged the sharp planes of his face, cheekbones, temples, his generous mouth, lingering on his strong jawline. She wiped the long line of his neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sighed deeply.</p><p>She continued across his collarbones and shoulders. Down his pectorals. He hissed, not with pain when the nubby washcloth drifted over his nipples and the disks hardened into little points. Skylar realized since she\u2019d handed Kade control of their interludes, he\u2019d never allowed her to spend much time exploring his beautiful, strong body. She hadn\u2019t lingered on learning how he liked to be touched above the waist. She hadn\u2019t traced the delineated muscles of his abs and stomach with her tongue. Which was a damn crying shame, and a situation she\u2019d rectify pronto.</p><p>Skylar admired his meaty biceps and thick forearms as she ran the washcloth along his brawny arms. The back of his hands were scarred and scabbed; the palm side of his hands were callused and rough. The hands of a working rancher. She knew these strong hands could rein in a thousand-pound horse, or fix barbed wire fence or even knock a man out cold. But she also knew how unbelievably gentle these powerful hands could be on her body. On her face. On their child.</p> <p>She switched washcloths and finished his torso, his rib cage, the flat belly and his narrow pelvis, spending time on that sexy, sensitive strip of skin stretching from hipbone to hipbone. Skylar circumvented his groin even when his full erection indicated he enjoyed her ministrations.</p><p>Kade\u2019s legs were dusted with dark hair and were all sinewy muscle. She swept the cloth down his thighs, repeated the process for his ropy calves, but she avoided his feet.</p><p>When she finished, she half-expected he\u2019d be watching her intently, but his eyes were closed. His breathing wasn\u2019t slow and easy, but choppy, restless. She knew he wasn\u2019t asleep.</p><p>Sky angled over his mouth and very very softly kissed his swollen lips. Then she followed the exact same path with her hands and mouth over his body that she had with the washcloth. Just as slowly. Just as thoroughly.</p><p>By the time she finished, his cock was weeping for her attention. Using the slick fluid leaking from the tip, she wrapped her fist around hot, rigid shaft and began to stroke.</p> <p>\u201cSkylar. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me do this for you. Please. I can\u2019t stand that you\u2019re hurting. Let me make you feel good. Let me give you back some of what you always give to me.\u201d She flicked her tongue down the corded muscles in his throat. When she reached his upper chest, she began her sensual assault.</p><p>Kade arched into her and his left hand twined in her hair.</p><p>She drove him crazy, went a little crazy herself, licking and playing with his nipples.</p><p>Digging her nails and her teeth into his warm, pliant flesh. She suckled and bit every inch of skin on his pecs as she jacked him off. Building from a slow steady pace to a fast one that elicited his near growl of impatience. His hips bumped up, his balls were walnut tight at the root of his sex. And when that thick cock jerked in her moving hand, she bit down on his left pectoral, sucking with enough force to leave a hickey. A big hickey. Sticky warmth poured over her fingers and Kade groaned long and low, slightly pulling her hair, as the pulses intensified and then, tapered off. Then stopped.</p><p>Still squeezing every drop of come out of his cock, she sought his mouth, trying to convey without words what was in her heart. Still kissing him, she used the washcloth to clean them both up.</p> <p>Sky untangled from his embrace and replaced the ice on his eye. His breathing slowed, but he didn\u2019t reach for her. She tiptoed out. He needed his rest, and whatever they needed to say to each other could wait until morning.</p><p>But the next morning, when Sky woke up, Kade was already gone.</p><p>For Kade not being able to see out of his right eye everything in his life was finally crystal clear.</p><p>When Skylar had come to him so sweetly the previous night, it\u2019d been all Kade could do not to demand her submission, mount her like a crazed beast and fuck her senseless. But he knew her taking the initiative in offering him loving comfort cemented the bond between them.</p><p>Especially after he\u2019d seen love bites she\u2019d left all over his chest. Suck marks. Teeth marks. Indentations from her fingernails. By showing him her ferocious, possessive side, she\u2019d been marking him as hers.</p><p>Time to return the favor on a more permanent level. He called his cousin Colt, knowing he was up with the damn chickens these days, and Colt happily gave him the phone number he needed.</p><p>Kade dialed. No hello, no niceties, he just said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a brilliant idea how I can prove it to her.\u201d He held the phone away from his ear. \u201cYeah, I know what time it is. I don\u2019t give a shit if you\u2019re not a mornin\u2019 person, you said to come talk to you when I figured it out. Hey, you\u2019re the one who said, no pain, no gain, so can\u2019t blame anyone but yourself for stickin\u2019 your nose in this. I\u2019m takin\u2019 you up on your offer. Yep.\u201d Pause.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell should I know? You\u2019re the expert. You\u2019ve got roughly ten hours. I\u2019ll be there after work.\u201d</p> <p>He called Colt back. \u201cHey, cuz. Remember how you\u2019re always sayin\u2019 if I need anything, just holler? Well, here\u2019s your chance. I\u2019m gonna be hollerin\u2019 real loud tonight and you\u2019ve been elected to hold my hand.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>Day One of Kade\u2019s absence from her life was bad.</p><p>Day Two of Kade\u2019s absence from her life was worse.</p><p>But Day Three? Day Three was absolutely intolerable.</p><p>Eliza was beyond cranky. Skylar suspected the baby missed her daddy and decided to make mommy pay for it by disrupting the entire daycare. Disrupting it to the point Skylar had to sequester Eliza in her office all day, which meant she hadn\u2019t gotten a damn thing done. For three days.</p><p>Not only that, Nadia had called in sick for the last two days, which threw Sky Blue\u2019s schedule off. The other employees were grouchy because they had to pick up the slack and work on a Saturday. Even India had snapped at her, babbling nonsense about nice guys finishing first, recognizing a good thing, and ending with India threatening to put a boot in her ass if she was too stupid to know she had to fight this time. And all she\u2019d called for was to check on the stock.</p><p>Skylar couldn\u2019t concentrate and screwed up the quarterly sales figures four times before she closed the file. Needing a mindless task, she spread out a blanket on the floor, plopped Eliza down with her favorite toys, and waded through the boxes of junk while keeping an eye on her fussy daughter.</p><p>Annie barged in. \u201cGlad to see you\u2019re finally takin\u2019 care of that stuff. It\u2019s a fire hazard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo things, actually. Where\u2019s the purchase order for the bottles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich bottles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hand lotion bottles. The plant in Cheyenne says they never received the order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull. I sent it three weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they never got it. And the original order form is not in the file.\u201d Annie braced her shoulders against the doorframe. \u201cIs it possible with all that\u2019s been going on, you only think you sent it?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are my options?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend another purchase order and pay the rush charge.\u201d</p><p>Skylar shuddered. That\u2019d put a big dent in the already small profit margin. \u201cOr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr wait until you get through those boxes to see if you accidentally tossed it in there during your rant about the ridiculously high prices of plastics and were looking at switching bottle manufacturing companies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny. Pay the damn rush charges. What was the other thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNadia wants to talk to you after lunch break.\u201d</p><p>Skylar looked at Annie. \u201cThank God she actually showed up today. Do you know what she wants to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething you\u2019re going to share with me, Annie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But as long as you\u2019re already in a pissy mood, I might as well tell you I heard what Kade said the other day and he was right about external safety issues around here.\u201d</p><p>When Sky started to protest, Annie stopped her. \u201cDon\u2019t bite my head off. We\u2019ve talked about this. I oughta say, I brought it up and you ignored me. As the owner you make sure all the internal safety equipment surpasses OSHA standards. All the MSDS are up to date. But, that\u2019s not all there is to creating a safe work environment. Most of your female employees have been in bad situations with men, including myself, which you knew when you hired us. So, I don\u2019t understand why we have a security gate we don\u2019t use and no alarm system whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm? Hello? Because we\u2019re out in the middle of nowhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweets, you\u2019re a great boss, but you have the attitude bad things don\u2019t happen in Wyoming. Bad things do happen here, less frequently than in LA, but we\u2019re still somewhat untamed in the Wild West. In some respects, cowboys are like them gangbangers, never backin\u2019 down from a fight, always lookin\u2019 for a way to avenge themselves when they think someone done them wrong. Especially if they were wronged by the woman in their life. Like Nadia\u2019s husband. Are you denying that is a potentially volatile situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t deny that if you had this exact same business in LA, you wouldn\u2019t dream of leavin\u2019 the door unlocked or the gate open. Those security type things woulda been the first things in place.\u201d</p><p>The truth punched her in the gut like freight train. Holy crap. Annie was exactly right. Kade had been right. How could she have been so oblivious? Because she was seriously overworked?</p><p>And whose fault is that?</p><p>Annie kept going. \u201cI figured you\u2019d take care of the oversight after you gave birth and Eliza was on the premises, things\u2019d change and you\u2019d see the external safety problems.</p><p>But you haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Half in a daze, Sky asked, \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you just handle it? Order the security components, hire the installers? You are the office manager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know that\u2019s a courtesy title. You\u2019re the owner, you\u2019re in control, and you make no bones about that. I can\u2019t even order the damn lotion bottles without your approval.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hadn\u2019t she sworn she\u2019d delegate rather than do everything herself?

Would she never learn she wasn\u2019t superwoman?</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and snap off a smart question like \u2018If you feel so unsafe and unappreciated here, why are you still working for me?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Skylar absolutely recoiled.</p> <p>Annie shook her finger. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why aren\u2019t you defensive? Full of pride.</p><p>Glaring at me, unwilling to admit when you\u2019re wrong?\u201d</p><p>Hadn\u2019t Kade accused her of the same thing? She swallowed, but her voice still was barely audible. \u201cBecause I was wrong, Annie. Fix it, however you see fit, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Annie sidestepped a pile of papers and slammed the door.</p><p>Startled by the sound, Eliza started screaming.</p> <p>Sky wished she could scream right along with her.</p><p>She was still sitting on the floor an hour later when Nadia knocked. \u201cIs this a bad time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Come on in and pull up a piece of carpet.\u201d</p><p>It surprised Sky when Nadia plopped down. But she focused on Eliza. \u201cShe\u2019s a beautiful baby. She has your cheekbones.\u201d</p><p>Skylar tried to remember in the last month if anyone had mentioned Eliza resembled her in any way. She heard Kade\u2019s rumbling voice, s he has your cute little upturned nose.</p><p>I\u2019m hopin\u2019 she gets your freckles too. And your laugh. I love your laugh.</p> <p>\u201cShe has your disposition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarvelous. I\u2019m the picture of well-adjusted, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Nadia sent her a panicked look. \u201cNo. I meant, she\u2019s very vocal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, that\u2019s a good thing, to not be afraid.\u201d Nadia wrapped her arms around her up-drawn knees. \u201cLook. I want to apologize for putting you in a bad position all these months by asking you to lie to my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s understandable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not and I\u2019m sorry I missed work the last two days. But after Rex showed up here...and Eliza\u2019s father...\u201d Sky\u2019s gaze snapped up. \u201cHe did the right thing, when it wasn\u2019t the easiest thing. When most people don\u2019t get involved. I hid behind the blinds and watched a man I didn\u2019t know from Adam, stand up to Rex, because he was trying to protect you and everyone in this place, including me\u2014who he didn\u2019t know from Adam\u2014</p><p>I realized it was past time I stand up for myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHiding out, hoping Rex will go away won\u2019t change any of the problems and isn\u2019t the example I wanna set for my boy. The reason I was gone the past two days is because I talked to a lawyer. Then I went to the sheriff and told him what happened out here and about some other stuff Rex threatened to do. I filed a restraining order against him. A piece of paper isn\u2019t armor, but it shows Rex I\u2019m done being afraid of him. And we\u2019re done. For good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how happy I am to hear that.\u201d She grabbed Nadia\u2019s hand. \u201cAre you really okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I feel more in control of my life than I have been in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad, Nadia, I really am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me? I appreciate the sentiment, but you were the one who took that first step.</p><p>It\u2019s easier not to change.\u201d How well she knew that. She let her head fall back against the wall. \u201cI\u2019ve done some things wrong, things I plan to change as soon as possible. I thought you were coming in here to quit, and I was all ready to whip out my spiel about how I intended to beef up external security and do some things differently around here to get you to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit? I\u2019m not going anywhere. This is the best job I\u2019ve ever had. We all think that.\u201d</p><p>Nadia rolled to her feet. \u201cYou give us more than just a good paycheck and a great place to work, Skylar. You show us how to be strong. You give us confidence in ourselves. No matter what mistakes we made in the past, what\u2019s been done to us, you\u2019ve shown us we don\u2019t have to live there, we can overcome it, change, and work toward a better future. We deserve to live our dreams the same as anyone else.\u201d</p><p>She slipped out the door leaving Sky staring after her, feeling a little more at peace with her business, and her relationship with her employees, but not having a clue how she could make things right with Kade.</p><p>With everything that\u2019d happened, the mindless sorting of paperwork was a welcome reprieve. Except the phrase, we deserve to live our dreams, hung in the air and stuck in Skylar\u2019s brain on a continuous loop. A life with Kade and Eliza was her dream.</p><p>When she reached the bottom of the fifth box, the corner of an envelope\u2014stuck in yet another safety supply magazine\u2014poked out. Before her fingers connected with the smooth white paper, she knew. This was the letter Kade had sent.</p><p>Sky flipped it over. No return address. Post marked Gillette, WY...two months ago.</p><p>Using a pen, she slit open the top and dumped the letter on the floor. She unfolded the single piece of lined notebook paper. The blocky printing filled up half the page: Skylar\u2014</p><p>I\u2019m probably the last person you expected to hear from. I hope you won\u2019t crumple this up and will give me a chance to explain.</p><p>After the bad way it ended with you last year, I needed time to re-evaluate some things. I moved to a remote section of the ranch, which is why I haven\u2019t approached you before now.</p><p>In the year I\u2019ve been alone on the range, I\u2019ve had time to think about what happened between us. What I did wrong. I can honestly say I\u2019m ashamed of myself. My intention wasn\u2019t to deceive you, but to get to know you.</p><p>When I get back into town in the next month, I\u2019d like to call you, maybe meet for coffee (or chocolate cake?) and see if time has healed the rift I caused. I believe there\u2019s still something worth exploring between us, something worth working out, something worth fighting for. I\u2019d like to start fresh.</p><p>I hope you don\u2019t find this out of line, and I\u2019m saying this from my heart. Being with you changed me. Time and distance haven\u2019t changed my feelings for you. But I hope the same time and distance have changed yours for me and you\u2019ll give me\u2014us\u2014a second chance.</p><p>All My Best,</p><p>Kade McKay</p><p>Kade wanted her. It was right there in black and white. He\u2019d wanted to be with her before he found out about Eliza. No ulterior motive. The sweet, honest man had thrown his heart out, not knowing if she\u2019d slice it to ribbons in her paper shredder.</p><p>Fat chance of that. Now that she had his heart she was keeping it safe forever. So, despite their rocky start, they\u2019d finished what they\u2019d begun not a month ago, but a year ago,they\u2019d fallen in love, the forever, permanent kind of love she never thought she\u2019d find or deserve.</p><p>Sky didn\u2019t realize she was crying until the tears splashed on the page.</p><p>She had the overwhelming urge to shout it from the rooftops: He likes me! He really really likes me! Likes? He loves you.</p><p>You love him; he loves you. It\u2019s the most simple thing in the world.</p><p>Was it?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Eliza squealed and Sky glanced at her.</p><p>Her daughter batted those big blue eyes, flashed a gummy grin...and rolled over.</p><p>\u201cEliza Belle McKay! How long have you been able to do that?\u201d</p><p>The baby made a gurgling sound suspiciously close to a laugh.</p><p>Still sobbing through her laughter, she said, \u201cWait until your daddy sees your new trick. He\u2019s gonna be over the moon.\u201d</p><p>And Sky couldn\u2019t wait another second to tell him everything. She picked up her babbling baby and ran out the door. \u201cAnnie!\u201d</p><p>Her coworker raced out to see Sky sprinting away from her office. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m leaving to fix another thing in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you coming back today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not. So you\u2019re in charge. Get used to it.\u201d Halfway down the hall, Sky stopped and turned to look at her friend. \u201cIs it really that simple?\u201d</p><p>Immediately Annie smiled. \u201cYes, honey, it really is.\u201d</p><p>Skylar found Kimi and Calvin\u2019s place easily enough, and felt another punch of guilt that she\u2019d never been here before. That was something else she\u2019d prioritize, making time for family, their family of three, and the McKay/West bunch that was such an important part of Kade\u2019s life. Maybe sometimes she and Kade and Eliza could stay overnight here, so Kade didn\u2019t have to drive so blasted far. Heck, she\u2019d move here and make the commute to Sky Blue if it came right down to it.</p><p>She started up the short sidewalk the same time a dark-haired man exited the house.</p><p>They nearly collided and both took a step back. Neither said anything as they eyed each other.</p><p>\u201cHey, Skylar. How are you?\u201d</p><p>This didn\u2019t have to be awkward. \u201cGood. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired.\u201d He bent down and peered at Eliza.</p><p>But Eliza\u2019s little feet didn\u2019t kick with happiness. She didn\u2019t coo and smile. She stayed still and watchful.</p><p>\u201cShe knows I\u2019m not him, don\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sky kissed the top of Eliza\u2019s head. \u201cShe\u2019s Daddy\u2019s girl. Daddy has her wrapped around his little finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother is a lucky man. She\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Kane smiled. \u201cYou look just like your mama, doncha, sugar?\u201d</p><p>No surprise Kane was still a total charmer. \u201cEveryone says she looks like Kade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they\u2019re not lookin\u2019 very hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Kade...where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s finishin\u2019 up the south hay field. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>Kane straightened. \u201cNow? Can\u2019t it wait until later tonight when he\u2019s done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Skylar half-expected Kane to get in her face. Demand to hear why she was interrupting his brother\u2019s workday. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he didn\u2019t. He positively grinned and chucked his niece under the chin. \u201cI figured that might be the case. When you track him down, tell him I\u2019ll finish up tomorrow. Ma sent me out to ask if you needed help carryin\u2019 anything in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great. There\u2019s a portable crib in the back seat.\u201d</p><p>After Skylar deposited Eliza with grandma and grandpa, she leaned against her car door and studied the map Kimi had drawn.</p><p>Kane sauntered over. \u201cGot an idea where you\u2019re goin\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot a clue.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cThrow away that map. Ma goes a little overboard. It\u2019s easy to find. Go five miles east on the gravel road. Turn right at the first four-way. Two miles later on your right, you\u2019ll come to a barbed wire gate. Go through it and follow the tire tracks along the fence line until you see dust and tractors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch easier.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Kane gestured to Sky\u2019s Subaru wagon. \u201cYou takin\u2019 this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Cause with the rain there\u2019s a couple places you might get stuck.\u201d He pointed to a dented and muddy red Dodge. \u201cTake my truck. Keys are in the ignition. Leave it here when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...what will you drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt can come and get me, no biggie.\u201d Skylar\u2019s distrust must\u2019ve been obvious because Kane said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re wonderin\u2019 why I\u2019m doin\u2019 this. You\u2019re here to make things right with my brother, or else you\u2019d be willin\u2019 to wait until he\u2019s done workin\u2019, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Kane sighed. \u201cLook. I never apologized for how I treated you on our date last summer, me bein\u2019 such a dick and all. When you started seein\u2019 Kade I\u2019ll bet you thought I had a miraculous personality change, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn hindsight, it should\u2019ve been a big tip off you were two entirely different men.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I ain\u2019t surprised Kade jumped at the chance to redeem us both. The poor guy\u2019s had no choice but to put up with the fallout from bein\u2019 my twin. With women who scream at him in public because I didn\u2019t call them back. Hearin\u2019 come-ons and put-downs just because we look alike. Guys pickin\u2019 fights with him because they think he\u2019s me and I\u2019ve done plenty to piss lots of folks off around here. It ain\u2019t never been fair and I never cared until last year.\u201d</p><p>Skylar waited for him to find the words to finish.</p><p>\u201cDag dyin\u2019 sucked. But you know what was worse for me? Watchin\u2019 my brother, who\u2019d always been the backbone of our family,\u201d Kane\u2019s voice dropped an octave, \u201cseein\u2019 Kade losin\u2019 hope. He cut himself off from everybody. I\u2019d never seen him hurtin\u2019 so bad and I\u2019ve never been so ashamed of myself for havin\u2019 a part in it. Yeah, I know he should\u2019ve come clean with you. He made a mistake. Probably threw him for a loop because he hardly ever screws up. He always does the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man. A great man. He\u2019s the very best man in the whole world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad someone finally recognizes that. Make him happy, Skylar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>Kade didn\u2019t pay attention when his brother\u2019s pickup parked next to his along the fence. He looped another pass in the field, trying to stay awake. On his third round, he saw Skylar standing beside Kane\u2019s truck. He snapped upright, half-afraid he\u2019d fallen asleep and was dreaming of her.</p> <p>Then the apparition waved.</p><p>Holy shit. That was Skylar.</p><p>In the south hayfield.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Sweet Jesus. Something bad must\u2019ve happened.</p><p>His heart slammed into his throat as his brain raced through all the awful scenarios.</p><p>Kade managed to park the tractor next to the nearest the fence. After shutting it off, he hopped to the ground and sprinted across the stubbly field.</p><p>Skylar met him halfway.</p><p>He clamped his gloved hands over her shoulders. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Eliza all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. She\u2019s with your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the rest of my family is okay too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what...\u201d He took a deep breath. Everything was fine. Thank God.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, why are you here?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip and glanced away. A nervous gesture? From the always confident Skylar?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEliza rolled over today.\u201d</p><p>He blinked with confusion and then he grinned. \u201cShe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and little miss was mighty pleased with herself. You weren\u2019t there to see it.</p><p>All I could think about was how you deserved to be there for every milestone in her life\u2014big or small. And how badly I wanted you there for every damn one, not just for her, but for me, too.\u201d</p><p>Sweet Lord, she looked like she was going to cry. \u201cHey, it\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is now that I\u2019m here with you.\u201d Sky wrapped her arms around his waist, pressing against him as if she was trying to crawl inside his skin. \u201cSo I showed up because I missed you, Kade. I missed you so much. And I couldn\u2019t wait another day to tell you that I love you. I love you like crazy. With all my heart, all my soul, with everything I am.</p><p>Please. I\u2019ll do anything to make this right. Please come home.\u201d</p><p>Kade closed his eyes and squeezed her tightly to make sure it wasn\u2019t another dream.</p><p>\u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you. And I\u2019m sorry, you were right about a lot of things. Not just the security stuff, which I have taken care of, much to my employee\u2019s relief. What I accused you of was wrong. I panicked. Deep down I knew you wouldn\u2019t take Eliza from me. Then you were gone and I didn\u2019t know if it was for good. And I didn\u2019t know how to make it right.</p><p>So all I can do is ask you to forgive me for being a pride-filled idiot, for not trusting you, or trusting in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve forgiven me for the Kane thing, I can forgive you.\u201d He hooked a piece of flyaway hair behind her ear. \u201cSkylar. I love you. I love you so damn much.\u201d He just held her. Loving the way she fit him so perfectly in so many ways.</p><p>Finally, she said, \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to leave me, ever, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long would you have waited for me to realize that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fifty years, give or take.\u201d</p><p>She looked up and her eyes were so serious.</p><p>\u201cWhat, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really are a true gentleman cowboy. A good guy, honest, steadfast, loyal and true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re makin\u2019 me sound like a damn preacher or something. I am who I am, Sky.</p><p>Who I\u2019ve always been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s who I want. That\u2019s who I love. And I\u2019m too damn practical, because I suck at this kind of romantic stuff. But I did try to make this be special and spontaneous and...\u201d Skylar stripped off his gloves and grabbed his hand. \u201cDammit. Come here. I have something to show you.\u201d She dragged him to where she\u2019d spread out a yellow blanket on the flat spot of ground between the ditch and the fence line. A red cooler anchored one corner of the blanket. Centered on the plastic cooler lid was a bunch of wild flowers.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s our romantic celebration. You like it?\u201d</p><p>The woman who claimed not to be a romantic...had picked flowers for him? \u201cYeah.</p><p>It\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a very convincing great, Kade. Sit down.\u201d</p><p>He shuffled his feet and sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna to sit on your nice blanket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ruin it. If you hadn\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m covered in dust and grime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Sky gave him a head to toe once over. \u201cThen you\u2019d better take off your dirty clothes.\u201d</p><p>Surely she was joking. \u201cSky\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t noticed,\u201d she mimicked, \u201cI\u2019m trying to seduce you. But I\u2019m fine with skipping the mushy romantic stuff and getting straight to the hardcore sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He glanced around. \u201cIn the middle of the damn field where anyone can see us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I see. It\u2019s okay when you make me strip down so you can have your wicked way with me, any time, any place. Need I remind you we had sex in my front yard, McKay?\u201d</p><p>Shit. He was so totally screwed.</p><p>The triumph shining in her eyes made him half-wary and completely hard. Skylar fisted her hands in his shirt and pulled his mouth down to hers for a fiery kiss that should\u2019ve set the hayfield on fire.</p><p>Kade groaned. God he loved kissing this woman. His woman. He loved her taste. He loved the way she curled her tongue against his. He loved the softness of her lips. He loved the sharp nip of her teeth. Mostly, he loved the fact she loved him.</p><p>She broke her mouth free but not her hold on his shirt. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I want you. I always want you. Let\u2019s go back to the house, I\u2019ll get cleaned up, Ma can watch Eliza for a bit longer and we can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Right here, right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what I think? That you don\u2019t want to think. You want a woman who will drag you off that damn tractor to fuck you in the weeds any time she pleases.\u201d Sky brushed her lips across his ear in an erotic glide that made him shiver. \u201cYou want a woman who doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re covered in dirt because she plans to fuck you in the mud like an animal anyway. You want a woman who gets all hot and bothered by your possessive primal male declaration of \u2018I protect what\u2019s mine\u2019 and then balls your brains out in the barn.\u201d</p><p>His cock went rigid. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI like the way you smell, fresh off the ranch.

Strip.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait a sec\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Buttons flew as she ripped his shirt open.</p><p>\u201cSkylar!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d focused on unbuckling his belt as she rained kisses down his belly. \u201cDamn T-shirt. Why do you have to wear so many layers of clothes?\u201d</p><p>Why did he? Hell. He could not think. \u201cAh. Um. Protection from the bugs and sun.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis little scrap of cotton isn\u2019t gonna protect you from me.\u201d</p><p>Kade groaned again.</p><p>\u201cFine. Half-naked works. You want to leave your boots on?\u201d</p><p>Kade\u2019s head was spinning with, what the hell had gotten into her? Followed by, why are you resisting?</p><p>\u201cI take that as a yes.\u201d Zip. His fly was undone. Yank. His Wranglers and boxers were down past his knees. She looked up at him. \u201cAre you gonna lay back on that blanket?\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t move, her eyebrows rose in challenge. \u201cOr am I going to have to push you down?\u201d</p> <p>Somehow, he managed not to stumble and ended up flat on his back, his cock sticking straight up like a divining rod, as he stared at the stunning cloudless blue of the big Wyoming sky.</p><p>Then an even prettier Sky was above him. \u201cWith your jeans around your boots, you\u2019re hobbled, cowboy. You can\u2019t get away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou put your hand or your mouth or your pussy on my cock and I guarantee I ain\u2019t gonna try to get away.\u201d</p><p>She grinned, looking as carefree and wild as he\u2019d ever seen her. \u201cHave I mentioned that I love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce or twice, but I wouldn\u2019t mind hearin\u2019 it again. And again.\u201d He reached for the tie on her hair. The shining waves fell around his face like a curtain of silk. He crushed a handful of the sweetly scented strands and inhaled deeply.</p><p>She slowly unbuttoned her blouse, letting it flutter to the ground. Her rosy nipples were completely visible through the lacy pink bra. Skylar threw her leg over his hip, scooted back and lifted her skirt.</p><p>He caught a glimpse of a dark triangle of curls between her milky white thighs.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord. You ain\u2019t wearin\u2019 panties?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope. Since you usually rip them off anyway, I took them off in the truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopin\u2019 to get lucky, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already knew I was the luckiest woman in the world when I saw you on the tractor. When you came running across the field to meet me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me finish. I didn\u2019t think it was possible to fall in love in a month. But I do love you. Not because you\u2019re Eliza\u2019s father but because you\u2019re you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month? I gotcha beat, babe, by a country mile. Do you know I\u2019ve been in love with you since our second date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I figured it was a possibility when I found that letter you sent today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found it? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d been shoved in a pile of junk mail. I\u2019ve gotta say, for the strong, silent type, you certainly have a way with sweet words.\u201d</p><p>His cheeks heated. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think it was dumb? Or corny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was beautiful. And hopeful. And perfect.\u201d</p><p>Kade twirled a section of her hair around his palm as he composed his thoughts. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t found that letter, would you be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It wasn\u2019t that I thought you were lying about writing it. It\u2019s just the way I am, Kade. I\u2019m the type of person who needs proof in order to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve you were with me because you cared about me, and wanted me for me, not just because of Eliza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only told you that about a dozen times. You want more tangible proof that I love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d In one quick movement he whipped off his T-shirt.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed on the square of white gauze on the left side of his chest. \u201cWhat happened? How did you get hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelf-inflicted. It\u2019s not completely healed, so you can\u2019t touch it yet.\u201d He peeled the adhesive tape and lowered the protective gauze so she could see his brand new tattoo.</p><p>Skylar\u2019s eyes widened, then pooled with tears. \u201cKade. You did that? For me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You hate needles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you came to me the other night, and left your marks all over me, I knew they\u2019d fade and I wanted to prove that you\u2019re a permanent part of me.\u201d He glanced at the puffy red skin, and the heart with Skylar scrolled in the center.</p><p>She squinted. \u201cIs the outline of that heart supposed to look like...barbed wire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Your sister has a bizarre sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>Tears splashed on his chest. Her mouth trembled.</p><p>\u201cBaby, don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s the thing, you do. Believe you deserve me, because I finally believe I deserve you. All you have to do is look in my eyes to know the truth. I\u2019ll always be your tangible proof.\u201d Kade wiped her tears and curled his hand around her face, bringing their mouths together for a long kiss. He rested his forehead to hers. \u201cSkylar. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me. Please. Show me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I can do.\u201d He braced his arms behind him as she lowered herself until they were joined completely. He kissed her as she rode him, slow and easy, sweetly. She freely and lovingly gave him all of herself, and she showed him tenderness he didn\u2019t know he\u2019d needed.</p><p>In one magnificent burst, the explosive physical pleasure they always brought to each other became the true intimacy they\u2019d both been searching for because it came from love.</p><p>He flopped back, still inside her, taking her with him so she was sprawled across his chest.</p><p>Scarcely a heartbeat passed before she put her lips to his ear and demanded, \u201cMarry me, Kade McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout damn time you came to your senses, woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, is that a yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, it\u2019s a yes.\u201d</p><p>For the longest time, Kade was content to lay in the middle of the land he loved, with the woman he loved. He was content to just...be. To exist in the moment of perfect happiness and look forward to going home. </p> </body></html>"]
