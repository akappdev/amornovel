His large hands formed a steeple in front of his mouth as he ran over the ten-minute conversation repeatedly until he was on the brink of craziness. He didn\u2019t know what to think, but he knew he needed a drink. A large one. He strode over to his drinks cabinet and lifted the old-fashioned globe-style lid. He didn\u2019t stop to consider which malt he fancied; any alcohol would suffice right now. Pouring a tumbler to the brim with bourbon, he downed half and immediately topped it back up. He felt hot and sweaty. The usually composed man had been knocked for six by today\u2019s revelations, and now all he could see were beautiful sapphire eyes. Everywhere he turned they were there, torturing him, reminding him of his failure. He yanked at his tie and unfastened the top button of his dress shirt, hoping the extra room at his neck would help him breathe. No such luck. His throat was closing up on him. The past had returned to haunt him. He\u2019d tried so hard not to get attached, not to care. And now it was happening again.</p><p>In his world, decisions needed to be made with a clear head and objective mind \u2013 something he was usually an expert at. Usually. Things in William\u2019s world happened for a reason, and that reason was typically because he said so \u2013 because people listened to him, respected him. Now he felt all sense of control slipping away, and he didn\u2019t like it. Especially where she was concerned.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m too old for this shit,\u2019 he grumbled, collapsing onto his chair. After taking another long, healthy glug of his bourbon, he rested his head back and stared up at the ceiling. She\u2019d sent him into a tailspin before, and he was about to let her do it all over again.</p> <p>He was a fool. But having Miller Hart added to the complicated equation left him little choice. And neither did his morals . . . or his love for that woman.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>My destiny has been steered by someone else. All of my effort, my cautious approach, and the protective shields I worked hard to put in place were obliterated the day I met Miller Hart. It fast became obvious that I\u2019d reached a point in my life where it was paramount I maintained my sensible life strategies, kept my calm fa\u00e7ade, and stayed vigilant. Because that man was unquestionably going to test me. And he did. He still is. Trusting a man, confiding in a man, and giving myself to a man was the ultimate. I did it all, and now I wholeheartedly wish I hadn\u2019t. Being frightened that he would leave me because of my history was wasted concern. That should have been the least of my fears.</p><p>Miller Hart is a high-class male prostitute. He said \u2018escort\u2019, but you can\u2019t pretty it up by selecting a less taboo word.</p><p>Miller Hart sells his body.</p> <p>Miller Hart lives a life of debasement.</p><p>Miller Hart is the male equivalent of my mother. I\u2019m in love with a man I can\u2019t have. He made me feel alive when I\u2019d spent too long just existing, but he took away that invigorating feeling, replacing it with desolation. My spirit is more lifeless now than it ever was before my encounters with that man.</p><p>The humiliation of being proved wrong is being drowned out by the hurt. I can feel nothing but crippling hurt. It\u2019s been the longest two weeks imaginable, and I have the rest of my life to soldier through. The thought is enough to make me want to close my eyes and never open them again.</p><p>That night at the hotel plays over and over in my mind \u2013 the feel of the belt Miller put on my wrists, the cold impassiveness of his face as he expertly made me come, the look of raw anguish when he realised the pain he\u2019d caused. Of course I had to flee.</p><p>I just didn\u2019t realise I\u2019d be running right into an even bigger problem. William. I know it\u2019s only a matter of time before he finds me again. I saw the surprise on his face when he registered me, and I saw the recognition when he spotted Miller. William Anderson and Miller Hart know each other, and William will want to know how I know Miller and, God forbid, what I was doing at that hotel. Not only have I spent two weeks in hell, but I\u2019ve also spent two weeks looking over my shoulder, waiting for him to appear.</p><p>After dragging myself to the shower and pulling on anything I can lay my hands on, I plod down the stairs, finding Nan on her knees loading the washing machine. I slip silently onto a chair at the table, but Nan seems to have a radar on me these days and every movement, breath and tear is detected, no matter if she\u2019s in the room with me or not. She\u2019s caring but confused, sympathetic but encouraging. Trying to make me see the positive side of my encounters with Miller Hart has become her life goal, but I can see nothing but imminent misery and feel nothing but lingering pain. There can never be anyone else. No man will ever spark those feelings, make me feel protected, loved and safe.</p> <p>It\u2019s ironic, really. All my life I\u2019ve despised that my mother abandoned me for a life of men, pleasure and gifts. And then Miller Hart turns out to be a male escort. He sells his body, takes money to bring women pleasure. For him, every time he took me in his thing, held me so tenderly in his arms, it was to erase the taint of an encounter with another woman. Of all the men in the world who could\u2019ve captured me so completely, why him?</p><p>\u2018Would you like to come to Monday club with me?\u2019 Nan asks casually while I try to choke down some cornflakes.</p><p>\u2018No, I\u2019ll stay at home.\u2019 I plunge my spoon into my bowl and take another mouthful. \u2018Did you win at bingo last night?\u2019</p><p>Huffing a few times, she slams the door of the washing machine, then proceeds to load the tray with laundry detergent. \u2018Did I heck! Waste of bloody time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why do you bother, then?\u2019 I ask, stirring my breakfast slowly.</p><p>\u2018Because I rock that bingo hall.\u2019 She winks, smiling a little, and I mentally plead for her not to hit me with another pep talk. My plea goes ignored. \u2018I spent years mourning your grandfather\u2019s death, Olivia.\u2019 Her words stun me a little, the mention of my grandfather the last thing I expected. My stirring slows. \u2018I lost my lifetime partner and I cried oceans.\u2019 She\u2019s trying to put things into perspective, and it\u2019s in this moment I wonder if she thinks I\u2019m pathetic for being so blue over a man I\u2019ve known so briefly. \u2018I didn\u2019t think I would ever feel human again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I remember,\u2019 I say quietly. And I remember how I came close to multiplying Nan\u2019s grief. She wasn\u2019t even over my mother\u2019s disappearance before she was cruelly faced with the premature death of her beloved Jim.</p><p>\u2018But it did happen.\u2019 She nods reassuringly. \u2018It doesn\u2019t feel like it right now, but you\u2019ll see that life can go on.\u2019 She\u2019s up the hallway now, while I\u2019m considering her words, feeling a little guilty for mourning something I barely had and even guiltier that she\u2019s comparing it to the loss of her husband in an attempt to make me feel better.</p> <p>I slip deep into thought, running over encounter after encounter, kiss after kiss, word after word. My washed-out mind seems hell-bent on torturing me, but it\u2019s my own stupid fault. I asked for it. Hopelessness has taken on a new meaning.</p><p>The chime of my mobile makes me jump back in my chair, bringing me out of my daydream, where all of the misery is real again. I don\u2019t particularly want contact with anyone, least of all the man responsible for my heartache, so when I see his name appear, I quickly drop my spoon into my bowl and stare blankly at the screen. My heart is sprinting. I\u2019ve clammed up with panic, and I\u2019m far back in my chair, putting as much distance between me and the phone as possible. I can\u2019t move further away because every useless muscle in my body is on shutdown. Nothing is working, except my damn memory, and it\u2019s torturing me some more, making me speed through every moment that I\u2019ve spent with Miller Hart. My eyes begin to pool with tears of despair. It\u2019s not wise to open this message. Of course it\u2019s not wise to open this message. I\u2019m not being very wise at the moment, though. Haven\u2019t been since I met Miller Hart.</p><p>I swipe up my phone and open the text.</p><p>How are you? Miller Hart x</p><p>I frown at the screen and reread the message, wondering if he thinks that I may have forgotten him already. Miller Hart? How am I? How does he think I am? Dancing on the ceiling because I got myself a few rounds of Miller Hart, London\u2019s most notorious male escort, for free? No, not for free. Far from free. My time and experiences with that man are going to cost me dearly. I\u2019ve not even begun to come to terms with what\u2019s happened. My mind is a knot of questions, all jumbled up, but I need to unravel it all and get it in order before I try to make any sense of this. Just the fact that the only man I\u2019ve ever shared my whole self with is suddenly gone is hard enough to deal with. Trying to fathom why and how is a chore my emotions refuse to bear on top of my loss.</p><p>How am I? \u2018A f**king mess!\u2019 I yell at my phone, stabbing at the delete button repeatedly until my thumb gets sore. In an act of pure anger, I throw my phone across the kitchen, not even wincing at the crash as it smashes to smithereens against the tiled wall. I\u2019m heaving violently in my chair, barely hearing the rushed clumping of footsteps down the stairs over my angry gasps.</p><p>\u2018What on earth?\u2019 Nan\u2019s shocked tone creeps over my shoulders, but I don\u2019t turn to see the stunned look that\u2019ll most certainly be plaguing her old face. \u2018Olivia?\u2019</p><p>I stand abruptly, sending my chair flying back, the screeching of wood on wood echoing around our old kitchen. \u2018I\u2019m going out.\u2019 I don\u2019t look at my grandmother as I escape, making my way quickly down the hall and viciously snatching my jacket and satchel from the coat stand.</p><p>\u2018Olivia!\u2019</p><p>Her footsteps are pounding after me as I swing the front door open and nearly take George off his feet. \u2018Morn\u2014 Oh!\u2019 He watches me barrel past, and I just catch a glimpse of his jolly face drifting into shock before I break into a sprint down the pathway.</p><p>I know I look out of place as I stand near the gym entrance, clearly hesitant and a little overwhelmed. All the machines look like spaceships, hundreds of buttons or levers on each one, and I haven\u2019t the first idea how to operate them. My one-hour induction last week did a great job of distracting me, but the information and instructions fell straight from my memory the second I left the exclusive fitness centre. I scan the area, fiddling with my ring, seeing masses of men and women pounding the treadmills, going hell for leather on the bikes and pumping weights on huge lifting devices. They all look like they know exactly what they\u2019re doing.</p><p>In an attempt to blend in, I make my way over to the water machine and gulp down a cup of icy water. I\u2019m wasting time being hesitant when I could be releasing some stress and anger. I spot a punchbag hanging in the far corner with no one within thirty feet of it, so I decide to give it a try. There are no buttons or levers on that.</p><p>Wandering over, I help myself to the boxing gloves hanging on the wall nearby. I shove my hands in, trying to look like a pro, like I come here every morning and start my day with an hour of sweating. After securing the Velcro, I give the bag a little poke. I\u2019m surprised at how heavy it is. My feeble hit has barely moved it. I draw back my arm and poke harder, frowning when all I get is a little sway of the giant bag. Deciding it must be full of rocks, I inject some power into my weak arm and throw some effort into my next hit. I grunt, too, and the bag shifts significantly this time, moving away from me and seeming to pause in mid-air before it\u2019s on its way back towards me. Fast. I panic and quickly pull back my fist, then extend my arm to prevent being knocked to the ground. Shock waves fly up my arm when my glove connects with the bag, but it\u2019s moving away from me again. I smile and spread my legs a little, bracing myself for its return, then smack it hard again, sending it sailing away from me.</p><p>My arm is aching already and I suddenly realise I have two gloved hands, so I pummel it with my left this time, smiling wider, the impact of the bag on my fists feeling good. I break out in a sweat, my feet start to shift, and my arms begin to pick up a rhythm. My shouts of satisfaction spur me on, and the bag morphs into more than a bag. I\u2019m beating the shit out of it and loving every moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019m there, but when I finally let up and take a moment to think, I\u2019m drenched, my knuckles are sore, and my breathing is erratic. I catch the bag and let it settle, then take a cautious glance around the gym, wondering if my lash-out has been noticed. No one is staring. I\u2019ve gone totally unnoticed, everyone focused on their own gruelling workout. I smile to myself and collect a cup of water and a towel from the nearby shelf, wiping my pouring brow as I make my way from the huge room, a certain skip to my step. For the first time in weeks, I feel prepared to take on the day.</p><p>I head to the changing rooms, sipping my water, feeling like a lifetime of stress and woes have just been knocked out of me. How ironic. The sense of release is new and the urge to go back in and pound for another hour is hard to resist, but I\u2019m already at risk of being late for work, so I push on, thinking this could get addictive. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning, maybe even after work today, and I\u2019ll thrash that bag until there are no more traces of Miller Hart and the pain he\u2019s caused me.</p><p>I pass door after door, all with glass panes, and peek into each. Through one I see dozens of tight backsides of people pedalling like their lives depend on it, through another are women bent into all sorts of freakish positions, and in another there are men running back and forth, randomly dropping to the mats to do varied sets of push-ups and sit-ups. These must be the classes the instructor told me about. I might try one or two. Or I could give them all a go.</p><p>As I\u2019m passing the final door before the women\u2019s changing rooms, I pull up when something catches my eye, and backtrack until I\u2019m looking through the glass pane at a punchbag similar to the one that I\u2019ve just attacked. It\u2019s swinging from the ceiling hook, but with no one in sight to have made it move. I frown and step closer to the door, my eyes travelling with the bag from left to right. Then I gasp and jump back as someone comes into view, bare-chested and barefoot. My already racing heart virtually explodes under the added strain of shock it\u2019s just been subjected to. The cup of water and my towel tumble to the ground. I feel dizzy.</p> <p>He has those shorts on, the ones he wore when he was trying to make me comfortable. I\u2019m shaking, but my shocked state doesn\u2019t stop me from peering back through the glass, just to check I wasn\u2019t hallucinating. I wasn\u2019t. He\u2019s here, his ripped physique mesmerising. He looks violent as he attacks the hanging bag like it\u2019s a threat to his life, punishing it with powerful punches and even more powerful kicks. His athletic legs are extending in between extensions of his muscled arms, his body moving stealthily as he weaves and dodges the bag when it comes back at him. He looks like a pro. He looks like a fighter.</p><p>I\u2019m frozen on the spot as I watch Miller move around the hanging bag with ease, his fists wrapped in bandages, his limbs delivering controlled, punishing blows time and time again. The sounds of gruff bawls and his hits send an unfamiliar chill down my spine. Who does he see before him?</p><p>My mind spins, questions mounting, as I quietly observe the refined, well-mannered, part-time gentleman become a man possessed, that temper he has warned me about clear and present. But then I retreat a pace when he suddenly grabs the bag with both hands and rests his forehead on the leather, his body falling into the now subtle sway of the punchbag. His back is dripping and heaving, and I see his solid shoulders rise suddenly. Then he begins to turn towards the door. It happens in slow motion. I\u2019m rooted in place as his chest, slicked with a sheen of sweat, comes into view and my eyes slowly crawl up his torso until I see his side profile. He knows he\u2019s being watched. My held breath gushes from my lungs and I move fast, sprinting down the corridor and flying through the door of the changing room, my exhausted heart begging me to give it a break.</p><p>\u2018You okay?\u2019</p><p>I look across to the shower and see a woman wrapped in a towel with a turban on her wet head, watching me with slightly wide eyes. \u2018Sure,\u2019 I breathe, realising I\u2019m splattered against the back of the door. I can\u2019t blush because my face is already bright red and steaming hot.</p> <p>She smiles through a frown and carries on her way, leaving me to find my locker and retrieve my shower bag. The water is far too hot. I need ice. But after five minutes of fiddling with the controls, I fail to cool it down. So I make do and set about washing my tangled, sweaty mane and soaping down my clammy body. My earlier relaxed frame of mind and body have been obliterated by the sight of him, and now the visions are replaying in my mind, too. There are hundreds of fitness centres in London. Why did I choose this one?</p><p>I haven\u2019t time to waste thinking too much or time to begin appreciating the pleasant effect of the hot water, which is now massaging my post-workout muscles, not burning my already heated flesh. I need to get to work. It takes me ten minutes to dry my body and hair and get dressed. Then I\u2019m skulking out of the gym with my head down and my shoulders high, bracing myself for that voice to call me or that touch to ignite the internal flame. But I escape safely and hurry to the Tube. While my eyes are thankful for the reminder of Miller Hart\u2019s perfection, my mind is not.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>As soon as the lunchtime rush dies down at the bistro where I work, Sylvie is on me like a wolf. \u2018Tell me,\u2019 she says, dropping to the sofa next to me.</p><p>\u2018Nothing to tell.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Livy, give me a break! You\u2019ve looked like a bulldog chewing a wasp all morning.\u2019</p> <p>I cast a sideways frown to find my co-worker\u2019s bright pink lips pressed into an impatient straight line. \u2018A what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your face is all screwed up in disgust.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He texted me,\u2019 I grumble. I\u2019m not telling her the rest. \u2018He texted me to ask how I am.\u2019</p><p>She scoffs and takes my can of Coke, slurping loudly. \u2018Supercilious moron.\u2019</p><p>I jump forward without thought. \u2018He\u2019s not a moron!\u2019 I shout defensively, immediately snapping my mouth shut and retreating back on the sofa when I clock Sylvie\u2019s knowing look. \u2018He\u2019s not a moron and he\u2019s not supercilious,\u2019 I say calmly. He was loving, attentive, and thoughtful . . . when he wasn\u2019t being a supercilious moron . . . or London\u2019s most notorious male escort. I drop my head on a sigh. Landing myself with one hooker is bad luck. Two? Well, that\u2019s just unreasonable of the gods.</p><p>She reaches over and squeezes my knee. \u2018I hope you didn\u2019t entertain him with a reply.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I couldn\u2019t even if I wanted. Which I don\u2019t,\u2019 I say, pulling myself up.</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018My phone\u2019s broken.\u2019 I leave Sylvie on the couch with a wrinkled brow and no further explanation.</p><p>All I\u2019ve told her about my break-up with Miller is that there was another woman. It\u2019s just easier that way. The truth is unspeakable.</p><p>When I enter the kitchen, Del and Paul are laughing like hyenas, each with a vicious knife in one hand and a cucumber in the other. \u2018What\u2019s so funny?\u2019 I ask, making them both halt their happy tittering, their faces morphing into a wash of pity as they each assess my weak body and mental state. I stand quietly and allow them to reach the only conclusion there is. I still look washed out.</p><p>Del\u2019s the one to snap back into action, pointing his knife at me, clearly making himself smile. \u2018Livy can judge. She\u2019ll be fair.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Judge what?\u2019 I ask, taking a step away from the blade.</p><p>Paul pushes Del\u2019s hand down on a tsk and smiles at me. \u2018We\u2019re having a cucumber-chopping competition. Your silly boss here thinks he can beat me.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t mean to, but I laugh. It makes both Paul and Del jump back a little, shocked. I\u2019ve seen Paul slice a cucumber, or I tried to see. His hand is a blur of motion for a few seconds until the vegetable is splayed out neatly, each slice perfect. \u2018Good luck!\u2019</p><p>Del smiles brightly at me. \u2018I don\u2019t need luck, Livy, sweetheart.\u2019 He spreads his legs and lays his cucumber down on the chopping board. \u2018Say when.\u2019</p><p>Paul rolls his eyes at me and stands back, a wise move judging by the hold Del has on the knife. \u2018Are you ready to time it?\u2019 he asks, handing me a stopwatch.</p><p>\u2018Is this a regular thing?\u2019 I take it and reset the display.</p><p>\u2018Yep,\u2019 Del answers, focusing on the cucumber. \u2018He\u2019s beat me on a pepper, onion and lettuce, but the cucumber\u2019s mine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018When!\u2019 Paul shouts, and I immediately press down to start the timer as Del flies into action, bringing the knife down repeatedly and savagely on the poor cucumber.</p><p>\u2018Done!\u2019 he yells, out of breath, looking over at me. He\u2019s broken out in a sweat. \u2018What did I get?\u2019</p><p>I look down. \u2018Ten seconds.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Pow!\u2019 He jumps into the air, and Paul immediately confiscates the knife from him. \u2018Beat that, Mr Master Chef!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Piece of cake,\u2019 Paul claims, taking up position by the chopping board and scraping away the dismembered cucumber before setting his own down. \u2018Say when.\u2019</p><p>I quickly reset the timer, just in time for Del\u2019s, \u2018When!\u2019</p><p>Paul, as I knew he would, sails through the cucumber with finesse and control, as opposed to Del\u2019s heavy-handed massacre. \u2018Done,\u2019 he declares calmly, no sweat and no heavy breathing, which belies his overweight frame.</p><p>Looking down at the stopwatch, I mentally smile. \u2018Six seconds.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Get out of town!\u2019 Del shouts, marching over to me and snatching the watch from my hand. \u2018You must\u2019ve cocked up.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I did not!\u2019 I actually laugh. \u2018And, anyway, Paul sliced, you hacked.\u2019</p><p>He gasps and Paul laughs with me, giving me an endearing wink. \u2018So now I have the pepper, the onion, the lettuce and the cucumber.\u2019 He takes a marker pen and puts a big tick through a basic picture of a cucumber on the wall.</p><p>\u2018Bullshit,\u2019 Del grumbles. \u2018If it wasn\u2019t for the Tuna Crunch, you\u2019d be history, buster.\u2019 Del\u2019s moodiness only increases our laughter, both of us chuckling as our boss stomps off. \u2018Clean up!\u2019 he shouts back to us.</p><p>\u2018Boys,\u2019 I muse.</p><p>Paul smiles fondly. \u2018It\u2019s good to see some spirit, darling.\u2019 He gives me an affectionate rub of the arm, not making too big a deal of it, before strolling off and shaking a pan of something on the stove. Watching him whistle happily to himself, I realise my earlier bubbling anger has completely subsided. Distraction. I need distraction.</p><p>It\u2019s the longest afternoon ever, which isn\u2019t a good sign of things to come. I\u2019m left to lock up the bistro with Paul, Sylvie having got off early to get to her local boozer to nab a front-row seat in time for her favourite band that\u2019s playing tonight. She nagged me for a solid half-hour, trying to entice me to go, but by the sounds of things, the band is in the heavy metal genre, and my head is banging enough already.</p><p>Paul gives my shoulder another friendly rub, the big man clearly uncomfortable with emotional women, before he heads off towards the Tube, leaving me to go in the other direction.</p><p>\u2018Baby girl!\u2019 Gregory\u2019s worried call hits me from behind, and I turn to see him jogging towards me in his combats and T-shirt, looking all muddy and grubby.</p><p>\u2018Hey.\u2019 I fight against my body\u2019s desire to fold in on itself at the prospect of another pep talk.</p><p>He catches me up and we start strolling to the bus stop together. \u2018I\u2019ve tried calling you a million times, Livy,\u2019 he says, worried but annoyed.</p><p>\u2018My phone\u2019s kaput.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter. You okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, I\u2019m not.\u2019 He scowls down at me. \u2018I\u2019m worried about you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be,\u2019 I mutter, not giving anything else away. Just like Sylvie, he knows nothing of male escorts and hotel rooms, and he doesn\u2019t need to. My best friend already hates Miller enough. There\u2019s really no need to give him more ammunition. \u2018I\u2019m fine.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Cocksucker!\u2019 he spits.</p><p>I don\u2019t humour him and instead change the subject. \u2018Have you spoken to Benjamin yet?\u2019</p><p>Gregory takes a long, weary breath. \u2018Briefly. He took one of my calls to tell me to stay away. Your cocksucking coffee-hater has put the fear of God in him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, whose fault is that? You said you wouldn\u2019t let anything happen to me that night, but when I needed you, you\u2019d skulked off with Benjamin.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I know,\u2019 he mutters. \u2018I wasn\u2019t thinking, was I?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, you weren\u2019t,\u2019 I confirm, mentally scolding myself for my cheek.</p><p>\u2018And now Ben\u2019s closed off from me completely,\u2019 he says.</p><p>I look up to Gregory and see a hurt I don\u2019t like. He\u2019s falling for a man who\u2019s pretending to be someone he\u2019s not . . . a bit like Miller. Or was he pretending the whole time he was with me? \u2018Completely?\u2019 I ask. \u2018No contact?\u2019</p><p>Gregory sighs deeply. \u2018He took a woman home that Saturday night and took great delight in telling me so.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 I breathe. \u2018You never mentioned it before.\u2019</p><p>He shrugs, playing it easy. \u2018Kinda bruised my ego,\u2019 he says, his forced indifferent expression turning to mine. \u2018You look a little red-faced.\u2019</p><p>Still? \u2018I went to the gym this morning.\u2019 I reach up and feel my brow. I\u2019ve been hot all day.</p><p>\u2018You did?\u2019 he asks, surprised. \u2018That\u2019s great. What did you do?\u2019 He starts dancing around on the pavement. \u2018A bit of circuit training? Some yoga?\u2019 He bends into the most obscene pose and looks up at me with a grin. \u2018Downward dog?\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t help but return his smile, pulling him back upright. \u2018I punched the crap out of a bag of rocks.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Rocks?\u2019 he laughs. \u2018I think you\u2019ll find those leather bags are full of sand.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Felt like rocks,\u2019 I grumble, looking down at my knuckles and seeing a row of red blisters on each.</p><p>\u2018Shit!\u2019 Gregory grabs my hands. \u2018You did go to town. Feel better for it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I admit. \u2018Anyway, don\u2019t let Ben mess you around.\u2019</p><p>He chokes on a laugh. \u2018Olivia, you\u2019ll forgive me if I don\u2019t take any notice of your advice. What about you? Have you heard from the coffee-hating prick?\u2019</p><p>I resist the urge to defend Miller again or to tell Gregory about the text message and gym scene. It\u2019ll get me nowhere, except lectured. \u2018No,\u2019 I lie. \u2018My phone\u2019s knackered, so no one can contact me.\u2019 That thought suddenly thrills me, and it\u2019s undoubtedly a good thing should Miller decide to text me again. \u2018This is me.\u2019 I point at the bus stop.</p><p>Gregory dips and kisses my forehead, giving me a sympathetic face. \u2018I\u2019m going to the parents\u2019 for dinner tonight. Wanna come?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, thanks.\u2019 Gregory\u2019s parents are lovely people, but keeping up with conversation requires brainpower, and I have none to spare at the moment.</p><p>\u2018Tomorrow, then?\u2019 he pleads. \u2018Please, let\u2019s do something tomorrow.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yes, tomorrow.\u2019 I\u2019ll find the enthusiasm for a full-on discussion within the next day, as long as the discussion remains on Gregory\u2019s diabolical love life and not mine.</p><p>His happy smile makes me smile in return. \u2018Catch ya later, baby girl.\u2019 He roughs up my hair and jogs off, leaving me to wait for my bus, and as if the gods detect my gloomy mood, they open the heavens and let it pour down on me.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I exclaim, wriggling out of my jacket and covering my head, thinking it\u2019s just typical that my bus stop is one with no damn shelter. And to rub it in, all of my fellow bus waiters have umbrellas and are looking at me like I\u2019m stupid. I am stupid \u2013 for more reasons than not just carrying an umbrella. \u2018Shit!\u2019 I curse, looking around for a doorway, anywhere to escape the pounding rain.</p><p>I circle, hunched under my jacket, but I find no place that\u2019ll protect me. A heavy, defeated sigh falls from my mouth while I stand hopelessly in the pouring rain, thinking that the day couldn\u2019t possibly get any longer or worse.</p><p>I\u2019m proven wrong. I suddenly can\u2019t feel the rain pelting my body, and the loud pounding of it beating the pavement dulls out, leaving my hearing saturated with words. His words.</p><p>The black Mercedes slows and pulls up at the bus stop \u2013 Miller\u2019s Mercedes. In an action based on pure impulse, because I know he won\u2019t want to get his perfection wet, I turn and start jogging up the road, the chaos of London rush hour attacking my frenzied mind.</p><p>\u2018Livy!\u2019 I barely hear him in the distance over the pounding rain. \u2018Livy, wait!\u2019</p><p>When I reach a road, I\u2019m forced to stop, the traffic zooming through the green light, leaving me among many other pedestrians waiting to cross, all with umbrellas. I frown when the people on both sides of me jump back, but by the time I\u2019ve realised why, it\u2019s too late. A great big truck zooms past, straight through a lake of a puddle by the roadside, kicking oceans of water up my body.</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I drop my jacket on a shocked gasp as the freezing cold water drenches me. \u2018Shit!\u2019 The lights change and everyone else starts to cross, leaving me looking like a drowned rat on the kerbside, shivering and brimming with tears.</p><p>\u2018Livy.\u2019 Miller\u2019s voice is quieter, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because he\u2019s far away or the rain is drowning him out. His warm touch on my wet arm soon tells me it\u2019s the latter, leaving me surprised that he\u2019s ventured out of his car, given the dreadful weather and the effect it\u2019ll have on his expensive suit.</p><p>I shrug him off. \u2018Leave me alone.\u2019 I bend to collect my saturated jacket from the ground, fighting the growing lump in my throat and the familiar internal sparks that his touch on my cold, wet skin has instigated.</p><p>\u2018Olivia.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How do you know William Anderson?\u2019 I blurt, swinging my eyes to him, finding he\u2019s standing beneath the safety and dryness of a giant golf umbrella. I should\u2019ve known. I\u2019ve surprised myself with my question, and obviously Miller, too, judging by his slight recoil. There are many questions I should be asking, yet my mind has centred on this one alone.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s of no importance.\u2019 He\u2019s being dismissive, making me more persistent.</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ,\u2019 I spit. He knew. All that time he knew. I may have only mentioned William\u2019s first name when I spilled my heart, released everything from my conscience about my mother to Miller, but he knew exactly who I was referring to, and now I\u2019m certain that that was the cause for the majority of his violent reaction and shock.</p><p>He must see the unyielding determination on my face because his impassive expression wavers slightly into a scowl. \u2018You know Anderson, and you know me.\u2019 His jaw tenses. He means I know what they both do. \u2018Our paths have crossed over the years.\u2019</p><p>From the bitterness rolling off him in waves, I determine something quite quickly. \u2018He doesn\u2019t like you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And I don\u2019t like him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because he pokes his nose in where it isn\u2019t wanted.\u2019</p><p>I inwardly laugh, thinking how much I agree, and my eyes drop to the ground, seeing raindrops splashing the pavement. Miller\u2019s confirmation only reinforces my previous fear. I\u2019m delusional if I believe for a moment that William will disappear to where he came from without digging for information on my connection with Miller. I learned many things about William Anderson, and one of those things was his desire to be in the know about everything. I don\u2019t want to explain to anyone, least of all my mother\u2019s ex-pimp. And anyway, I don\u2019t owe him any explanation.</p><p>I\u2019m snapped from my worries when I see Miller\u2019s tan brogues appear in my line of sight. \u2018How are you, Olivia?\u2019</p><p>I refuse to look at him now, his question restoking my anger. \u2018How do you think I am, Miller?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been trying to contact you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You really have no idea?\u2019 I look up at him, surprised. His perfect features hurt my eyes, making me instantly drop my gaze, like if I look at him for too long, I might never forget him.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>\u2018I have an inkling,\u2019 he murmurs. \u2018I did tell you to take me for who I am, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But I didn\u2019t know who you were.\u2019 I grind the words out, keeping my eyes on the bouncing raindrops at my feet, incensed that he would use such a feeble excuse to wriggle out of this. \u2018The only thing that I\u2019ve accepted is that you\u2019re different, with your obsession to have everything painfully perfect and your uptight manners. It can be annoying as hell, but I\u2019ve accepted it and even started to find it lovable.\u2019 I should have used any other word \u2013 appealing, charming, endearing \u2013 but not lovable.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not that bad,\u2019 he argues weakly.</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 I look at him now. His face is straight. It\u2019s nothing new. \u2018Look!\u2019 I run my finger up and down his dry, suited body. \u2018You\u2019re standing here with an umbrella that could keep half of London dry, just so you don\u2019t get your perfect hair and expensive suit wet.\u2019</p><p>He looks a little sulky as he casts his eyes down his suit and slowly back up to me. Then he chucks the umbrella to the pavement, and the rain instantly soaks him, waves of hair falling all over his face, water running down his cheeks, and his expensive suit starting to stick to him. \u2018Happy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You think getting yourself a little wet might fix this? You f**k women for a living, Miller! And you f**ked me! You made me one of them!\u2019 I stagger back, dizzy from both my fury and the flashbacks of our time in the hotel room.</p><p>The water pouring down his face is shimmering. \u2018You don\u2019t need to be so crass, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>I recoil, trying desperately to gather myself. \u2018Fuck you and your bent moral compass!\u2019 I shout, making Miller\u2019s jaw seize with stiffness. \u2018Are you forgetting what I told you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018How could I possibly forget?\u2019 Anyone else would think his face utterly impassive, but I see the tic in his cheek, the anger in his eyes \u2013 eyes I know how to read. I would say that he\u2019s right, that he really is emotionally unavailable, but I\u2019ve experienced feeling with him \u2013 incredible feeling \u2013 and now I just feel conned.</p><p>I wipe my sopping hair from my face. \u2018Your shock when I confided in you, told you about my history, wasn\u2019t because I put myself out there or because of my mother. It was because I\u2019d described your life, with the drink and rich people, taking gifts and money. And. That. You. Knew. William. Anderson.\u2019 I\u2019m doing a grand job of retaining my emotions. I just want to scream at him, and if he doesn\u2019t give me something soon, I might just do that. These are the things that I should have said before. I shouldn\u2019t have goaded him into f**king me or put myself in those women\u2019s shoes to prove a point \u2013 a point I still can\u2019t fathom. Anger makes you do stupid things, and I was angry. \u2018Why did you invite me to dinner?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s nothing you can do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then why did you come?\u2019 he asks.</p><p>His straight question catches me off guard. \u2018Because I was angry with you! Flash cars, clubs and luxury possessions don\u2019t make it right!\u2019 I yell. \u2018Because you made me fall in love with a man you\u2019re not!\u2019 I\u2019m freezing cold, but my quivering body is not a result of that. I\u2019m angry \u2013 blood-boiling angry.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re my habit, Olivia Taylor.\u2019 His statement is delivered with no emotion. \u2018You belong to me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Belong to you?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 He steps forward, prompting me to retreat, keeping the distance between us somewhere near to safe. It\u2019s an ambitious endeavour when he\u2019s still within sight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018You must be mistaken.\u2019 I raise my chin and work hard on keeping my voice even. \u2018The Miller Hart I know has an appreciation for his possessions.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t!\u2019 He takes my arm, but I yank it free.</p><p>\u2018You wanted to continue with your secret life of f**king woman after woman, and you wanted me to make myself readily available for you to f**k when you got home.\u2019 I mentally correct myself. He called it destressing, but he can call it what he likes. The principle is still the same.</p><p>He freezes me in place with adamant eyes. \u2018I\u2019ve never f**ked you, Livy. I\u2019ve only ever worshipped you.\u2019 He steps forward. \u2018I only ever made love to you.\u2019</p> <p>I draw a long, calming breath. \u2018You didn\u2019t make love to me in that hotel room.\u2019</p><p>His eyes clench shut briefly, and when they reopen, I see anguish pouring from them. \u2018I didn\u2019t know what I was doing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You were doing what Miller Hart does best,\u2019 I spit, hating the venom in my tone and the mild shock that passes across his heart-stopping face as a result of my statement. Many women may think that that\u2019s what London\u2019s most notorious male escort does best, but I know different. And deep down, so does Miller.</p><p>He watches me for a moment, unspoken words swimming in his gaze. It\u2019s right now that understanding slams through me. \u2018You think I\u2019m a hypocrite, don\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 He shakes his head mildly . . . unconvincingly. \u2018I accept what you did when you ran away and gave yourself . . .\u2019 He pulls up. He can\u2019t finish. \u2018I accept why you did it. I hate it. It makes me hate Anderson even more. But I accept it. I accept you.\u2019</p> <p>Shame eats away at me, and I momentarily lose my fortitude. He accepts me. And reading between the lines, I think he wants me to accept him. Take me as I am, Olivia.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t. I can\u2019t.</p><p>When an eternity passes and I\u2019ve mentally sprinted through every reason to walk away, I hold his gaze and reel off my own version of his words. \u2018I don\u2019t want other women to taste you.\u2019</p><p>His body goes lax on an exhale of defeated breath. \u2018It\u2019s not as easy as just quitting.\u2019</p><p>Those words are like a bullet to my head, and with nothing left to say, I turn and walk away, leaving my perfect Miller Hart, still looking perfect in the pouring rain.</p><p>Chapter Three</p> <p>The week is passing painfully slowly. I\u2019ve seen my shifts through at the bistro and avoided Gregory, and I\u2019ve not returned to the gym. I want to, but I can\u2019t risk seeing Miller. Every time I seem to edge forward a little, he seems to sense it and materialises from nowhere \u2013 mainly in my dreams, a few times in reality \u2013 to put me back at square one.</p><p>Nan appears at the lounge doorway and takes a few moments to dust the nearby bookshelf before swiping the remote control from my hand. \u2018Hey, I was watching that!\u2019 I wasn\u2019t watching it at all, and even if I had been utterly engrossed and interested in the documentary on fruit bats, Nan wouldn\u2019t give a stuff.</p><p>\u2018Hush your mouth and help me decide.\u2019 She throws the remote onto the couch next to me and runs into the hallway, returning quickly with two dresses on hangers. \u2018I can\u2019t choose,\u2019 she says, holding one up to the front of her body. It\u2019s blue with bright yellow flowers scattered all over it. \u2018This one\u2019 \u2013 she swaps it for a green dress \u2013 \u2018or this one?\u2019</p><p>I sit up a little and flick my eyes between the two. \u2018I like both.\u2019</p><p>Her navy eyes roll. \u2018Fat lot of help you are.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Where are you going?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dinner-dance with George on Friday.\u2019</p><p>I smile. \u2018Are you going to rock the ballroom?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Pfft!\u2019 She shakes her head and performs a little jig, making my smile widen. \u2018Olivia, your grandmother rocks just about anything she does.\u2019</p><p>\u2018True,\u2019 I admit, scanning the dresses again. \u2018The blue one.\u2019</p><p>The smile that graces her face replaces some of the lingering coldness that has resided for days, sending a brief shot of warmth to my heart. \u2018I think so, too.\u2019 She throws the green one aside and holds the favourite up against her. \u2018It\u2019s perfect for dancing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is it a competition?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not officially.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You mean it\u2019s just a dance?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, Olivia, it\u2019s never just a dance.\u2019 She twirls and flicks her grey bob, for what it\u2019s worth. \u2018Just call me Ginger.\u2019</p><p>I chuckle. \u2018And is George your Fred?\u2019</p><p>She sighs, exasperated. \u2018God bless him, he tries, but the man has two left feet.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Give him a break. The poor bloke is in his late seventies!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m no spring chicken, but I can still bump and grind with the best of \u2019em.\u2019</p><p>My brow wrinkles. \u2018Bump and what?\u2019</p><p>Her legs bend until she\u2019s squatting a little, and then she starts thrusting her old h*ps forward. \u2018Bump,\u2019 she says, before changing direction and swivelling her h*ps around, \u2018and grind.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nan!\u2019 I laugh, watching as she alternates between thrusting and swivelling. She looks crafty as she increases her pace, leaving me in a helpless fit of giggles on the couch, holding my aching stomach. \u2018Stop it!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I might audition for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s next music video. Think I\u2019ll rock it?\u2019 She winks and takes a seat next to me, wrapping me in her arms. I get my laughter under control and sigh into her bosom, embracing her tight clinch. \u2018Nothing gives me greater pleasure than seeing those beautiful eyes sparkle when you laugh, my darling girl.\u2019</p><p>My amusement subsides and appreciation takes over \u2013 appreciation for this wonderful old woman who I\u2019m so lucky to call my grandmother. She\u2019s worked tirelessly to fill the gaping hole that my mother left and has succeeded to a certain extent. And now she\u2019s adopting the same tactic for the absence of another person in my life. \u2018Thank you,\u2019 I whisper.</p><p>\u2018For what?\u2019</p><p>I shrug a little. \u2018Just for being you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A nosy old bat?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I never mean it when I say that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, you do.\u2019 She laughs and pulls me from her bust, cupping my cheeks in her wrinkled hands and smothering me with her marshmallow lips. \u2018My beautiful, beautiful girl. Dig deep to find that sass, Olivia. Not too much, but just a little. It\u2019ll serve you well.\u2019</p><p>My lips tip. She means not as much as my mother.</p><p>\u2018Darling girl, take life by the balls and twist them.\u2019</p><p>I laugh, and she laughs, too, falling back on the sofa and taking me with her. \u2018I\u2019ll try.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And while you\u2019re at it, twist the balls of any arseholes you encounter, too.\u2019 She hasn\u2019t said it directly, but I know who she\u2019s talking about. Who else?</p><p>The house phone rings, pulling us both up.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll get it,\u2019 I say, giving Nan a quick kiss on the cheek and heading into the hall, where the cordless device sits in its cradle on the old-fashioned telephone table. In a sad fit of excitement, my eyes light up when I see the bistro\u2019s landline number displayed on the screen, and I hope I know why. \u2018Del!\u2019 I greet, all cheery and way too enthusiastic.</p><p>\u2018Hi, Livy.\u2019 His strong cockney accent is a pleasure to hear. \u2018I tried your mobile, but it was dead.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, it\u2019s broken.\u2019 I need to get a new phone pronto, but I\u2019m also quite enjoying the benefit of seclusion that not having one is bringing.</p><p>\u2018Oh good. Now, I know you\u2019re not keen on evenings . . .\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll do it!\u2019 I blurt, taking the stairs fast. Distraction, distraction, distraction.</p><p>\u2018Oh?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You want me to waitress?\u2019 I fall into the bathroom, sadly excited at the thought of a perfect opportunity to escape the risk of falling back into mental torment, now that Nan\u2019s antics have expired for the day.</p><p>\u2018Yes, at the Pavilion. Damn agency workers are so unreliable.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No prob\u2014\u2019 I halt mid-sentence and fall against the bathroom door, suddenly thinking of something that could blow my plan of distraction out of the water. \u2018Can I ask what the occasion is?\u2019</p><p>I can see Del frown in my mind\u2019s eye. \u2018Uh, yeah, annual gala for a bunch of judges and barristers.\u2019</p><p>My whole being relaxes. Miller is not a judge, nor is he a barrister. I\u2019m safe.</p><p>\u2018Should I wear black?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 He sounds confused. \u2018Seven o\u2019clock start.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Great. I\u2019ll see you there.\u2019 I hang up and throw myself in the shower.</p><p>I hurry into the staff entrance of the Pavilion and immediately find Del and Sylvie pouring champagne. \u2018I\u2019m here!\u2019 I shrug off my denim jacket and ditch my satchel. \u2018What should I do?\u2019</p><p>Del smiles, then looks to Sylvie, a quiet acknowledgment passing between them at my unusual cheery mood. \u2018Finish pouring, you sweet thing,\u2019 he says, handing me a bottle and leaving me with Sylvie to finish up.</p><p>\u2018You okay?\u2019 I ask Sylvie, commencing pouring duties.</p><p>Her black bob sways as she shakes her head on a smile. \u2018You look . . . chirpy.\u2019</p><p>I swiftly brush off her observation, refusing to let the smile fall from my face. \u2018Life goes on,\u2019 I say quickly before going for subject change. \u2018How many posh people have we got to feed and water this evening?\u2019</p><p>\u2018About three hundred. The reception is from eight until nine before they\u2019ll all be pushed into the ballroom for dinner. We\u2019ll pick up again at tennish when they\u2019re done and the band starts.\u2019 She places the empty bottle of champagne down. \u2018Done. Let\u2019s go.\u2019</p><p>Despite my enthusiasm to distract myself with work, I don\u2019t feel comfortable this evening. I\u2019m gliding through the crowds, delivering canap\u00e9s and champagne, but I feel uneasy. I don\u2019t like it.</p><p>When the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 announces dinner, the room soon empties, leaving hundreds of cocktail napkins all over the posh marble floor. They might be people of the legal world, but they\u2019ve littered this stunning room terribly. I rid myself of my tray and start making my way around the room, scooping up the rubbish and stuffing it into a black sack, even finding the remnants of canap\u00e9s as I go.</p><p>\u2018You okay there, Livy?\u2019 Del calls across the room.</p><p>\u2018Sure. They\u2019re a messy bunch,\u2019 I say, tying my full sack. \u2018Do you mind if I use the toilets?\u2019</p><p>He laughs, shaking his head. \u2018What would you do if I said no?\u2019</p><p>The question throws me. \u2018Are you going to say no?\u2019</p><p>\u2018God love you. Go to the bloody toilet, woman!\u2019 My boss disappears back into the kitchen, leaving me to find the ladies\u2019.</p><p>I take some stairs, following the signs, until I\u2019m wandering down a long stretch of corridor, admiring the paintings flanking either side of me. They are all of historical kings and queens, the earliest being Henry VIII. I stop and take in the portly, bearded man in his later years, wondering, stupidly, what would possess a woman to venture there.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s not Miller Hart, is he?\u2019</p><p>I swing around, coming face to face with Miller\u2019s \u2018business associate\u2019. Cassie. What the hell is she doing here? She\u2019s gazing at the picture thoughtfully, arms crossed over the bustier of a stunning silver gown, her glossy black hair tumbling over her shoulders.</p><p>\u2018And he may have been a busy boy in the bedroom, but not as busy as Miller.\u2019 Her sly, hurtful words are like pins shoved viciously into the centre of my heart. \u2018Is he as good as everyone claims?\u2019 She turns her cocky expression to me, giving me the once-over with eyes full of satisfaction. I crumble a little, yet find a hidden strength to conceal it.</p><p>\u2018That depends on how good everyone claims he is,\u2019 I retort, meeting her stare and matching her confidence. Her question quickly tells me that she\u2019s asking because she doesn\u2019t know herself, and that satisfies me too much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Very good.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then they are very right.\u2019</p><p>She barely retains her shock, pushing my confidence further. \u2018I see,\u2019 she says quietly, nodding mildly.</p><p>\u2018But I\u2019ll tell you something for free.\u2019 I step forward, feeling unreasonably superior with the knowledge that I\u2019ve had him and Cassie hasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t give her the opportunity to ask what. I\u2019m in my stride. \u2018He makes love even better than he f**ks with restraints.\u2019</p> <p>She gasps, backing away from me, and it\u2019s in this moment I comprehend the weight of Miller\u2019s reputation. It makes me feel nauseous. Somehow, though, I manage to cling on to my sass.</p><p>\u2018If your plan was to try and shock me with news of Miller\u2019s business, then it\u2019s wasted bitchiness. I already know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Right,\u2019 she says slowly, thoughtfully.</p><p>\u2018Are we done, or are you going to enlighten me of his rules, too?\u2019</p><p>She laughs, but it\u2019s a surprised laugh. I\u2019ve shocked her even more, startled her with my assertiveness, and she wasn\u2019t prepared for it, which is now making me smug. \u2018I guess we\u2019re done.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Good,\u2019 I fire with confidence before finding my way to the toilet and falling apart once I\u2019m safely behind the closed door of the cubicle. I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m crying when I feel so satisfied with myself. I think I just twisted some balls, and Nan would be so proud . . . if I could tell her.</p><p>After spending an eternity pulling myself together, I make my way back to the kitchens and start loading up some trays of champagne in preparation for the return of guests from their meal.</p><p>Cassie is one of the first to enter the room, and she is draped all over a mature man, at least thirty years her senior. It\u2019s then that the obviousness hits me like a tornado, making my tray of champagne flutes chink as my palm shakes. She\u2019s a high-class hooker, too!</p><p>\u2018Oh my God,\u2019 I whisper, watching her giggle and lap up the attention he\u2019s showering her with. Why? She has a stake in an exclusive nightclub. She surely doesn\u2019t need the cash or gifts. And in this moment, I swiftly realise that I haven\u2019t even considered Miller\u2019s motive for absorbing himself in that world. He owns Ice. He definitely doesn\u2019t need the money. I reflect back to our encounter at the restaurant, scanning my mind for some words I vaguely recall.</p><p>Enough to buy a nightclub.</p><p>I\u2019m buzzing with curiosity, and I hate being curious. It\u2019s already got me in too deep and more could see me drowning.</p> <p>\u2018You gonna stand there all night and daydream?\u2019 Sylvie\u2019s voice snaps me back into the room, which is now filled with guests and happy chatter. My eyes cast slowly across the gatherings of people, all, as usual, impeccably dressed, and I wonder how many are immersed in a world of high-class prostitution. \u2018Livy?\u2019</p><p>I jump, prompting me to steady my tray with my spare hand. \u2018Sorry!\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 Sylvie asks, looking around the room, and I know it\u2019s because of all the other times during these functions that I\u2019ve had a funny turn.</p><p>\u2018Nothing,\u2019 I blurt. \u2018I\u2019d better get serving.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hey, is that the woman . . .\u2019 She pauses and looks at me, her pink lips pursed tight to stop her from completing her question.</p><p>I don\u2019t answer, instead leaving Sylvie to lose myself in the crowd and let her draw her own conclusion. I\u2019ve led my friends to believe that Cassie is Miller\u2019s girlfriend, and I might have got away with it if the slut wasn\u2019t parading around blatantly with another man.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>I walk home from work the next evening, taking a few detours to see some of my favourite landmarks on my way. As always, the diversion is welcome, but when I stop at a street vendor to buy a bottle of water, a picture on the front of a newspaper catapults me back to square one. He did this interview weeks ago. Why is it in print only now? My pulse increases as I absorb the photograph of the beautiful male gracing the front page, and then it pumps relentlessly when I read the headline:</p> <p>London\u2019s most eligible bachelor opens</p><p>London\u2019s most exclusive nightclub.</p><p>I gingerly pick up the paper and stare down at the words, being bombarded with images of a happy moment, when he had acknowledged his feelings and seemed to have given up trying to hide from them. He\u2019d told that brash journalist to rethink her plan to title the piece with this. She must have been delighted by the news that Miller Hart is, in fact, a bachelor. The hurt is too much and reading the article will only inflame it, so I force myself to throw it back on the pile, forgetting to collect the water I\u2019d originally stopped for.</p><p>He\u2019s still around every corner. I stare blankly down at the pavement, trying to figure out where to head next. In my fog, I step into the road, only to be honked at by an approaching car, but I don\u2019t even jump. If that car were to mow me down, I wouldn\u2019t feel a thing.</p><p>It slows and stops a few feet before me. The Lexus is unfamiliar, but the registration plate isn\u2019t. Two letters. Just two.</p><p>W A</p><p>The driver\u2019s door opens and an unfamiliar man gets out, tipping his hat to me before briskly walking around the car and opening the rear door, holding it and gesturing for me to get in. Refusing would be stupid. He\u2019ll find me, no matter where I hide, so I tentatively step forward and lower myself into the car, keeping my eyes down, working hard to make my tears recede. I don\u2019t need to look to check if I\u2019m alone. I know I\u2019m not. I could feel the power that he wields from outside of the car. Now that I\u2019m within touching distance of him, it\u2019s potent.</p><p>\u2018Hello, Olivia.\u2019 William\u2019s voice is just how I remember. Soft. Comforting.</p><p>I hang my head. I\u2019m not ready for this.</p><p>\u2018You could at the very least be courteous enough to look at me and say hello this time. That night at the hotel, you were in an awful hurry.\u2019</p><p>I slowly turn my eyes and absorb every refined piece of William Anderson, refreshing the distant memories that I\u2019ve stored at the back of my mind for years and years. \u2018What is it about you types and manners?\u2019 I ask shortly, keeping my stare on his shimmering greys. They seem even more sparkly, his full head of grey hair making his eyes seem more like liquid metal.</p><p>He smiles and reaches over, clasping my little hand in his big one. \u2018I would have been disappointed had you not fired a little spunk in my direction.\u2019</p><p>His touch is just as comforting as his handsome face. I don\u2019t want it to be, but it is. \u2018And I would hate to disappoint you, William,\u2019 I sigh. The door next to me shuts and the driver is up front in no time, pulling away from the kerb. \u2018Where are you taking me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018For dinner, Olivia. It seems we have a lot to talk about.\u2019 He pulls my hand to his mouth and kisses my knuckles before placing it back in my lap. \u2018The similarities are incredible,\u2019 he says quietly.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t,\u2019 I grate, turning to look out the window. \u2018If that\u2019s all you want to talk about, then I\u2019ll graciously decline your invitation to dinner.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I wish it really was all there is to talk about,\u2019 he replies sternly. \u2018But a certain wealthy young gentleman is higher on my list of concerns, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>My eyes slowly close and, if it were possible, I\u2019d close my ears, too. I don\u2019t want to hear what William has to say. \u2018Your concern isn\u2019t necessary.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll be the one who decides that. I\u2019m not going to sit back and watch you be dragged into a world where you don\u2019t belong. I fought long and hard to keep you from it, Olivia.\u2019 He reaches over and runs his knuckles down my cheek, watching me closely. \u2018I won\u2019t allow it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It has nothing to do with you.\u2019 I\u2019m sick of people thinking they know what\u2019s best for me. I\u2019m the master of my own destiny, I think like an idiot. I take the handle of the door when the car stops at a red light, ready to jump out and run. But I don\u2019t get very far. The door won\u2019t budge and William has a firm grip around the top of my arm.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re staying in this car, Olivia,\u2019 he asserts firmly as the car pulls away from the lights. \u2018I\u2019m in no mood for your defiance this evening. You really are your mother through and through.\u2019</p><p>I shrug him off and rest back in the plush leather. \u2018Please don\u2019t speak of her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your hatred hasn\u2019t lessened, then?\u2019</p><p>I turn cold eyes onto my mother\u2019s ex-pimp. \u2018Why would it? She chose your dark world over her daughter.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re about to choose a darker world,\u2019 he says matter-of-factly.</p><p>My mouth snaps shut and my heart rate doubles. \u2018I\u2019m choosing nothing,\u2019 I whisper. \u2018I\u2019m never going to see him again.\u2019</p><p>He smiles fondly at me on a little shake of his head. \u2018Who are you trying to convince?\u2019 he asks, and probably wisely, too. I heard my words. There was no conviction in them. \u2018I\u2019m here to help you, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t need your help.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I assure you, you do. More than you did seven years ago,\u2019 he says harshly, almost coldly, leaving me feeling cold. I remember William\u2019s dark world. I can\u2019t possibly need his help more now than I did then.</p><p>He turns away from me and takes his phone from his inside pocket, punching in a few numbers before holding it to his ear. \u2018Cancel my appointments for the rest of the evening,\u2019 he orders, and then hangs up, slipping his phone back into his jacket. He keeps his gaze forward for the rest of the journey, leaving me wondering what\u2019s about to transpire over dinner. I know I\u2019m about to hear things that I don\u2019t want to, and I know there is nothing I can do to stop it.</p><p>The driver pulls the Lexus up to a small restaurant and opens the door for me. William nods, a wordless gesture to step out, which I do without a fuss, knowing it will get me nowhere to protest. Smiling at the driver, I wait for William to join me on the pavement and then watch as he buttons his jacket before placing his hand on the small of my back to guide me onward. The doors to the restaurant are opened for us and William greets almost everyone as we pass through. The awareness of his presence by other diners and the staff is powerful. He nods and smiles all the way until we\u2019re being seated at a private table at the back, away from prying eyes and ears. A wine menu is handed to me by a smart waiter, and I smile my thanks as I take my seat.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019ll have water,\u2019 he orders. \u2018And the usual for me.\u2019 There\u2019s no please or thank you. \u2018I recommend the risotto.\u2019 William smiles across the table at me.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not hungry.\u2019 My stomach\u2019s in knots, a mixture of nerves and anger. I couldn\u2019t possibly eat.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re bordering on emaciated, Olivia. Please let me have the satisfaction of watching you eat a decent meal.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I have my nan to nag me about my weight. I don\u2019t need you nagging, too.\u2019 I place the menu on the table and take the glass of water that\u2019s just been poured.</p><p>\u2018How is the formidable Josephine?\u2019 he asks, accepting a tumbler of dark liquid from the waiter.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t so formidable when William sent me back to her. I recall him referring to my grandmother on a few occasions during my reckless spell, but I was too blinkered by my determination back then to delve into the details of their acquaintance. \u2018You knew her?\u2019 Now I\u2019m curious again, and I damn well hate being curious.</p><p>He laughs, and it\u2019s a pleasant sound, all smooth and light. \u2018I\u2019ll never forget her. I was her first call each time Gracie performed one of her disappearing acts.\u2019</p><p>The mention of my mother\u2019s name stirs the bile in my stomach, but hearing about my grandmother makes me smile on the inside. She\u2019s fearless, not intimidated in the least bit by anyone, and I know William wouldn\u2019t have been an exception. His amused tone while talking of Nan is proof. \u2018She\u2019s well,\u2019 I answer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Still spunky?\u2019 he asks with a slight smile on his lips.</p><p>\u2018More than ever,\u2019 I answer, \u2018but she wasn\u2019t too good when you took me home that night seven years ago.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019 He nods in understanding. \u2018She needed you.\u2019</p><p>Regret cripples me, and I crumble within, wishing I could change how I reacted to the discovery of my mother\u2019s journal and to my grandmother\u2019s grief. \u2018We got through it. She\u2019s still spunky.\u2019</p> <p>He smiles. It\u2019s a fond smile. \u2018No one ever made me quake in my boots, Olivia. Only your grandmother.\u2019 The idea of William quaking in his boots is ludicrous. \u2018But she knew deep down that I could no less control Gracie than she or your grandfather could.\u2019</p><p>William relaxes back in his chair and orders two risottos when the waiter presents himself.</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 I ask once the waiter has scurried away again. This is a question I should have asked all those years ago. There are so many things I should have asked back then.</p><p>\u2018Why what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why was my mother like that? Why couldn\u2019t she be controlled?\u2019</p> <p>William visibly shifts in his seat, clearly made uncomfortable by my question, and his grey eyes are avoiding mine. \u2018I tried, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>I frown across the table at him, finding it strange seeing such a prolific male looking so awkward. \u2018What?\u2019</p><p>He sighs and rests his elbows on the table. \u2018I should have sent her away sooner. Like I did you when I discovered who you were.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why would you send her away?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because she was in love with me.\u2019 He watches for my reaction across the table, but he won\u2019t find much because I\u2019ve been stunned into blankness. My mum was in love with her pimp? Then why the hell did she put it about town? Why . . . Realisation descends quickly and halts my silent questions.</p><p>\u2018You didn\u2019t love her,\u2019 I whisper.</p> <p>\u2018I loved your mother madly, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then why\u2014\u2019 I sit back in my chair. \u2018She was punishing you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Daily,\u2019 he sighs. \u2018Every f**king day.\u2019</p><p>This isn\u2019t what I expected. I\u2019m totally confused. \u2018If you loved each other, then why weren\u2019t you together?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She wanted me to do things that I simply couldn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Or wouldn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, couldn\u2019t. I had a responsibility. I couldn\u2019t walk away from my girls and let them fall into the hands of some immoral bastard.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So you walked away from my mum.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018And let her fall into the hands of an immoral bastard.\u2019</p><p>I gasp, my eyes darting around the dimly lit restaurant, trying to comprehend what I\u2019m being told. \u2018You knew. I was looking for answers and you knew all along?\u2019</p><p>His lips straighten and his nostrils flare. \u2018You didn\u2019t need to know the sordid details. You were a young girl.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How could you let her go like that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I kept her close for years, Olivia. Letting her loose in my world was disastrous. I stood back and watched her drown men in her beauty and spirit, watched them fall for her. It tore my heart out every f**king day, and she knew it. I couldn\u2019t take it any more.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So you banished her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And I wish to every god that I hadn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>I gulp back the lump forming in my throat. Everything William has told me might fill a massive hole in my history, but it doesn\u2019t fill the hole in my heart. Despite his tale of tortured love though, she still abandoned her daughter. There\u2019s nothing he could tell me to make that right. I glimpse across the table at the mature, handsome man whom my mother was in love with and, crazily, I can appreciate it. And even crazier was that I went to find my mother, tried to fathom her mentality. I took her journal and tracked down those men she wrote about, desperate to figure out what she found so appealing. But instead I found comfort in her pimp. My short time with William when I was seventeen showed me a compassionate, caring man, a man who I fast became fond of, a man who cared for me. There was no desire, nor was there any physical attraction, despite his good looks, but I can\u2019t deny that I felt a certain sense of love for him.</p><p>\u2018How did you not know who I was?\u2019 I ask. I survived a whole week before William worked it out. I remember his face, the realisation . . . the anger. I know that I look scarily like my mother. How had he not seen it?</p><p>He takes a deep, almost frustrated breath. \u2018When you turned up, it had been fifteen years since I\u2019d seen Gracie. The resemblance was uncanny, but I was so blindsided by that alone I didn\u2019t stop to consider the possibility. Then I did, but the maths didn\u2019t add up.\u2019 His eyebrows jump up accusingly. \u2018Wrong name, wrong age.\u2019</p><p>I look away, ashamed. I\u2019m humiliated and shattered. Some things are best left dead, and my mother is one of those things. \u2018Thank you,\u2019 I whisper quietly as our risotto is placed before us.</p><p>William lets the waiter fuss for a few moments before flicking his hand, silently ordering him to leave. \u2018For what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018For sending me back to Nan.\u2019 I look up at him and he reaches over and takes my hand. \u2018For helping me and not telling my grandmother.\u2019 That was what did it. William\u2019s threat to pay a visit to Nan terrified me more than anything else because it would have killed her. She was in a terribly dark place. As far as Nan is concerned, I ran away to escape the harsh reality that my mother\u2019s journal represented. I couldn\u2019t add to her grief. Not after everything she went through with her daughter and then Granddad. \u2018But I read her journal.\u2019 I let the words tumble from my lips in a moment of confusion. \u2018That\u2019s how I found you back then.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A little black leather book?\u2019 he asks with an edge of resentment to his tone.</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 I\u2019m almost excited that he knows what I\u2019m talking about. \u2018You know of it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course I do.\u2019 William\u2019s jaw has noticeably tightened, making me sit further back in my chair. \u2018She was kind enough to leave it on my desk for a bit of bedtime reading once.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh . . .\u2019 I pick up my fork and start poking at the rice dish that I\u2019m not hungry for \u2013 anything to escape the potent bitterness pouring from William.</p><p>\u2018Your mother could be a cruel woman, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>I nod, the purpose of the little black book suddenly very clear. She really did get a thrill from writing all of those passages, describing endless encounters with endless men, all in vivid detail. But it wasn\u2019t because she relished doing it. Or maybe she did. Who knows? The primary reason was to torture William. Her thrill was knowing the hurt and anger she\u2019d cause the man she was in love with.</p><p>\u2018Anyway,\u2019 he sighs, \u2018that\u2019s all history . . .\u2019</p><p>I scoff at his insult. \u2018For you, perhaps! For me it\u2019s a daily mystery as to why she\u2019d give me up.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t beat yourself up, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well I do!\u2019 I\u2019m outraged that he can pass off my abandonment with such flippancy. Trying to convince myself it was of no consequence that she cleared off was easier than facing the harsh reality. A story of tortured love doesn\u2019t make this all better, nor does it make me understand.</p><p>\u2018Calm down.\u2019 William leans across the table and gives my hand a soothing rub, but I snatch it away. I\u2019m furious with so many aspects of my life, and I feel like all of it is out of my control.</p><p>\u2018I am calm!\u2019 I yell, making William sit back in his chair with a look of exasperation on his handsome face. \u2018I\u2019m calm.\u2019 I start playing with my risotto again. \u2018Do you think she\u2019s alive?\u2019</p><p>The harsh pull of breath that stems from the man across the table is full of pain. \u2018I . . .\u2019 He\u2019s shifting in his chair again, avoiding my eyes. \u2018I\u2019m . . .\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just tell me,\u2019 I say evenly, wondering why I care. She\u2019s dead to me anyway.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 William collects his own fork and pokes at the dish. \u2018Gracie and her ability to make men insane with frustration and lust could have quite possibly driven someone to strangulation, too. Trust me, I know.\u2019 He drops his fork, the conversation clearly sucking up his appetite. I follow his lead and do exactly the same.</p><p>\u2018She sounds like a handful,\u2019 I say, because I don\u2019t know what else there is to say.</p><p>\u2018You have no idea,\u2019 he sighs, almost on a smile, like he\u2019s reflecting. \u2018Anyway, back to the matter at hand.\u2019 He brushes off the reminiscing quickly and turns all businesslike, and I imagine that\u2019s exactly how it was all those years ago with my mother. Even just talking about her exposes vulnerability in this hard-faced, powerful man. \u2018Miller Hart.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What about him?\u2019 I raise my chin cockily, like he\u2019s of no importance.</p><p>\u2018How do you know him?\u2019</p><p>\u2018How do you know him?\u2019 I\u2019m being conniving, but I\u2019m also even more curious after Miller\u2019s vague explanation. All of these warnings and concern. Why?</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s a ruined man.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That doesn\u2019t answer my question.\u2019</p><p>William leans forward, and I move back, wary. \u2018That man lives in a dark place, Olivia. Darker than mine. He plays with the devil.\u2019</p><p>I swallow hard, pain slicing through my heart. No words are coming to me and, even if they did, I wouldn\u2019t get them past my thick tongue.</p><p>\u2018I know what he does and how he does it,\u2019 William continues. \u2018He\u2019s known as London\u2019s most notorious male escort for a reason, Olivia. I worked too hard to keep you from my own business dealings to see you blindly jump into Miller Hart\u2019s dark place. I\u2019ve been in this world for a long, long time. There\u2019s not much I don\u2019t know, if anything. And I know this . . .\u2019 He pauses, leaving a lingering, unwanted silence hovering between us. \u2018He will break you.\u2019</p><p>I flinch at his cold claim. I\u2019m desperate to tell him that Miller showed me nothing but tenderness . . . until that night at the hotel. The night William found me racing away from where Miller had restrained me to a bedpost and treated me like any of his other clients. I still wasn\u2019t sure what was worse \u2013 his cold impassiveness that night or the way his clever fingers and tongue still made me come in exquisite torture.</p><p>\u2018Thanks for the news flash,\u2019 are the only words I can get out through my pain.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re your mother\u2019s daughter, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t say that!\u2019 I yell, making William recoil. He doesn\u2019t retaliate, though. He simply takes a sip of his drink and waits for me to calm down. \u2018I\u2019m nothing like my mother. She gave up her daughter for a man who didn\u2019t want her.\u2019</p><p>He leans forward, his grey eyes blazing. \u2018A relationship between me and Gracie Taylor would have been impossible. Don\u2019t you dare think for a minute that I wasn\u2019t trying to do what was best for her. Or for you.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m slightly taken aback by William\u2019s unusual show of anger. I\u2019ve never seen him anything less than perfectly composed.</p><p>He takes another sip of his drink before continuing. \u2018And a relationship between you and Miller Hart would be equally impossible.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 I whisper, feeling those damn tears pinching the backs of my eyes. \u2018I already know that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad, but knowing something is bad for you doesn\u2019t stop you from wanting it. Pursuing it. I was bad for Gracie, yet she wouldn\u2019t give up.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Will you stop comparing me to my mother, William?\u2019 I shake my head, not prepared to listen to the cold, hard truth any longer. \u2018I really should get home. Nan will be worrying.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then call her.\u2019 He nods to my bag. \u2018I\u2019m enjoying the company and we have dessert and coffee to order yet.\u2019</p><p>\u2018My phone\u2019s broken.\u2019 It\u2019s the perfect excuse to escape. I make to stand, collecting my satchel from the floor beside me. \u2018Thank you for dinner.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I sense no appreciation in your tone, Olivia. How am I supposed to get hold of you?\u2019</p><p>His question worries me. \u2018Why would you want to?\u2019</p><p>\u2018To ensure your safety.\u2019</p><p>\u2018From what?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Miller Hart.\u2019</p><p>I roll my eyes, forgetting, again, who I\u2019m dealing with. \u2018I\u2019ve survived just fine without your supervision, William. I think I\u2019m good.\u2019 I turn and walk away from him, praying it\u2019s the last I see of him. This dinner, although enlightening, has only brought back too much hurt which, on top of my already searing pain, might be the final nail in the coffin.</p><p>\u2018You won\u2019t survive with Miller Hart in your life, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>I skid to a stop on my Converse, his declaration freezing my veins. I dare not look at him for fear of what facial expression I might find. He\u2019s not in my life, I say to myself, hearing the movement of a chair and slow footsteps, but I keep my eyes forward until William has rounded me and is looking down at my pathetic form.</p><p>\u2018I know a woman captured by a man when I see one, Olivia. I saw it in your mother and I can see it in you.\u2019 He takes my dropped chin and lifts it. There\u2019s an element of knowing in his grey gaze. \u2018I can see you\u2019re hurt and angry, and those two emotions can make you do silly things. His business conduct is questionable at best. And you should know that he\u2019s in Madrid for a few days.\u2019 William flashes me a telling look, daring me to enquire further. I don\u2019t need to. He\u2019s with a client.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m a sensible girl,\u2019 I murmur meagrely. I can hear the uncertainty in my tone. I don\u2019t believe in my strength any more than William does, despite knowing everything he says is the cold, hard truth. He\u2019s right to be concerned. \u2018I can take care of myself.\u2019</p><p>He drops his lips to my forehead and sighs through his delicate kiss. \u2018You need more than words, Olivia.\u2019 William takes my satchel from my shoulder and starts to guide me from the restaurant. \u2018I\u2019ll take you home.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I want to walk,\u2019 I argue, breaking free of his hold.</p><p>\u2018Be sensible, Olivia. It\u2019s late and dark.\u2019 He reclaims me, tighter than before. \u2018Anyway, we\u2019ll stop by a store and replace your phone.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can buy my own phone,\u2019 I protest.</p><p>\u2018Maybe so, but I\u2019d like to buy you one as a gift.\u2019 He raises cautionary eyebrows and his grey eyes darken when I open my mouth to object. \u2018A gift that you will accept.\u2019</p> <p>I don\u2019t argue further. I just want to go home and try to process what William has and hasn\u2019t told me, so I let him lead me from the restaurant and put me in his car, not saying a word.</p><p>After stopping by a store and loading me up with the latest iPhone, William\u2019s driver drops me home, accepting my request to stop around the corner so Nan doesn\u2019t spot the strange car and me getting out of it.</p><p>\u2018Make sure you charge this up,\u2019 he orders, putting the lid back on the box. \u2018I have the number and I\u2019ve stored mine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018For what purpose?\u2019 I ask, pissed off at his intrusion in my life.</p><p>\u2018Simple peace of mind.\u2019 He hands me the box and nods to the door for me to get out. \u2018I would tell you to send Josephine my kindest regards, but I doubt it would be appreciated.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Without doubt.\u2019 I slide from the car and turn to shut the door. The window lowers and I bend to get William back into my field of vision. His grey eyes are shining, his big body reclined, putting emphasis on his torso. He\u2019s incredibly fit for a man in his mid-forties. \u2018She would probably take a baseball bat to your posh car.\u2019</p><p>He throws his head back on a laugh, making me smile a little. \u2018I can just picture it. I\u2019m sincerely glad she\u2019s back to her old ways.\u2019 He maintains his smile for a few moments before it slowly falls away, prompting mine to fall with it. \u2018Just remember one thing, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>I almost don\u2019t want to ask what, and I don\u2019t need to because he draws breath to go on, obviously seeing my hesitance. He\u2019s going to tell me, whether I want to hear or not.</p> <p>\u2018Your body instinctively knows danger. If you feel the hair on the back of your neck rise, a prickly sensation between your shoulder blades, or just overall bad vibes \u2013 you run.\u2019 The window starts closing and William\u2019s serious face disappears from sight, leaving me still bent on the pavement with the lingering effect of those cold words.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Nan slides the plate towards me and hands me a fork. The giant lump of cake makes my stomach turn, but I resist pushing it away and break a corner off while she watches. Nan\u2019s eyes are not the only set studying me so closely. Gregory has joined us for supper, along with George, and they are all quiet and watching me as I bring a small piece of cake to my lips. It tastes like rat poison, and it has nothing to do with my grandmother\u2019s baking skills. Everything tastes rancid, my taste buds probably punishing me for neglecting them.</p><p>\u2018Beautiful.\u2019 Gregory breaks the uncomfortable silence, performing a little finger-licking session. \u2018You should open a cake shop.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Pah!\u2019 Nan scoffs. \u2018Perhaps twenty years ago.\u2019 She laughs, turning to the sink and running the tap. I\u2019m thankful for the let-up of scrutiny.</p><p>George\u2019s chubby finger delves straight onto the side of the cake plate, scooping off some stray lemon drizzle, and as if Nan has sensed something untoward is going down, she swings around from the sink.</p><p>\u2018George!\u2019 She whips at him with her dishcloth. \u2018Where are your manners?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sorry, Josephine.\u2019 He sits up like a naughty schoolboy and places his hands in his lap, his face straight.</p><p>Gregory kicks me under the table, nodding at Nan, and I look to see her shaking her head at the old boy. We\u2019re both suppressing our laughs, and then George winks cheekily at us and we both lose the battle to restrain ourselves. We titter together, earning a reproachful look from Nan before she turns back to the sink, and another wink from George.</p><p>\u2018Are you ready to help Nan rock the ballroom, George?\u2019 I ask, reining in my chuckles before I get a thorough telling off. Old George is looking most dapper in a brown suit, although his mustard tie is questionable.</p><p>\u2018Josephine needs no help to rock anything,\u2019 he replies, looking over to my nan\u2019s back. \u2018She does a damn fine job of rocking, as you call it, all by herself.\u2019 Nan doesn\u2019t respond or turn around, but she\u2019s smiling down into the sink, I know she is.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s going to show you how to bump and grind,\u2019 I snigger, kicking Gregory under the table but quickly hauling my leg back when Nan swings around from the washing up, making her lovely dress swoosh like it most certainly will be on the dance floor later. She glares at me as she dries her hands on her apron, her grey eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u2018You look beautiful, Nan,\u2019 I say.</p><p>Her scornful face drops in an instant and she glances down on a smile. \u2018Thank you, sweetheart.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Whatever is bumping and grinding?\u2019 George asks, totally perplexed, looking to Nan. I\u2019m delighting in the faint blush that rises in her cheeks.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s dancing, George.\u2019 She flicks me a warning look, but it softens the moment she registers my mild grin. \u2018I\u2019ll teach you.\u2019</p><p>I nearly fall off my chair when mental images of George and Nan getting down and dirty spring into my mind.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s so funny?\u2019 George asks, throwing frowns around the kitchen. \u2018I knew that.\u2019 He huffs, plunging his finger back into the lemon cake in a strop. Nan doesn\u2019t scorn him this time. She\u2019s too busy howling across the kitchen.</p><p>\u2018I might wear my hot pants,\u2019 she giggles, sending Gregory and me delirious with laughter.</p><p>\u2018Oh, those little short thingies?\u2019 George\u2019s eyes sparkle. \u2018Yes, please!\u2019</p><p>\u2018George!\u2019 Nan shrieks.</p><p>\u2018Oh, please stop!\u2019 Gregory grabs me for support, falling all over the place, taking me with him. We\u2019re crying, shaking with hysterics. \u2018Will they be sparkly?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, leather.\u2019 She grins. \u2018And crotchless.\u2019</p><p>I choke on nothing, coughing all over the dinner table, and George looks like he\u2019s about to have a seizure. He gathers himself and picks up his newspaper, using it to fan his face. \u2018You have a wicked mind, Josephine Taylor.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She does,\u2019 Gregory chuckles, giving me a little wink.</p><p>Everyone pulls themselves together and I sigh, starting to poke at my cake again. Then I worry because I hear Nan draw breath \u2013 the long kind, the kind that means I\u2019m not going to like what she says. \u2018Why don\u2019t you let Gregory take you out?\u2019</p><p>I sink into my chair, feeling three sets of eyes all on me again. The misery returns, too.</p><p>\u2018Yeah, come on, Livy,\u2019 my friend interjects, giving me a light knock on my arm with his fist. \u2018We\u2019ll go to a straight bar.\u2019</p><p>\u2018See!\u2019 Nan chirps. \u2018How kind. He\u2019s even willing to sacrifice a night of passion for your benefit.\u2019</p><p>I gasp. Gregory laughs and George snorts. He loves Gregory, but he refuses to acknowledge his sexual preference. I think it\u2019s an age thing, not that it bothers Gregory. In fact, he plays on it too much, and when he takes a deep inhale of air, I know immediately that he\u2019s about to do just that.</p><p>\u2018Yes\u2019 \u2013 he leans back in his chair \u2013 \u2018I\u2019ll pass up the opportunity to roll around with a naked, sweaty man if it means you\u2019ll come out.\u2019</p><p>I bite my lip, stopping myself from laughing out loud at the awkward fidgeting coming from George\u2019s direction. Nan doesn\u2019t, though. No, she\u2019s in pieces, her body jiggling with laughter as George continues to shift and mutter under his breath.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re all wicked,\u2019 he grumbles. \u2018Wicked minds.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How very good of you, Gregory.\u2019 Nan titters. \u2018Now that\u2019s a good friend.\u2019</p><p>George\u2019s old face frowns at Gregory across the table. \u2018I thought you were bisexual.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh\u2019 \u2013 Gregory grins \u2013 \u2018I\u2019ll be whatever they want me to be, George.\u2019</p><p>Nan\u2019s companion fails to prevent his disgusted snort and Nan fails to prevent her continued amusement.</p><p>This is good. The diversion in conversation to Gregory\u2019s sexual antics has saved me from further pressure to go out and my struggle to appear fine. I study him for a few moments, watching his shoulders jump up and down as he continues to wind up poor George, and Nan eggs him on with hoots of glee. Their happy banter suddenly only seems to remind me that I\u2019m not happy and no amount of pretending or distraction will remedy it. Things can divert me momentarily, but it soon returns, seeming more painful when it does, like it\u2019s making up for its brief absence every time I break a smile.</p><p>My chews slow and so do my swallows. My turning stomach is fast, though, executing a spin that sends me dashing from the kitchen to the bathroom, where I retch over the toilet for no purpose at all. There\u2019s nothing to bring up except acidy bile, making the taste in my mouth even worse.</p><p>Hopeless.</p><p>The soft knock at the door forces me to lift my head and look blankly at the wood. \u2018Baby girl?\u2019 Gregory pushes the door open and slips in, not bothering to warn me first in case I\u2019m on the toilet. His handsome face tries to smile some ease into me but fails miserably. I know he feels as hopeless as I do. He pops a Polo mint past my lips and pulls me to my feet before brushing my hair from my face and scanning me worriedly.</p><p>\u2018Livy, you\u2019re wasting away.\u2019 His eyes drop to my skinnier-than-usual body. \u2018Come on.\u2019</p><p>Pulling me across the landing to my bedroom, he shuts the door softly behind us and guides me to the bed, tugging me down next to him and slipping his arm around me. I snuggle into his side but get no comfort from his embrace. This isn\u2019t the thing I had with Miller. This isn\u2019t warming me to the core or sending my mind into a blissful peace. There\u2019s no humming or gentle lips pushing into the top of my head now and then. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We lie for an age in silence until I feel Gregory\u2019s chest rise, drawing air, prepared to speak. \u2018Are you ready to give me the full story yet? You\u2019re not fine, and don\u2019t bother trying to fob me off with the \u201cother woman\u201d story because you kinda had your suspicions before. It didn\u2019t stop you then.\u2019</p><p>I shake my head no into his chest, but I\u2019m not sure whether I\u2019m declining his offer to explain or if I\u2019m telling him that no, it\u2019s not the supposed other woman. The former I don\u2019t need to confirm. It\u2019s glaringly obvious, but the latter isn\u2019t. I could never share the real reason why my life is over. And William? No, no, I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 he sighs above me, squeezing me tighter, but then his phone starts ringing and he eases up a little to dig through his pocket. I definitely don\u2019t imagine the increased speed of his heart rate under my ear. Pulling from his chest, I find him staring down at the screen, looking completely defeated. His expression reminds me that while I\u2019ve been wallowing in self-pity, my best friend has been suffering, too. I feel incredibly guilty, which, even more selfishly, feels so much better than my constant aching heart.</p><p>\u2018Are you going to answer it?\u2019 I ask quietly, while he continues to stare down at the screen. I\u2019m not sure why he looks so upset. Surely he should be happy that Ben is calling. Or am I missing something? Probably. I don\u2019t recall much from the past two weeks at all, but I distinctly remember he\u2019d spoken to Ben briefly and it wasn\u2019t good. Or did I imagine that?</p> <p>He lifts his eyes and smiles, but it\u2019s a sad smile. \u2018I guess I should. I\u2019ve been expecting it.\u2019</p><p>I frown a little as he connects the call, but he doesn\u2019t speak. He just holds the phone to his ear and it\u2019s mere seconds before I hear Ben\u2019s angry shouts, plain and clear. Gregory winces as his ex-lover hurls abuse down the line, ranting about calling and harassing him. I\u2019m stunned, even more so when Gregory apologises quietly. He\u2019s got nothing to be sorry about. He\u2019s not the one pretending to be someone he isn\u2019t. He\u2019s not hiding from the truth. Familiar anger bubbles but for a whole other reason, and in a moment centred on pure protective instinct, I snatch the phone from my friend\u2019s limp hand and let out two weeks\u2019 worth of fury. I\u2019m raging.</p><p>\u2018Who the hell do you think you are?\u2019 I shout, jumping up from the bed when Gregory tries to regain possession of his mobile. I pace doggedly around my bedroom, quaking with rage.</p><p>\u2018Who\u2019s this?\u2019 Ben\u2019s voice has quieted. He sounds shocked.</p><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter who it is. You\u2019re nothing more than a fraud! You\u2019re a spineless coward!\u2019</p> <p>Ben is now silent but breathing heavily as I continue to attack him. \u2018You deserve to be miserable! I hope you wallow in misery for the rest of your life, you pathetic, gutless arse!\u2019 I\u2019m hyperventilating, physically shaking. \u2018You don\u2019t deserve the affection or time Gregory has given you, and you\u2019ll soon realise that. And by then it\u2019ll be too late! He\u2019ll be over you!\u2019 I smash the disconnect button and throw Gregory\u2019s phone on the bed, while my friend looks at me in shock, his eyes wide, his mouth agape.</p><p>Trying to cool my boiling blood and rein in my quaking body, I watch in silence as Gregory attempts to spit some words out. He\u2019s stuttering, totally stunned, a bit like me. It wasn\u2019t my place to do that. I had no right to interfere, especially as I\u2019ve chastised my friend when he\u2019s tried to step in on my diabolical relationship with a certain man disguised as a gentleman.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 I pant, failing to stabilise my erratic breathing. \u2018I didn\u2019t\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sassy,\u2019 he says simply, and once again I fall apart, my anger making way for my depression to return full force. My chin drops to my chest, my arms hang limply by my sides, and I sob uncontrollably, my pathetic form now shaking for different reasons. I feel no better after my tirade.</p><p>Hearing a heavy sigh of frustration emanate from the bed, I\u2019m pulled down to Gregory\u2019s chest and wrapped in his arms. \u2018Shhhh,\u2019 he soothes, rocking me back and forth, stroking my hair. \u2018I get the feeling those words weren\u2019t meant for Ben.\u2019</p><p>I nod and he tightens his squeeze. They were appropriate for Ben, but I wish I were delivering them to another man. And I also wish I could reap what I sow.</p> <p>\u2018What a pair we are.\u2019 He sighs. \u2018How did we get ourselves in this mess?\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t know, so I shake my head, sobbing and snivelling uncontrollably.</p><p>\u2018Hey.\u2019 He pulls me out of my hiding place and holds my face gently as he gazes down at me, sympathy gushing from his eyes. \u2018What are we going to do with each other, baby girl?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I choke out, letting Gregory stroke the trail of tears away from my wet cheek. \u2018I feel hopeless.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Me too,\u2019 he agrees softly as our eyes hold each other. \u2018Me too.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s an unexpected shift in the atmosphere, the two friends comforting each other suddenly looking longingly into each other\u2019s eyes, misery and desolation seeming to make way for something else.</p><p>Something strange.</p><p>Something forbidden.</p> <p>I\u2019m confused by it, and when my friend\u2019s lips part, his eyes flicking down to my mouth and his face coming slowly closer, my head starts spinning wildly. There are plenty of reasons to halt what is about to happen, but I can\u2019t think of them at the moment. I can\u2019t think of anything, except that this could be exactly what I need.</p><p>I start inching closer, too, until our lips meet and my heart starts thudding in my chest. The unusual feeling of my best friend\u2019s lips on mine doesn\u2019t deter me. I shift my position, throwing my leg over Gregory\u2019s reclined body and settling myself across his hips, keeping our mouths joined, letting our tongues dance madly. The sensation of his hands running all over my back and his mouth pressed hard to mine brings me a strange comfort, even if it\u2019s alien and not what I\u2019m used to. It doesn\u2019t matter. I need different.</p><p>\u2018Livy.\u2019 He breaks our kiss, panting in my face. \u2018We shouldn\u2019t. This is wrong.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t let him try to talk us out of this. I smash my lips back on his and start working him desperately, feeling his strong arms and smoothing down his tight muscles. He groans, the evidence of his hardness beneath me pushing me on.</p><p>\u2018Livy,\u2019 he argues weakly, making no attempt to push me off.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ll help each other,\u2019 I gasp, pulling at the hem of his T-shirt. He doesn\u2019t stop me. He shifts, making my task easier, and is soon rid of it, leaving his chest exposed to my roaming hands. It\u2019s not long before I feel my top being pulled off, and I release his lips to sit up, letting my best friend in the whole world strip me. With a lack of a bra covering my modest br**sts, I\u2019m left in just my small pyjama shorts with Gregory\u2019s eyes focused on my tight ni**les that are within licking distance.</p><p>\u2018Oh f**king hell,\u2019 he mumbles, looking up at me as I wheeze in his face. \u2018Oh f**king, f**king hell.\u2019 He takes the tops of my arms and pushes me to my back, taking my mouth again urgently as he pushes my shorts and knickers down my legs. He\u2019s hard and wedged up against my thigh, pulsing incessantly, and I find myself fumbling at the fly of his jeans. He helps me, lifting his h*ps slightly so I can rid him of the denim, until we\u2019re both naked, rubbing up against each other, rolling around the bed, kissing and feeling.</p><p>\u2018Fucking hell,\u2019 he curses again, working his mouth across my cheek while I pant up at the ceiling. \u2018We should stop.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I breathe.</p><p>\u2018We shouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u2019 He makes no attempt to halt, finding my mouth again and plunging his tongue in urgently. We\u2019re matching each other in the frenzied stakes. Hands and lips are everywhere as we explore unknown territory. We\u2019re both consumed with desperation to eradicate our woes, neither one of us seeming prepared to stop this. We should halt it. This won\u2019t help.</p><p>\u2018Oh God!\u2019 I yelp, throwing my head back when Gregory cups my breast. I\u2019m squirming beneath him, my whole being tingling with fevered shots of desperate pleasure. Our mouths quickly find each other again and my hand starts venturing downward until I have his hard, hot length in my grasp.</p><p>\u2018Holy shit!\u2019 he barks, his h*ps bucking forward, prompting a full stroke down his shaft. \u2018Oooooh shit.\u2019</p><p>Pleasure-filled noises are drowning the room. We\u2019re lost. Gregory pulls back and gazes down at me, his brow shimmering in sweat, his breath spreading across my heated face.</p><p>\u2018Do that again,\u2019 he breathes, pushing his h*ps forward.</p><p>I pull an even swipe of my palm down his hardness and he draws an uneven breath. His head drops briefly, only for a second, before he lifts again and falls back to my lips, swirling his tongue through my mouth. It shouldn\u2019t, but this feels nice. I\u2019m focused only on my best friend kissing me, his hands feeling me, and his body pushed against mine.</p><p>\u2018You taste like strawberries,\u2019 he whispers hoarsely.</p><p>Strawberries.</p><p>The word hits me like a sledgehammer, and I\u2019m suddenly dropping him from my grasp and wriggling beneath him. \u2018Greg, stop!\u2019</p><p>He freezes, pulling back to look down at me. \u2018Are you okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No! We should stop.\u2019 I scramble up and pull the sheets over me, covering my na**d body, feeling ashamed . . . guilty. \u2018What are we thinking?\u2019</p><p>Gregory sits up and rubs his palms frantically over his face, groaning, but now it\u2019s in regret. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 he admits. \u2018I wasn\u2019t thinking, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Me neither.\u2019 I meet his eyes, pulling the protective sheeting closer, while Gregory remains uncovered and quite unbothered by it. He\u2019s still . . . ready . . . and I try to divert my eyes anywhere except at the hard length of muscle jutting from his lap. It\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s like a magnet to my eyes. I\u2019ve never allowed myself to look at my g*y friend like this, but when he\u2019s totally exposed and looking so ripped, it\u2019s impossible. He\u2019s everything a man could ask for, and a woman, for that matter. He\u2019s hot, so kind, and totally genuine. But he\u2019s my best friend. I can\u2019t lose him to the awkwardness that will descend if we continue \u2013 if it\u2019s not too late already. But that isn\u2019t the only reason. No man could ever fill the gaping hole in my heart, nor could they sate my desire. Only one man can do that.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 I say quietly, guilt consuming me. I don\u2019t know why. I have nothing to feel remorseful for, except for jeopardising my friendship with Gregory. \u2018I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hey\u2019 \u2013 he pulls me onto his lap and squeezes me \u2013 \u2018I\u2019m sorry, too. I think we both got a little carried away.\u2019</p><p>I snuggle deep, searching for the comfort I need. It\u2019s nowhere to be found. \u2018It was my fault.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, I instigated that. It\u2019s my fault.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ,\u2019 I whisper, letting him attempt to rub some life back into me.</p><p>The rise and fall of his chest under me indicates his heavy sigh. \u2018What a pair,\u2019 he muses. \u2018A couple of sad-arse losers pining after something we can\u2019t have.\u2019</p><p>I nod my agreement. \u2018You won\u2019t go off and screw another woman, will you?\u2019 I ask, knowing it\u2019s what generally happens when he\u2019s dumped by a bloke and probably why things went too far just now. \u2018I don\u2019t want you to do that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m swearing off men and women for a while.\u2019 He chuckles, making me smile a little.</p><p>\u2018Me too.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So you\u2019re basically returning to reclusive, then?\u2019 he quips lightly.</p><p>\u2018Look where being the alternative has got me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not all men are like that cocksucker.\u2019 He pulls me from his chest and clenches my cheeks fiercely. \u2018Not every man will shit all over you, baby girl.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I\u2019m not going to give them the chance.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I hate seeing you like this.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I hate seeing you like this,\u2019 I counter, his anguish suddenly very obvious and real, now that the information has filtered through my fuzz of misery. \u2018And I\u2019m stealing \u201ccocksucker\u201d to use for Ben, because he really is a cocksucker, even if he won\u2019t admit it.\u2019</p><p>Gregory smiles, his eyes twinkling. \u2018That\u2019s fine by me.\u2019</p> <p>I nod my approval and let my eyes wander down to Gregory\u2019s lap. He starts laughing and quickly snatches the sheet to cover himself, leaving me stark naked. I gasp and yank it back, and so a wrestling match with the sheets begins. We\u2019re both laughing, pulling back and forth, our earlier ease as friends fully restored . . . even if we\u2019re now both naked. Not that either of us seem bothered as we battle for possession of the sheets.</p><p>But we both freeze when the sound of creaking floorboards muscles in on the happy laughter, and then Nan\u2019s curious voice creeps through the door. \u2018Gregory, Olivia? What\u2019s going on in there?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh shit!\u2019 I blurt, jumping up from the bed and sprinting across the room. I flatten my na**d front against the door. \u2018Nothing, Nan!\u2019</p><p>\u2018It sounds like a herd of elephants are doing the cancan up here.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re fine!\u2019 I squeak, my forehead hitting the door, my eyes clenching shut as I tense and brace myself for a counter-attack.</p> <p>\u2018Well, you sound like you\u2019re coming through the ceiling!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sorry. We\u2019re on our way down.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re off to the dance now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Have a nice time!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you okay?\u2019 she asks more softly.</p><p>I smile a little. \u2018I\u2019m fine, Nan.\u2019</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t say any more, and then I hear the creaking floorboards, telling me she\u2019s on her way back downstairs. I turn around, my back pushed up against the door, and find Gregory\u2019s eyes making continuous up and down motions as he sits on the bed with the sheets concealing him.</p><p>\u2018Good view.\u2019 He grins, reminding me that I\u2019m still nude. \u2018But you\u2019re far too skinny.\u2019</p><p>I make a vain attempt to cover my modesty, making Gregory fall back on the bed in laughter. He\u2019s helpless, while I\u2019m blushing furiously. \u2018Stop it!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry!\u2019 he chuckles. \u2018Really sorry.\u2019</p><p>My colour increases as I scan my room for the nearest thing to save my dignity, settling on a T-shirt draped over the back of my chair in the corner. I dart over and make quick work of throwing it on, feeling better instantly, like I\u2019ve regained some self-respect after throwing myself at my best friend. Gregory isn\u2019t so concerned by his state of undress, though, and is currently rolling around laughing, tangled among the blankets of my bed. It makes me smile more, my head cocking in admiration, musing at his tight backside, but more at his hysterical, carefree state.</p><p>\u2018Come on,\u2019 he says, pushing himself up and patting the mattress next to him. \u2018I won\u2019t grope you, promise.\u2019</p><p>I roll my eyes and join him on the bed, resting my back against the headboard next to him. I fiddle with my ring, wondering what on earth to say. I really don\u2019t know, so I say the only thing that I should \u2013 the only thing I\u2019m concerned about. \u2018This won\u2019t change things, will it?\u2019 I ask. \u2018I can\u2019t be without you, Greg. I don\u2019t want what happened to change us.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aaah, baby girl.\u2019 He drapes his arm around my shoulders and cuddles me close. \u2018Never, because we won\u2019t let it. I guess that twenty per cent got the better of me.\u2019</p> <p>I smile. \u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, thank you,\u2019 he sighs. \u2018Let\u2019s make a pact.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A pact.\u2019 I frown. \u2018What kind of pact?\u2019 I\u2019m suddenly concerned that Gregory is about to propose an arrangement that says we marry each other if we haven\u2019t found our soulmate by the time we\u2019re thirty.</p><p>\u2018We stay strong,\u2019 he whispers, \u2018for each other.\u2019</p><p>I look up and see a face pleading with me to help him.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m struggling, too, Livy.\u2019</p><p>I feel terrible. \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 I\u2019ve been so consumed in my own misery, I\u2019ve not stopped to truly consider my best friend\u2019s turmoil, not seen the extent of his own unhappiness. I\u2019ve been blindsided by my own pitiful state. \u2018I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We can do it together,\u2019 he continues. \u2018I\u2019ll help you and you can help me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Does that mean confiscating your phone?\u2019 I tease.</p><p>\u2018No, but it does mean you can delete his number.\u2019 He grabs his mobile and shoves it in my hand. \u2018Go on.\u2019</p><p>I scroll through his contact list, deleting Ben\u2019s number before going to his text messages \u2013 sent and received \u2013 and deleting any traces of Ben from there, too. Happy I\u2019ve extinguished him from Gregory\u2019s mobile altogether, and hopefully his life, too, I hand it back and watch as my friend raises expectant eyebrows at me. He wants to return the favour.</p><p>\u2018I told you, my phone\u2019s broken.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And you\u2019ve not replaced it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I reply, sounding rather proud and feeling it as well. I won\u2019t be charging the phone William bought me, or any other phone, in fact. Unobtainable. Anyway, I want Gregory to be able to delete Miller Hart from my brain, not just any phone I might be using.</p><p>\u2018So we\u2019re both free of cocksuckers.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cocksucker is reserved for\u2019 \u2013 I pause for a moment \u2013 \u2018you know who.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve cleared that up.\u2019 I wince immediately, and Gregory frowns, clearly wondering what the problem is. I shake my head and settle back into his side, feeling a little better, despite the strangeness of the past half-hour and despite familiar words falling from both of our mouths without thought or awareness.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Gregory and I aren\u2019t doing a very good job of helping each other through our turmoil. The next evening, and in an attempt to move on with our lives, we\u2019ve had a quiet Italian meal together, which was lovely, but the wine has taken hold and we\u2019re now falling towards the doors of Ice, both giggling, both staggering a little. My drunken mind has become vengeful and is stamping all over the fact that Miller is away and he will likely watch all of the CCTV footage from the club when he returns. And I\u2019m going to give him something interesting to view.</p><p>\u2018How do you know he\u2019s away?\u2019 Gregory asks, taking us to the back of the line, since this time we lack an invite or our names on the guest list.</p><p>\u2018Text before my phone broke.\u2019 I can\u2019t tell him about William.</p><p>\u2018How did it break?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dropped it.\u2019 I distract Gregory from the reason for the premature demise of my mobile phone by flashing my membership card to Ice.</p><p>He grins and takes it from my hand, giving it a quick inspection. \u2018Not much to it, is there?\u2019</p><p>I shrug and snatch it back as we near the front. I get a look from the doorman, but he doesn\u2019t refuse me entry when I flash my card. He does, however, call Tony to notify him of my arrival. But I\u2019m feeling brash and brave, probably assisted by the three glasses of wine that I drank throughout dinner. Neither one of us is guilty of forcing the other to Miller\u2019s club. We just ended up here after I mentioned my membership card and free entry, and neither of us protested \u2013 me, because I\u2019m feeling cruel and this is the only way I know how to hurt him, and Gregory because I know he\u2019s silently hoping Ben will be here tonight. How long will we continue to torment ourselves?</p><p>Calvin Harris\u2019s \u2018Feel So Close\u2019 greets us as we enter and we find our way to the bar, ordering champagne automatically once we\u2019re there, which is daft. What are we celebrating? Being complete idiots? I ignore the strawberry in my flute and sip while gazing around the bar, expecting Tony to appear from somewhere, but after a few minutes of scanning the club, no Tony.</p><p>Gregory doesn\u2019t tell me to take it easy, probably because he\u2019s hell-bent on dulling down his own hurt with alcohol. This is a dangerous position for us both to be in, for the combination of alcohol and our determination to heal our broken hearts is sure to land us in trouble. I can see cameras everywhere. I can also see men watching me, my eyes like a hawk\u2019s trying to attract the attention that I\u2019m usually so uncomfortable receiving. I take a deep breath, push all thoughts of disgrace to the very back of my mind, and lose myself in the crowd of London\u2019s elite. I shy away from nothing. I accept drinks, I talk with confidence, and I let men rest their hands on my waist or lower back when they get close to talk over the loud music. My cheek is kissed by countless men, and Gregory, although watchful and a little wary, smiles each time.</p><p>He moves in when I step away from a tall preppy-type. \u2018You look comfortable. What\u2019s changed?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miller Hart,\u2019 I say nonchalantly before finishing off my champagne. Gregory hands me another and we make the most of our time alone, taking a few moments to drink in our surroundings. Heads are thrown back in laughter and continental-style kisses are exchanged everywhere. In reality, Gregory and I really don\u2019t fit in among these social elitists.</p><p>But Ben does.</p><p>And he\u2019s here.</p><p>I know what I should be doing. I should be dragging Gregory away, but just as I convince my alcohol-drenched brain to do exactly that, Ben spots us and starts making his way over.</p><p>Shit, I curse to myself, weighing up my options. My drunken mind isn\u2019t allowing me to think quickly enough, so before I can haul my friend away, Ben is standing in front of us and Gregory is shifting awkwardly on the spot. I still feel mad, especially when Ben glances at me with high eyebrows. I gather breath to hit him with another torrent of abuse, but he beats me to it and launches into an apology speech. My mouth snaps shut as I flick my eyes from Ben to Greg, back and forth, wondering how this is going to play out.</p><p>\u2018I was a total dick,\u2019 Ben begins quietly, just loud enough for us to hear over the music. He\u2019s still in the closet. \u2018I don\u2019t want anyone to know before I\u2019m ready to . . . share.\u2019</p><p>\u2018When might that be?\u2019 Gregory snaps, shocking me. I was certain he\u2019d turn to mush all over the dopey-eyed Ben. I\u2019m pleasantly surprised.</p><p>Ben shrugs sheepishly and drops his eyes to the glass of champagne in his grasp. \u2018I need to prepare myself, Greg. This is a huge deal.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re making it a bigger deal by pretending and dragging it out.\u2019 Gregory takes my elbow. \u2018We\u2019re done here,\u2019 he says, pulling me towards the dance floor. I let him take me, and I peer over my shoulder as I\u2019m escorted away, seeing Ben standing lonely and looking a little lost, until an over-the-top woman approaches, throwing her arms over him, and he switches straight back to smiley, people-pleaser Ben. Any ounce of sympathy I had for him diminishes instantly.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m proud of you,\u2019 I say as we arrive on the dance floor and get a little taster of Jean Jacques Smoothie.</p><p>He grins and discards our glasses before taking me in his hold and twirling me out on a spin. \u2018I\u2019m proud of me, too. Let\u2019s dance, baby girl.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t argue, but as I\u2019m twirled around the floor, I\u2019m mindful that Gregory\u2019s massive smile and forced carefree appearance is for the benefit of Ben, who\u2019s standing at the edge of the floor talking to a different woman but doing a terrible job of engaging, his eyes nailed to my friend. This is good, as long as Gregory continues to hold his own and doesn\u2019t let Ben muscle his way back into his life.</p><p>I fulfil my role perfectly, laughing along with Gregory and letting him swing me about and grind into my waist seductively, but then the music cuts abruptly before the track ends, not even mixing into another. Everyone halts dancing, looking around a little bemused. The only sounds now are of confused chatter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Is it a power cut?\u2019 I ask, but quickly realise the stupidity of my question when I register all of the blue lights still glowing at every turn.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not sure,\u2019 Gregory replies, confused. \u2018Maybe the fire alarm will kick in.\u2019</p><p>I gaze around the club, seeing motionless forms everywhere, all looking confused by the sudden quiet. Even the doormen have entered from outside to find out what\u2019s happening, and when I cast my eyes over to the DJ, I see him shrug at the security guy next to him, who\u2019s obviously asking what\u2019s going on.</p><p>Unease sets in, strangeness settles in my gut, and the hairs at the back of my neck rise.

I\u2019m not sure.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 Gregory shrugs, not in the least bit concerned.</p><p>But then the club is suddenly filled with music again, and everyone seems to sag around me, including Gregory, who starts laughing. \u2018I think the DJ might be getting sacked.\u2019 He turns to me, his smile dropping when he registers my blank face and static form. I can\u2019t move. \u2018Livy, what\u2019s up?\u2019</p><p>The words to the track soak through the haze of alcohol, punching me in the stomach . . . hard. \u2018Enjoy the Silence\u2019. My eyes close.</p><p>\u2018Livy?\u2019 Gregory shakes me a little, prompting my eyes to fly open and shoot around the club. \u2018Olivia?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 I force a smile, trying to appear fine, but my heart is crashing against my breastbone, set on fighting its way from my chest. He\u2019s here. \u2018I need the toilet.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll come.\u2019 He starts leading me off the floor.</p><p>\u2018No, honestly. Get the drinks. I\u2019ll meet you at the bar.\u2019</p><p>Gregory relents easily, letting me find my way to the toilets alone while he orders more drinks. But I don\u2019t head for the ladies\u2019. I divert once I\u2019m out of Gregory\u2019s sight and hurry towards the front of the club, taking the stairs fast, down to the maze of corridors beneath Ice. William told me to run, but I doubt he wanted me moving towards the danger. I\u2019m a woman possessed as I follow the passageway, taking too many wrong turns and shouting my frustration when I land in front of a storeroom. I can still hear the music \u2013 the words distressing me, reminding me, as I rush back the way I came and try a different route. The sight of the metal keypad outside Miller\u2019s office fills me with relief and dread all at once as I charge for it. I have no clue what the code is or what I\u2019ll find . . . or what I\u2019ll do if I find anything \u2013 if I find him.</p><p>I don\u2019t need the code. The door is ajar and one tiny push swings it open.</p><p>Internal fireworks explode.</p> <p>He\u2019s standing in the middle of the room, suit adorned and expressionless, just watching me as I hover on the threshold of his office. My eyes instantly fill with tears as I breathe erratically and watch him watching me. My knees feel weak. The music is relentless. I drink him in, his dark suit pristine, his hair seeming longer, the soft waves flicking out from below his earlobes. There are no words, just intense eye contact. There\u2019s no facial expression or body language to tell me what he\u2019s thinking. He doesn\u2019t need to tell me what he\u2019s thinking, though. His eyes are doing that. And they\u2019re angry. He\u2019s been watching the club\u2019s CCTV footage. He\u2019s been watching me being hit on by countless men. I take a worried pull of breath. He\u2019s been watching me encourage and accept it.</p><p>\u2018Did you let any of them taste you?\u2019 He steps forward, and I instinctively step back, wary.</p><p>This isn\u2019t going to be a happy reunion. He has a nerve to ask such a question after he\u2019s been in another country with another woman. My shock from his presence is turning into irritation fast. \u2018That\u2019s none of your business.\u2019 He\u2019s jealous again, and this gives me an unreasonable thrill.</p><p>His perfect jaw is ticking. \u2018When you\u2019re in my club, it\u2019s my business.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019ll never be your business again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wrong.\u2019</p><p>I shake my head as I step back further, hating my uncooperative body for staggering slightly. \u2018I\u2019m right.\u2019</p><p>He runs displeased eyes up and down my tight, short-dressed form. \u2018You\u2019re drunk.\u2019</p> <p>I ignore his accusation, remembering something. \u2018Which means you can\u2019t f**k me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shut up, Olivia!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because you want me to remember every kiss, every touch, every\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Livy!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Except I don\u2019t want to remember every moment. I want to forget them all.\u2019</p><p>His neck veins bulge to bursting point. \u2018Don\u2019t say things you don\u2019t mean.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I mean it!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shut up!\u2019 he roars, sending me back a few more paces, his ferocity stunning me into silence. I gather myself fast, but my wide eyes are undoubtedly displaying all of the shock I\u2019m feeling. Shock that I came here, shock that he\u2019s here, shock that he\u2019s so fuming mad. He has no right to be, despite my provoking him. I knew what I was doing. And he knows that, too.</p><p>\u2018You told Tony to let me in if I came, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 It\u2019s suddenly very clear. He anticipated this. \u2018You told Tony to monitor me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I have over two hundred cameras in this club to do that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How dare you!\u2019 I spit, feeling my blood heat with rage, rather than the usual desire when I\u2019m within touching distance of Miller Hart. I thought my presence would shock him, but no. He fully expected it.</p><p>He steps forward again, but I keep my distance. I\u2019m now in the corridor, not that it deters him. His long strides have him in front of me in seconds, his hand taking my nape and guiding me to his desk determinedly. I\u2019m pushed down into his office chair, where I\u2019m confronted with image after image of me in his club \u2013 all with men hovering around me. While I\u2019m ashamed of myself, I\u2019m also quietly delighted. The whole point was to torture him the only way I know how. And it looks like I\u2019ve succeeded. The apparently emotionless man is furious. Good. I just didn\u2019t expect to be around when he watched the footage.</p><p>\u2018There are five dead men on these screens,\u2019 he seethes, leaning down next to me, smashing a button on his remote control. The images all change, but they\u2019re all still me . . . and men. \u2018There are six on these ones.\u2019 He proceeds to flick through the footage, adding up the men he\u2019s going to be slaughtering. \u2018Does that make you happy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018They never tasted me,\u2019 I say quietly.</p><p>\u2018They want to! And you\u2019re doing nothing to discourage it!\u2019 he yells next to me, making me jump in his chair. I can feel the fury pouring from him. He\u2019s right. His temper isn\u2019t something I want to toy with. \u2018Where\u2019s your f**king self-respect?\u2019</p><p>Those words ricochet around my head like a bullet. \u2018My self-respect?\u2019 I shout, flying up from the chair, letting my bag tumble to the floor and my fear of his temper tumble away. I feel pretty lethal myself right now. \u2018My self-respect?\u2019 My palms collide viciously with his chest, sending his tall frame staggering back. My strength shocks me. \u2018My f**king self-respect!\u2019</p><p>His eyes have widened slightly at my tiny fuming body and foul mouth.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re a joke!\u2019 I shout in his face, resisting the urge to lash his cheek with my palm. But I do smack him in the chest again. This time my wrists are seized and I\u2019m swung around, my back crashing to his body and my arms secured tightly. His mouth is at my ear, breathing hot, angry bursts of air. I hate the desire ripping through my anger. I hate it.</p><p>\u2018The joke isn\u2019t on me, Olivia Taylor.\u2019 He pushes his lips to my cheek and then bites down, leaving me whimpering in desperation. \u2018The joke is on you. You\u2019re the one fighting a battle you cannot win, sweet girl.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m stronger than you give me credit for,\u2019 I breathe, clenching my eyes shut, knowing my words carry no strength whatsoever.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m banking on it.\u2019 His teeth clamp down on my earlobe, sending my backside shooting back and colliding with his groin. I cry out. He growls. \u2018I need you to be strong for me.\u2019 I\u2019m spun around and grabbed behind the thighs, then yanked up to straddle his lean h*ps with one easy pull. He thrusts me up against his office door, one of his hands keeping me secured by the back of my thigh, the other slamming into the wood by my head. I don\u2019t even flinch. Nothing will power through the lust attacking every fibre of my being.</p><p>His blue eyes search mine for a few moments, taking in every detail of my face, before he crashes our mouths together on a yell. I accept his violent kiss. My hands are a knotted jumble in his mess of waves, my body arching into him as he pushes me up the door on continuous moans and muffled words. While the contact is in one sense soothing me, in another it\u2019s frightening me, bringing back too many bad memories of our hotel encounter. I start to wriggle beneath him, pulling at his suit jacket, but he mistakes my actions for equal impatience and fights free of his jacket, not breaking our fused lips.</p><p>\u2018Miller.\u2019 I turn my face, yet he manages to find my lips again within a nanosecond. Things are getting out of hand and panic\u2019s beginning to flood me. \u2018Miller!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You taste so f**king good.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miller, please!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fuck!\u2019 he barks, finding the strength he needs to release me, letting me slide down the door before he steps away and wipes his brow with his cuff. He looks dazed. We\u2019re both panting and sweating.</p><p>\u2018This isn\u2019t happening.\u2019 I run and snatch my bag from the floor, then hurry to the door, thinking I need to calm down before I find Gregory.</p><p>\u2018Olivia!\u2019</p><p>I swing around, finding him wrestling his jacket on. \u2018No!\u2019 I scream. \u2018This is it, Miller!\u2019 He didn\u2019t just worship me. If I let this go further, there will be no worshipping. There will be only f**king. He\u2019s been fighting his instincts all this time, and now he\u2019s exhausted, desperate. I take my membership card for Ice from my bag and throw it at him, and then watch as he follows its journey to the floor at his feet. \u2018I said you\u2019d never get to taste me again, and I meant it!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I just tasted you, and I want more. I want more hours. A lot f**king more.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re ruining my life!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You merely existed before.\u2019 His words are arrogant but his tone soft. \u2018I brought you back to life, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, for another man to taste.\u2019 I get no thrill from the look of horror on his face \u2013 none at all. There will be no other man. I\u2019m returning full force to solitary confinement because what I\u2019m feeling right now is total devastation. Empty. Lifeless. No man can fix me, not even Miller.</p><p>\u2018Take that back now.\u2019 He points a warning finger at me. \u2018Take it back!\u2019</p><p>I remain silent, watching his body heave before me.</p><p>\u2018I know I\u2019m a f**k-up, Olivia!\u2019 His breathing slows, his arm lowering to his side as he takes a moment to compose himself, pulling gently at his shirt, as if he can smooth his temper the same way he smooths his clothes. \u2018I\u2019m on my way to hell.\u2019</p><p>My bottom lip starts to quiver as I watch his crystal-clear eyes freeze over, a coldness settling around his office that slows my heart.</p><p>He steps forward. \u2018There\u2019s only one person who can drag me back.\u2019</p><p>I choke on a sob but he\u2019s expressionless now. I\u2019m getting nothing, except those chilly eyes. I don\u2019t like it. Is he asking me for help? The OCD, the freakish manners and uptight attitude. The women, the debasement, the nasty f**king and belts and rules . . .</p><p>No, I can\u2019t see past it all.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not strong enough to help you,\u2019 I murmur. William\u2019s words are spinning in my head, making me dizzy. Miller really is ruined. \u2018You\u2019re too damaged.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I run.</p><p>My legs work fast, carrying me away from my distress and a man who I don\u2019t think can be helped at all. By anyone. I navigate the corridors well, my terror fuelling my determination to escape, until I break free of the underground labyrinth of Miller\u2019s club. I\u2019m torn when the exit comes into sight, my head snapping back and forth between that and the openness of the club where Gregory is waiting for me.</p><p>I need to find him. I tear through the crowds, bumping and pushing into bewildered revellers, who curse or shout when I send drinks flying and knock bodies back.</p><p>I spot Gregory. \u2018Where have you been?\u2019 he asks as I come to an abrupt halt in front of him, his confused eyes taking in my pale, sweaty face. Handing me a glass cautiously, his concern soon morphs into anger and the drink is withdrawn, his eyes diverting over my shoulders.</p> <p>\u2018I need to leave,\u2019 I wheeze, grabbing his hand. \u2018Please, I need to go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s he doing here?\u2019 He discards my drink on the bar and starts pulling me away, making sure he knocks into Miller as we pass, but I\u2019m soon captured by the wrist and yanked away from Gregory. \u2018Get your f**king hands off her,\u2019 Gregory growls, his body starting to shake. \u2018Now!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll ask you to do the same thing,\u2019 Miller retorts on a menacing whisper, tugging at my arm. \u2018We\u2019re not done.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, we are.\u2019 I wrench myself free and push Gregory onward, knowing Miller won\u2019t give in. Ben approaches, looking concerned, but soon backs off, a cautious look on his face when he clocks Miller following behind. And then there\u2019s Tony, who tries to intercept Miller and gets practically thrown to the side for his trouble.</p><p>\u2018Miller, son, this isn\u2019t the time or place,\u2019 Tony seethes, looking nervously around the club.</p> <p>\u2018Fuck you!\u2019 Miller spits.</p><p>All I can hear is shouting. Miller is cursing. Tony is cursing. Gregory is cursing. Anger is drenching the happy club atmosphere around me, making my determination to escape stronger.</p><p>The doorman gives us a wide berth as we throw ourselves out of the club, his eyes widening when he sees who\u2019s coming after us. \u2018Don\u2019t let her leave!\u2019 Miller roars, prompting the doorman to make chase. He catches me and tosses me up onto his big shoulder, but I\u2019m too stunned to voice my shock, still hearing men swearing.</p><p>Explicit language is being fired everywhere, my view of events surrounding me is hampered, leaving me wriggling to free myself from the severe grip of the doorman.</p><p>\u2018Give her to me!\u2019 Miller\u2019s voice is dripping with threat, and I feel hands at my waist trying to pull me down.</p><p>\u2018Dave, put her down!\u2019 Tony yells.</p> <p>\u2018I will if you all give me some f**king space!\u2019 the doorman bellows, taking me away from the grappling of hands, over to the other side of the road. He lowers me to my feet and gives me the once-over. \u2018Are you okay, darling?\u2019</p><p>I half-heartedly pull my dress back into place, feeling disorientated and exposed. \u2018Sure,\u2019 I murmur, but then I\u2019m seized by the waist again in a fierce clinch. Internal lightning bolts strike me hard, and as I look up, I see Gregory a few yards away. Miller has me, and the fear of his touch sends me into a deranged mess of flailing body parts. \u2018Let go of me!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Never!\u2019</p><p>Gregory\u2019s at my side in an instant. I\u2019m being yanked from one direction to the other, both men yelling, both men persistent. This is becoming a battle of the egos now.</p><p>\u2018Both of you stop!\u2019 I scream, my shriek having no effect whatsoever, my body still flying from one man to the other, until Miller curls an arm around my waist and hauls me up to his chest. My face is level with his, and the first thing I notice is the lethal danger in his eyes as he focuses past me. There\u2019s no sight of the deep twinkle that always hypnotised me. This is another man. Not the man disguised as a gentleman or the loving, worshipping Miller. This is someone else.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll f**king kill you!\u2019 Miller bellows, earning a right hook to his jaw from Gregory, the fist skimming my cheek to find its target. He staggers back, and Gregory takes Miller\u2019s momentary daze as an opportunity to reclaim me, pulling me from his hold. But he doesn\u2019t hold tight enough, and I fall to the ground in a heap of limp muscle, smacking my head on the kerb as I land.</p><p>\u2018Shit!\u2019 Pain sears through me, making me a little dizzy and even more disorientated. I glance up to see Miller tackle Gregory to the pavement, both men rolling around like animals, fists flying, curses piercing the night air, until Tony and Dave intervene and drag them apart.</p><p>And the whole time, I\u2019m crumpled on the ground in a pathetic mess, my head pouring blood, my eyes pouring tears. Both men are so consumed by the determination to win, they\u2019ve lost sight of what they\u2019re fighting for. Now I\u2019m injured, blood\u2019s gushing down my face, and I\u2019ve still not been noticed as they wrestle in the holds of Tony and Dave.</p> <p>\u2018Stay away from her,\u2019 Gregory snarls at Miller, letting up on his persistent struggle against Tony.</p><p>\u2018Only when I\u2019m f**king dead!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then I\u2019ll f**king kill you!\u2019 Gregory breaks free and launches himself at Miller, taking him and the doorman to the concrete. I wince at the sounds of hard knuckles connecting with flesh, blood spraying, and clothes ripping. But even though Gregory is well built, Miller clearly has the upper hand, showing the fighting skills of someone trained.</p><p>I\u2019ve seen him show this kind of punishment before, except it was a limp bag of sand hanging from the rafters of a gym that was subjected to his brutality. Not my treasured friend. Both of them have forgotten about me, neither noticing that I\u2019m injured and distressed on the pavement. Their rationality has been clouded by caveman behaviour and bashing horns.</p><p>In my dazed state, I struggle to my feet while the spectacle continues. My steps forward are tentative. I need to stop this, but then my arm is taken and I\u2019m being pulled away. I look up, seeing Tony focused, with purpose directing me to the road. He flags a taxi down and makes to put me inside.</p><p>\u2018Tony, I need to stop them.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll sort it. You\u2019re best off out of the way,\u2019 he snaps harshly, encouraging me into the cab.</p><p>\u2018Please stop them,\u2019 I beg as he slams the door.</p><p>He nods, a nod that I find reassuring as he leans into the window and hands the driver a twenty. \u2018Take her to A and E.\u2019 And then he\u2019s gone, stalking away, rampant with fury. As the driver pulls away from the horror scene I\u2019ve caused, he eyes me in his rear-view mirror, prompting me to reach up and feel the top of my head. I wince, tears continuing to fall, more from despair than pain.</p><p>\u2018Are you okay, sweetheart?\u2019 the taxi driver asks, looking concerned.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m fine, honestly.\u2019 I rummage through my purse for a tissue but give up when one\u2019s handed through the small hole in the glass. \u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No problem. Let\u2019s get you to the hospital.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 I murmur pitifully, resting back in the seat and watching the blurred lights of London by night zoom past the window.</p><p>The driver drops me off at A&amp;E and gives me his mobile number to call him as soon as I\u2019m done. After checking myself in, I sit among the masses of Saturday night drunks, all injured, some ranting, some throwing up.</p><p>Four hours later, I\u2019m still sitting in the waiting area, my bottom numb, my head banging. I get up and make my way to the toilet, looking down and seeing my ice-blue dress soaked with blood. My reflection in the mirror once I arrive in the ladies\u2019 reveals even more of a mess. My hair is matted and my right cheek caked in dried blood. I look as pitiful as I feel. After staring at myself for too long and not bothering to remedy my sorry state, I exit into the waiting area again, just catching the tail end of my name being called. I look across the room to see a nurse scanning the waiting area.</p><p>\u2018Here!\u2019 I call, hurrying over, thankful my time in the drunk-infested space is up. \u2018I\u2019m Olivia Taylor.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Let\u2019s get you sorted out.\u2019 She smiles kindly and directs me into a cubicle, swiftly pulling the curtain across and settling me on the bed. \u2018What have you been up to?\u2019 she asks, frowning at my blood-coated face.</p><p>\u2018I fell,\u2019 I mutter feebly, which isn\u2019t far from the truth.</p><p>\u2018Okay, lovey,\u2019 she says, taking a sterile pad from a packet. \u2018This may sting.\u2019 I pull in a shocked rush of breath as it connects with my head, and she hushes me like an injured child. \u2018There, there. It looks worse than it is. Some glue will sort it out.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m flooded with relief. \u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Perhaps better footwear is called for.\u2019 She smiles, looking down at my heels before continuing to glue me back together.</p><p>I sit on the edge of the bed and listen to the nurse chat away, offering the odd agreement or answer to her questions every now and then. My face is cleaned up, but there is nothing that can be done with my hair, so I pile it up gingerly, securing it with a loose tie that I find hiding at the bottom of my bag. My dress looks like it\u2019s ready for the dustbin. I look like I\u2019m ready for the dustbin.</p><p>Once I\u2019ve been seen to thoroughly and checked for concussion, I\u2019m discharged and left to find my way home. But I don\u2019t call the nice taxi man because one pulls up, just as the automatic doors swing open, exposing me to the chill of the early hours. I shiver and wrap my arms around my body, trying to squeeze the shudders away as I hurry to the cab. I hop in, but before I can pull the door shut, there\u2019s a body blocking it, hindering my attempts.</p><p>Then a palm is resting on my nape and internal sparks begin to fizz. \u2018You\u2019re coming with me.\u2019</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Despondency and the look of determination in his eyes prevent me from fighting him. I haven\u2019t the energy to fight him, so I let him pull me from the taxi and lead me away.</p><p>\u2018Get in,\u2019 he orders when we arrive at his car parked haphazardly nearby.</p><p>I do as I\u2019m told and let him shut me in. He climbs in and shocks me when he starts pulling at his wreck of a suit. \u2018Fucking mess,\u2019 he mutters, looking out the corner of his eye to me. He\u2019s probably taking in my own dishevelled state, the fool. On a mild shake of his head, he slams his Merc into gear and pulls away from the hospital way too fast, but I don\u2019t say a thing. I\u2019d be stupid to say anything. He looks homicidal, totally deranged. And I\u2019m wary of it.</p><p>\u2018Are you okay?\u2019 he asks, pulling a sharp left onto the main road.</p><p>I don\u2019t answer, instead focusing forward. He knows the answer to that question.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve asked once.\u2019</p><p>I remain quiet, absorbing the continued fury emanating from his messy form.</p><p>\u2018Damn it, Olivia!\u2019 He punches the door window, sending me on a startled jump in the passenger seat. \u2018Where are your f**king manners?\u2019</p><p>I chance a cautious glance at him, seeing a sweaty brow and that loose curl jumping across his forehead from his shaking. \u2018I\u2019m fine,\u2019 I whisper.</p><p>He takes a calming pull of breath and glances up to the rear-view mirror. \u2018Why is your phone turned off?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s broken.\u2019</p><p>He looks across to me before flicking his eyes up to the mirror again, then taking another sharp left. \u2018How?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I threw it at the wall when you texted me,\u2019 I don\u2019t hesitate telling him. \u2018Because I was mad at you.\u2019</p><p>His face turns to mine and drinks in my blank face for what seems like for ever. Then his hand releases the gearstick and starts to slowly come towards my knee until he gently and cautiously rests it on my bare flesh. I look down at him rubbing lazy circles before I pull my leg away and return my stare forward, leaving his hand dropping to the leather by my leg. He quietly curses and, in my peripheral vision, I see him looking to the rear-view mirror once again. My hand shoots out to grab the door when he takes another vicious turn into a dark alley on yet another quiet curse, and I instinctively glance out the back of the car. Does he think someone\u2019s following us? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m just about to speak when the car screeches to a halt and Miller is out, quickly making his way to my side and opening the door. He offers his hand. \u2018Take it,\u2019 he demands, and I hesitantly reach forward, sensing an element of urgency to his tone. I\u2019m grasped and pulled from the car before his hold shifts to my neck.</p><p>\u2018What are you doing?\u2019 I ask, my feet moving fast to keep up with his determined strides. \u2018Miller?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve had too much to drink to be driving.\u2019 He brushes off my question and heads to the Tube entrance across the street, his eyes darting around constantly. \u2018Now\u2019s not the time to be difficult, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 I\u2019m looking around nervously now, too.</p> <p>\u2018Trust me.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s jumpy and it\u2019s frightening me. \u2018What have you done to make me do that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Everything,\u2019 he answers immediately, making me frown up at him as my legs continue to keep up with his fast strides.</p><p>We enter the station and I\u2019m released momentarily while Miller clears the turnstiles with an easy leap, not prepared to waste time at the ticket machine. He turns and grabs me, lifting me over with no regard for security or onlookers. Then my neck is reclaimed and we begin descending into the bowels of London, taking the escalators fast and frantically.</p><p>\u2018Miller, please,\u2019 I plead, my feet killing, my head banging.</p> <p>He halts, turns, and scoops me into his arms. I gasp. \u2018I apologise for making you walk.\u2019</p><p>I look down at him, the close proximity and sudden artificial light giving me a clear view of his face. His cheek is bruised and his lip grazed. But he\u2019s still breathtaking. And my reactions to his beauty and touch are still evident. I\u2019m hypnotised by him, my heart being hijacked by a violent, determined thrum, which has nothing to do with my exertion. I don\u2019t like these responses to him. They\u2019re dangerous.</p><p>The platform is empty and we\u2019re no longer on the move, yet he doesn\u2019t place me down, choosing to keep me secure against him.</p><p>A whistling breaks through the silent air, indicating the arrival of a train, and when the doors slide open, he carries me into the car and rests his backside on one of the raised cushions at the end of the carriage. He finally places me on my feet, spreads his legs, and pulls me face-forward to his body, our chests colliding, the internal sparks firing off wildly. His breathing is strained as he feels the back of my neck and pushes me further into him, like he\u2019s trying to morph us together. The severity of his grip stops me from trying to escape. Do I want to escape? I can feel a familiar ease descending, which is obscene, given Miller\u2019s strange behaviour, but my subconscious is also working hard to remind me of . . . everything. Yet in the same breath, Miller is working hard to try and make me forget, and his tactic for doing this is by immersing me in his body and attentiveness. Worshipping me.</p><p>\u2018Let me taste you again. I beg you,\u2019 he murmurs into my neck, starting to kiss his way up to my jaw. The familiarity of his slow-moving lips makes me close my eyes and plead for strength. \u2018Forget the world outside and be with me for ever.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t forget,\u2019 I answer quietly, my face nuzzling into his mouth automatically.</p> <p>\u2018I can make you forget.\u2019 He reaches my lips and gently brushes over them, his eyes sinking into mine. \u2018You agreed to let no one else have you.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t speak with any hint of arrogance as he pulls away slightly, revealing his wayward curl and too many lovely places for my eyes to focus on.</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t know who I was agreeing with.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You were agreeing with the man who you can\u2019t function without.\u2019 His voice is low and hoarse, his eyes continuously glancing to my lips. There is little point in denying his claim when the words are a mirror of my own, spoken aloud and delivered to him personally. And our separation has only proved it. \u2018We were made to fit together. We fit perfectly together. You must feel it, Olivia.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t allow me time to agree, or maybe disagree. He inches forward slowly, carefully, holding my eyes until our mouths meet and he\u2019s humming in contentment. My arms lift and hold him, my body pushes into his, and my eyes close in bliss. We kiss for an age, slowly, delicately, lovingly. I can feel our broken pieces shifting and coming together, the rightness of us fused everywhere cancelling out all of the wrongness of our doomed relationship. I\u2019m allowed to kiss him. I\u2019m allowed to touch him.</p><p>The train begins to slow until we\u2019re at a stop and the doors are sliding open, but a quick peek while maintaining our consuming kiss reveals no one getting off and no one waiting to board. I\u2019m allowed to kiss him. That thought and the sound of the doors snapping into action again yank me from the curious world of Miller Hart and puts me back into a place where everything is . . . impossible. He\u2019s been in Madrid. He\u2019s been with clients while he\u2019s been with me.</p><p>I dive from his arms through the tiny slit of space left to exit, landing on the platform before I can register my sharp movement. Looking back at the carriage, I watch as the train starts to pull away and Miller starts hammering on the door frantically. He\u2019s deranged, panicked and shouting, as I stand deathly still and watch him disappear into the tunnel. My last tear-filled vision is of him throwing his head back on a ferocious roar and propelling his fist into the glass.</p><p>Time seems to slow. I\u2019m numb and useless and running over every reason for me to remain at a safe distance from Miller Hart, while my fingertips run over my lips, feeling his mouth still there. I can feel his body against mine, too, and the lingering burn his gaze has left on my skin. He has worked his way deep into me and I\u2019m terrified there is no shaking him out.</p><p>The front door swings open before I\u2019ve even made it halfway up the garden path, and Nan\u2019s standing looking petrified in her nightie. \u2018Olivia! Oh my goodness.\u2019 She rushes down the path to collect me, taking my elbow and leading me into the house. \u2018Oh my word, whatever has happened? Oh my goodness!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m okay,\u2019 I mumble, exhaustion taking hold, rendering me incapable of proper speech. I should make the effort, though, because Nan looks truly beside herself, her usually fixed hair in disarray and her face looking older. She needs reassurance.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019ll make a cup of tea.\u2019 She pushes me towards the kitchen, but I freeze on the threshold when I feel the hairs on the back of my neck rise.</p><p>\u2018Where is he?\u2019 I ask, jolting forward a little when Nan bumps into my back.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer, instead overtaking me and pulling me into the kitchen. \u2018Come, I\u2019ll make tea,\u2019 she repeats in an attempt to avoid answering my question.</p><p>\u2018Nan, where?\u2019 I ask, stopping her from pulling me further into the room.</p><p>\u2018Olivia, he\u2019s been out of his mind.\u2019 She tugs me harder until I stumble into the kitchen and he comes into view. Miller\u2019s sitting at the table, looking a mighty mess and really pissed off. Yet his evident displeasure and the irritation it spikes in me doesn\u2019t prevent the simmering want from our train kiss to reignite.</p><p>Defeated.</p><p>He slowly stands, giving me warning eyes. I couldn\u2019t care less. He has no scruples, dragging in an old lady as a tool to get his way. She\u2019s oblivious to the horror that is our dead relationship and, subsequently, my dead heart. I\u2019m about to scream in his face in a desperate attempt to show him my rage at his underhanded tactics, but before I can muster the energy, a sharp pain stabs at my temple, making me clench my head on a hiss and a stumble of my heels.</p><p>\u2018Jesus, Olivia.\u2019 He\u2019s in front of me in a second, stroking my face, putting his lips everywhere and mumbling incoherent words, mostly quiet curses.</p><p>I\u2019m too tired to fight him off, so I wait until he\u2019s finished smothering me before pulling away. I penetrate him with cold eyes. \u2018Nan, please see Miller out.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Olivia,\u2019 she rebukes me gently. \u2018Miller has been terribly worried. I told you, you need to replace your telephone.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I won\u2019t because I don\u2019t want to speak to him.\u2019 My voice is as cold as my eyes surely are. \u2018Have you forgotten what the last few weeks have been like, Nan?\u2019 I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve been cornered like this again. He has no morals.</p><p>\u2018Of course, but Miller has explained. He\u2019s very sorry, said it\u2019s all a misunderstanding.\u2019 She hastily gets three mugs from the cupboard, set on making tea quickly, like it will pacify me. Or maybe the consumption of some good English tea will make everything better.</p><p>\u2018A misunderstanding?\u2019 I look at him, finding the usual impassive blue gaze. Ironically, it\u2019s comforting after the maniac I\u2019ve encountered tonight. It\u2019s familiar, which I conclude to be a bad thing. \u2018Tell me. What out of everything have I misunderstood?\u2019</p><p>Miller steps forward, but on instinct I step away again. \u2018Livy.\u2019 He rakes a frustrated hand through his dark waves and attempts to straighten his wrecked suit. \u2018Can we talk?\u2019 he tries, his jaw ticking.</p><p>\u2018Come on, Livy. Be reasonable,\u2019 Nan pipes up. \u2018Give him a chance to explain.\u2019</p><p>I let slip a little laugh, making Nan frown and Miller\u2019s jaw tense further. \u2018Never.\u2019 I turn away, leaving two despairing souls in the kitchen. No one is more desolate than I am, though. I\u2019m crumbling, disintegrating.</p><p>My head is thumping as I take the stairs, my mind crippled with too much to absorb. I\u2019ve never felt more confused and helpless, or angry and frustrated.</p><p>\u2018Livy.\u2019 His voice halts me halfway up and I muster the strength I need to face my heart\u2019s nemesis. His eyes are glazed, his shoulders visibly slumped, but that air of confidence still surrounds him. \u2018You\u2019ve underestimated my determination to fix us.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We can\u2019t be fixed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wrong.\u2019</p><p>I take the banister for support. His one-word counter is seething with determination and confidence. \u2018I\u2019ve already told you, I can\u2019t fix you. And I can\u2019t risk you breaking me beyond repair . . .\u2019 My voice trails off as I reach the end of my declaration. I\u2019m furious that I can\u2019t finish as bravely as I started. I\u2019m already ruined. Not broken, but ruined. Broken is fixable. Ruined is not. Ruined is beyond hope. \u2018Good night.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re mistaking me for a man who gives up easily.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, I mistook you for a man who I could trust.\u2019 I find my way to my room and strip down before collapsing onto my bed and hiding under the sheets. While I know I\u2019m being sensible, the willpower to maintain my strength is crushing me. He\u2019s crushing me.</p><p>Sleep finds me easily, mainly because the agony of thinking makes my brain retreat into protective mode, shutting down and giving me a few hours of peace before I face another black day.</p><p>I\u2019m surrounded by warmth \u2013 I\u2019m too hot. But I can\u2019t move to free myself from the covers. Then I notice breathing, and it\u2019s not mine. I also notice something hard wedged up against my back, but there\u2019s material between my na**d body and the solid muscle pushing into me. And it feels like expensive material. Suit material. Bespoke suit material.</p><p>If I could, I\u2019d move, but he has me in a vice grip, like he\u2019s afraid I might escape while he\u2019s snoozing. \u2018Miller.\u2019 I nudge him, and he groans a little, squeezing me harder. \u2018Miller!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thing,\u2019 he mumbles sleepily, nuzzling into my neck. \u2018Hold that thought.\u2019</p><p>He feels amazing, completely surrounding me, but my waking brain is quickly registering this to be a bad thing. \u2018Miller, please!\u2019</p><p>He releases me fast and retreats, giving me space to sit up and brush my hair from my face. I immediately flinch on a quiet hiss when I brush harshly over my cut, the pain quickly reminding me of my injury.</p><p>\u2018Olivia.\u2019 He\u2019s in front of me quickly, holding my arms to keep me in place, but I shrug him off. \u2018Does it hurt?\u2019 he asks softly, giving me the space I\u2019m demanding. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I allow my gaze to lift to his face, knowing it\u2019ll be a bad move, but his magnet eyes are far too powerful. He still looks beautiful, despite his tired face and mess of waves. His eyes are dull, his fully suited body is creased beyond creased, and his lightly tanned skin looks sallow. \u2018Not as much as you\u2019ve hurt me,\u2019 I half sob, trying to combat the tears from falling. \u2018Get out!\u2019</p><p>He drops his eyes, and I get off the bed, escaping to the shower. I can\u2019t look at him. I\u2019ll cave.</p><p>The water feels like stabbing blades on my sore head as I tentatively lather up with shampoo, then smooth some conditioner through the ends, all the while reminding myself of everything William has said to me. I take my time, in no hurry to start my day, and by the time I\u2019m done, I expect Miller to be gone, but as I walk into the bedroom wrapped in a towel, he\u2019s sitting on the edge of my bed, still dishevelled. And he has a cup of tea in his hand.</p><p>\u2018Does Nan know you\u2019re here?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>Of course she does, I think. Who else produces tea like it\u2019s going out of fashion? \u2018You had no right to invade my bed.\u2019 I slam the door behind me for effect, not that it has an effect. He remains deadpan, completely unruffled.</p><p>\u2018I needed you in my arms. You would never allow it while you were conscious, so I used my initiative.\u2019 He shows no remorse for his sly stunt, taking a slow sip of his tea while I look on, stunned, struggling against my body\u2019s instinct to react to those lips in action.</p><p>\u2018Are you going to break in every night and violate my privacy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018If I have to.\u2019</p> <p>I\u2019m on dangerous ground. I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of his determination on more than one occasion. I need to stay strong. Memories of the loving, worshipping Miller I remember between the emotional retard are slipping further away. \u2018Why are you still here?\u2019 I make my way over to my chair and negotiate the towel so I can slip some underwear and a T-shirt on.</p><p>\u2018Why are you all bashful?\u2019</p><p>I swing around and find his roving eyes dragging up and down my legs. He looks conceited and victorious, and that makes me feel . . . defeated. \u2018I\u2019d like you to leave.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019d like you to give me the opportunity to talk. But we don\u2019t all get what we want, do we?\u2019 He stands and makes his way over.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll slap you if you come any closer!\u2019 I snap, feeling panic descending as I back away. Damn it, he\u2019s going to have me up against the wall and at his mercy but, to my utter shock, he drops to his knees in front of me and looks up, the arrogance disappearing and genuine regret replacing it.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m on my knees, Olivia.\u2019 His hands slowly lift and slide cautiously under my T-shirt to my bum, like he\u2019s expecting me to shout at him to stop. I would if I could find my tongue. Blue eyes watch me as he reaches forward with his lips and rests them on the material covering my tummy. \u2018Let me put right what I\u2019ve broken.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018That\u2019s me,\u2019 I choke. \u2018You\u2019ve broken me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can fix you, Olivia. And I need you to fix me, too.\u2019</p><p>My chin starts to tremble at his earnest words. \u2018It\u2019s your entire fault,\u2019 I sob, resisting feeling his wayward hair, knowing it\u2019ll offer me comfort that I shouldn\u2019t be seeking from him.</p><p>\u2018I accept full responsibility.\u2019 He kisses my stomach again and glides his palms over my bottom. \u2018We\u2019re more broken if we don\u2019t have each other. Let me put us back together again. I need you, Olivia. Desperately. You\u2019re making my world light.\u2019</p><p>The word I want to say nearly slips past my lips, but there\u2019s so much that needs to be spoken about. Too much I fear for any of this to ever be right. I\u2019m pulled down to my knees and smothered by his lush, soft lips. The familiar comfort saturates my senses. \u2018Miller.\u2019 I break away and hold him at arm\u2019s length. \u2018You think it\u2019s that easy?\u2019</p><p>His stunning brow furrows deeply as he scans my face. \u2018Overthinking.\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t stop my eyes from rolling at his feeble retort. \u2018We should talk.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay. Let\u2019s talk now,\u2019 he pushes.</p> <p>I feel frustration starting to take hold again. \u2018I need time to think.\u2019</p><p>\u2018People overthink things, Livy. I\u2019ve told you that before.\u2019</p><p>He must realise what he\u2019s saying. He\u2019s a smart man. \u2018And make big deals of small deals?\u2019 I ask, a light edge of sarcasm lacing my tone.</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s no need for insolence.\u2019</p><p>I sigh. \u2018I\u2019ve told you before, Miller Hart. With you there is.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How much time?\u2019 He has no counter for that.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never been in a relationship, and I wanted one with you. Then I found out you f**k women for a living!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Livy!\u2019 he yells. \u2018Please, don\u2019t be so crass!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry. Did I hurt your feelings?\u2019</p><p>I expect a scowl but get an even tone and straight face. \u2018What the hell has happened to my sweet girl?\u2019 His eyebrows rise, raising my hackles. \u2018Getting drunk, offering yourself to other men.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You happened!\u2019 Yes, I got drunk, but only to dull the pain that he\u2019s caused.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want anyone else to taste you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I feel the same!\u2019 I yell, making him jump before he snarls. His lack of retort should surprise me but it doesn\u2019t. It worries me. But something springs to mind. \u2018I saw the newspaper.\u2019</p><p>His hostility is sucked up in a second. Now he looks downright uncomfortable, and he isn\u2019t jumping to his defence, confirming my suspicions. Diana Low didn\u2019t take it upon herself to change that headline. Miller told her to.</p><p>The sound of pots and pans clanging downstairs distracts me, making my head drop back on a moan of frustration. \u2018What have you told Nan?\u2019 I need to clarify this because she\u2019s going to be on me like a vulture the second Miller leaves.</p><p>\u2018Just that we had words, that you misunderstood a woman I had a meeting with as more than the business associate she was.\u2019 A sharp crack spikes in my neck when my head snaps back up. He shrugs and drops his arse to his heels. \u2018What else should I have said?\u2019</p><p>No answer to that is coming to me. I should be grateful for his quick thinking, but the audacity of his lie to my dear grandmother halts any gratitude. \u2018I\u2019ll call you,\u2019 I breathe.</p><p>\u2018What do you mean, you\u2019ll call me?\u2019 His displeasure is obvious. \u2018And you have no phone!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve been in another country with another woman.\u2019 I drag myself to my feet, feeling more exhausted than ever before.</p><p>\u2018Livy, I didn\u2019t sleep with her. I\u2019ve not slept with anyone since I met you, I swear.\u2019</p><p>I should be relieved, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m completely shocked. \u2018No one?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, no one.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not a soul?\u2019 He\u2019s an escort. I\u2019ve seen him with women. He\u2019s been away . . .</p><p>His eyes are smiling. \u2018No matter how you ask, the answer will still be no. Not a soul.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So what were you doing in Madrid? And that woman at Quaglino\u2019s?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Come and sit.\u2019 He stands and starts pulling me to the bed, but I doggedly shake him off.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I walk over to my bedroom door and pull it open. Nothing he can say will fix this mess, and even if he finds any soothing words, he will still be an escort with some awful tactics. I need to listen to William.</p><p>He makes no attempt to leave my bedroom, his beautiful mind obviously racing. \u2018I\u2019ll take you for dinner, and you can\u2019t refuse because it\u2019s rude to decline a gentleman an offer to wine and dine you.\u2019 He nods his approval at his own words. \u2018Ask your grandmother.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Next week,\u2019 I suggest in an attempt to get him out before I cave, wondering if I\u2019ll ever be ready to take him on. I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s found the idea that I hold the strength I need to help him.</p><p>His eyes widen slightly, but he maintains his composure. \u2018Next week? No, I\u2019m afraid not. Tonight. I\u2019m taking you to dinner tonight.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tomorrow,\u2019 I fire back unconsciously, stunning myself.</p><p>\u2018Tomorrow?\u2019 he asks, clearly mentally calculating how many hours that is before sighing heavily. \u2018Promise.\u2019 His lips move slowly. \u2018Promise me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I promise,\u2019 I whisper, drawn to his mouth, thinking it can make everything better.</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 His tall, crumpled form approaches me and stops at the doorway. \u2018Can I kiss you?\u2019 His manners shock me. He doesn\u2019t usually care for them in situations like this.</p><p>I shake my head, knowing I\u2019ll be blindsided and undoubtedly end up on the bed beneath him.</p><p>\u2018As you wish.\u2019 He\u2019s full to the brim with aggravation. \u2018For now I\u2019ll respect your request, but I won\u2019t for much longer,\u2019 he warns, moodily stomping in his expensive shoes down the hallway. \u2018Tomorrow,\u2019 he affirms as he disappears down the stairs.</p><p>I shut the door, feeling relieved, lost and proud all at once.</p><p>But I still want Miller Hart.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>With the absence of a certain gentleman at the dinner table, supper has returned to dishes that I\u2019m familiar with and at the kitchen table, rather than at Nan\u2019s fancy dining room table. George\u2019s top button is undone, and no one is being chastised for their manners. There\u2019s no wine, no Sunday best frocks, and there\u2019s no pineapple upside-down cake.</p><p>But there are three pairs of inquisitive eyes on me, all watching me closely as I force-feed myself. My silence speaks volumes, and Gregory is beside himself, having received the rundown from Nan before I made it downstairs to the dinner table. I heard the hushed whispers, the shocked gasp, and I also heard Nan pacifying a rankled Gregory with excuses of misunderstandings and business associates not being who I thought. Gregory won\u2019t buy it, so remaining at the table for as long as possible to avoid his pressing questions is paramount. He has a black eye and a swollen hand. It can\u2019t be ignored, and I\u2019m wondering what he\u2019s told Nan.</p><p>When Nan starts clearing the dinner table, Gregory cocks his head to the side, signalling me to follow him out of the kitchen. I know my time evading him is up. I thank Nan, rub George on the shoulder affectionately, and follow my best friend into the hallway.</p><p>But I get in first. \u2018What were you thinking?!\u2019 I hiss, looking back to the door and then yanking him up the stairs. \u2018I didn\u2019t need you flexing your muscles and bashing horns with him!\u2019</p><p>We reach the top of the stairs and I turn to see his mouth dropped open in shock at my tirade. \u2018I was protecting you!\u2019</p><p>\u2018At first, yes, but it soon turned into a battle of the biggest ego! You threw the first punch!\u2019</p><p>\u2018He was manhandling you!\u2019</p><p>Both of our heads snap to the side when we hear Nan. \u2018What\u2019s going on up there?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nothing!\u2019 I call, pulling Gregory into my room and slamming the door. \u2018You prised me from him and dumped me on the pavement before tackling him to the floor!\u2019 I bend and point at my head. \u2018I spent hours in A and E being glued together while you wrestled in the middle of the street!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You just disappeared!\u2019 he shouts, pointing his finger in my face. \u2018And you have no f**king phone!\u2019 He throws his hands up in the air in frustration.</p><p>I pull up a moment, thinking about something that I really never wanted to think about again. \u2018It\u2019s affecting us,\u2019 I say quietly.</p><p>His neck retracts on his shoulders. \u2018Yes, he is.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t mean Miller.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then what\u2014\u2019 His mouth snaps shut, his eyes wide. \u2018Oh no! Don\u2019t blame this on that little thing we had.\u2019 He waves towards the bed, laughing sarcastically. \u2018This shit between us is down to that f**king prick you\u2019ve fallen in love with!\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018He\u2019s not a prick!\u2019 I shout, searching deep for the strength to calm myself down.</p><p>\u2018I swear to God, Livy, if you see him again, then we\u2019re done!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t talk stupid!\u2019 I\u2019m horrified he would say such a thing. I\u2019ve helped him through endless shitty break-ups, and I\u2019ve never made such a threat.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not,\u2019 he says more calmly. \u2018I mean it, Olivia. You know as well as me that that cocksucker is trouble. And I know you\u2019re not telling me everything.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I am!\u2019 I defend myself far too hastily.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t insult me!\u2019</p><p>\u2018At least he cared enough to search for me!\u2019</p><p>Gregory recoils in disgust. \u2018He\u2019s ruining you.\u2019 Biting his lip, he watches me closely for a few long seconds. I don\u2019t like the look on his face, and I know I\u2019m not going to like his next words. He\u2019s thinking too hard about them. \u2018I can\u2019t see you if he\u2019s in your life.\u2019</p><p>I gasp as he turns and leaves, making a point of slamming the door behind him, leaving me struck dumb in the middle of my bedroom. I\u2019m speechless, hurt and mad. He can\u2019t slap conditions on our friendship when it suits him. I never have.</p> <p>I throw myself into bed on an annoyed curse and hide under the sheets. Once again, my mind is grateful for the let-up in painful thinking, and I\u2019m soon dreaming of hard warmth pushed up against my back and soft humming in my ear. I\u2019m only dreaming, but the sharp edges under the bespoke suit and the familiar feeling of smooth hands stroking my bare tummy are comforting, even if they aren\u2019t real. It\u2019s far more welcome than the usual nightmare.</p><p>I don\u2019t welcome Monday with any more enthusiasm than I have every other morning since I fled that hotel. On top of my muddled thoughts about a certain man, I now have Gregory to worry about. The calamity that is my life at the moment is certainly making up for all the boring that\u2019s come before.</p><p>Half of me is wondering why I suggested dinner with Miller today when I was desperate to be swallowed up by him yesterday, and half of me is wondering why I suggested any day at all. He hasn\u2019t slept with anyone? I need to make a list of questions. If I\u2019m stupid enough to meet him.</p><p>I pull my bedcovers back and immediately frown down at my semi-naked body. I have my knickers on, but everything else is gone. Glancing up, I see all of my clothes folded neatly and placed in a pile on my chair. I\u2019m not totally losing my mind. I fell into bed in my clothes after Gregory stormed out; I know I did. I consider the possibility of Nan stripping me down in my sleep, but that pile of precisely folded and placed clothes tells me otherwise.</p><p>Still frowning, I untangle my body from the bedcovers and make my way across the room, opening the door quietly and listening out for Nan. There are the sounds of happy singing and clanking dishes, but no talking. Casting my eyes back to the offending pile of clothes, I think hard, trying to remember if it\u2019s my doing, but I\u2019m blank. Nothing is coming to me. Maybe I\u2019m walking in my sleep, or maybe I\u2019m tidying in my sleep.</p><p>A quick look at my clock tells me I haven\u2019t got time to ponder this mystery any more, so I make quick work of showering and dressing for work, throwing on some jeans and my white Converse, like I want my feet to dictate my mood: lifeless . . . blank.</p> <p>There are cornflakes in my bowl before I even sit at the table, and Nan is looking at me with an edge of delight mixed with curiosity. We\u2019re alone for the first time since yesterday morning, which means she finally has the opportunity to pick at me for answers. Quickly searching my brain for the best words before she hits me with her own, I very quickly come up with . . . something.</p><p>\u2018How was the dance?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>\u2018We rocked it.\u2019 She brushes me off, even though I\u2019m certain she has many tales to tell from her night as Ginger Rogers. \u2018And it was two nights ago.\u2019</p><p>I wince. \u2018Sorry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No matter,\u2019 she insists, and I know why. \u2018Miller looked mighty sad when he left yesterday.\u2019 She potters around with her tea towel while watching for my reaction. \u2018And I didn\u2019t like the sound of you and Gregory arguing.\u2019</p><p>I sigh, letting my backside fall to the chair, and pour some milk over my cornflakes as Nan loads my tea with too much sugar. \u2018It\u2019s complicated, Nan.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh . . .\u2019 Her rounded rump hits the chair next to me, her old navy eyes way too curious. \u2018I can deal with complicated. In fact, I bet I have the answer.\u2019</p><p>I smile fondly and rest my hand over hers. \u2018This is for me to fix.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I get the impression that Gregory doesn\u2019t like Miller,\u2019 she says cautiously.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve got the right impression, but can we leave it there?\u2019</p><p>Her thin lips purse slightly, annoyed that I won\u2019t confide in her. I\u2019m not exposing her to the hideousness of my complications, so she\u2019ll just have to be annoyed and accept the lie that Miller has fed her. I can\u2019t risk sending her into that horrific dark place again. \u2018I might be able to help,\u2019 she persists, squeezing my hand.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m a big girl, Nan.\u2019 I raise my eyebrows, making hers fall into a scowl.</p><p>\u2018I suppose you are,\u2019 she relents, still scowling, \u2018but remember one thing, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Life\u2019s too short to hang around waiting for answers that can only be found by getting off your skinny arse and finding them.\u2019 She gets up and viciously plunges her wrinkled hands into the dishwater, then proceeds to dump dish after dish onto the drainer heavy-handedly.</p><p>It\u2019s a quiet afternoon at the bistro \u2013 until Miller Hart walks through the door. He immediately holds everyone\u2019s attention in the place. And the bastard knows it.</p><p>\u2018Are you free to leave?\u2019 he asks politely, but I expect there is only one correct answer to this question, and behind his impassive fa\u00e7ade, he\u2019s just daring me to give the wrong one.</p><p>\u2018Uh . . .\u2019 I can\u2019t form words. Del hands me my satchel and denim jacket with a wary nod, but it takes Miller to physically collect me from behind the counter to get my feet moving. He takes my nape gently and starts guiding me from the bistro, massaging my neck as he does, leaving me with no option but to keep up with his punishing pace. The black Mercedes is parked on double-yellow lines, and it\u2019s only when he opens the door to guide me to the seat that I speak up.</p><p>\u2018What are you doing?\u2019 I ask, looking up at him.</p><p>My question doesn\u2019t make him falter in his attempts to put me in his car. \u2018You promised me dinner. Get in the car.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That was before you just humiliated me.\u2019 I twist out of his grip and step back. I definitely notice the semblance of a scowl at my rejection, but Miller\u2019s smidgen of emotion isn\u2019t the only thing that has my attention.</p><p>He leans down, quite a way, so his eyes are level with mine. They are soft and reassuring. They have me. \u2018Why do you keep denying me?\u2019</p><p>I rip my stare from his gaze before I can lose myself in it, and walk away from him, my stride quick but completely pointless, too. I\u2019m going nowhere.</p><p>He\u2019s behind me, his expensive shoes pacing evenly. \u2018I don\u2019t like repeating myself.\u2019 He catches me and turns me in his arms. Then he straightens me out and places my hair neatly over my shoulders before stepping back. \u2018I\u2019ll make an exception this time. Why do you keep denying me?\u2019</p><p>His audacity sets my emotions in gear. My lips start trembling, my eyes welling. The anger is restoking, too, the hurt magnifying, the confusion tripling. \u2018Because . . .\u2019 I close my eyes briefly, feeling my strength slipping away, despite his arrogance. \u2018Everything.\u2019 I know William is right. I shouldn\u2019t be getting myself caught up in Miller\u2019s web of pleasure. I might not like William\u2019s interference, and he might not have a right to enforce his demands, but I can\u2019t deny that he knows what he\u2019s talking about. Everything I now know has been confirmed by William. I should listen to him. He\u2019s wise and familiar with this world.</p><p>Miller\u2019s luscious lips purse and his eyes drop, prompting that soft curl to fall forward, but I don\u2019t remind him of his rule of looking at someone when they are speaking to you. \u2018You don\u2019t desire me?\u2019 he asks quietly.</p><p>My face bunches in confusion. What kind of question is that at a time like this? \u2018Of course I do.\u2019 I realise my error immediately when his eyes lift and drown me in . . . desire. My own desire is reflecting back at me through the never-ending depths of his blue eyes.</p><p>\u2018And I you,\u2019 he whispers. \u2018More than my body desires water to survive or my lungs air to breathe.\u2019</p><p>I fight for breath. \u2018I\u2019m also frightened of you,\u2019 I confess.</p><p>\u2018And I you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t trust you.\u2019</p><p>That statement makes him falter slightly, but he quickly pulls it back. \u2018I trust you with my life.\u2019 His hand lifts, his thumb stroking over my eyebrow. The skin-on-skin contact puts me in my comfort zone and the sparks fire off within. \u2018I trust you to help me.\u2019 His finger drifts down my cheek, my jaw, until he\u2019s stroking my bottom lip. My eyes close on a quiet hitch of breath. \u2018Let me taste you.\u2019</p><p>My nod of agreement is automatic. I can feel bursts of life within.</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 he murmurs quietly, his breath feathering against my cheek before his lips come down on my mouth softly. He\u2019s gentle, almost cautious, as he caresses my tongue with his, slowly breaking me down. \u2018Hold me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018If I do that, I\u2019m yours again.\u2019 I force myself to step away from him, leaving him still bent with eyes searching mine.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve made reservations for dinner.\u2019 He straightens up. \u2018Will you do me the honour of joining me?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m a mess of conflicting thoughts, struggling to figure out if Miller is my destiny. But as his palm gingerly slides around my back and his heated touch burns through the material of my T-shirt, I think of something. \u2018Where were you last night?\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t imagine the slight stiffness on his palm against me and the edge of guilt in those eyes. \u2018Come to dinner with me.\u2019</p><p>He did. He broke into my house. That\u2019s . . . creepy! I feel violated. \u2018You undressed me?\u2019 I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t wake. \u2018I wasn\u2019t dreaming, was I?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I hope so. And when you\u2019re not dreaming of me, I hope you\u2019re constantly thinking of me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m thinking you have a problem!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I did,\u2019 he replies quickly, deadly serious. \u2018My world was fading into blackness again and the only thing that can keep it light keeps running away!\u2019</p><p>I flinch at the genuine irritation in his voice. \u2018I have questions.\u2019</p><p>He nods mildly and takes a deep breath, gathering some calm. \u2018I\u2019m ready to answer anything you\u2019d like to ask me.\u2019</p><p>My relief is immense, but so is my dread. I\u2019m not sure I want to hear his answers. \u2018Over dinner,\u2019 I assert. We need to be on neutral ground. No bed in sight. \u2018Just dinner.\u2019 This will be done my way. I may have laid my cards before, but they can still be turned back over. Actually, they absolutely can\u2019t, but Miller doesn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>\u2018Just dinner,\u2019 he agrees, but I can tell it\u2019s a reluctant agreement.</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t get to taste me or touch me.\u2019 I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m saying such a stupid thing. I\u2019m desperate for the comfort he offers me.</p><p>The dash of annoyance that passes over his perfect face makes me all the more determined. He can turn on his arrogant, gentlemanly charm and have me just as quick as the soft, attentive lover. \u2018Now you\u2019re just being silly.\u2019</p><p>I shake my head. \u2018I won\u2019t come if you\u2019re planning on winning me over by worshipping me.\u2019 It\u2019ll be game over. I\u2019m still taken by him, even with my growing wariness and knowledge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Fine. As you wish,\u2019 he mutters.</p><p>I nod and gather myself. \u2018Where should I meet you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Meet me?\u2019 His forehead furrows.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll meet you at the restaurant.\u2019 Miller picking me up is too familiar, and I can\u2019t allow Nan to think all is well when it isn\u2019t.</p> <p>That declaration gains me a flash of irritation, but he contains it coolly. Delving back into solace with Miller is dangerous, but I fear I have no other choice and not just because he doesn\u2019t appear to be giving me one. He\u2019s back in my life, and I really want him to be. I need his comfort, his thing, his words. I need it all. Nothing has ever made me feel so protected but at the same time so utterly vulnerable. And nothing has made me feel so strong, yet so incredibly weak. There has to be a middle ground.</p><p>\u2018Fine.\u2019 He exhales a mixture of frustration and annoyance. \u2018When did you become so difficult?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The second you touched me,\u2019 I reply quietly, finding the sass that has become paramount since I fell into the curious world of Miller Hart. I won\u2019t survive without it. I won\u2019t survive him without it.</p><p>His palm lifts slowly and cups my cheek, stroking slow circles. \u2018The second I looked at you, I saw light through my constant darkness.\u2019 He moves in, his mouth getting closer, my eyes focused only there. \u2018I saw bright, hopeful light reflecting back at me through those beautiful sapphire eyes.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t kiss me; he just keeps our mouths close, his breath spreading across my face, enhancing the sense of warmth coursing through me. My eyes close. \u2018I\u2019ll respect your request for this evening. But remember, you are my possession, Olivia. You\u2019re my habit, and I\u2019m not going down without a fight.\u2019 He releases me, leaving me breathless, dizzy and feeling abandoned. I open my lids to face torturous beauty. \u2018And I won\u2019t lose no matter who takes me on. Even you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Where shall I meet you?\u2019 I breathe, not caring to challenge him on his confident claim. I\u2019ve seen him in action, fists flying, and I\u2019ve also felt him in action . . . worshipping action. All challengers are doomed. Including me.</p> <p>\u2018Seven o\u2019clock here.\u2019 He takes a pen from his inside pocket and scribbles an address on an old receipt from his wallet before handing it to me. \u2018I\u2019ll be waiting.\u2019</p><p>I nod as he starts to back away, smoothing down his suit before sliding his hands into his pockets. Our eyes lock. I see hope there. I see confidence. I see fear. And I see caution. But I\u2019m not sure if that caution is for him or for me. Probably both.</p><p>Miller breaks the eye connection, then turns away from me and strolls off to his car.</p><p>My palms hit my cheeks and rub some life back into them. I feel hot, my mind a jumbled mess of contradicting thoughts, worries . . . fear. I\u2019m frightened of him, but he makes me feel unbelievably safe. I\u2019m worried about him, but I\u2019m worried about me, too. I can\u2019t even fathom my thought process, which is jumping from surrendering to fighting harder against him. Nothing is making sense.</p><p>I\u2019m in a world of my own, trying to figure out too much, when I find my palm stroking my nape. The hairs are dancing wildly under my touch, tingling, making my skin buzz.</p><p>\u2018This is exactly what I was afraid of.\u2019 The velvet voice pulls my body around slowly, warily, and my heart sprints up to my throat.</p> <p>Chapter Nine</p><p>I\u2019m not sure whether I should be relieved or worried by what I find. William is leaning against his Lexus, arms crossed, ankles crossed. He doesn\u2019t look happy, his typically sparkling grey eyes fractious and his soft features cut with annoyance.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re following me?\u2019 My question spills on a guilty gasp \u2013 the guilt for my weakness where Miller\u2019s concerned, the gasp for my shock at finding William here.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve been trying to call you.\u2019 He pushes his body away from the car and strolls over casually until his hulking frame is towering over me. \u2018Where\u2019s the phone I bought you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I haven\u2019t charged it.\u2019 I divert my eyes downward, for what reason I don\u2019t know. He might be right about Miller, but I\u2019m not answerable to him. London\u2019s most notorious male escort may have resided in a dark place, but I\u2019m making it light. He wants to change for me. I have to make my own decisions. I\u2019m the master of my own destiny.</p><p>\u2018Then you will,\u2019 he orders. \u2018Tell me why you were at his club.\u2019</p><p>I look up, shocked. \u2018You have been following me!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I told you before. I make it my business to know what happens in this world. When I heard of an incident at Ice involving Miller Hart and a pretty little blonde, it didn\u2019t take long to figure out who the pretty little blonde was.\u2019 He cups my jaw and lifts my chin. \u2018Walk away.\u2019</p> <p>I shake my head, my eyes beginning to well with tears. \u2018I\u2019ve tried. I\u2019ve tried dozens of times and I can\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Try harder, Olivia. You\u2019re falling into his darkness and there\u2019s no getting out once you land. You have no idea what you\u2019re truly getting into.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I love him,\u2019 I sob, admitting aloud for the first time that I\u2019m still in love with the confounding man, who is even more of a mystery now than he ever was before some of his secrets were revealed. I can\u2019t fall into his darkness if I\u2019m keeping it light. \u2018It\u2019s painful love.\u2019</p><p>He winces at my confession, and I know it\u2019s because he identifies with how that feels. \u2018The pain will subside, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Has it for you?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t . . .\u2019 He frowns and drops my chin from his hold. I\u2019ve surprised him with my question.</p><p>I don\u2019t give him a chance to pull himself together. \u2018You\u2019re crippled by agony every day. You let your Gracie go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I had no\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I cut him off, and he doesn\u2019t chastise me for it. The formidable William Anderson snaps his stubbled jaw shut without a word. \u2018Don\u2019t tell me it gets easier.\u2019</p><p>His smart-suited shoulders sag and I sidestep him, making my way to the Tube, my words spoken to William strengthening my reasons to take Miller on. Years after walking away from Gracie, William Anderson is still in agony. He hasn\u2019t got over her, and he doesn\u2019t look like he ever will. If William Anderson has felt like I do right now for all these years, then I think I\u2019d rather take death.</p><p>\u2018Get in the car,\u2019 William calls from the inside as it slows alongside me.</p><p>\u2018No, thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Damn you, Olivia!\u2019 he yells, halting my determined march. \u2018Don\u2019t make me manhandle you.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m stunned into silence and stillness by his threat, the coolness of this well-respected, well-contained man heated to the boiling point. \u2018You\u2019re just going to nag me,\u2019 I splutter, not knowing what else to say.</p><p>He actually rolls his eyes, stunning me further. \u2018I\u2019m not your father.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then stop acting like it,\u2019 I spit, that word enhancing the absence of a male confidant in my life. I haven\u2019t needed one for twenty-four years. But then again, I\u2019ve not encountered a Miller Hart during that time. Until now.</p><p>\u2018Would you kindly get in and allow me to drive you home?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you going to chew my ear off?\u2019</p><p>He refrains from laughing, leaning over and opening the door. \u2018I\u2019ve done some questionable things in my time, Olivia, but I\u2019m not guilty of chewing any ears.\u2019</p><p>I narrow my eyes suspiciously until he gives me an expectant look. I\u2019ve no doubt William would manhandle me, so to save a public spectacle, I cautiously slide into the Lexus and shut the door gently.</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 he says, relaxing back in his seat. The driver pulls away and I rest my bag on my lap, fiddling with the buckles for something to do other than wait for him to speak. \u2018Will nothing I say convince you that he\u2019s a bad idea?\u2019</p><p>I sigh, exasperated, and flop back against my seat. \u2018You said you weren\u2019t going to chew my ear.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, I said I never had before. There\u2019s a first time for everything.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cute,\u2019 I mutter. \u2018I\u2019m meeting him for dinner this evening.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>\u2018To talk.\u2019</p><p>\u2018About what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think you know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What happened in that hotel?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nothing.\u2019 I grind the words through my tight jaw. I was delusional to ever think he would let that go. I\u2019m not telling him, despite the fact that I suspect he knows all too well. And, anyway, I\u2019d never be able to utter the words. Thinking them is hard enough.</p><p>\u2018Nothing,\u2019 he muses. \u2018So you looked like a frightened kitten because nothing happened?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I spit, despising that he clearly has his suspicions. I\u2019m not confirming them.</p><p>\u2018Of course,\u2019 he sighs. \u2018What\u2019s worrying is that you\u2019re going back for more.\u2019</p><p>\u2018More what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018More of Miller Hart.\u2019</p><p>I have to fight to stop myself from screaming, \u2018That wasn\u2019t Miller Hart!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Where are you meeting?\u2019 he continues after observing me closely for a few moments.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know. He gave me an address for a restaurant.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Let me see.\u2019</p><p>Losing a bit of patience, I fish through my satchel and pull the receipt out, thrusting it across the back seat without looking at William. \u2018There.\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s taken from my grasp, and I hear him hum thoughtfully. \u2018Nice place. I\u2019ll take you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh no!\u2019 I laugh, swinging disbelieving eyes his way. \u2018I\u2019ll get myself there.\u2019 I don\u2019t want William interfering. Enough people are already, even if they\u2019re unaware of the whole horrid story. And their determined efforts to stop me from seeing Miller only spells out how much more resistance I\u2019ll be facing should they know.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll simply drop you off.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not necessary.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Either you accept my ride, or you don\u2019t go.\u2019 He\u2019s deadly serious.</p><p>\u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 I ask, but then his reasons are too clear. \u2018Is this an attempt to ease your guilt?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 He\u2019s all defensive, spiking my curiosity and my annoyance.</p><p>\u2018Gracie. You failed her, so you\u2019re trying to redeem yourself by helping me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s nonsense!\u2019 he laughs, looking away from me.</p><p>It\u2019s not nonsense at all. It\u2019s perfect sense.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t need your help, William. I am not my mother!\u2019</p><p>His handsome face slowly turns back to mine. All previous amusement has disappeared as if it was never there. He looks grave. \u2018Then why were you at his club?\u2019</p><p>My mouth snaps shut momentarily. \u2018I . . .\u2019</p><p>His grey eyebrows lift slightly, his question and look making me retreat in my seat. I open my mouth to speak, but nothing materialises, prompting William to come closer. \u2018Punishing him, were you?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m immobilised by realisation, crippled by the cold, hard truth. \u2018I\u2019m not . . .\u2019 I can\u2019t finish.</p><p>William slowly pulls back and settles his eyes on my hand, where I\u2019m fiddling with my ring. \u2018You are more like your mother than you realise, Olivia.\u2019 He gently clasps my hand and takes over the twirling of my ring. \u2018Don\u2019t mistake that as a bad thing. She was a beautiful, passionate woman with an addictive spirit.\u2019</p><p>A lump the size of London has jumped into my throat, and I turn away from him to gaze out the window so he doesn\u2019t see my tears. I don\u2019t want to be like her. Selfish. Reckless. Naive. I want to be none of those things.</p><p>The ring on my finger is silently twirled by William while I have my tears. He says no more, and neither do I.</p><p>Much to my relief, Nan isn\u2019t home. She\u2019s left a pot of stew, along with a note to let me know that she\u2019s gone out with George. After finding my new phone, I tag on a message to hers saying I\u2019ve gone out with Sylvie, leaving my new number for her. Then I spend an hour slowly getting myself ready, but more time is spent mentally preparing, rather than making myself look presentable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At six thirty, I wander down the garden path to the Lexus awaiting me. The driver opens the door; I slip in quietly and immediately feel his grey eyes on me.</p><p>\u2018You look lovely,\u2019 William says genuinely, and I look over to find him taking in my short black dress, one of only three evening dresses I have.</p><p>\u2018Thank\u2014\u2019 I\u2019m interrupted by the unfamiliar sound of a phone chime, but William doesn\u2019t go to retrieve his mobile and after it rings for a few moments, I realise it\u2019s coming from my purse. I rummage through, locate my new iPhone on a frown, and glance down at the screen. Then I look to William.</p><p>\u2018Just checking.\u2019 He smiles, his hand appearing and cutting the call from his own phone.</p> <p>\u2018Haven\u2019t you got better things to do than ferry me around?\u2019 I ask, slipping my phone back into my bag.</p><p>\u2018I have plenty to do, and doing my best to stop you from free-falling into his world is one of the most important.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re a hypocrite,\u2019 I accuse, fairly or not; I don\u2019t care any more. \u2018Your world, his world. It\u2019s more or less the same damn thing. How can you claim to know him so well?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Our worlds collide every now and then,\u2019 he answers swiftly, and devoid of feeling.</p><p>\u2018Collide?\u2019 I question, a little confused and also cautious with the use of the word collide in that statement. Collide hints at crashing. He didn\u2019t use meet or pass.</p> <p>He leans towards me and speaks on a mere whisper. \u2018I have morals, Olivia. Miller Hart does not. It\u2019s caused friction between our worlds. I don\u2019t agree with how he conducts business and I\u2019m not afraid to tell him, despite that lethal temper of his.\u2019</p><p>I recoil, unable to argue with him. I\u2019ve seen how Miller conducts business and I\u2019ve seen that temper. \u2018He can change,\u2019 I murmur, knowing I\u2019ve failed to inject any confidence into my tone. William\u2019s sardonic huff of laughter tells me he\u2019s just as doubtful. \u2018I\u2019d like you to drop me around the corner,\u2019 I say confidently, knowing that Miller isn\u2019t likely to appreciate me being dropped off by another man, especially William and especially knowing that their worlds collide every now and then. I don\u2019t want tonight to be one of those every now and thens.</p><p>\u2018Of course.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tell me,\u2019 he begins, \u2018how such a stable, sweet young woman could fall in love with a man like Miller Hart.\u2019</p><p>Like Miller Hart? Stable and sweet? I wrack my brain for an answer to that question. And I find nothing, so I utilise Nan\u2019s words. \u2018We don\u2019t choose who we fall for.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You might be right.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know I\u2019m right,\u2019 I say to myself. I\u2019m living proof.</p><p>\u2018And knowing what you know, you still feel the same?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know he hasn\u2019t been with another woman since he met me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s had dates, Olivia, and please don\u2019t try to tell me otherwise. Don\u2019t forget, there\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then you\u2019ll know that he hasn\u2019t slept with any of them,\u2019 I grate, feeling my patience wearing thin.</p><p>\u2018And I\u2019d love to know how he avoided it,\u2019 William muses. I don\u2019t reply to that, quietly pleased that he hasn\u2019t challenged my claim. \u2018I have a question. Probably the most important question.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Does he love you?\u2019</p><p>I wilt on the inside at William\u2019s perfectly reasonable enquiry. Nothing less than a yes should be good enough here. William knows it. I know it. I shouldn\u2019t even entertain the idea of exposing my fallen heart to more hurt without that confirmation. \u2018He\u2019s fascinated by me.\u2019 I turn to look out the window, feeling young and stupid.</p><p>\u2018Does fascinate equal love?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I murmur, barely audibly, but I know he\u2019s heard me when his palm rests on my knee and squeezes gently.</p><p>\u2018Do your talking,\u2019 he says quietly. \u2018Then do your thinking.\u2019</p><p>I nod in acceptance and feel strangely comforted by William\u2019s affectionate touch. I\u2019ll talk and I\u2019ll think, but I don\u2019t actually think anything Miller could tell me will lessen or diminish my fascination with London\u2019s most notorious male escort. I want it to, but I\u2019m being real. I\u2019m caught up in his confounding, dark world, and I have no faith that anything can free me from it, not even William, no matter how hard he tries.</p><p>The driver doesn\u2019t drop me off around the corner as agreed. He pulls up right outside the restaurant, and William doesn\u2019t point out his error. I start to voice the mistake, but then I spot Miller standing on the pavement waiting, and the wary look he\u2019s giving the Lexus tells me he knows the car. But he doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m in it.</p><p>\u2018Please\u2019 \u2013 I turn to William, panicked \u2013 \u2018ask your driver to pull into the next street.\u2019</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s no need.\u2019 He dismisses my concern and exits the car swiftly and confidently and with the utmost superiority. I want to crawl under the seat and hide. I haven\u2019t looked out to see Miller\u2019s reaction to William\u2019s appearance. I don\u2019t need to. I can feel the air freeze around me, and he hasn\u2019t even seen me yet. \u2018Hart,\u2019 I hear William say tightly. Then my door is opening and William is looking down at me and extending his hand for me to take. I want to scream at him for his underhandedness. He\u2019s being threatening and I\u2019ve seen Miller under threat. It\u2019s frightening.</p><p>Closing my eyes and taking a deep breath of confidence, I reject William\u2019s offering and step out, slowly straightening my body until I\u2019m engulfed in the glacial air that has nothing to do with the poor weather conditions. Then I turn and face him. Blue eyes have slightly widened and his shadowed jaw is tense, but he remains quiet as William escorts me to him. Miller, as ever, looks unfathomably stunning in a dark grey three-piece suit, pale blue shirt \u2013 tie perfectly knotted \u2013 and tan brogues. His eyes, although shocked, are shimmering as I approach, his dark hair a tousled array of waves and his tall body striking. As I near, he flicks William a cold look before returning his eyes to mine and sliding his palm around my nape, tugging me forward. The icy air is still rife, but now it\u2019s mixed with a delicious warmth being injected into me from our joining. Dipping slowly, he gets his face level with mine and gives me a hint of a smile. It reminds me that Miller Hart has the most beautiful beam and it\u2019s been too long since I\u2019ve seen it.</p><p>He blinks slowly, another of his lovely traits, and gently rests his lips on mine. I know William is twitching behind me, but nothing will prevent me from absorbing Miller. Not even me. \u2018You put perfection to shame, my gorgeous girl.\u2019 He pecks my lips and pulls back to get my eyes. \u2018Thank you for coming.\u2019</p><p>I feel utterly stupid with William playing minder behind me, so I turn and find him watching us closely. \u2018You can leave now.\u2019 I feel Miller\u2019s arm snake around my waist and pull me into his chest. He has completely ignored my request of no touching and tasting, and I\u2019ve done nothing to stop him. He\u2019s staking his claim, marking his territory.</p><p>The tall, mature, grey-haired male steps away slowly, not taking his eyes from Miller until he\u2019s at his car. \u2018I know morals are something you struggle with, Hart, but I\u2019m asking you nicely to do the right thing now.\u2019 William may be asking nicely, but his tone is drenched in threat.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t question my morals when it comes to Olivia Taylor, Mr Anderson.\u2019 Miller\u2019s grip on me increases. \u2018Never do that.\u2019</p><p>The animosity bouncing between these two powerful men is intoxicating. My head is awash with questions of associations and worlds colliding, and that\u2019s on top of the list I have ready for Miller.</p><p>\u2018Do the right thing,\u2019 William says before turning greys onto me. \u2018You\u2019ll call me.\u2019 He slides effortlessly into the car without waiting for my agreement and pulls away fast, leaving me on the pavement, tense and bracing myself for a round of questions from Miller.</p><p>It\u2019s a few silent moments before he speaks, and when he does, it\u2019s not at all the reaction I\u2019ve been bracing myself for. \u2018Well that was a surprise,\u2019 he muses quietly, making me frown. \u2018How did you come to keep company with William Anderson?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m totally perplexed. \u2018He was my mother\u2019s pimp,\u2019 I remind him, holding back on the information that I\u2019ve recently been enlightened on. And I know Miller won\u2019t appreciate the reminder of my encounter with William during my reckless spell, so I omit that, too. \u2018And while we\u2019re on the subject,\u2019 I fire, turning in his arms and stepping away from him, \u2018how did I come to be keeping company with you?\u2019</p><p>He looks at me a little bemused. \u2018You\u2019ve already defaulted on your no touching and tasting rule.\u2019 Stooping down, he lands me with a cheeky peck on my lips. Damn me, I don\u2019t shy away from it. \u2018It would be silly to reinstate it now.\u2019 His eyes are sparkling wildly, his face full of unseen victory. Silly because it was a given that I\u2019d fail, or silly because of where I might end up should I give in, which is ultimately in Miller\u2019s bed being worshipped.</p><p>\u2018It wouldn\u2019t be silly at all,\u2019 I counter with grit. While Miller-style worshipping is the ultimate escape from my troubles, I need to maintain my strength, no matter how much I want him to indulge me and swallow me up in his mind-blowing world of pleasure. \u2018Are we having dinner?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 He gestures across the road and, when I glance over, I see his car. \u2018After you.\u2019</p><p>My brow puckers, but I turn towards the restaurant instead. I don\u2019t get very far.</p><p>\u2018Wrong way,\u2019 he says simply, taking my nape and guiding me in the direction of his car with a little twist of his hand on my neck.</p><p>\u2018Dinner and a talk,\u2019 I remind him. \u2018You agreed to meet me for dinner and a talk.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, I agreed to meet you at the restaurant. You never specified that the eating and talking should happen there.\u2019</p><p>I laugh nervously, wondering where he plans on doing the eating and talking. \u2018You can\u2019t twist my words.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve not twisted anything.\u2019 He guides me across the road with ease and places me in his car. \u2018We\u2019re having dinner at my apartment.\u2019 The door shuts on me and the locks click into place.</p><p>Now I\u2019m freaking out. Being at Miller\u2019s is a bad, bad idea. I try the door, to no purpose whatsoever. I heard the locks. Then I hear them again and I try the handle once more but get nowhere. He slides in beside me. \u2018This is kidnapping!\u2019 I protest. \u2018I don\u2019t want to go to your apartment.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 he asks, starting the engine and pulling his seat belt on.</p><p>\u2018Because . . . I . . . because . . . it will . . .\u2019</p><p>\u2018Be natural for us to make love?\u2019 He slowly turns his eyes to me. Serious eyes.</p><p>The words alone send my pulse into overdrive. I\u2019m feeling hot, lustful and helpless, and that\u2019s a dangerous situation to be in with Miller Hart. \u2018Talk,\u2019 I murmur weakly.</p><p>He shifts in his seat and rests his forearm on the wheel. He can see my wanton condition. I\u2019m breathless. \u2018I\u2019ve always promised that I\u2019d never make you do anything I know you don\u2019t want to. Haven\u2019t I?\u2019</p><p>I nod.</p><p>He smiles a little and reaches over to rearrange my wild blond hair. \u2018Do you know how hard it is to refrain from touching you, especially when I know that you want me to?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I want to talk,\u2019 I affirm, finding my very last scrap of strength to utter my demand, leaving me defenceless should he choose to ignore my request.</p><p>\u2018And I want to explain, but I\u2019d like to do it in the comfort of my own home.\u2019 He says no more and returns his attention to the road, pulling away from the kerb. There\u2019s no speaking or even any glances across the car to me. The only thing I have to focus on, except my racing mind, are the words of Portishead\u2019s \u2018Glory Box\u2019 that echo in the enclosed air around us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They sink into my mind, making it spin, and then I hear Miller utter two words to himself, so quietly I barely hear. \u2018I will.\u2019</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>I\u2019m regretting insisting on the no tasting and touching rule. I\u2019m close to collapsing by floor nine as we climb up to his penthouse, and Miller\u2019s knowing look is a clear sign that he can detect my regret. But my hot face and aching calves also remind me of the first question I\u2019d like to ask.</p><p>He unlocks his black shiny door and stands to the side, holding it open for me and revealing the inside of his palatial apartment. The urge to run overwhelms me.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m not allowed to physically restrain you, so I beg you don\u2019t run away from me.\u2019</p><p>I turn my face up to his and find blue eyes full of pleading. He\u2019s being that respectful, loving man, the one I love most of his split personalities. \u2018I won\u2019t run,\u2019 I promise, stepping over the threshold and tentatively rounding the table in the entrance hall. The front door shuts behind me and Miller\u2019s fancy shoes click on the marble as he approaches.</p><p>\u2018Would you like some wine?\u2019 he asks, removing his jacket and draping it neatly over the back of a chair.</p><p>\u2018Water, please.\u2019 I\u2019m dehydrated after my marathon stair climb, and I need a clear head.</p><p>\u2018As you wish,\u2019 he says, disappearing into the kitchen and quickly returning with a bottle of spring water and a glass. He walks over to his drinks cabinet, pours two fingers of Scotch, and then turning to face me, he brings the glass to his lips slowly, making me avert my eyes to avoid the pleasurable sight. He knows what those lips do to me, and he\u2019s brandishing them unethically. \u2018Don\u2019t deprive me of your face, Olivia.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Don\u2019t deprive me of your respect,\u2019 I retort calmly.</p><p>He has nothing to say to that, so instead he says, \u2018Sit,\u2019 as he makes his way over with my water.</p><p>\u2018I thought we were having dinner?\u2019</p><p>He falters midstride. \u2018We are.\u2019</p><p>\u2018In the lounge?\u2019 I ask, my voice loaded with sarcasm. I know Miller Hart and his obsessive world of perfection, and there is not a chance in hell he would eat off his lap.</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s no need\u2014\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yes, there is,\u2019 I sigh. \u2018I assume we\u2019re eating in the kitchen.\u2019 I take the water being offered and leave Miller to head for the kitchen, coming to an abrupt halt at the doorway on a little gasp.</p><p>\u2018You didn\u2019t give me a chance to add the finishing touches,\u2019 he murmurs from behind me. \u2018Candles, music.\u2019</p><p>The smell of something delicious permeates the room and the table is laid Miller-perfect. I could have wandered into the Ritz by mistake. \u2018It\u2019s . . . perfect,\u2019 I breathe.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not perfect at all,\u2019 he says quietly, inching past me. He sets his drink down, tweaks its position, then lights the candles running up the centre of the table. Moving across the kitchen, he puts his iPhone in the docking station before playing with a few buttons. I just stare at him as Ellie Goulding\u2019s \u2018Explosions\u2019 seeps from the speakers and he slowly turns to face me. \u2018It\u2019s still not perfect,\u2019 he says, wandering slowly over. He lifts his hand hesitantly and looks to me for permission. I nod, letting him gently take my hand, and follow his steps across the kitchen. The chair at one end is pulled out and he releases me, indicating for me to take a seat. I follow his request and let him tuck me neatly under. \u2018Now it\u2019s perfect,\u2019 he whispers in my ear, stealing a nip of my lobe and throwing me into desire desolation. I\u2019m tense everywhere, and he knows it. After ensuring I get a few unbearably gratifying moments of his heated breath in my ear, he takes his time ripping his bended body from my seated frame. \u2018Wine?\u2019 he asks.</p><p>I close my eyes briefly to gather some abandoned strength. \u2018No, thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Being free from alcohol won\u2019t sate your desire for me, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>He places a cloth napkin across my lap before taking the chair at the other end. He\u2019s right, of course, but avoiding alcohol might help me think clearer.</p><p>\u2018The distance is acceptable?\u2019 he asks, indicating between us with a sway of his hand.</p> <p>No, it\u2019s not; he seems so far away, but it would be foolish to tell him so. Not that I need to tell him a thing. He knows very well. I nod and scan the table before me, my usual nerves present whenever I\u2019m presented with a table set by Miller. \u2018What are you feeding me?\u2019</p><p>He restrains a grin and pours some red wine into one of the larger wine glasses. \u2018I can\u2019t feed you anything from over here.\u2019</p><p>I bite my lip and resist the urge to fiddle with the fork at my place setting, knowing I\u2019ll never replace it accurately.</p><p>\u2018Do you like me feeding you?\u2019 he asks, pulling my eyes from the perfect table to his perfect face.</p><p>\u2018You know the answer to that question.\u2019 Images of strawberries and puddles of dark chocolate jump all over my mind.</p><p>\u2018I do,\u2019 he agrees. \u2018And I don\u2019t need to tell you how much I enjoy nourishing you.\u2019</p><p>I nod in silent acknowledgment, remembering the satisfaction on his face.</p><p>\u2018And worshipping you.\u2019</p><p>I squirm in my chair, fighting off the throb threatening to attack me between my thighs. No matter what persona he takes on, he has me every time. \u2018We\u2019re supposed to be talking,\u2019 I point out, eager to steer away from thoughts of worshipping, strawberries dipped in warm chocolate, and Miller\u2019s general magnetism.</p><p>\u2018We are talking.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why are you so terrified of elevators?\u2019 I go for the jugular but feel immediately guilty when his face drops just a tiny bit. He quickly gathers himself, though.</p><p>\u2018I have a phobia of enclosed spaces.\u2019 He swirls his wine thoughtfully while he watches me. \u2018Which is why you\u2019ll never convince me to hide in a closet.\u2019</p><p>My guilt is increased by his confession and my unwitting demand in my bedroom that time. \u2018I didn\u2019t know,\u2019 I whisper, also reminded of his terrified face when I refused to get out of the elevator. I\u2019d worked it out as I fled the hotel and I used it against him.</p><p>\u2018Of course you didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t tell you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Where does it stem from?\u2019</p><p>His shoulders jump up a little and he looks away, evading my eyes. \u2018I don\u2019t know. Many people have phobias of certain things with no explanation.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You have an explanation, though, don\u2019t you?\u2019 I press.</p><p>He won\u2019t look at me.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s polite to look at me when I\u2019m talking to you, and it\u2019s polite to answer someone when they ask you a question.\u2019</p><p>Blue eyes filled with irritation slowly find mine. \u2018Overthinking, Olivia. I have a phobia of enclosed spaces, and that line of conversation will finish right there.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What about your freakish tidiness?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I have an appreciation for my possessions. That doesn\u2019t make me a freak.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You have more than that,\u2019 I reply. \u2018You have obsessive-compulsive disorder.\u2019</p><p>Miller\u2019s mouth drops open a little. \u2018Because I like things a certain way, I have a disorder?\u2019</p><p>I exhale a wary breath and stop my elbows from hitting the table just in time. He won\u2019t acknowledge his freakish obsessiveness, and it\u2019s clear I\u2019m getting nothing on the claustrophobia front, either. But these are trivial issues in the grand scheme of things. There are more important things to address. \u2018The newspaper. Why was the title changed?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I realise how that looks, but it was for your benefit.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How?\u2019</p><p>His lips fix in a straight line. \u2018To protect you. Trust me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Trust you?\u2019 I fight off the urge to laugh in his face. \u2018I trusted you with everything! How long have you been London\u2019s most notorious male escort?\u2019 The words feel like acid burning my tongue as I spit them from my mouth.</p><p>\u2018Are you sure you wouldn\u2019t like some wine?\u2019 He lifts the bottle from the table and looks at me hopefully. It\u2019s a pathetic attempt to avoid my question.</p><p>\u2018No, thank you. An answer would be nice, though.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How about some appetisers?\u2019 He stands and strides over to the fridge, without waiting for my answer. I can\u2019t eat with my stomach in such knots and my brain a fuzz of unanswered questions, and I doubt my appetite will appear once I finally squeeze the answers from him.</p><p>He opens the huge mirrored fridge and pulls out a platter of something. Then he shuts the door but doesn\u2019t return to the table, instead messing with whatever\u2019s on the tray, poking and shifting things around. He\u2019s trying to buy time, and when he glances cautiously up to the mirror, he catches me watching him in the reflection. He knows I know his game.</p><p>\u2018You said you\u2019re ready to answer my questions,\u2019 I remind him, keeping my determined stare on him in the mirror.</p><p>His eyes drop to the tray briefly, and then he slowly turns on a deep breath and makes his way back to the table, pushing that dark lock of hair off his forehead en route. I nearly choke when the platter is placed with utter accuracy, revealing a pile of oysters.</p><p>\u2018Help yourself.\u2019 He gestures to the silver dish, then sits.</p><p>I ignore his offer, annoyed by his choice for starters, and ask my question once again. \u2018How long?\u2019</p><p>Lifting his plate, he takes three oysters and sets them neatly down. \u2018I\u2019ve been an escort for ten years,\u2019 he says, choosing not to look at me as he delivers his answer.</p><p>I want to gasp in shock, but I resist, instead taking my water to moisten my suddenly parched mouth. \u2018Why notorious?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because I\u2019m unforgiving.\u2019</p><p>Now I do gasp, and I hate myself for it. This shouldn\u2019t be news to me. I\u2019ve experienced him being unforgiving.</p><p>He sees me struggling but continues. \u2018Because in the bedroom, I\u2019m wicked, unloving, unfeeling, and unbothered by it. The women can\u2019t get enough of me and the men can\u2019t work out why that is.\u2019</p><p>\u2018They pay for you\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018To be the best f**k of their life,\u2019 he finishes for me. \u2018And they pay obscene amounts for the privilege.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t get it.\u2019 I shake my head, my eyes darting all over his flawless table. \u2018You don\u2019t let them kiss you or touch you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018When I\u2019m naked, no. When we\u2019re intimate, no. I\u2019m a perfect gentleman on dates, Olivia. They can feel me over my clothes, work themselves up and enjoy my attention. But that\u2019s as far as their control goes. I\u2019m the perfect mix of man for them. Arrogant . . . attentive . . . talented.\u2019</p><p>I inwardly wince. \u2018Do you get anything from it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 he admits. \u2018I\u2019m in full control in the bedroom and I come every time.\u2019</p><p>I flinch at his earnest words, looking away, feeling sick and wounded. \u2018Right.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Show me that face,\u2019 he demands harshly, and my head lifts automatically, finding soft eyes replacing the hard ice. \u2018But nothing will ever come close to the pleasure I gain from worshipping you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m struggling to see that man now,\u2019 I say, making the softness of his expression drift into misery. \u2018I so wish you\u2019d never made me one of them.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Never more than me,\u2019 he whispers, slumping back in his chair. \u2018Tell me there\u2019s hope.\u2019</p><p>All I can see is Miller in that hotel room. My desire and need for him are still there, but our short conversation has brought the harsh reality of his life crashing down around me. I\u2019m not equipped with enough strength to deal with him. If I let him in again, then I\u2019m facing a lifetime of torture and possibly regret. Nothing will make me forget the unforgiving lover. All I\u2019ll see when he takes me is a red mist of misery. My life has been difficult enough as it is. I can\u2019t make it harder.</p><p>\u2018I asked you a question,\u2019 he says quietly. The tone of his voice tells me he\u2019s slipping into that clipped, arrogant mode, probably because he can see my sudden despondency, and with a flick of my eyes to his, I see that arrogance, too. He won\u2019t go down easily. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018The woman in Madrid?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t sleep with her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then why did you go?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Prior obligation.\u2019 He\u2019s impassive and sharp, yet strangely I believe him.

But a definitely should always win over a maybe. The confliction is too much. It\u2019s tearing me apart.</p><p>He watches me carefully. Nervously. \u2018You\u2019re leaving, aren\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve asked my questions. I never said I\u2019d stay once you answered them. And I never said I\u2019d like or accept the answers.\u2019 The definitely wins. William wins. I leave the kitchen hastily to escape the intensity that he\u2019s exuding.</p><p>\u2018Olivia!\u2019</p><p>Swinging the front door open, I dash from his apartment, knowing he\u2019ll never allow me to leave without a fight. My troubled mind only just allows me to register my safest route from his building. I head straight for the lift. My heart is thumping chaotically, my breathing panicked and frenzied as I bash the call button.</p> <p>\u2018Olivia, don\u2019t get in that lift, please!\u2019 His charging footsteps have me repeatedly smacking the metal button and cursing while I wait for what seems like decades for the doors to slide open. \u2018Fuck! Olivia!\u2019</p><p>I dive in, smack the button for the ground floor, and push myself up against the far wall. I\u2019m being cruel, but desperation is overriding any guilt I\u2019m feeling for using this weakness against him.</p><p>I knew he\u2019d make it in time, but I still jump when his arm appears and crashes against the doors, pulling them open. His brow is a sheen of sweat, his eyes wide with fear. \u2018Get out!\u2019 he yells, his broad shoulders heaving.</p><p>I shake my head. \u2018No.\u2019</p><p>His jaw looks set to shatter from tenseness. \u2018Get out of the f**king lift!\u2019</p><p>I keep quiet, pushing myself further into the wall. He\u2019s fuming mad, frighteningly so.</p><p>\u2018How could you do this?\u2019 he pants, yanking the door open when it tries to close again. \u2018How?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t be with you, Miller.\u2019 My voice is barely audible over his laboured breathing and my clattering heart.</p> <p>\u2018Livy, I beg you, don\u2019t do this to me again.\u2019 He\u2019s beginning to shake, his eyes darting continuously from me to the inside of the elevator.</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t forget that man.\u2019 I reach out and press the button again.</p><p>\u2018Fuck!\u2019 He releases the doors and they start to close. \u2018I refuse to give up, Olivia.\u2019 Blue eyes glaze over, his expression straightening. \u2018I won\u2019t lose.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve already lost,\u2019 I murmur as his face disappears.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ve ended up here. Probably to reinforce my decision. Seeing the four-poster bed, the regal room, and the images of me restrained is helping steel my resolve. But it\u2019s also magnifying the pain. I\u2019m standing in the middle of the hotel room, gazing around, torturing myself further and praying for some strength to see me through. Run away. Disappear for ever. I can see no other way. My skin is prickling and cold. My eyes are sore with tears. The plans I started to make so many times need to be completed and fulfilled now. I need to go away for a while, put space between us and hope the saying \u2018out of sight, out of mind\u2019 is true. For both of us.</p><p>\u2018Why did you come here?\u2019 The question filters through the rush of blood that\u2019s distorting my hearing, dragging me back into the chilly room.</p><p>\u2018To help convince myself that I\u2019m doing the right thing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Does it feel right?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I admit. Nothing feels right. It\u2019s all so very wrong. I hear the door click shut, snapping me from my daydream, and I swing around to find a mess of a man, his hair wild, his suit crumpled. But his blue eyes are relieved.</p><p>\u2018I won\u2019t lose,\u2019 he says, resting his hands in his pocket. \u2018I can\u2019t lose, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>Tears begin to trickle down my cheeks as I stand before him, defeated.</p><p>Conquered.</p><p>His back hits the door, his own eyes glazing over as his body sags into the wood. The sight of Miller Hart fighting to prevent his tears from falling rips my heart from my chest and makes my knees buckle, sending my body folding to the floor. My chin hits my chest, and my hair tumbles over my shoulders. And I cry. The broken man before me has always made my eyes hurt, but this time it\u2019s not with pleasure at his beauty. This time it\u2019s seeing him looking so tormented. Desperate. Ruined.</p><p>I\u2019m engulfed by him in a nanosecond, his warm arms wrapped tightly around me, my face pushed into his chest. \u2018Don\u2019t cry,\u2019 he whispers, pulling me onto his lap. \u2018I need you to be strong for me.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m scooped up and carried to the bed. \u2018It ends here,\u2019 he says, laying me down gently and spreading his body over me, burying his face in my neck. I don\u2019t fight. I let his body melt into mine, let his strength seep into me, holding onto him like my life depends on it. He does the same. Each of us is squeezing tightly, both of our hearts pounding a strong, steady thrum. I can hear the beats. We\u2019re both coming back to life.</p><p>His head lifts slowly until I\u2019m staring into blue eyes filled with anguish. \u2018I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019 He wipes my eyes. \u2018I know I\u2019ve run away, too, but I accept it now.\u2019 He dips and kisses me gently, his soft lips wanted and terribly needed. \u2018I need you to do the same.\u2019 He sits up and pulls me onto his lap with ease, swamping me with his arms and kissing my face repeatedly. \u2018What we have is beautiful, Olivia. I can\u2019t give it up.\u2019 He grasps my dress by the hem but doesn\u2019t set about removing it. \u2018May I?\u2019</p><p>I answer by pushing his suit jacket from his shoulders, and he drops my dress to allow me to rid him of it. I need his na**d skin on mine.</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 he breathes, removing my dress and casting it aside. His lips find mine and begin a delicate caress, his tongue tentative and soft as it slips into my mouth. My mind blanks, but my body responds instinctively. I accept his kiss, returning his soft, lazy pace, soaking up the emotion pouring from his entire being. His warm hands are all over me, touching and feeling everywhere, reminding me of the lack of skin beneath my palms. I start unbuttoning his waistcoat, then his shirt, until my hands are diving inside the material, feeling him everywhere for too short a time before I\u2019m pushing the garments from his body, refusing to release his lips, not even to take in his perfect torso. Once his arms are free again, he unhooks the clasp of my bra and slowly pulls it from my body, exposing my tight, tingling ni**les. He breaks our kiss, and I whimper in protest, reaching down to unfasten his trousers.</p><p>That hypnotising mouth is parted, allowing breathy pants to escape, and his eyes are focused on my modest br**sts. I pull at his trousers once they\u2019re undone, impatient for him to be naked.</p><p>He rips his eyes from my chest and looks up at me. \u2018Taste me.\u2019</p><p>I waste no time, but I seek out his neck rather than his mouth, nibbling on his throat and taking a long inhale of his manly scent. I\u2019m all over him, making him moan and mumble in gratification.</p><p>\u2018My mouth,\u2019 he groans, and I divert immediately to his lips with his plea. \u2018Oh Jesus, Olivia.\u2019 Big palms find my cheeks and hold my head securely while we kiss, soft and slow. \u2018I can\u2019t imagine anything could feel better than kissing you,\u2019 he says against my lips. \u2018Tell me you\u2019re mine.\u2019</p><p>I nod against him and meet his swirling tongue as he takes me down to the bed, letting me quickly push his trousers down his long legs. He abandons me momentarily, producing a condom from nowhere and slipping it on, hissing and clenching his eyes shut before falling back down to my body. I whimper when he settles between my thighs and I feel the broad head of his erection nudging at my entrance.</p><p>\u2018Say it.\u2019 He bites at my bottom lip, rearing back. \u2018Don\u2019t deny me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yours.\u2019 There\u2019s no question.</p><p>He rests his forehead on mine and pushes into me on a controlled surge of breath. \u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miller,\u2019 I sigh, feeling the pieces of my fallen heart merging back together. My eyes close on a satisfied exhale, a peace settling over me, and he begins a lazy sway of his hips. With my hands free, I can touch him, and I make the most of it, slowly sliding my palms everywhere, feeling every inch of him. Our tongues are dancing sweetly, his h*ps are rolling gently, and reverence is pouring from him. He\u2019s fully redeemed, his attentiveness extinguishing the horror scene of this hotel, this perfect moment reminding me of the sweet, gentle man he is when he\u2019s worshipping me \u2013 the man I need him to be. The man he wants to be. For me.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m never freeing your lips,\u2019 he declares, our sweaty bodies slipping languidly. \u2018Never.\u2019 I\u2019m rolled from beneath him so I\u2019m straddling his lap, still full to the maximum, the movement sending him so incredibly deep.</p><p>\u2018Oh God!\u2019 My palms slap into his abs and brace, my chin hitting my chest.</p><p>\u2018Fuck!\u2019 Miller curses, grinding up into me, his hands gripping the tops of my thighs. \u2018Olivia Taylor,\u2019 he whispers. \u2018My most precious possession.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re never freeing my lips,\u2019 I choke through the desire, then gasp as his palm is quickly secured on my nape and yanking me down to his face. He thrusts up again. I cry out.</p><p>Then he sends me out of my mind with a kiss so full of hunger, I struggle to remember my name.</p><p>\u2018Move.\u2019 He nips my tongue and encourages me by smoothing his hands around to my bottom and tugging up. I feel him slip from my passage, instigating a delicious friction that prompts me to fly up on a yell. My hands delve into my hair. \u2018That\u2019s it, Livy!\u2019</p><p>The pleasure contorting his face injects some fortitude into me. I lift and fall onto his lap uncontrolled. \u2018Like that?\u2019 I ask, not waiting for his answer. His clenched eyes tell me, so I repeat, gripping my blond masses of hair harshly. \u2018Miller, tell me!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 His eyes fly open, his jaw clenched. \u2018You can do whatever the f**king hell you want to me, Olivia. I\u2019ll take it all.\u2019</p><p>I pause, breathing heavily, feeling him throb incessantly within me, my muscles stroking every pulse. \u2018Me too.\u2019</p><p>He moves quickly, taking me to my back and slipping back into me with ease. Then his fingertip makes a lazy trail down my hot cheek before he claims my mouth again. \u2018I wish you were in my bed,\u2019 he murmurs around my lips, circling his hips, beginning another excruciating pattern of steady circles and deep plunges. \u2018Please say I can take you back to my bed and cuddle you all night.\u2019</p><p>His request triggers a question, making me break our kiss so I can ask, \u2018How can cuddling be your thing?\u2019 I don\u2019t allow him time to answer. I\u2019m missing his mouth terribly already, so I waste no time sealing my lips to his and dipping my tongue in his mouth as he continues to rock lazily into me.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s only a thing with you.\u2019 He nibbles on my lip and plants feathery kisses from one corner of my mouth to another. \u2018I just want to squeeze you to death.\u2019</p><p>I smile up at him and nearly burst into tears when he blasts me back with his rare but beautiful smile, his blue eyes twinkling wildly. He really has redeemed himself, the brutal Miller long forgotten. I want his lips on mine again, but I also want to look at his face when it\u2019s smiling the brightest I\u2019ve ever seen. \u2018I love your smile,\u2019 I declare on a breathy gasp, just as he blesses me with a smooth rotation of his groin, catching me just perfectly on my front wall. \u2018Oh God!\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I only smile for you.\u2019 He pecks my lips and pushes his torso up so he\u2019s braced on his long, lean arms. \u2018I love your br**sts.\u2019 He flicks his eyes to them and licks his lips provocatively.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t have much.\u2019 I almost want to cover my lack of assets with my palms but my hands have other ideas and are feeling out his forearms.</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ.\u2019 He gasps a little and slowly closes his eyes as he delivers the ultimate, deep, precise grind. My muscles stiffen, and I push against his rooted arms.</p><p>\u2018Oh my goodness,\u2019 I gasp, feeling the head of a delicious orgasm brimming.</p> <p>\u2018Are you going to come, sweet girl?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I moan, my back bowing, my legs curling around his waist. The hot rush of pressure in my groin is descending swiftly.</p><p>Dropping his head, he slowly peels his eyes open and falls to his forearms. \u2018Give me your lips.\u2019 He groans as he plunges, retreats, and inches carefully back into me. The crippling pleasure that he\u2019s inflicting on me is sending me dizzy. \u2018Livy, I\u2019ve asked once.\u2019</p><p>He puts his face closer to mine so with a slight lift of my head, our tongues meet and begin duelling delicately, but when I start shaking as my cl**ax takes hold, he pushes further into me, kissing me ardently and moaning loudly. My hands find his hair and dive into his wet waves, pushing into the back of his head.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m coming,\u2019 I groan. \u2018Miller, I\u2019m coming.\u2019 I start to contract around him and try to harden my kiss as I\u2019m attacked by waves of pleasure, but he doesn\u2019t allow me to. He just pulls away ever so slightly for a few seconds before brushing our lips together, silently guiding me.</p> <p>Hot sparks of pleasure seem to attack me from every direction. I can\u2019t breathe through the overwhelming sensations. I scream. I explode. My flesh pulses and my eyes become heavy as he continues to worship my mouth and thrust lazily into me. I can feel the shattered pieces of me pulling back together again under his adoring attention. We can do this. As long as we have each other, we can battle through the challenges before us. My fortitude has never been so strong.</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 I sigh on a smile, letting my arms flop above my head.</p><p>\u2018Never thank me.\u2019</p><p>Through my blissed-out state, I vaguely register the absence of him softening within me. \u2018You haven\u2019t come,\u2019 I wheeze.</p><p>He slowly pulls out of me and starts to kiss his way down my body until his head is between my thighs and he\u2019s sending me delirious with a tickling flick of his tongue over my quivering flesh, followed by a firm lash straight up my centre. I writhe under him, trying to control the pulsing twinges as he crawls back up my body and sinks his tongue back into my mouth.</p><p>\u2018I worship you.\u2019 He drops a kiss lightly on my forehead and circles our noses. \u2018Give me my thing.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018My arms don\u2019t work.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Give me my thing, Livy.\u2019 He raises cautionary eyebrows at me, making me smile more. \u2018Now.\u2019</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take much effort at all to fulfil his demand. My arms circle his shoulders and crush him to me. \u2018I want to be in your bed,\u2019 I mumble into his hair, wishing I were there already.</p><p>\u2018Then you will be.\u2019 He rolls over, taking me with him, and then pushes me up so I\u2019m astride his stomach. He studies me quietly.</p><p>\u2018What are you thinking?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ve never been shocked in my life,\u2019 he says, reaching up and circling my ni**les until they\u2019re bullets, tingling and sensitive, \u2018but when you threw that money on the table in Langan\u2019s, I had to resist coughing up my wine.\u2019</p><p>I blush a little at my own brashness, wholeheartedly wishing I never had. \u2018I won\u2019t be doing it again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Neither will I,\u2019 he whispers, transferring a hand to my wrist and stroking over the area where the sores have now faded to nothing. \u2018I\u2019m so sorry. I was so consumed with desperation to\u2014\u2019</p> <p>I pull my arm from his grip and shut him up by dropping my body to his and my lips to his mouth. \u2018Please don\u2019t feel guilty.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I appreciate your compassion, but nothing you can say will ease my remorse.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I pushed you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s no excuse.\u2019 He sits up and shifts us to the edge of the bed, placing me on my feet. \u2018I\u2019m going to make it up to you, Olivia Taylor,\u2019 he vows, standing and cupping my cheeks in his palms. \u2018I\u2019ll make you forget that man.\u2019 His lips meet mine, reinforcing his words, and I nod my acceptance against him. \u2018He\u2019s not the man I want to be for you.\u2019</p><p>I let him drown me in his mouth and remorse, let him push me up the wall desperately, let him feel me everywhere. \u2018Take me to your bed,\u2019 I plead, needing the comfort and security that being in Miller\u2019s arms and bed brings \u2013 something that I\u2019m not wholly feeling here in this hotel room, where the four-poster bed is a constant reminder of an entirely different Miller.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll do anything you want me to,\u2019 he breathes, letting up a little on his apology kiss and pecking continuously at my lips. \u2018Anything you want. Please try to erase what\u2019s happened.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then take me away from here,\u2019 I insist. \u2018Get me out of this room.\u2019</p><p>He starts to panic a little, pulling away when he realises the extent of my desperation to escape the reminders. It\u2019s made him desperate, too. He shakes himself into action, removing the condom and getting dressed at lightning speed, not caring for a straight tie or a crease-free suit. He leaves his shirt half unbuttoned and hanging out of his trousers, his waistcoat is thrown on haphazardly and his jacket equally so, before he\u2019s snatching up my dress and quickly getting me into it.</p><p>After grasping my hand, he leads me away from the coldness of the extravagant hotel room. We take the stairs, and he looks back every few steps to check up on me. \u2018Am I going too fast?\u2019 he asks while keeping up his determined stride.</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I answer, my legs struggling to keep up but wanting to go faster. Nothing will get me out of this place quick enough.</p><p>We hit the palatial foyer of the hotel, both of us catching the eye of the posh clientele in our dishevelled state. I\u2019m not concerned by the looks and neither is Miller. He practically throws the room\u2019s key card over the desk to the lady at the reception. He\u2019s as desperate to get out of here as I am.</p><p>The car park feels like miles away, when it is only around the corner. The journey feels like hours when it\u2019s probably only minutes. The stairs to Miller\u2019s apartment feels like thousands, but there are probably only a few hundred. And as soon as the door is shut behind us, my dress is pulled impatiently from my body, my underwear discarded, and I\u2019m lifted up to his carelessly dressed physique and carried across his apartment, while he indulges me in his mouth the whole way, except we don\u2019t enter his bedroom. He takes me to his studio and places me on the sofa, where I sit awkwardly and a little bewildered by his mounting desperation as he hurries out of his clothes, leaving them a pile of expensive material on the floor. Bringing his body down over mine, he engulfs me completely and pins me to the old worn sofa beneath me. His face is in my neck, taking a long inhale of my hair, and then his mouth is on mine, working through delicately with his tongue, humming and moaning as his kiss gets harder, completely defeating the whole purpose of our reunion. It is always me driving things forward and Miller insisting on calm, and now I know why. But worry is getting the better of him.</p><p>I try to slow our kiss, bring it down a few levels, but he\u2019s blinded by purpose to make me forget. It\u2019s not incredibly hard, not at all, yet it\u2019s not what I want or need. \u2018Slow down,\u2019 I gasp, breaking away from his lips, but he homes in on my neck, resuming the force there. \u2018Miller, please!\u2019</p><p>At my short plea, he bolts upright in shock, his hands delving into his waves. The fear in his eyes is more than I can cope with, and it\u2019s in this moment I realise he\u2019s two entirely different people \u2013 physically and emotionally. At least he is now that I\u2019m in his life. I suspect before me he was simply the man disguised as a gentleman and the punishing lover \u2013 or escort.</p><p>\u2018Are you okay?\u2019 I ask, inching myself up into a sitting position.</p><p>\u2018I apologise.\u2019 He stands and walks to the huge window. His na**d back in the night glow looks almost ethereal. I feel the overwhelming need to be close to him, but he\u2019s lost in thought and I should let him have those thoughts. For so long, I\u2019ve thought it was just me who\u2019s the damaged half of this relationship. I was so wrong. Miller\u2019s more broken. I\u2019ve seen the result of this lifestyle. I saw the effect it had on my mother and the lifelong impact it\u2019s had on my grandmother. And on me, too. I\u2019ve done some stupid things. Except Miller has no family to affect. There\u2019s only him, no matter how I ask the question. And he isn\u2019t on his way to hell. I\u2019ve pulled him back, but that sobering claim strengthens my hope. Miller has spent too many years doing something he didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u2018Miller?\u2019</p><p>He slowly turns, and I don\u2019t like what I see.</p><p>Defeatism.</p><p>Sorrow.</p><p>Sadness.</p><p>His head drops. \u2018I\u2019m f**ked up, Olivia. I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve apologised enough. Stop saying you\u2019re sorry.\u2019 I can feel the panic flaring in me. \u2018Please, come here.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if you choose to, but you really should run a mile, sweet girl.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I snap, worried by his change in approach to our reunion. \u2018Come here.\u2019 I\u2019m about to physically fetch him myself when he starts to make his way over. He sits at the other end of the couch, too far away. \u2018Don\u2019t say things like that,\u2019 I warn, lying down on my back and resting my head in his na**d lap so I\u2019m looking up at him.</p><p>He drops his head so his eyes meet mine, his hands stroking through my hair. \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018If you say that one more time,\u2019 I warn, reaching up to feel his neck out. I pull him down, forcing him to bend so we\u2019re forehead to forehead. \u2018I\u2019ll . . .\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I admit, \u2018but I\u2019ll do something.\u2019 So I kiss him, because that is all there is left to do. And he lets me. It is me setting the delicate pace, me who\u2019s guiding Miller. I\u2019m the strong one right now. Me. It doesn\u2019t matter what has come before me. What matters is that we have both found each other and finally accepted each other. I feel it\u2019s like the blind leading the blind, but my determination is now fierce. I\u2019ve let him break down my barriers and, in the process, I\u2019ve innocently bashed down his, too. This feeling of his lips isn\u2019t something I\u2019m prepared to surrender. This sense of belonging isn\u2019t going to be given up. This is where I\u2019m supposed to be. I\u2019m not prepared to fight against this any more. I have the strength to help him. He gives me that strength.</p><p>He halts our kiss abruptly and breathes heavily in my face, making a deliberate show of stroking my cheeks and hair so very tenderly. \u2018Was that you telling me off?\u2019 he asks seriously, dropping a light peck on my nose. \u2018Because if so, then I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Stop it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re being silly.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll do something,\u2019 I warn, pulling a little on his hair.</p><p>He shifts my head from his lap and lays himself down, repositioning me so I\u2019m spread all over him, my face level with his. \u2018Please do,\u2019 he whispers, putting his lips close to mine and blinking teasingly slowly.</p><p>\u2018You want me to kiss you?\u2019 I ask quietly, keeping the distance between our mouths minimal and resisting the urge to capture the temptation within licking distance.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 He brushes our lips, and I lose all resistance, the enticement of him impossible to fight off. \u2018I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019</p><p>My tongue plunges relentlessly but softly, working smoothly and with complete reverence. We\u2019re back to where we belong. My world is right again. Everything can be forgiven, except now there is so much more to forgive. His rules, the ones that prevented me from touching him and kissing him, are being blown out of the water now. I\u2019m feeling him everywhere, kissing him like I\u2019ll never have the pleasure again. It\u2019s loving, meaningful, and completely mind-blanking. It\u2019s perfect.</p><p>\u2018I love your punishments,\u2019 he mumbles, twisting onto his side and pulling me closer to his chest, still kissing me and still feeling me everywhere. \u2018Stay with me tonight.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m the one who severs the contact, my lips stinging and swollen. His dark stubble is always so prickly and coarse, but familiar and comforting. I run my palm down his cheek and watch his lips as they part when my thumb drags across them. \u2018I don\u2019t want to stay just one night,\u2019 I murmur. My eyes reluctantly climb his nose until I\u2019m staring into blue circles of understanding.</p> <p>\u2018I want you to stay for ever,\u2019 he replies softly, following up his words with a hard push of his lips on mine. \u2018I need to put you in my bed.\u2019 He untangles us from the sofa and picks me up, resuming his kiss as I lie across his arms and he carries me to his bedroom.</p><p>\u2018Do you know how you make me feel?\u2019 he asks, placing me gently down and encouraging me to turn onto my front.</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 I turn my face into the pillow when he begins a slow, delicate flick of his tongue up the column of my spine, finishing with a soft kiss on my shoulder blade.</p><p>The hard head of his erection teases my opening, making my arse lift fractionally to urge him on. \u2018Thank God I have you again.\u2019 He sinks into me on a harsh pull of breath, then holds still, trying to regain control of his breathing. I bite at the pillow, moaning quietly. The hardness of his torso is pressing into my back, pushing me into the mattress, and my fists are balling into the sheets. \u2018You\u2019ve taken the only resilient part of me and annihilated it, Livy,\u2019 he whispers hoarsely, performing an easy grind of his hips.</p><p>I turn my heated face back outwards when I feel his lips at my ear and find dark lashes framing sparkling blue eyes. \u2018I don\u2019t want to take anything. I want you to give it to me.\u2019</p> <p>He retreats slowly and pushes forward firmly, again and again, drawing constant moans of pleasure each and every time. \u2018What do you want me to give you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s the most resilient part of you?\u2019 I groan the words through an excruciatingly deep thrust.</p><p>\u2018My heart, Livy. My heart is the most resilient part of me.\u2019 He loses control momentarily and bucks forward on a bark.</p><p>My chest swells at his admission. \u2018Let me see you.\u2019 I wriggle under his body. \u2018Please, I need to see you properly.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fucking hell,\u2019 he curses, and quickly slips out of me, allowing me to spin over and grab at his shoulders before he quickly re-enters me, pounding forward uncontrolled. \u2018Livy!\u2019 he shouts, pushing his torso up on his arms. He holds still, panting and staring down at me. \u2018I\u2019m petrified of you.\u2019</p><p>I tilt my h*ps up, making him drop his chin to his chest, his waves falling forward as he does. \u2018I\u2019m scared of you, too,\u2019 I whisper. \u2018Terrified.\u2019</p> <p>He lifts his eyes and circles his hips. \u2018I\u2019m an emotion virgin, Livy. You\u2019re my first.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What are you saying?\u2019 I ask quietly.</p><p>He goes to speak, then seems to think better of it, his eyes darting all over my face. \u2018I\u2019ve fallen, Olivia Taylor,\u2019 he whispers.</p><p>I bite down on my bottom lip to prevent a sob slipping free. That\u2019s the only thing that matters. \u2018You fascinate me,\u2019 I counter. I\u2019m reaffirming my feeling, making it known that nothing has changed. I\u2019ve wasted too much precious time pushing him away \u2013 time that I could have been helping him and making myself stronger.</p><p>He drops to his forearms and starts pumping his h*ps slowly, carrying me further into rapture. \u2018Please don\u2019t drop me,\u2019 he breathes.</p><p>I shake my head and feel the back of his head out, meeting each one of his advances with matching thrusts of my hips. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, but I do know that my feelings are profound. And now they\u2019ve only been strengthened.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve been saved by a gorgeous, sweet girl,\u2019 he whispers, gazing down at me. \u2018She makes my heart quicken and my senses slow.\u2019</p><p>I close my eyes, letting him drive on, the perfection of this moment tearing at my soul.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m going to come,\u2019 he gasps, \u2018Olivia!\u2019</p><p>My eyes snap open, my body squirming under his hard physique. His pace has advanced, along with my pleasure. Our bodies are locked together, as are our eyes, and the connection remains intact until we both whimper as our cl**axes take hold in unison and both of us go rigid, gasping into each other\u2019s faces. A strange sensation floods me. Literally. My insides are warm, feeling good. Too good.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re not wearing a condom,\u2019 I say quietly.</p><p>Recognition dawns on his perfect face, his gentle drives halting too abruptly. He thinks hard for a few moments before he eventually speaks. \u2018I guess I\u2019m not the gentleman I claim to be.\u2019</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t smile, given the serious situation, but I do. Miller\u2019s unusual show of humour, even if it\u2019s inappropriate, makes it impossible not to. \u2018You have a dry humour.\u2019</p><p>He pushes into me, deep and high, his semi-hard-on stroking me, reminding me of the rightness of his bareness. \u2018There\u2019s nothing dry about our current condition.\u2019</p><p>I laugh. Miller Hart never ceases to amaze me. \u2018That\u2019s terrible!\u2019</p><p>\u2018It feels pretty damn good to me.\u2019 He flashes me a boyish grin and dips to bite my cheek. He\u2019s right, it feels incredible, but that doesn\u2019t make it a good thing.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll need to visit my doctor.\u2019 I push my face to his mouth and muster the strength required to hold him tightly.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll take you. I accept full responsibility.\u2019 Pulling back, he studies me closely. \u2018It felt better than I ever imagined. It\u2019ll be difficult to return to condoms.\u2019</p><p>I comprehend something immediately. \u2018You knew, didn\u2019t you? The whole time you were aware.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It felt too good to stop.\u2019 He kisses my startled face chastely. \u2018Besides, we can ask the doctor to prescribe you the pill while we\u2019re there.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We can?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 he answers surely. \u2018Now I\u2019ve had you with nothing between us, I\u2019m greedy for more.\u2019</p><p>I have nothing to say to that.</p><p>\u2018Would you mind if we slept on the sofa in my studio?\u2019 he asks.</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It soothes me, and with you in my thing, too, I\u2019m going to sleep extremely well.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019d love to.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good, not that you had a choice.\u2019 He scoops me up and transports me back to his art studio, where I\u2019m placed neatly on the old squidgy sofa before he mirrors me, pulling me back to his chest and resting his head on mine so we both have the stunning view in sight. The silence surrounding us gives me an opportunity to consider some of the answers I\u2019m still to learn.</p><p>\u2018Why wouldn\u2019t you let me kiss you?\u2019 I whisper.</p><p>I feel him stiffen behind me, and I don\u2019t like it. \u2018I\u2019m reluctant to answer any more of your questions, Livy. I don\u2019t want you to run away again.\u2019</p><p>I find his hand and bring it to my mouth, kissing it sweetly. \u2018I won\u2019t run.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Promise me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I promise.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 He tugs at me, helping me to turn around and face him. He wants eye contact while we\u2019re conversing. \u2018Kissing is a very intimate act,\u2019 he says, pulling my face to his and giving me a long, slow, languid one, both of us humming contentedly.</p><p>\u2018So is sex.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re wrong.\u2019 He pulls away and scans my confused face. \u2018There is only intimacy if there is feeling.\u2019</p><p>I absorb his words in an instant. \u2018We have feeling.\u2019</p><p>He smiles and makes an elaborate gesture of feeling by coating my face in wet kisses. I don\u2019t stop him. I let him stifle me completely. I drown in his affection until he decides that my face has been given enough intimacy. The knowledge of Miller\u2019s rules, the no kissing or touching, sends a warm feeling of satisfaction deep into the very centre of me, alleviating the anguish that\u2019s crippled me since my discovery. He allows me to kiss him and he allows me to touch and feel him. Those women missed out on something obscenely gratifying.</p><p>\u2018You haven\u2019t slept with a woman since you met me?\u2019</p><p>He shakes his head.</p><p>\u2018Yet you\u2019ve had\u2019 \u2013 I pause, thinking what word I should use \u2013 \u2018bookings?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dates,\u2019 he corrects me. \u2018Yes, I\u2019ve had dates.\u2019</p><p>William\u2019s curiosity gets the better of me. He wondered how Miller managed to uphold his dates without ha**ng s*x with those women. If I hate my own curiosity, then I despise William\u2019s. \u2018If they pay to get the best f**k of their life, then how did you avoid giving it to them?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It wasn\u2019t without its difficulties.\u2019 He brushes my hair from my face. \u2018I\u2019m not a fan of small talk.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You talked?\u2019 I ask, shocked.</p><p>\u2018I might have said the odd word when I was paying attention. Most of the time I was thinking of you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are we done?\u2019 he asks, clearly uncomfortable with the conversation, yet I\u2019m not. I should be. I should be satisfied with his offered information, glad he\u2019s opened up and enlightened me, glad there are no feelings involved. But I\u2019m not. I\u2019m too confused.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t understand why those women want you like that.\u2019 Good Lord, if they experienced what I have with Miller Hart, if they were worshipped, then I\u2019m certain they would be bashing down the door to get to him.</p><p>\u2018I make them orgasm.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Women pay thousands for an orgasm?\u2019 I blurt. \u2018That\u2019s . . .\u2019 I\u2019m about to say obscene, but then I recall each of my own orgasms and Miller\u2019s hint of a smile tells me he knows what I\u2019m thinking. I deflate. \u2018You make all women feel as good as I do when you have me in bed.\u2019</p><p>He nods.</p><p>\u2018So there\u2019s nothing special about me.\u2019 I sound hurt. I am hurt.</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ,\u2019 he argues, and I\u2019m about to challenge him, but he hushes me with his glorious lips, sweeping his tongue through my mouth slowly. My senses scramble and I completely forget what I was going to say. \u2018There\u2019s something very special about you, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I ask, relishing his attention.</p><p>\u2018You make me feel as good as I know I make you feel \u2013 something that no one else has ever done or ever will. I had sex with women. Nothing about any of those encounters made my heart race.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You said it was pleasurable,\u2019 I remind him, keeping myself attached to him. \u2018I didn\u2019t get any pleasure when you took me like that. Did you?\u2019 I definitely remember him cl**axing.</p><p>\u2018I felt nothing but disgrace before, during, and after.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because I swore on my own life that I\u2019d never tarnish you with my dirty brush.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then why didn\u2019t you stop?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I blacked out.\u2019 He drops my lips and shifts uncomfortably. \u2018When that switch flicks, I don\u2019t register anything except my own aim.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How do these women get any satisfaction from it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018They desire me. But I\u2019m unobtainable. Everyone wants what they can\u2019t have.\u2019 He watches me closely, almost apprehensively. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sever our eye contact, trying to process all of this, but Miller interrupts my train of thought.</p><p>\u2018Do you know the statistics when it comes to women cl**axing during penetrative sex?\u2019</p><p>My gaze lifts. \u2018No.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s incredibly rare. Every woman I f**k comes when I\u2019m inside her. I don\u2019t even have to try. That kind of makes me talented. And in demand.\u2019</p> <p>I\u2019m stunned into silence, astounded by his frankness. He\u2019s explaining like it\u2019s a burden. It might be. And exhausting. My poor, innocent mind is racing, and it homes right in on a little detail. My orgasm in the hotel room. I didn\u2019t try for that one. I was shut off from my body. It came all by itself . . . but then my spiralling thoughts register something else. \u2018You had to help me once,\u2019 I breathe, remembering feeling so useless and frustrated. \u2018You used your fingers.\u2019</p><p>He frowns. \u2018That makes you even more special.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve buggered up your flawless track record.\u2019</p><p>He smiles at me, pulling one from me, too. It\u2019s ridiculous that I\u2019m mirroring his amusement, but the alternative is wretchedness. \u2018Arrogance is a really ugly emotion,\u2019 he whispers.</p><p>My eyes widen. \u2018Says you?\u2019 I choke.</p> <p>He shrugs.</p><p>\u2018I might sell my story,\u2019 I announce seriously, watching as his mild smile spreads into the rare, full-blown one I cherish seeing. \u2018London\u2019s most notorious male escort loses his touch.\u2019 I remain serious, watching his eyes continue to twinkle and his mouth twitching.</p><p>\u2018What will it cost me for your silence?\u2019 he asks.</p><p>I look up to the ceiling and pout, feigning thinking hard about his question when I know exactly what I\u2019m going to say, and I knew the moment he posed the question to me. I return my eyes to his. \u2018A lifetime of worshipping.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I hope you mean from me.\u2019 Our lips reattach.</p><p>\u2018Exclusively. You owe me a thousand pounds,\u2019 I mumble against his mouth, making him pull away on a puckered brow. \u2018I paid for goods that I wasn\u2019t satisfied with. I want my money back.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You want a refund?\u2019 He smiles, but it falls away in a second, being replaced with worry. \u2018I left your money on the table.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 I sit up and straddle his lap, not matching his concern at all. I don\u2019t want that money any more than I want the thousands that are stashed in the bank accounts where it came from. \u2018I bought you dinner.\u2019 I shrug.</p><p>\u2018Livy, oysters and wine do not cost a thousand pounds.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then I bought you dinner and left a very generous tip.\u2019</p><p>His lips press into a straight line in an obvious attempt to restrain his amusement. \u2018Now you\u2019re just being silly.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And you are being uptight.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I beg your pardon!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, lighten up!\u2019 I collapse onto his chest and nuzzle into him.</p> <p>He scoffs at my insult but cuddles me fiercely. \u2018Your request has been noted, Miss Taylor.\u2019</p><p>I grin into his skin, feeling an overwhelming sense of happiness. \u2018Jolly good, Mr Hart.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cheeky.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You love my sassy streak.\u2019</p><p>He sighs deeply and rests the side of his head on mine. \u2018I do,\u2019 he whispers. \u2018If you\u2019re sassy with me, I love it, most of the time.\u2019</p><p>His indirect declaration cements it for me. I\u2019m utterly and completely in love with Miller Hart. He turns me away from his body and pulls my back into his chest. My head rests on his forearm and my hand finds his, our fingers intertwining in a silent message.</p><p>Never let go.</p><p>\u2018Unobtainable,\u2019 I whisper on a sigh.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m perfectly obtainable to you, Olivia Taylor.\u2019 He constricts me, inhaling deeply before tenderly kissing the back of my head. \u2018I\u2019ve never made love to a woman in my life.\u2019 I barely hear his words. \u2018Only you.\u2019</p><p>His sobering confession sinks into my mind, shocking me. \u2018Why me?\u2019 I ask quietly, refraining from spinning over to see his eyes. I shouldn\u2019t make a big deal of it, even though it\u2019s a huge deal.</p><p>He sinks his nose into my hair and breathes me into him. \u2018Because when I look into those bottomless sparkling sapphires, I see freedom.\u2019</p><p>My body relaxes on a contented sigh. I would not have thought I could take my eyes from the stunning outlook of Miller\u2019s squidgy sofa, but when he follows up his heartfelt words with his signature hum, I\u2019m proven wrong. London slowly disappears before my eyes, and the horrid images I\u2019ve fought and failed to remove from my mind\u2019s eye for so long disappear with it.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>I come awake slowly, feeling safe and content, the hardness of Miller\u2019s torso pushed into my back, his arms wrapped tightly around my waist and his face buried snugly in my neck. Smiling, I melt further into him, closing any space there may have been, gripping his hand on my tummy with mine. It\u2019s early, the rising sun offering a hazy glow through the window, and I\u2019m warm and cosy, but I\u2019m also thirsty. Completely parched.</p><p>Breaking away from Miller\u2019s firm clench is close to unthinkable, but I can quickly find my place again once I\u2019ve quenched my thirst. So I tentatively peel my body from his, detaching his arms from around my midriff and shifting towards the edge of the sofa, being sure not to disturb him. Then I quietly stand and study him for a while. His hair is everywhere, his dark lashes spread and his full lips slightly parted. He looks angelic, beautifully tangled up among the blankets. My emotionally impaired part-time gentleman.</p><p>I could remain here motionless for an eternity, just watching him sleeping serenely. He looks peaceful. I feel peaceful. The air surrounding us is so peaceful.</p><p>On a contented exhale, I take my na**d self out to the corridor and follow my feet until I\u2019m standing before one of Miller\u2019s paintings. London Bridge. I c**k my head, pouting while I ponder his perception of the landmark, the blur of paints sending my eyes crossed after a few moments of staring, making me see the bridge perfectly. Then I frown, uncrossing my eyes, making the painting a perfect mess of oil paints again. He\u2019s taken a beautiful London landmark and made it almost unappealing \u2013 like he wants people to be averse to its actual beauty, and it\u2019s in this moment I wonder if Miller Hart sees everything in his life as distorted and unclear. Does he see the whole world in this tainted manner? My neck retracts as another speculating moment descends on me abruptly. Does he see himself in this tainted manner? At a distance, the painting looks perfect, but get up close and beneath the surface, you find a wreck. A mess of colour \u2013 something ugly and confusing. I think he does see himself like this, and I think he goes all out to blur people\u2019s perception of him, too. The sobering thought is paining but equally maddening. He\u2019s beautiful inside and out. But I may be the only person on this planet who knows that for sure.</p><p>A distant chiming sends me on a startled jump and yanks me from my pondering, my hand flying up to my chest to put some pressure on my suddenly pumping heart. \u2018Jesus!\u2019 I blurt, following the sound until I\u2019m rummaging through my bag for my new phone. A glance at the screen tells me it\u2019s five-fifteen and Nan\u2019s calling. \u2018Oh shit!\u2019 I answer immediately. \u2018Nan!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Olivia! Oh my goodness, where are you?\u2019 She sounds beside herself, and my face screws up guiltily, mixed with a little dread. \u2018I woke to use the toilet and checked your room. You\u2019re not in bed!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well obviously.\u2019 I wince and drop my bare bum to a chair, hiding from no one by burying my face in my spare palm. I hear a little gasp through the phone. It\u2019s a gasp of realisation. It\u2019s a happy gasp.</p><p>\u2018Olivia, sweetheart, are you with Miller?\u2019 She\u2019s silently begging the answer is yes, I know she is.</p><p>My na**d shoulders rise and brush my earlobes. \u2018Yes,\u2019 I squeak, my face screwing up further. I should be apologising for causing her such worry, but I\u2019m too busy clamping down on my bottom lip in anticipation of her reaction to this news.</p><p>Nan coughs, clearly trying to restrain her squeal of delight. \u2018I see.\u2019 She\u2019s failing terribly to sound nonchalant. \u2018Well, um, in that case, uh, I\u2019m sorry for disturbing you.\u2019 She coughs again. \u2018Yes, I\u2019ll be going, then.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nan.\u2019 I roll my eyes, my face heating with embarrassment. \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I should have called you to\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018On no!\u2019 she screeches, piercing my eardrum. \u2018It\u2019s fine! So, so fine!\u2019</p><p>I knew it would be. \u2018I\u2019ll be home to get ready for work.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay!\u2019 She must be waking the whole street. \u2018George is taking me shopping early. I might not be here.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll see you after work, then.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ooooh, with Miller? I\u2019ll do dinner! Beef Wellington! He said it was the best he\u2019d tasted!\u2019</p><p>I rub my forehead and flop back in the chair. I should have expected this. \u2018Maybe another time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, well, I can\u2019t organise my life around you two.\u2019 She can and she would. \u2018Enquire as to what day would suit him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I will. See you later.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, you will.\u2019 She sounds slighted, and her tone is threatening. I\u2019m going to be grilled later.</p><p>\u2018Bye.\u2019 I go to disconnect the call.</p><p>\u2018Oh, Livy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Give his buns a little squeeze from me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nan!\u2019 I gasp, hearing her giggling as she hangs up on me, leaving me gaping at her crude comment. The filthy minx! I\u2019m about to throw my phone down on the table in disgust, but the text icon catches my eye, telling me I have a message. And I know who it\u2019s from. I open it, despite wanting to throw this phone at the wall, too.</p><p>I would appreciate being enlightened</p><p>on this evening\u2019s events. William.</p><p>He wants me to check in? I scowl at my phone, then toss it on the table. I\u2019m not telling him anything, no matter how terse the demand. Nor am I going to let him talk me out of this. Or force me out of this. Never. Resolute and confident, I stand, suddenly eager to join Miller back on the sofa. I hurry over to the cupboard, grab a glass, and fill it from the tap, not prepared to delay myself further by fussing with bottled spring water. I glug it all down, place the glass carefully in the dishwasher, and then make my way back towards Miller\u2019s studio, pulling to a sudden halt when I spot my dress strewn across the floor. Or still strewn across the floor. He\u2019s not picked it up, folded it neatly, and placed it deftly in his bottom drawer? I frown at the offending garment, not being able to resist scooping it up and shaking it out before folding it. Then I stand thoughtfully for a few moments and before I know it, I\u2019m in the studio staring at all of his clothes scattered everywhere. I know his painting space is typically a royal mess, but his suit doesn\u2019t belong in here on the floor. It\u2019s all wrong.</p><p>I hurry and gather up his clothes, shoving them under my arm and doing my best to smooth and fold while I take myself to his room. I wander through to his wardrobe, making sure everything is put in its rightful place \u2013 his jacket, trousers and waistcoat hung up; his shirt, socks and boxers in the laundry basket; and his tie on his tie rack. Then I make sure my dress and shoes land in the bottom drawer of his dresser in the bedroom. I start to leave and notice the bed is a huge mess, too, so I spend a good ten minutes messing with the sheets, attempting to restore it to its former glory. He\u2019s slept through the night, with no tormenting thoughts or dreams of items in the wrong place. I don\u2019t want him diving up in a panic to fix that. Creeping quietly back to the studio, I slip under the blankets, shift cautiously so I don\u2019t disturb him . . . and squeal when I\u2019m seized by the waist and yanked onto his body. I don\u2019t get a moment to gather myself. I\u2019m hauled up and carried to his bedroom where he throws me on the bed with no consideration that I\u2019ve just perfected it. Or probably not perfected it by Miller\u2019s standards. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Miller!\u2019 I\u2019m pinned by my wrists beneath him, all disorientated, with his dark locks tickling my nose. \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 I\u2019m too stunned by his uncharacteristic act to laugh.</p><p>\u2018Hold that thought,\u2019 he mumbles into my neck, nudging my thighs apart so he can make himself comfy. The skin of my neck is suddenly hot and wet, his tongue the source of heat. \u2018How are you feeling this morning?\u2019 He bites and licks my throat, sending me rigid, my thighs clamping onto his hips.</p><p>\u2018Perfect,\u2019 I reply quietly, because I really am. My arms find their way around his shoulders when he releases me and hold him tightly while he spends an age worshipping my neck. I don\u2019t want to go to work. I want to do what Miller suggested one time and lock the doors, stay here for ever with him. He\u2019s in an exceptionally good mood, no traces of the clipped man in sight. I\u2019m exactly where I\u2019m supposed to be and Miller is, too, in body and in mind.</p><p>His face appears close to mine, those eyes sending me deeper into my contented bliss as he studies me for a few moments. \u2018I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u2019 He pecks my lips. \u2018I\u2019m glad I found you, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re my habit, and I\u2019m glad we\u2019re irrevocably fascinated with each other.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Me too,\u2019 I whisper.</p><p>His eyes twinkle, his lips twitch, that lovely dimple showing signs of an appearance. \u2018It\u2019s a good job because you really don\u2019t have a choice.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want a choice.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then this is a pointless conversation, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I answer decisively on a nod, making Miller\u2019s lips twitch more. I want to see that full-blown, beautiful smile and dimple, so I slowly skate my palms down his back, feeling every smooth piece of him while he watches me with interest until I\u2019m at his lovely arse. His eyebrow cocks curiously, and I c**k mine right back.</p> <p>\u2018What are you up to?\u2019 he asks, blatantly restraining his lips from tipping farther.</p><p>I pout a little on a tiny shrug. \u2018Nothing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ.\u2019</p><p>On a little grin, I sink my nails into the solid flesh of his bum. His brow furrows. \u2018That\u2019s from Nan.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Pardon!\u2019 He coughs, pushing up onto his forearms.</p><p>I\u2019m really grinning now. \u2018She said to give your buns a little squeeze.\u2019 My nails dig in again, and Miller chokes on a laugh. A proper laugh. His dimple is deep on his cheek and my smile falls away in an instant as I watch his head drop, his hair flopping forward and his shoulders jumping up. I know I wanted a smile, but I wasn\u2019t prepared for this. I\u2019m not sure how to handle it. He\u2019s in bits, and with a lack of a natural reaction coming to me, I can do nothing more than lie here, trapped beneath his jerking body, and wait for him to pull it together. But he doesn\u2019t look anywhere near to composure. \u2018You okay?\u2019 I ask, still stunned, still frowning.</p> <p>\u2018Olivia Taylor, your grandmother is a treasure,\u2019 he chuckles, pressing his lips hard to mine. \u2018An eighteen-carat-gold treasure.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s a pain in the royal arse, that\u2019s what she is.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t speak of a loved one in such a way.\u2019 He pulls back to reveal that familiar straight face, all laughter and happiness gone like it was never there. The sudden change in mood makes me appreciate how insensitive my words were. Miller has no one. Not a soul.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 I feel thoughtless and guilty under his accusing gaze. \u2018I wasn\u2019t thinking.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s special, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know she is,\u2019 I retort quietly. I was joking, although I\u2019d do well to remember that Miller Hart isn\u2019t the joking kind. \u2018I didn\u2019t mean it.\u2019</p><p>He slips into thought, flicking his blues around my face before settling back on my eyes. His shining orbs soften. \u2018I overreacted. I apologise.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, there\u2019s no need.\u2019 I shake my head on a sigh, keeping myself lost in the softness of his puddles of blue. \u2018You have a someone, Miller.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018A someone?\u2019 His beautiful brow furrows.</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I begin enthusiastically. \u2018Me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m your someone. Everyone has a someone, and I\u2019m yours, like you are mine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re my someone?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 I nod sharply, watching as he thinks about my declaration.</p><p>\u2018And I\u2019m your someone?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Correct.\u2019</p><p>Miller\u2019s head bobs mildly on an agreeable nod. \u2018Olivia Taylor is my someone?\u2019</p><p>I shrug. \u2018Or habit.\u2019</p><p>His nodding stops in a heartbeat and I watch delightedly as his lips begin to twitch again. \u2018Both?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course,\u2019 I agree. I\u2019ll be whatever he wants me to be.</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t have a choice.\u2019 The twitching transforms into his lovely smile, nearly blinding me.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want one.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then this\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is a pointless discussion, yes, I agree.\u2019 I yank him down to my body and secure my legs around his waist, my arms over his shoulders. And then something in this moment makes me say it loud and clear \u2013 no code or words with actions. \u2018I love your bones, Miller Hart.\u2019</p><p>He pauses with his sucking on my neck and pulls back slowly to gaze down at me. I brace myself, for what I don\u2019t know. He knows how I feel. He thinks for a moment before drawing breath. \u2018I\u2019m going to take an educated guess and suggest you mean that you love me deeply.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Correct,\u2019 I laugh, pushing into his mouth when his head dips to lock back onto my neck.</p><p>\u2018Excellent.\u2019 He kisses me chastely and works his way up my jaw, across my cheek, and onto my lips. \u2018I\u2019m deeply fascinated by you, too.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m reduced to mush beneath him. That\u2019s all I need. That\u2019s his way. That\u2019s Miller Hart, the emotionally deprived fraudulent gentleman expressing his feelings with words \u2013 funny words, but I understand them. I understand him.</p><p>I let him kiss me, let his scratchy stubble rub against my face, and I relish every sweet second, grumbling my annoyance when he pulls away.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to the gym before work this morning.\u2019 He rises to his knees and pulls me up to his lap. \u2018Would you like to come?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh?\u2019 I\u2019m not sure that I need to now. All my anger and stress has completely disintegrated, thanks to Miller and his worshipping ways. Punching a bag of sand to death isn\u2019t necessary any more. \u2018I don\u2019t have membership to any gyms,\u2019 I lie, thinking it\u2019s also not necessary for me to observe Miller beating a bag of sand to death. The scenes from the studio at the gym and outside Ice are not events I relish or want to relive.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll be my guest.\u2019 He lands me with a quick kiss and lifts me from the bed. \u2018Get dressed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I need a shower,\u2019 I say, watching his back disappear into his wardrobe. The scent of sex is heavy and clinging all over me. \u2018I\u2019ll be two minutes.\u2019 I make my way towards his bathroom but gasp when I\u2019m intercepted and swiped from my feet.</p><p>\u2018Wrong,\u2019 he says matter-of-factly, carting me back to the bed across his arms. \u2018There\u2019s no time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But I feel all . . . sticky.\u2019 I cringe as I\u2019m placed on my feet, finding Miller semi-clothed in only his shorts, his bare chest being waved like a red flag to a bull. I can\u2019t rip my eyes away as it gets closer and closer until my nose is almost touching it.</p><p>\u2018Earth to Olivia.\u2019 His silky voice yanks me out of my trance and I step back, lifting my eyes to find a sanctimonious grin.</p><p>I grin back. \u2018God paid extra special attention when crafting you.\u2019</p><p>His eyebrows arch and his grin stretches further across his face. \u2018And he created you for me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Correct.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve cleared that up.\u2019 He cocks his head towards the bed. \u2018Want to help me make my bed?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I blurt the word without thought, thinking I\u2019ve already wasted too much energy on fussing over his beloved bed, and also remembering the last time I made a masterpiece of it. He could barely contain his compulsion to rip off all of the sheets and fix it. And he eventually did. \u2018You do it.\u2019 He\u2019ll only put it all right again, so it\u2019ll be a total waste of my time.</p><p>\u2018As you wish,\u2019 he says on an agreeable nod. \u2018Get dressed.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t argue, leaving Miller to fix his bed while I retrieve my clothes from the bottom drawer. \u2018I don\u2019t have any gym clothes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll take you home.\u2019 He flaps the quilt onto the bed artfully, and it lands pretty perfectly, but he still makes his way around, pulling and tweaking corners. \u2018Then I\u2019ll take you to work. What time do you need to be there?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Excellent. We have three-point-five hours.\u2019 He positions the pillows and steps back to assess his handiwork before turning and catching me watching him. \u2018Chop-chop.\u2019</p><p>Smiling, I shimmy into my dress and slip my heels on. \u2018Teeth?\u2019 I can hold off on the shower if he insists, but I need to freshen up my mouth.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ll do it together.\u2019 He sweeps his arm out in a gesture for me to lead on, which I do with a smile on my face. He\u2019s still predominantly uptight, but there\u2019s an air of peace surrounding him, and I know the source of that harmony is me.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>The health club is heaving. After finding a small space on one of the benches in the ladies\u2019 changing rooms, I hurry into my gym kit and shove my bag in a locker before escaping the happy morning chatter of many gym buddies and falling into the corridor, feeling exhausted already. I make a quick scan of the corridor but I can\u2019t see Miller, so I pace towards the end of the building where I remember the gym to be, passing the many glass-paned doors and spotting the various classes under way. Stopping at the last door, I watch as dozens of women prance around in front of a huge mirror, each looking super-fit and toned, each, although showing exertion, displaying perfectly made-up faces. My hand lifts and feels the knotted bun on my head, and my face in the reflection catches my attention. I\u2019ve not a scrap of make-up on, nor do I look like a regular. It seems the gym isn\u2019t an excuse to skimp on personal appearance.</p><p>\u2018Oh!\u2019 I gasp when I feel hot breath at my ear.</p><p>\u2018Wrong way,\u2019 he whispers, snaking his forearm around my waist and lifting me from my feet. \u2018We\u2019re in this room.\u2019 I\u2019m transported back the way I came with no complaint, until Miller is entering the very room where I spied on him. The door is closed behind us with my back still secured against his chest, and he soon spins me around and pushes me up against it. My first thoughts are of disappointment when I find him wearing a T-shirt, but they are soon hijacked when I\u2019m hoisted up to his lips and blindsided by the wonderful talents of his mouth. This is a workout of another kind.</p><p>\u2018You could have kept me in bed and tasted me,\u2019 I mumble, feeling him smile against my lips. All of these smiles and his relaxed persona, especially out of the bedroom, are throwing me all off-kilter. I love it, but it\u2019s all so very new.</p><p>\u2018I can taste you wherever I like.\u2019 He lets me slide down the door to my feet and steps back, leaving me resentful of the sudden space between us.</p><p>So I close it and circle his waist with my arms, burying my nose in the material of his T-shirt. \u2018Let\u2019s just have our thing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re here to work up a sweat.\u2019 He has humour in his tone as he collects my wrists from behind his back and disconnects me from him.</p><p>\u2018There are too many things I could say to that,\u2019 I grumble.</p><p>\u2018Is my sweet girl exposing her sassy streak?\u2019 His eyebrow cocks as he grasps the hem of his T-shirt and slowly pulls it up over his torso, revealing ripple after ripple until I\u2019m cross-eyed with delight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018You\u2019re being childish,\u2019 I accuse with slightly narrowed eyes. \u2018Why would you do that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That.\u2019 I wave my arm up and down his chest, and he looks down, that wayward curl falling loose. \u2018Put your T-shirt back on.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But I\u2019ll get hot.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I won\u2019t be able to focus, Miller.\u2019 I\u2019m very swiftly feeling the need to punch a bag of sand, but my frustration is of another kind. My finicky, obsessive Miller Hart is playing games and although it\u2019s so very lovely to see him at ease, his tactics are irritating the hell out of me.</p><p>\u2018Tough luck.\u2019 He folds his T-shirt and places it neatly to the side, and then takes my hand, leading me to the huge padded mat where the bag of sand is swaying from the rafters. \u2018And your focus will be fine, trust me.\u2019 Looking down at my feet, he frowns. \u2018What are you wearing?\u2019</p><p>I follow his line of sight and wriggle my toes in my Converse, noticing he\u2019s barefoot. Even his feet and toes are perfect. \u2018Shoes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Take them off,\u2019 he orders, sounding totally exasperated.</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You\u2019ll go barefoot. Those things have no support.\u2019 He gives them a disgusted look and points to them, reinforcing his order. \u2018Off.\u2019</p><p>I grumble under my breath as I kick them off, so I now have bare feet to match Miller. \u2018Aren\u2019t you putting your T-shirt on?\u2019 Bare feet, bare chest. This will be torture.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 He wanders over to a bench, takes his iPhone from his pocket, and then crouches, placing it in a docking station. He spends an age scrolling before declaring, \u2018Perfect,\u2019 as Florence and the Machine\u2019s \u2018Rabbit Heart\u2019 fills the huge studio.</p><p>I c**k my head a little in surprise as he makes his way back, a face full of purpose, and let him place me where he wants me. I\u2019m mentally cursing his perfect arse to hell and avoiding letting my eyes feast too much. Impossible. \u2018What are we doing?\u2019 I ask, watching him collect a long length of material and smooth it through his fingers, folding and arranging it just so.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re going to spar.\u2019 He takes my hand in his and begins neatly wrapping it in the material while I frown up at his focused face. \u2018You\u2019re going to hit me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I pull my hand away fast, horrified. \u2018I don\u2019t want to hit you!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yes, you do.\u2019 He almost laughs as he takes my hand back and continues with the wrapping.</p><p>\u2018No, I don\u2019t,\u2019 I affirm, not laughing at all. \u2018I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You can\u2019t hurt me, Olivia.\u2019 He releases my hand and collects the other. \u2018Well, you can, but not with your fists.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What do you mean?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I mean,\u2019 he sighs, like I should already know, while he keeps up his wrapping task, \u2018the only physical pain you can cause me is to my heart.\u2019</p><p>My confusion transforms into satisfaction in an instant. \u2018But it\u2019s too resilient.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not where you\u2019re concerned.\u2019 His blue eyes flick briefly to mine. \u2018But you already know that, don\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>I hide my satisfied smile and flex my fists beneath the bandaging. \u2018I have a vicious swipe,\u2019 I remind him, rightly or wrongly. I don\u2019t particularly relish the reminder of that night, but his cockiness is annoying me. I did well on the punchbag before. I worked up a sweat, and I had the achy arms to prove it.</p> <p>\u2018I concur,\u2019 Miller agrees with a hint of sarcasm, grabbing some gloves from a hook and negotiating my hands into them.</p><p>\u2018Why all the wrapping?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mainly for support, but it\u2019ll also prevent blisters from developing on your knuckles.\u2019</p><p>The heat rises in my cheeks. I really am an amateur. \u2018Okay.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re done.\u2019 He hits the tops of the gloves with his balled fists, sending my arms jolting down. \u2018Resistance, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You caught me off guard!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Always be on your guard. It\u2019s rule number one.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m always on my guard where you\u2019re concerned.\u2019</p><p>He bashes the tops of the gloves again, sending them downward . . . again. Then he smirks. \u2018Really?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Point taken,\u2019 I mutter, trying in vain to brush a stray hair from my face and getting nowhere.</p><p>\u2018Here, allow me.\u2019</p><p>I let him tuck the wayward strand behind my ear and try my very hardest not to rub my cheek onto his hand . . . or cast my eyes to his chest . . . or smell him . . . or . . . \u2018Can we get on with this, please?\u2019 I shake him off and bring my gloves to my chin, ready to strike.</p><p>\u2018As you wish.\u2019 He\u2019s smug.</p><p>\u2018So you just want me to crack you one?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You mean hit me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Knock you out.\u2019</p><p>His face twists in amusement. \u2018You will not knock me out, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I might.\u2019 I\u2019m sounding cocky now, and deep down I know I\u2019ll regret it.</p><p>\u2018I love your sass,\u2019 he says on a shake of his head. \u2018Take your best shot.\u2019</p><p>\u2018As you wish.\u2019 I quickly draw back my arm and throw it out, aiming straight for his jaw, but he pulls back stealthily, sending me on an uncontrolled spin on the spot, and before I know where I am, he has my back locked against his chest.</p><p>\u2018Good try, sweet girl.\u2019 He bites at my ear and pushes his groin into my lower back, making me choke on a breath mixed with shock and desire. I heave against him, all disorientated; then I\u2019m spun back around and released from his secure grasp. \u2018Better luck next time.\u2019</p><p>His cocky demeanour injects me with irritation and I immediately thrash out again, hoping to catch him off guard . . . and fail. \u2018Oh!\u2019 I cry, finding myself back in the hardness of his chest with his groin pushed into me, his stubbled cheek against mine.</p><p>\u2018Oh dear.\u2019 His breath tickles my ear, and my eyes clench shut while I look for the poise I need to take him on. \u2018You\u2019re being driven by frustration. It\u2019s the wrong fuel.\u2019</p><p>Fuel? \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 I puff.</p><p>Releasing me, he places me back in position and brings my fists up to my face. \u2018Frustration will make you lose control. Always maintain control.\u2019</p><p>My eyes widen at his statement. I don\u2019t remember seeing any element of control all of the times I\u2019ve seen Miller\u2019s fists flying, and judging by the fleeting look that passes over his face, he\u2019s just considered that, too.</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t help,\u2019 he says quietly, holding his hands out to the sides. \u2018Again.\u2019</p><p>Mulling over his words, I try to find some calming thoughts and my inner control, but it\u2019s hidden deep and before I can locate it, my arm rockets forward again on impulse, doing nothing more than sending me into a physical tailspin, as well as a mental one. \u2018Damn it!\u2019 I curse, pushing my bum back when I feel his h*ps brush up against me again. There\u2019s nothing controlled about this either, my body naturally reacting to the contact. \u2018I can do it!\u2019 I yell, annoyed, wriggling free of his grasp before I give in to temptation and turn to rip his shorts off. \u2018Give me a minute.\u2019 Taking some deep, calming breaths, I raise my fists to my face and my eyes to his. He\u2019s regarding me thoughtfully. \u2018What?\u2019 I ask shortly.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m just thinking how lovely you look in boxing gloves, all sweaty and exasperated.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not exasperated.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ,\u2019 he deadpans, widening his stance. \u2018Ready when you are.\u2019</p><p>His coolness is heating my annoyance. \u2018Why are we doing this?\u2019 I ask, thinking I desperately need to expel some of this pent-up frustration before I explode. My solo gym session was far more satisfying, even if I didn\u2019t have Miller\u2019s sharp physique to focus on.</p><p>\u2018I told you, because I love seeing you all exasperated by me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You always make me feel exasperated,\u2019 I mutter, extending my arm fast and ending up, yet again, in the heated hardness of Miller\u2019s chest. \u2018Damn it!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Frustrated, Olivia?\u2019 he whispers, running his tongue up the edge of my ear. My eyes close, my breathing slowing to breathless gasps that have nothing to do with my exertion. His teeth bite lightly at my ear and shots of desire stab harshly in my groin, making my thighs clench.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s the point of this?\u2019 I breathe.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re my possession and I have an appreciation for my possessions, which includes doing anything I can to protect them.\u2019</p><p>The words are quite impersonal, but it\u2019s my emotionally wrecked male who\u2019s delivering them, and although it\u2019s a peculiar way of communicating his feelings, I accept that it\u2019s his way. \u2018Does this help you?\u2019 I ask, just locating the ability to voice my question through my fevered state that\u2019s fast being diluted by anxiety. He has anger issues.</p><p>\u2018Immensely,\u2019 he confirms, but doesn\u2019t elaborate and instead escalates my fever by lifting me and carrying me across to a wall. I frown, not because I\u2019d like an explanation, even though he\u2019s confirmed my suspicions, but because I\u2019m looking at dozens of coloured, plastic-moulded lumps protruding sporadically from the surface of the wall \u2013 starting from the base and staggering up to the ceiling.</p><p>\u2018What are they?\u2019 I ask as he pushes me into a part of the wall that\u2019s free from strange lumpy bits.</p><p>\u2018This\u2019 \u2013 he reaches around me and takes my hands, removes the gloves, and slowly unravels the bandages \u2013 \u2018is a climbing wall. Hold on.\u2019 My hands are placed on two of the plastic moulds. I grip hard, and then I gulp as he gently takes my h*ps and pulls back. \u2018Comfortable?\u2019</p><p>I can\u2019t speak. All previous pent-up, workout-related stress has made way for anticipation. So I nod.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s polite to answer someone when they ask you a question, Livy. You know that.\u2019 He pulls my shorts aside, along with my knickers.</p><p>\u2018Miller,\u2019 I gasp, slightly concerned by our location, feeling his fingers skimming my sex. \u2018We can\u2019t, not here.\u2019</p><p>\u2018This room is booked out to me daily from six to eight. No one will disturb us.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But the glass . . .\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re out of sight.\u2019 His finger pushes forward and my forehead meets the wall on a deep inhale of shaky breath. \u2018I\u2019ve asked once.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m comfortable,\u2019 I answer reluctantly. I\u2019m comfortable in my position, but not in my location.</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ.\u2019 He circles deep, enticing a deep moan from us both. \u2018You\u2019re tense.\u2019</p><p>Thrust!</p><p>\u2018Oh God.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Loosen up.\u2019 He eases gently into me, this time with two fingers, and his tender movement reduces my tenseness, softening my whole body. \u2018Better.\u2019</p><p>It is better. The continued slipping of his fingers into me is pushing me into a rapturous state, my mind no longer concerned by our location. I\u2019m too lust-fuelled. I\u2019m quivering. I\u2019m . . . I\u2019m . . . I\u2019m . . . \u2018Miller!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shhhh.\u2019 He hushes me gently and withdraws his fingers, taking a firm but gentle hold of my hips. The loss of friction pushes me to insanity and I release one of the grips and bash the side of my fist into the wall.</p><p>\u2018No, please!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Didn\u2019t I tell you that I\u2019d drive you crazy with desire on a daily basis?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019</p><p>\u2018And am I?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019</p><p>\u2018And you know it delights me, right?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fucking hell! Yes!\u2019</p><p>He groans his approval and slips the head of his c**k across my flesh. Then he eases into me on a drawn-out hiss. My knees buckle.</p><p>\u2018Oooh.\u2019 My body liquefies, depending on Miller to hold me up.</p><p>\u2018Steady,\u2019 he breathes, coiling his arm around my waist to support my limp body. My chin drops lifelessly to my chest. \u2018It would appear we\u2019ve steered off course.\u2019 His h*ps ease forward, each fraction deeper that he plunges sending me giddier until he\u2019s fitting snugly within me and holding still. In my darkness, I see nothing, but the loss of sense is of no consequence. I can smell him, hear his fitful breaths, feel him, and when his hand slides up my front until his fingers are resting on my lips, I can lick him and taste him, too. \u2018Would you like me to move?\u2019 he asks, his voice rough and full of searing hot craving. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mouth is busy lapping at his fingers, so I find some strength to stabilise my legs and use it to push my bottom into his groin. He inhales sharply. I bite down on his finger.</p><p>\u2018Olivia?\u2019 He wants an answer.</p><p>I relax my bite and find my voice. \u2018Move. Please move.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh Jesus.\u2019 His hand is in my hair, yanking my hair tie out, before strong fingers are combing through it, sending my waves tumbling freely. Then his palm encases my throat and tugs until the back of my head meets his shoulder. My lips part and I keep my eyes shut tight, my face pointing up to the ceiling. He\u2019s still unmoving, yet my flesh is quivering incessantly with a tidal wave of crippling sensations that are getting set to send me delirious with pleasure the moment he begins to pump into me. I\u2019m teetering on the edge already, Miller\u2019s steady, pulsing c**k sending my internal muscles into spasm. Heavy breathing invades my ears. \u2018I\u2019m so happy that you\u2019re my someone, Olivia Taylor.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018And I\u2019m so happy that I am your habit,\u2019 I murmur, finding it easy to utter those words amid my mind-numbing bliss.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve cleared that up.\u2019 His face falls into my neck and he begins a lazy pump of his hips, making all air leave my lungs on a satisfied rush of quiet breath.</p><p>I smile through my pleasure and I feel him smile against my neck as he kisses me delicately while maintaining his precise pace, keeping his palm spread across my throat.</p><p>\u2018You taste divine,\u2019 he whispers hoarsely.</p><p>\u2018You feel divine.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You\u2019re tightening around me, sweet girl.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m close.\u2019 I can feel all of the present signs intensify \u2013 the tenseness, the pulsing, the heaviness. \u2018Oh God!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shhhh, Livy,\u2019 he chokes, his h*ps taking on a mind of their own, bucking briefly before he locks his teeth on my neck and takes some steadying breaths. He stops moving.</p><p>Sweat beads spring onto my forehead. The heat of his mouth on my flesh is spreading through my clammy body, burning deep into my very centre.</p><p>\u2018How close?\u2019 he asks on a strangled gasp. \u2018How close are you, Livy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Close!\u2019</p> <p>His h*ps seem to start vibrating, a clear sign of his fight to refrain from bucking wildly.</p><p>\u2018Shit!\u2019 I cry when he advances quickly but carefully, my knuckles turning white from my despairing grip. Out he draws again before striking intently. My lungs drain of air and my surging heart rate escalates to dangerous levels. I feel faint. \u2018Miller,\u2019 I gulp, making my arms rigid against the wall. I\u2019m buzzing, feeling out of control, the heights of pleasure sending my mind spiralling into meltdown. I don\u2019t know what to do to cope with him. Nothing changes and I hope it never does. \u2018Miller, please, please, please.\u2019 I\u2019m on the cusp of tumbling over the edge, but he\u2019s holding me there, teasing me. He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing.</p><p>\u2018Beg,\u2019 he grunts, hitting me calmly with another burst forward of his hips. \u2018Beg me for it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re doing it on purpose!\u2019 I yell, thrusting back onto him in an attempt to catch the rush of pressure and let it explode, earning a bark from Miller and a shocked yelp from me. My face is yanked to his and I\u2019m eaten alive, our kiss spurring on my imminent cl**ax.</p><p>\u2018Beg,\u2019 he repeats against my lips. \u2018Beg me to devote the rest of my life to you, Olivia. Make me see that you want us as much as I do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Beg.\u2019 He bites my lip and lets it drag through his teeth gently before his blue eyes are burning into me, searing my soul. \u2018Don\u2019t deny me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I beg you.\u2019 My eyes hold his and absorb the need seeping from them. Need for me. It\u2019s reassuring. We\u2019re in desperate need of each other.</p> <p>\u2018And I beg you.\u2019 A delicious swivelling of his h*ps begins, reminding me of my previous explosive state. He pecks my lips and finds his rhythm again, plunging deep and retreating slowly, crippling me with his expert worshipping. \u2018I beg you to love me for ever.\u2019</p><p>My face falls into his neck and nuzzles. \u2018You don\u2019t need to beg me,\u2019 I murmur. \u2018There\u2019s nothing more natural to me than loving you, Miller Hart.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Can you stop driving me crazy now?\u2019 My cl**ax is still being held in limbo. It\u2019s screaming for release.</p><p>\u2018God, yes.\u2019 He drives into me firmly and holds himself deep, grinding his hips. I rocket on a cry and the built-up pressure gushes from my being, sending me dizzy and useless in his arms. \u2018Fuck, f**k, f**k!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t drop me!\u2019 My body is quivering, my head shaking from side to side.</p><p>\u2018Never.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh . . .\u2019 I breathe, the twinges showing no sign of receding as I relax into him. My world is a haze of distorted sounds and blurred images as I fight my way through the intensity of my orgasm. I can\u2019t feel my limbs, only Miller biting lightly on my cheek and his erection pulsing within me. Vivid images are flashing through my mind, each one of Miller and me, some past, some very much present, and some of our future together. I\u2019ve found my someone \u2013 a damaged someone, a someone who displays his emotions in the most unusual fashion and conducts himself in a way to mostly repel affection. But he\u2019s my damaged someone. I understand him. I know how to ease him, handle him, and most importantly, I know how to love him. Despite his lifelong mission to reject the potential of feeling and caring, he\u2019s let me fight my way past his harsh, cold exterior \u2013 helped me do it, to a certain extent \u2013 and I\u2019ve allowed him to have the same effect on me. How I\u2019m feeling right now, safe, cherished, loved, was worth every modicum of heartache we\u2019ve both endured to this point. He accepts me and my history. We\u2019re worlds apart but utterly perfect for each other. He\u2019s beautiful from afar, and he\u2019s equally beautiful up close. And beneath that external beauty, he\u2019s even more beautiful. It goes deep, and the deeper I look, that beauty only strengthens. I\u2019m the only person who sees it, and that\u2019s because I\u2019m the only person who Miller has allowed to see it. Just me. He\u2019s mine. All of him. Every beautiful piece.</p><p>Miller\u2019s teeth sinking into my shoulder and his pulsing length still buried within me brings me back down to earth, where I\u2019m staring at the ceiling and my fingers are numb and set in place from my fierce grip of the wall\u2019s gripper things. I\u2019m exhausted but energised, weak at the knees but strong within. \u2018I watched you once,\u2019 I whisper. I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m compelled to tell him this.</p><p>He sucks my flesh into his mouth and pecks his bite mark lightly before sweeping my hair into his fist and turning my face into him. \u2018I know you did.\u2019</p><p>He doesn\u2019t ask what I mean or where I watched him. He knows. \u2018How?\u2019</p><p>\u2018My skin tingled.\u2019</p><p>My smile is one of confusion as I search his eyes, looking for anything more than those three confounding words. I see sincerity, total belief in his statement. \u2018Your skin tingled?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, like subtle fireworks exploding under my skin.\u2019 His face remains straight.</p><p>\u2018Fireworks?\u2019</p><p>His lips meet my forehead and his h*ps retreat, his semi-arousal slipping free. My knickers and shorts also slip back into place, leaving me resentful and bitter for my loss. I\u2019m gently turned in his arms, my hair arranged neatly down one side and my arms draped over his na**d shoulders. He\u2019s damp and warm, and his skin is glistening under the harsh artificial light of the studio. My affronted body and lack of Miller inside me is forgotten when my eyes and mind are met by the hard planes of his torso \u2013 tight ni**les, smooth skin and chiselled muscles. It\u2019s truly a sight to behold.</p><p>I watch him scan the wall behind me before edging me a fraction to the left, and then that masterpiece of a physique moves in and barricades me against the coolness behind me, every inch of his semi-nakedness coating my gym-clad body. His forefinger rests under my chin and directs my face up to his. \u2018Up here.\u2019 He smiles and kisses my cheek tenderly. \u2018Share with me your tell.\u2019</p><p>\u2018My tell?\u2019 The confusion in my voice isn\u2019t concealable. I have no idea what he\u2019s talking about. \u2018I\u2019m not sure I know what you mean.\u2019</p><p>He gives me a dimple smile, cute and almost shy. \u2018When you\u2019re near, even out of touching distance, my skin lights up. Like fireworks. Every inch of my flesh tingles deliciously. That\u2019s my tell.\u2019 His palm cups my cheek, his thumb ghosting over the surface of my lips. \u2018That\u2019s how I know you\u2019re close by. I don\u2019t need to be able to see you. I feel you, and when we physically touch\u2019 \u2013 he blinks lazily and pulls a long, steadying breath \u2013 \u2018those fireworks explode. They make me dizzy. They\u2019re beautiful, bright, and consuming.\u2019 Leaning in, he kisses the tip of my nose. \u2018They represent you.\u2019</p><p>My lips part, my hold moving to the back of his head. I spend a few silent moments absorbing his gaze and his body pressed hard to mine. I also absorb his words. There\u2019s nothing confounding about that statement. I know just what he\u2019s talking about now, except my tell is a little different.</p><p>\u2018I have fireworks, too.\u2019 I kiss the pad of his finger, and his side-to-side drag across my bottom lip stops as he regards me quietly. \u2018Except mine implode.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That sounds dangerous,\u2019 he murmurs, dropping his gaze to my mouth. I disregard William\u2019s caution of rising neck hair, certain my mind was working overtime, probably because of my messed-up mind and loss of Miller. Or it could be part of my tell.</p><p>\u2018It is dangerous,\u2019 I confess.</p><p>\u2018How?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because every time I look at you, feel you, or even sense you, those fireworks shoot straight for my heart.\u2019 I feel emotion grip me from every direction as I watch his eyes drag up my face until they\u2019re locked with mine. \u2018I fall in love with you a little bit more each time that happens.\u2019</p><p>He slowly nods his acknowledgement. It\u2019s almost undetectable. \u2018We\u2019re going to see and touch each other a lot,\u2019 he murmurs. \u2018You\u2019re going to be incredibly in love with me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Already am.\u2019 I close my eyes when his thumb moves and his lips replace it. And I fall that little bit more. Our mouths move gingerly together, purposely slow, our wild abandon of a few moments ago being replaced with cautious motions and complete aching tenderness. He\u2019s speaking with this kiss. He\u2019s acknowledging his understanding. He feels that way, too, except he calls it fascination.</p><p>\u2018To my bones?\u2019 he asks into my mouth, making me smile.</p><p>\u2018Deeper than that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And I\u2019ll pray for that continued love every day.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s a given.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nothing in this world is a given, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not true,\u2019 I argue, detaching myself from his mouth, my contentment of a few moments ago vanishing. I\u2019m under his close scrutiny as I form my next words in my mind. I\u2019m not sure what other way I can say it. \u2018Why won\u2019t you accept it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s hard to accept something that shouldn\u2019t be.\u2019 His palm works its way to the back of my head and nestles into my hair. \u2018I\u2019m not worthy of your love.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, you are.\u2019 I can feel heated anger rising into my cheeks, replacing my post-orgasm flush.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ll agree to disagree.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, we won\u2019t.\u2019 My body reacts to his blindness, my hands shifting to his chest and shoving him gently back. \u2018I want you to accept it. Not just tell me you do to keep me happy, but really accept it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t hesitate to agree, but there\u2019s no conviction.</p><p>My shoulders sag, defeated, all of the dazzling hope that\u2019s shone since our reunion dulling too fast. \u2018What\u2019s made you so negative?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Reality.\u2019 His tone is flat and lifeless, and my mouth snaps shut. I have no counter for that \u2013 no words or sense of encouragement. At least not off the cuff. Given a few moments, I\u2019ll think of something and I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s valid and logical. But my sprinting mind is interrupted in mid-construction when the door to the studio swings open. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Both of our heads snap to the side, and my hackles instantly rise.</p><p>\u2018Time\u2019s up.\u2019 Cassie\u2019s silken voice riles me further, her perfect figure laden in Lycra not helping in the least bit. Her eyes are full of resentment, with a little alarm mixed in for good measure. She\u2019s shocked to see me and that pleases me too much.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re just leaving,\u2019 Miller retorts curtly, taking my nape and leading me to collect his phone before directing me to the door.</p><p>I watch with narrowed eyes as she struts across the room and shamelessly reaches down to touch her toes, stretching before sliding down into the splits on a conniving smirk. The diamond cross that always graces her lovely neck skims the floor. \u2018Pilates,\u2019 she purrs. \u2018Does wonders for flexibility. Isn\u2019t that right, Miller?\u2019</p> <p>I look up at him with wide eyes, hoping I\u2019m not interpreting those words correctly. He doesn\u2019t humour me with confirmation or even a reassuring look. \u2018Rein it in, Cassie,\u2019 he spits, opening the door and gently pushing me through.</p><p>\u2018Have a great day!\u2019 she sings on a laugh.</p><p>As soon as the door slams behind us, I fight my way from Miller\u2019s hold and swing to face him, my hair whipping my face. \u2018What\u2019s she doing here?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She has the studio from eight to ten.\u2019</p><p>I bristle. \u2018Have you slept with her?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No.\u2019 His answer is swift and decisive. \u2018Never.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then what\u2019s her bendy arse harping on about?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Bendy arse?\u2019 One corner of his mouth tips in concealed humour. It doesn\u2019t improve my mood.</p><p>\u2018I know she\u2019s a hooker, Miller. I saw her at a function with some old, fat, rich man.\u2019</p><p>Any signs of amusement slip away from his face in an instant. \u2018I see,\u2019 he says simply, like it\u2019s of no importance.</p><p>\u2018You see?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018What else would you like me to say? She\u2019s an escort.\u2019</p><p>My sass shrivels. I don\u2019t know what I want him to say. \u2018I need to get to work.\u2019 I pivot, making for the ladies\u2019 changing rooms, feeling hot wetness trickling down my thighs. Damn it!</p><p>\u2018Olivia.\u2019</p><p>I ignore him and push my way through the door. The possessiveness coursing through my fire-filled veins is a little shocking, my returning sass transforming into . . . something else. I\u2019ve not quite identified it yet, but it\u2019s dangerous. I know that much. My backside plummets to a slatted bench and my head falls into my hands. She\u2019s going nowhere. She\u2019s bold and obviously harbours a hatred for me. Can I handle that?</p><p>\u2018Hey.\u2019 Warm palms skate up my thighs and I peek through my parted fingers to find Miller kneeling in front of me. A brief scan of the changing room quickly tells me that we\u2019re not alone. There are two towel-clad women at the other end, watching with interest, but neither seem concerned by their lack of clothing.</p><p>\u2018Miller, what are you doing?\u2019 I return my eyes to his crouched form, seeing an expressionless face but sympathy in his eyes.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m doing what a man does when he sees the woman he adores in pieces.\u2019</p><p>Adores? Not fascinated? Even now, when I\u2019m struggling to locate any sense, that simple word thrills me. \u2018I don\u2019t like her.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Neither do I sometimes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just sometimes?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s misunderstood.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019m misunderstanding her. She doesn\u2019t like me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s because I like you. Very much so.\u2019</p><p>Fascinated. Adores. Like. \u2018Does she want you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She wants to make things difficult.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>He sighs, low and drawn out, and clamps his palms on either side of my cheeks, getting nose to nose with me. \u2018She can\u2019t see past what she knows.\u2019</p><p>She can\u2019t see past sex and glamour? I shake my head, a little confused but more frustrated. So she expects Miller to follow the same theory? \u2018I want to run away,\u2019 I whisper, my legs twitching already, eager to carry me from the stark truth of Miller and his history. Everything everywhere is a constant reminder. I\u2019m not sure if I can get past it. \u2018With you,\u2019 I clarify when a wave of trepidation floats across his face. \u2018Will any of these people let us be?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sweet girl, I\u2019m prepared to annihilate anything that blocks my path to freedom.\u2019 He leans in and kisses my forehead \u2013 an act so tender but bursting with reassurance. Or supposed to be. Uncertainty was pouring from his eyes before his lids closed and concealed it. \u2018I beg you, don\u2019t let the demeaning words of others interfere.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s hard.\u2019 I let him press his lips over every part of my face until he\u2019s pulling away. He\u2019s got the uncertainty under control. Now his blues are beseeching. He thinks I\u2019ll allow these people \u2013 Cassie and whoever else there is, because I know there will be more \u2013 to scare me away. They won\u2019t. Nothing will. \u2018I love you.\u2019</p><p>He smiles and pulls me to my feet. \u2018I accept your love.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re just saying that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Will I ever win this argument?\u2019 he asks, his hairline pulling back from the sudden height of his eyebrows.</p><p>I consider his question for a moment. \u2018No,\u2019 I state, short and exact, because he can\u2019t. I\u2019ll never really know if he truly accepts it. His words will never convince me.</p><p>\u2018Get showered and changed.\u2019 He clasps my shoulders and turns me away from him. \u2018We\u2019ll be late.\u2019</p><p>A cheeky tap of my bottom sends me on my way, but the uncertainty that I found in Miller\u2019s eyes seems to have rooted itself deep within me. If he can\u2019t ease my trepidation, then no one can.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>We\u2019re a few streets away from the bistro, caught up in a traffic jam. I can feel him studying me, so I cast a sideways glance on a tiny smirk. He leans over and kisses me sweetly. \u2018Your hair\u2019s a little wild.\u2019</p><p>I frown while he makes a haphazard job of tucking it behind my ears. Then I smile. \u2018I didn\u2019t have any conditioner.\u2019 Reaching forward, I smooth my hand through Miller\u2019s perfect dark waves. \u2018I should have asked to borrow yours.\u2019</p><p>He freezes mid-arranging of my hair and flicks amused eyes to mine. My smile widens. \u2018You\u2019re perfect.\u2019 He untucks my hair. \u2018This is perfect. Never cut it off.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I won\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll jump out here. You can slip up that side street and avoid the traffic.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, I\u2019m in no rush.\u2019 He brushes me off and proceeds to join the other horn-happy drivers, smacking his palm into the centre of the wheel.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019ll get you nowhere,\u2019 I laugh. \u2018And, anyway, I am in a rush. I can\u2019t be late.\u2019 I peck his lips and jump out of his Mercedes.</p><p>\u2018Olivia!\u2019 he shouts after me.</p><p>I turn and bend to get him in my line of sight. \u2018It\u2019s a couple of streets away. I\u2019ll be there in two minutes.\u2019 I smile at his scowling face and shut the door, hurrying to the pavement.</p><p>I lose myself amid the sea of people, all scurrying to their places of work. It\u2019s familiar to me, comforting, but the strange sensation I\u2019m feeling as I scamper like an ant with my fellow Londoners isn\u2019t. I reach up to my shoulder and brush away a tingle, shivering when it immediately jumps back onto my skin. Something tells me to look behind me so I do, but I only note a mass of bobbing bodies following the flow of foot traffic. My Converse speed up without any prompt from my brain, and I start overtaking people, uneasy but with no explanation. As I round a corner, I look back again, a familiar chill resonating through me, the hairs on my nape rising.</p><p>\u2018Oh!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Watch where you\u2019re going!\u2019</p><p>I stagger, taking the man\u2019s briefcase with me, the expensive leather getting tangled between my clumsy legs. \u2018I\u2019m sorry!\u2019 I yelp, catching the side of the brick wall to steady myself.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve scuffed my case, you stupid woman!\u2019 He snatches up his property and brushes it down, grumbling and huffing his aggravation.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 I repeat, straightening myself out, bracing myself for a further verbal bashing.</p><p>\u2018Fucking imbecile,\u2019 he grunts, stomping off into the crowd, leaving me being sidestepped by more impatient pedestrians.</p><p>My eyes dart everywhere, scanning faces coming towards me and the backs marching away from me, my internal alarm screaming. Reaching up, I run my palm over my nape, smoothing down the hairs. I feel a stupid sense of relief when they remain flush with my skin once I remove my hand. But my stomach is turning, anxiety gripping me. I\u2019m circling on the spot, unease lingering deep and fretfulness plaguing me.</p><p>I turn and hurry across the road to Del\u2019s, constantly looking over my shoulder.</p><p>The bistro is the last place on earth I want to be right now. I feel nauseous, and my dread at facing my colleagues is only amplified when three sets of cautious eyes monitor my walk from the door to the kitchen. I feel judged. I am being judged. They all think I\u2019m daft, but they haven\u2019t experienced Miller when he\u2019s not armoured up in one of his fine three-piece suits. They have drawn their conclusions on the little information they know, and I\u2019m past the point of feeling the need to justify my relationship with London\u2019s most notorious ex-escort, to Sylvie, Del, Gregory, or anyone for that matter. It\u2019s exhausting enough trying to justify it to Miller, and he\u2019s the only one who really matters. God help me and my ears if any one of these people were to discover Miller\u2019s history. To them, he is simply an uptight arsehole who\u2019s played me. And it\u2019ll stay that way.</p><p>\u2018Morning.\u2019 Sylvie\u2019s tone is lacking its usual chirpiness, her hands redundant on the filter handle of the coffee machine.</p><p>\u2018Hi.\u2019 I flash a small smile. \u2018Oh, I have a new phone. I\u2019ll text you the number.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay.\u2019 She nods as I pass her, entering the kitchen and immediately getting into my apron.</p><p>Paul follows me in and takes up position behind the stove, lifting and tossing a pan full of onions. \u2018You have a good evening?\u2019 he asks. I detect genuine interest and look up to find an expression displaying indifference.</p><p>\u2018I did, thank you, Paul. You?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure,\u2019 he grunts as he slides two plates across the counter. \u2018Tuna Crunches for table seven. Let\u2019s have some service around here.\u2019</p><p>I swing into action and grab the plates, bypassing Sylvie and Del on my way out, my boss remaining tight-lipped, my friend\u2019s lips remaining pursed. \u2018Tuna Crunches?\u2019 I ask, sliding them onto the table.</p><p>\u2018Ta, darlin\u2019,\u2019 a pot-bellied man sings, all happy, almost dribbling as he pulls both plates towards him while licking his lips. His big mouth wraps straight around one corner and he looks up at me, smiling, soggy bread spilling from his chops. I grimace. \u2018Fill this up, will ya?\u2019 He pushes his coffee mug into my hand and my stomach turns when a lump of tuna slips past his lips and splatters on the floor at his feet. I follow his finger as it swoops down and mops it up. Then I watch with horror when he takes the half-chewed food and laps it off his pudgy finger with a tongue lathered in Paul\u2019s secret recipe. I gag, my palm slapping across my mouth as I sprint across the bistro, thinking Miller would have a seizure if he witnessed the display of such caveman manners.</p><p>\u2018You okay?\u2019 Sylvie asks with alarm as I fly towards her.</p><p>\u2018Refill. Table seven.\u2019 I thrust the mug at her and dart past, trying desperately to stop the bile stirring. I clatter past tables, bump into chairs, and smack my shoulder into the wall as I round a corner. \u2018Bollocks!\u2019 I curse, way too loud and in front of a table of two old dears who are enjoying tea and cakes in the quieter part of the bistro. I wince and rub my arm, then turn to apologise.</p><p>And throw up all over them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Goodness gracious!\u2019 One old lady shoots up from her chair, rather fast for an old-timer. \u2018Oh! Doris, your hat!\u2019 She swats her friend\u2019s head with a napkin, trying to brush away the lumps of vomit that I\u2019ve sprayed all over the poor old lady. I swipe up a napkin and hold it over my mouth.</p><p>\u2018Oh, Edna, is it ruined?\u2019 Her friend\u2019s hand goes straight for her head and sinks into the sick-coated fur of her hat. I heave violently again.</p><p>\u2018I fear it might be. Oh what a shame! Don\u2019t touch it!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m so sorry,\u2019 I splutter through the napkin, watching the two old biddies fussing over each other. I can feel eyes punching holes into me from everywhere, and a quick glimpse over my shoulder reveals a bistro full of silent observers. Even the filthy-mannered fatty who\u2019s the cause of my vomiting episode is looking at me with disgust. \u2018I . . .\u2019 I can\u2019t finish. Sweat has jumped onto my forehead and heat has jumped onto my cheeks. I\u2019m mortified. And I feel terrible \u2013 sick, embarrassed and stupid. I let the corridor that leads to the ladies\u2019 room swallow me up, and I flop over the sink, running the tap and splashing my face before rinsing my mouth. Looking up, I\u2019m greeted by the reflection of a pale, meek-looking creature. Me. I feel rotten.</p> <p>Which reminds me. Once I wash and dry my hands, I take my phone from my pocket and spend five minutes cringing down the line, explaining to my doctor\u2019s receptionist why I need an emergency appointment. \u2018Eleven?\u2019 I ask, pulling my phone from my ear to see the time. My shift finishes at five. \u2018Have you anything later?\u2019 I try, already running over a plausible excuse for me to escape work for an hour or two. My shoulders sag when she gives me no other option, then points out hastily that I only have a seventy-two-hour window if the morning-after pill is going to work. Damn. \u2018I\u2019ll take eleven,\u2019 I say, giving my name before hanging up.</p><p>\u2018Livy?\u2019</p><p>Sylvie is peeking around the door. \u2018Hey.\u2019 I pop my phone back in my pocket and snatch a paper towel to dab at my wet face. \u2018Am I fired?\u2019</p><p>She smiles, her pink lips wide, and joins me by the sink. \u2018Don\u2019t be silly. Del\u2019s worried about you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He shouldn\u2019t be.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Well, he is. And so am I.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Neither of you should be worried about me. I\u2019m fine.\u2019 I turn back to the mirror, not prepared to suffer another lecture about my relationship with Miller.</p><p>\u2018Sure you are,\u2019 she laughs, making me frown at her in the mirror. She\u2019s belittling me. \u2018I assume things didn\u2019t go so well after he abducted you from the bistro yesterday.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re wrong,\u2019 I seethe, turning to face her. The smile has dropped and shock has replaced it. She assumes because I\u2019m a little off colour that things had gone all wrong last night. That Miller is responsible. \u2018I feel a little under the weather, Sylvie. Don\u2019t presume that Miller is the catalyst for everything.\u2019 I dump the used towel in the bin harshly. \u2018Miller and I are fine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I cut her off. I\u2019m not standing for it any more. Not from Sylvie, not from Gregory, not from William. No one! \u2018A disgusting man just spat his Tuna Crunch all over the floor and scooped it up with a filthy finger. Then he ate it!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Eww!\u2019 Sylvie recoils, her hand going to her midriff and circling slowly, like sickness has just jumped up and bit her on the arse. She should have seen it.</p><p>\u2018Yes, exactly.\u2019 I tuck a wayward strand of hair behind my ear and straighten my shoulders. \u2018That is why I threw up, and I\u2019m f**king miserable because I\u2019m sick of hearing people griping about me and Miller, and even sicker of receiving sympathetic f**king looks!\u2019</p><p>Her eyes widen while I bubble with anger before her, my chest pulsing with laboured breaths. \u2018Okay,\u2019 she squeaks.</p><p>I nod sharply, determinedly. \u2018Good. I have to get back to work.\u2019 I slip past a startled Sylvie and bump into Del in the corridor. \u2018I\u2019m fine!\u2019 I snap petulantly.</p><p>His head seems to sink into his neck. \u2018Clearly. But the two old birds in there aren\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>I cringe. \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Go home, Livy,\u2019 he sighs.</p><p>I admit defeat easily on a slump of my shoulders, grateful for not having to make an excuse to escape for my appointment, and follow through on my boss\u2019s sharp order. I take my drained body down the corridor and into the kitchen, slipping quietly past the two old ladies who I\u2019ve just spewed all over. They\u2019re distracted with fresh cakes and a new steaming pot of tea.</p> <p>Weaving my way through the tables of customers, my need to escape the confines of the bistro becomes urgent under the repulsed looks of the clientele. I burst out the door and land on the pavement, my head falling back on my shoulders and looking to the heavens. The fresh air hits my lungs, and I close my eyes and expel it on a heavy, frustrated sigh, relieved to be in open air.</p><p>\u2018The signs aren\u2019t good.\u2019 William\u2019s rich tone sucks all of that relief out of me, my head dropping down slowly, my expression tired. \u2018I assume you know how to operate the iPhone that I bought for you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I grate. It\u2019s not even ten o\u2019clock and I\u2019ve put up with far too much already today. Now William, too. He\u2019s leaning up against the Lexus, arms crossed over his chest in authority. He looks formidable. And cross.</p><p>\u2018Then I\u2019m going to assume there\u2019s a perfectly good explanation for you ignoring my message.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I was busy.\u2019 I throw my satchel across my body and square my shoulders.</p><p>\u2018Doing what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018None of your business.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Being blindsided by a handsome man who has seduction down to a fine art? Is that what you mean?\u2019</p><p>I bristle, my teeth clenching. \u2018I am not answerable to you.\u2019</p><p>He laughs lightly, a splash of recognition invading his face. I\u2019m behaving like my mother, and I hate myself for it. But for the first time in for ever, I\u2019m thinking hard about her own battle against the people who obstructed her mission to win William. The man before me included. If this is how she felt, then I\u2019m beginning to relate, and that\u2019s something I never dreamed I\u2019d do. But I\u2019m feeling pretty reckless. Determined. I\u2019ve been there before and I\u2019d probably go there again, if I didn\u2019t now have the support of my someone. Gracie never did, and I can fully comprehend how that impacted her. \u2018Tell me how my mother came to love you so much.\u2019</p><p>My abrupt question wipes the amusement from William\u2019s face in an instant. He\u2019s fallen into that uncomfortable mode again, shifting and diverting his liquid grey stare from mine. \u2018I\u2019ve told you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, you haven\u2019t. You\u2019ve told me nothing, only that she was in love with you. You haven\u2019t explained how that came to be. Or how you fell in love with her.\u2019 I\u2019m dying to ask him where his manners are, too, but I refrain, waiting patiently for him to piece together his story instead. I need to know. I need to hear how William and my mother came upon each other. One thing I remember vividly is William saying loud and clear that she put herself in his world for him. But how did they meet?</p><p>He coughs, keeping his eyes off me, and opens the rear door of his Lexus. \u2018I\u2019ll take you home.\u2019</p><p>I huff my displeasure at his evasion and leave him waiting for me to get in his car, making tracks towards the bus stop.</p><p>\u2018Olivia!\u2019 he shouts, and I hear the car door slam harshly. It startles me, making my shoulders hit my earlobes, but I disregard his evident annoyance and pick up my pace. \u2018It was instant!\u2019 he yells, pulling me to a rapid halt. The unsure tone of his words and rushed delivery of them is proof of the pain they\u2019re causing him. I slowly turn to assess exactly how much pain I\u2019m dealing with, and when his face comes into my view, I see a sadness that deflects right off William and punches a hole in my gut. \u2018She was seventeen years old.\u2019 He laughs a nervous laugh, almost embarrassed. \u2018It was wrong of me to look at her the way I did, but when those sapphire eyes turned to me and she smiled, my world exploded into a million shards of sparkling glass. Your mother knocked me on my arse, Olivia. I saw a freedom that I knew I couldn\u2019t have.\u2019</p><p>My heart slows, a crevice cracking wide open and exposing a horrid reality. I don\u2019t like what I\u2019m hearing. My brain is failing to locate any words of comfort for William, but it\u2019s jumping all over his admission. \u2018Why are you trying to sabotage our love?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>It\u2019s a perfectly reasonable question, especially in light of this information. It\u2019s not jealousy or resentment. William could\u2019ve had that freedom, just like Miller can. Except Miller is more determined to get it. Miller isn\u2019t prepared to let me slip through his fingers. Miller will fight for us \u2013 even if, maddeningly, he questions his worthiness.</p><p>William\u2019s eyes close slowly, reminding me of my part-time gentleman\u2019s lazy blink. It makes me want to dash to Miller without delay, let him immerse me in his sanctuary and thing. \u2018Please, allow me to take you home.\u2019 He steps back and opens the car door again, gesturing with pleading eyes for me to get in.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019d rather walk,\u2019 I tell him. I still feel ill and the fresh air will do me good. Plus, I need to get to my doctor and I can\u2019t ask William to drop me there. The thought makes me shudder on the spot.</p><p>My petulance is irritating him, but I stand firm, not prepared to be bossed into his car again. \u2018Then at least give me five minutes.\u2019 He indicates across the road to the square where Miller once sat me \u2013 the time I finally gave in and let him have his one night.</p><p>I nod, silently pleased he isn\u2019t demanding me into his car. He needs to know I can assert some control, too. We start to wander across together, William giving his driver a mild nod as we leave. My stomach is churning, a mixture of sadness and compassion. I feel like I\u2019m falling into an abyss of knowledge. I don\u2019t want to continue my descent because I know it\u2019ll be a bumpy landing \u2013 one that\u2019s going to shred the unforgiving resentment I hold for my mother and replace it with overwhelming guilt. Each minute I spend with William Anderson is weakening the band circling the hardened part of my heart that I\u2019ve reserved for holding utter contempt for Gracie Taylor. It\u2019s going to snap soon and let the cynical fragments merge with the soft, fallen part. I\u2019m not sure whether I can cope with more heartache, not after I\u2019ve barely recovered and can feel light filling the darkness. But curiosity and the overpowering need to validate what Miller and I have is overriding my reluctance.</p><p>We both lower to a bench and I remain quiet, watching William\u2019s stiff body trying to relax next to me. And failing on every level. He places his hands on his lap and removes them. He reaches for his phone, checks it, and replaces it in his inside pocket. He crosses his legs, then uncrosses them, and his elbow rests on the bench\u2019s arm. He\u2019s uncomfortable, which is making me uncomfortable, too. Although I continue to study his string of awkward motions.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve never told anyone your story, have you?\u2019 I ask, surprising myself when my palm lands on his knee and squeezes in a gesture of comfort. It\u2019s obscene for me to be offering my empathy. He sent my mother away and lost her for ever, for both of us. But he sent me away, too. And saved me.</p><p>The distinguished gentleman stops shifting and drops his gaze to my hand. Then he lays his big palm over mine and holds it. He sighs. \u2018I was in training, if you will. Being ordained to take over for my uncle. I was twenty-one, a nasty little f**ker, and fearless to boot. Nothing and no one fazed me. I was the perfect successor.\u2019</p><p>My eyes drop to our hands and I watch closely as he fiddles with my ring thoughtfully before drawing breath. \u2018Gracie had landed in my uncle\u2019s club by accident. She was with friends, tipsy and bold. She hadn\u2019t the first idea of what she\u2019d stepped into, and I should\u2019ve sent her on her way the second I clocked her, but I was rendered immobile by her spirit. It emanated from her entire being, right from her soul, and it held me in its claws. I tried to walk away, but they dug in further. They held me there.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He reaches up with his spare hand and rubs at his eyes on a long, drawn-out sigh. \u2018She laughed.\u2019 William gazes ahead thoughtfully. \u2018Tipped martinis down her beautiful throat and carried her stunning body onto the dance floor. I was rapt. Hypnotised. Among the corrupted, sinful best of London was my Gracie. She was mine. Or going to be. When my duty was to lead her away from the seedy underworld that I was destined to run, I was instead luring her in.\u2019</p><p>The particles holding that contempt for my mother and the considerable part of my heart that holds pure, raw love for Miller begin to blend. I\u2019m beginning to lose the ability to distinguish between the two . . . just as I suspected and feared. William looks up at me and smiles wistfully, his handsome face pained and remorseful. \u2018I bought her champagne. She\u2019d never tasted it. Watching her eyes sparkle in new-found delight lifted a layer from my hard heart. Not once did she stop smiling and not once did my doubt waver that I had to make this young woman mine. I knew I was swimming in murky waters, but I was blinded.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You wish you had,\u2019 I suggest, knowing I\u2019m right. \u2018You wish you had seen her out and forgotten about her.\u2019</p><p>He laughs a little. It\u2019s condescending. \u2018There wasn\u2019t a hope of me forgetting Gracie Taylor. Sounds ridiculous, I know. I snatched a measly hour with her, stole a kiss when she resisted and told her I\u2019d be taking her out the following evening. Somewhere off the beaten track. Somewhere private, where no one knew me. She said no but didn\u2019t stop me when I helped myself to her bag and found some identity to confirm her name and address.\u2019 His smile broadens in an obvious moment of reflection. \u2018Gracie Taylor.\u2019 The sound of my mother\u2019s name pleases him, and I can\u2019t prevent a fond smile from developing on my own lips. The blossoming feelings between Gracie and William are picture perfect. Novel material. Consuming and irrational. Then it all went horribly wrong.</p> <p>I can totally relate to my mother. Despite William and Miller clearly despising each other, they have many similar qualities. She must have been just as blinded by William Anderson as he claimed to be by her. And as I am by Miller Hart.</p><p>\u2018Your obligation to your uncle ruined everything.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Obliterated it,\u2019 he corrects sardonically. \u2018My uncle was planning to retire, but a freak accident sent his body to the bottom of the Thames before we got to give him his timepiece.\u2019</p><p>My brow crumples. \u2018Timepiece?\u2019</p><p>He smiles and lifts my hand to his lips, kissing it sweetly. \u2018It\u2019s commonly recognised as a good retirement gift.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018It is?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, funny, don\u2019t you think? Someone who no longer has to clock-watch is given a watch.\u2019</p><p>I chuckle with William, feeling a bond between us budding. \u2018It\u2019s quite ironic.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Very much so.\u2019</p><p>What\u2019s also ironic is that we\u2019re laughing about this when he\u2019s just informed me that his uncle died so tragically. \u2018I\u2019m sorry about your uncle.\u2019</p><p>William huffs a sarcastic puff of breath. \u2018Don\u2019t be. He got what he deserved. Live by the sword, die by it. Isn\u2019t that what they say?\u2019</p> <p>I don\u2019t know. Do they? I\u2019m being fed information that is way too vivid and complex for my poor mind to process.</p><p>I stammer all over my words, but the comprehension seems to bite me on the arse. \u2018Was your uncle an immoral bastard?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 he chuckles again, wiping under his eyes. \u2018He was the immoral bastard. Things changed once I took over. I might have been a nasty bastard when I needed to be, but I wasn\u2019t unfair. I implemented new rules, sorted the girls out, and weeded out the arseholes on the client list as best I could. I was young, fresh, and it worked. Earned me far more respect than my uncle ever gained. The ones who wanted to stick around and do things my way stayed. The ones who didn\u2019t like the changes went and continued to be immoral bastards. I earned myself a lot of enemies, but even at that age I was not to be taken lightly.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Have you killed anyone?\u2019 I blurt the question without thought, and startled greys flip to mine fast. I almost let an apology slip for asking such a thing, but the wary glaze that descends over William\u2019s clear eyes tells me it\u2019s not such a stupid inquiry. He has.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s irrelevant, don\u2019t you think?\u2019</p><p>No, I don\u2019t, but his cautionary glare prevents me from saying so. Had he not taken someone\u2019s life, then I\u2019m certain he\u2019d be quick to put me right. \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be.\u2019 He reaches over and skims his knuckles over my cheek. \u2018Your beautiful mind doesn\u2019t need to be tarnished with ugliness.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Too late,\u2019 I whisper, making William\u2019s delicate touch falter. \u2018But we\u2019re not talking about me and my decisions. What happened then?\u2019</p> <p>Shifting in his seated position, William takes both of my hands and turns to me. \u2018We courted.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dated?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, if you will.\u2019</p><p>I smile, remembering Nan using the very same word. \u2018And?\u2019</p><p>\u2018And it was intense. Gracie, although young and lacking in experience, had passion built in and ready to unleash. And she unleashed it on me. It sparked an undiscovered hunger in me. A hunger for her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You fell in love.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think that happened immediately.\u2019 Sadness washes over his features again, his eyes dropping to his lap. \u2018I spent only a month swallowed up in your mother\u2019s fiery desire. Then reality hit, and Gracie and I were suddenly an impossible combination.\u2019</p><p>I know exactly how he must have felt, and whatever bond we share just got a little stronger. \u2018What happened?\u2019</p><p>\u2018My eye was off the ball and one of my girls paid for it.\u2019</p><p>I gasp and reclaim a hand.</p><p>He rubs his forehead, reliving the pain. \u2018Damage control was something else. My enemies would have been pigs in shit over it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So you broke things off with her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tried to. For a long, long time. Gracie was addictive and the thought of facing a day without immersing myself in her was unthinkable. And anyway, she knew how to render me stupid, how to brandish her sass and body unfairly. I was screwed.\u2019 William relaxes back on the bench and gazes across the square, drifting off somewhere distant and troubled. \u2018I kept us on the down-low. She would have been a target.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It wasn\u2019t just your obligation to the girls that stopped you being together, was it?\u2019 I don\u2019t need confirmation.</p><p>\u2018No, it wasn\u2019t. If I allowed my feelings for that woman to be known, she would have been a red flag. I may as well have served her on a f**king plate.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But that happened anyway,\u2019 I remind him. He sent her away, let her fall into the hands of an immoral bastard.</p><p>\u2018After a few traumatic years, yes, it did. I always hoped you would be enough to pull her around.\u2019</p><p>I scoff, pissed off at being reminded of my lack of incentive to my mother. \u2018We all know how that worked out for you,\u2019 I snipe. \u2018Sorry I let you down.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Enough!\u2019</p><p>\u2018How did she become pregnant with another man\u2019s child?\u2019 I ask, ignoring his irritation at my candidness. \u2018She was nineteen when she had me. That\u2019s not long after you met.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She punished me, Olivia. I already told you that. I don\u2019t need to remind you of the book. Remember reading much of me in there?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I admit, feeling almost sorry for William.</p><p>\u2018She became pregnant with another man\u2019s child. It deflected any suspicion there may have been about your mother and me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Who was he?\u2019</p><p>William scoffs. \u2018Who the hell knows? Gracie certainly didn\u2019t.\u2019 Resentment pours from him and he releases a calming rush of breath. Speaking of this makes him angry. And it just makes me hate my mother more. \u2018You were probably the best thing that could have happened.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad someone thinks so,\u2019 I say scathingly.</p><p>\u2018Olivia!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad I served a purpose,\u2019 I laugh wickedly. \u2018And here\u2019s me thinking no one wanted me, yet it turns out that I did my mother\u2019s pimp a favour. My purpose in life is making me so proud.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You saved your mother\u2019s life, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I snap. He\u2019s not going to suggest that my purpose was to deter the enemy, to deflect from Gracie and William\u2019s relationship? \u2018Just so she could abandon me later?\u2019 I ask. \u2018For all we know, she\u2019s dead, William! My purpose stands for shit because despite everything, she still ended up f**king dead! I still have no mother and you have no Gracie!\u2019 I heave violently next to him, blinking back tears of fury. The compassion has been sucked up, the merging parts of my heart severed in the blink of an eye . . . or the delivery of a thoughtless sentence. He was doing so well. The history of their relationship momentarily made me forget about the matter at hand. Miller. And me. Us. We\u2019re not destined to follow the same destructive path of tortured love and irreparable heartache. We were on our way, but we saved each other.</p><p>I stand and swing towards him. He\u2019s regarding me carefully. \u2018Miller won\u2019t let me down like you did Gracie.\u2019 I turn and storm away, hearing him hiss on a wince. I half expect to be seized before I make it out of the square, but I\u2019m allowed to remove myself from William and his revelations without intervention.</p><p>I don\u2019t mean to, but when I finally make it home, I slam the front door shut, still reeling after my time with William and exhausted after my time at the doctor\u2019s. I don\u2019t recall much of my time sitting opposite my GP\u2019s desk. I blurted my predicament, was interrogated before being prescribed the morning-after pill and contraceptive pill, and left, taking myself across the road to the pharmacy. And it was all done in a cloud of hopelessness.</p><p>The harsh clatter of the door crashing within the frame prompts Nan to scuttle from the kitchen in alarm. \u2018Livy, whatever\u2019s the matter?\u2019 She glances down at her old watch. \u2018It\u2019s not even midday.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t bother trying to compose myself \u2013 I\u2019m still too wound up \u2013 so I utilise my only other option, which is fine because it\u2019s part true. \u2018Del sent me home.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you ill?\u2019 Her steps increase in pace as she wipes her hands on the tea towel, until she\u2019s standing before me feeling my forehead. \u2018You have a temperature.\u2019</p><p>Yes, I have. I\u2019m burning with blinding rage. Sagging against the front door, I let my grandmother fuss over me, grateful for the sight of her friendly face, even if it\u2019s etched in worry right now. \u2018I\u2019m okay.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Pa!\u2019 she scoffs. \u2018Don\u2019t piss down my back and tell me it\u2019s raining!\u2019 She brushes some damp tendrils from my face. \u2018The faster you learn that I\u2019m not doolally-tap the better.\u2019 Her old sapphire eyes drill holes into my pathetic form. \u2018I\u2019ll make tea.\u2019 She\u2019s off up the hallway. \u2018Come.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because tea makes everything in the world right,\u2019 I mutter, pushing myself off the door and following her.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nothing.\u2019 I land in a chair and retrieve my phone from my satchel when it chimes.</p><p>\u2018A call?\u2019 Nan asks, flicking the kettle on.</p><p>\u2018A text.\u2019</p><p>She turns, genuine curiosity my way. \u2018How do you know the difference?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, because a call . . .\u2019 I halt mid-sentence as I unlock my shiny new device. \u2018Are you ever going to have a mobile phone?\u2019</p><p>She laughs and returns to tea-making duties. \u2018I\u2019d rather get a back massage by Edward Scissorhands! Why at my age would I need one of those silly things?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then it doesn\u2019t matter what sound signals a text, call, or e-mail, does it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018E-mail?\u2019 she screeches. \u2018You can send e-mails?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Yes. And you can use the Internet, do your shopping, and delve into social media.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s social media?\u2019</p><p>I laugh, flopping back in my chair. \u2018You won\u2019t live long enough for me to explain, Nan.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 She shows complete indifference as she pours boiling water into the teapot, and then milk into a tiny jug. \u2018There will be little point for people to leave their homes if technology continues at this rate. Texts and e-mails. Whatever happened to having a face to face conversation with someone, hmmm? Or even a nice chat on the phone. Don\u2019t ever send me a text.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I can\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t have a mobile.\u2019</p><p>\u2018An e-mail, then. Never send me an e-mail.\u2019</p><p>I smirk. \u2018You don\u2019t have an e-mail account, so I can\u2019t send you an e-mail either.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, that\u2019s a relief.\u2019</p><p>I titter to myself and direct my eyes to the screen of my phone as Nan brings the tea to the table and pours, loading mine with sugar.</p> <p>\u2018Need fattening up,\u2019 she grumbles, but I ignore her because William\u2019s name is glowing at me, telling me he\u2019s sent me a message \u2013 one I know I won\u2019t want to read. It doesn\u2019t stop me from pushing the Open button, though.</p><p>This can\u2019t end well.</p><p>My teeth grit and I delete the message, damning myself for reading it.</p><p>\u2018I haven\u2019t seen Gregory in a while.\u2019 Nan\u2019s statement is laced with forced nonchalance. She knows he and I aren\u2019t speaking. I can\u2019t bring myself to call him, not after his rant. He was furious and undeniably serious in his threat.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s been busy.\u2019 I toss my phone in my bag and swipe up my cup of tea, blowing the steam from the surface while I watch Nan stir hers slowly.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s never been too busy before.\u2019</p> <p>No valid reason for Gregory\u2019s absence is dawning on me. She knows Miller and Gregory don\u2019t see eye to eye. It would be easier to tell her that he\u2019s slapped conditions on our friendship, but I just can\u2019t be bothered. \u2018I\u2019m going to lie down.\u2019 I scoop my satchel up and stand, giving my grandmother\u2019s pouting face a peck. She hates it when I keep things from her, but with my spunky nan being the only person on the planet, other than Miller and me, encouraging our reunion, I\u2019ve concluded that everything should be on a need-to-know basis. And she doesn\u2019t need to know.</p><p>I drag myself upstairs and collapse to my arse on the familiar, messy sheets of my bed as I rummage through my satchel and pull out a paper bag. Flicking through the boxes, I find the pack and open it, popping out the pill before placing it on my tongue and closing my mouth. I just sit there, the tiny tablet feeling like lead. Closing my eyes, I eventually swallow it down and chuck the boxes in the top drawer of my bedside table. Then I fall to my back. There\u2019s no darkness to be found, even if I were to pull the curtains across, so I yank a pillow close and roll into it, nuzzling my face deep and clenching my eyes shut. I\u2019m only a fraction through the day and all of the elation I felt on waking this morning has been killed stone-cold dead.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Fireworks implode, a soft crackling rousing me from a peaceful slumber. It\u2019s dusk and I\u2019m safe. He\u2019s here. I smile and shift in his hold until I\u2019m lost in beautiful, soft blue eyes. My hands disappear beneath his suit jacket, around his back, and I pull myself closer until his warm breath is coating my cheeks. Circling our noses, he shifts his palm to the back of my thigh, tugging it up to his hip. \u2018I was worried about you,\u2019 he whispers. \u2018What happened?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I threw up on a pair of grannies.\u2019</p><p>His eyes sparkle mischievously. \u2018I heard.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then William showed up.\u2019 I\u2019m not surprised when the sparkle dulls and Miller stiffens in my hold.</p><p>\u2018What did he want?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018To irritate me,\u2019 I mutter, snuggling into his chest, my cheek resting over his heart. It\u2019s beating a strong steady thrum and the sound settles me completely. \u2018Tell me you\u2019ll never abandon me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I promise.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t falter, like he\u2019s had a warning that I\u2019d make this request, like he knows why William is hounding me.</p><p>It\u2019s enough, because Miller Hart doesn\u2019t make promises that he can\u2019t keep. \u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t thank me, Olivia. Never thank me. Come here, let me see you.\u2019 He wrestles me from the sanctuary of his body and props himself up against my headboard, arranging me on his lap just so. I can feel his erection wedged between our bodies, long and hard, but by the look on Miller\u2019s face, I\u2019m on my own in the lust department. I frown and take a sneaky grind as he clasps my hands and entwines our fingers. Then he cocks a knowing eyebrow at me. \u2018Why do you work at the bistro?\u2019</p><p>His odd question halts my tempting tactics in their tracks. \u2018To earn money.\u2019 That\u2019s not strictly true. I have a bank account bursting at the seams with cash.</p><p>\u2018I have plenty of money. You slaving away in a London caf\u00e9 isn\u2019t necessary.\u2019</p><p>I bite my bottom lip, worrying it back and forth as I comprehend what he\u2019s saying. His Adam\u2019s apple is bobbing in his throat from his constant swallows. He\u2019s nervous of my reaction, and he should be. \u2018I don\u2019t need any man\u2019s money,\u2019 I state quite calmly, even though his hint has zapped my serenity of a few moments ago.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not just any man, Olivia.\u2019 His palms slide to my upper arms and pull me close to the stubbled shadow of his jaw. Blue eyes scorch me with heated annoyance, but he\u2019s still gentle with me, and his tone is soft. \u2018Don\u2019t upset yourself.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not. I just want to earn my own money.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know you have more ambition than making coffee.\u2019 Miller\u2019s tone is patronising, and while I could point out that his ambitions were a lot less commendable, I\u2019m not up for another confrontation today.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m tired.\u2019 I cop out from the line of conversation with that pathetic statement and fall onto his suit-covered chest, pushing my face into his neck and filling my nose with his manly scent.</p><p>\u2018Tired.\u2019 He sighs and envelops me in his arms. \u2018It\u2019s six thirty in the evening and I believe you have been in this bed since noon.\u2019</p><p>I ignore his observation and reach up to play with his ear, rubbing his lobe through my index finger and thumb. \u2018How was your day?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Long. What did Anderson want?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I told you, to irritate me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Elaborate.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve asked once.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You can ask as many times as you like,\u2019 I whisper. \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m being moved before I can stiffen my muscles to hinder him. He pushes me up so I\u2019m straddling his lap and clamps down on my thighs, impatience hazy in his gaze. \u2018Tough luck.\u2019</p><p>\u2018For you,\u2019 I mutter indignantly. I\u2019m pushing his buttons, but I have no desire to share my recent revelations with Miller right now \u2013 probably never will. I was a baby of convenience, and not of the regular kind. I served one purpose and one purpose alone, and that failed miserably, anyway.</p><p>I\u2019m under close scrutiny. He\u2019s waiting for my elaboration, which will never come, yet Miller\u2019s expectant pose doesn\u2019t block more unpleasant thoughts from creeping through the barriers of my mind. How must William have felt knowing Gracie got pregnant by another man when he loved her so deeply? She was punishing him by sleeping with other men, that\u2019s now clear, but did she mean to get herself knocked up? Was one of my purposes to cripple William with hurt, too? And would William have made my mother terminate me had I not been of use in diverting the enemy? I was a pawn, that\u2019s all. An object used to William\u2019s advantage.</p><p>\u2018Olivia?\u2019 Miller\u2019s gentle, encouraging mention of my name sucks my dejected mind back into the room where I\u2019m faced with someone who does want me. Not because I serve a purpose, but because I am their purpose.</p><p>\u2018William used me,\u2019 I murmur, the words causing me physical pain. I was over this. I was past the hurt of being abandoned, but now I\u2019m facing a new kind of hurt. \u2018My mother got herself pregnant by another man to punish William.\u2019 I wince at my own cold words and clench my eyes shut. \u2018They were in love. William and my mother were hopelessly in love and couldn\u2019t be together because of William\u2019s world. If the wrong people found out about his relationship with Gracie, they would have used her against him.\u2019 I\u2019m suddenly considering the possibility of William keeping Gracie close by, not only to fuel his need to see her, but also as another deterrent. He never got involved with his girls. It was common knowledge.</p><p>My eyes remain locked tightly shut until I feel movement beneath me and Miller\u2019s warm mouth on mine. \u2018Shhh,\u2019 he hushes me, despite the fact that I\u2019ve stopped speaking. I have nothing more to say and I hope Miller doesn\u2019t push for more. Every tiny snippet of information that William fed me this morning, all of the intensity and passion between him and my mother that he spoke of, was annihilated with his final enlightenment.</p><p>You saved your mother\u2019s life.</p><p>No, I didn\u2019t, and my current state of mind won\u2019t allow me to feel remorseful about it. \u2018How long have you known William?\u2019 I ask quietly as he rains gentle pecks on my cheeks and lips.</p><p>\u2018Ten years.\u2019 His answer carries an air of finality and his mouth continues to seduce mine, his tongue slipping past my lips and sweeping reverently in circles. I feel distracted, so I pull away from his busy mouth and study him for a moment, pushing his misbehaving wave from his brow. He\u2019s not happy about my withdrawal, which only increases my suspicion.</p><p>\u2018When you found out I knew William, you knew he\u2019d have something to say about us, didn\u2019t you? He doesn\u2019t agree with how you conduct business.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Correct.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s it?\u2019</p><p>He shrugs a little, displaying indifference. \u2018Anderson has a lot to say about a lot of things, me included.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He said you\u2019re immoral,\u2019 I whisper, dropping my gaze to our laps, almost ashamed of sharing William\u2019s thoughts, which is ridiculous when I\u2019ve heard William tell Miller this to his face.</p><p>\u2018Look at me.\u2019 The pad of his finger slips under my chin and raises my face to his. I\u2019m immediately consumed with blazing eyes and soft parted lips. \u2018Never with you,\u2019 he says slowly, quietly, holding my eyes like magnets.</p><p>I knew that. Our horrid hotel encounter needs to be forgotten. That wasn\u2019t my Miller. \u2018I love you,\u2019 I tell him on a quiet gush of air, slipping my arms under his and melding into his torso, my cheek lying on his shoulder. He responds with an almost undetectable groan and takes me to my back, the length of his body pinning me to the bed. \u2018You\u2019ll be all crumpled,\u2019 I muse, ruffling his hair and trying to push my rendezvous with William away. All of those years I wished for an explanation, went to epic lengths to find it, and now I\u2019ve stumbled upon it and I wholeheartedly wish I hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u2018It could be worse.\u2019 He nips at my neck, the hot pressure of his mouth sending me on a little writhe.</p><p>\u2018How?\u2019 Miller\u2019s obsession with his appearance is definitely lessening, and while it should please me immensely that some of his uptight, picky ways are evidently easing up, I can\u2019t figure out why I seem to be more bothered by his waning care than he does.</p><p>\u2018We could be scheduled to eat out.\u2019</p><p>My brow furrows, but he continues before I can ask what on earth he\u2019s talking about.</p><p>\u2018Luckily, your lovely grandmother has offered to feed us.\u2019 He pushes up on his forearms and looks down at me, a cunning glint in his eyes. I know what he\u2019s looking for and I won\u2019t disappoint him. I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u2018Did she pin you down until you agreed?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Not necessary.\u2019 Miller drops a lazy kiss on my lips and rises, the shift pushing his h*ps into my lower stomach. My eyes widen and moisture bombards my centre. Now that I have emptied my mind of unwanted burdens, there\u2019s room for something else. Something appealing.</p><p>Desire.</p><p>Nibbling my bottom lip, I reach up to his shoulders and smooth down the sleeves of his suit jacket, the feel of tight muscle beneath only heightening my growing wanton state. He shakes his head slowly, definitely, unwaveringly, and I deflate on an annoyed huff of breath. \u2018Control yourself, then.\u2019 I tip my h*ps up and spike a sharp inhale of breath from him, followed up with a poor attempt to scowl at me. I grin and repeat. Of course, this only teases me further, too, but Miller\u2019s struggle to contain himself ignites a childish rebellion in me. I flip up again and watch on a laugh as he jumps off the bed and starts brushing himself down and pulling at his jacket.</p><p>\u2018Really, Olivia?\u2019</p> <p>I sit up, a wicked grin on my face. \u2018It\u2019s always on your terms,\u2019 I state, resting my chin in my palm and my elbow on my knee. He\u2019s still busy rearranging himself, choosing to answer without looking at me.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s a good job, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s polite to look at someone when they\u2019re talking to you.\u2019</p><p>Frantic hands halt in their fussing and an impassive face slowly rises to mine. \u2018It\u2019s a good job, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, I wouldn\u2019t.\u2019 Images of a gym, a paint studio, and cars jump all over my mind. At least there\u2019s a bed here. And it\u2019s my bedroom. I slide off the mattress and pace slowly and purposely over to him. He watches me, standing silently, almost cautiously, until my chest is pushed into his. I lift my eyes to his mouth. Hot, lusty air streams from parted lips, fuelling my hunger, swelling my confidence. \u2018I won\u2019t make it through dinner,\u2019 I warn, flicking my eyes to his.</p> <p>\u2018I won\u2019t disrespect your grandmother, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>My eyes narrow and a conniving hand stretches forward and brushes over his groin. He jumps back. I move forward. \u2018Don\u2019t be so uptight.\u2019</p><p>Strong hands circle my upper arms and a face full of frustration lowers to mine. \u2018No,\u2019 he says simply.</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I retort, struggling out of his hold and cupping him over his trousers. \u2018You\u2019re the one who\u2019s unleashed this need, so you\u2019re under obligation to remedy it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fucking hell!\u2019</p><p>I inwardly cheer, knowing I have him. He can\u2019t make me endure another dinner at Nan\u2019s table when I\u2019m in this condition. I\u2019ll spontaneously combust. \u2018Loosen up.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Give me strength, Olivia.\u2019 He knocks my hand away from his groin and tackles me to the bed, the frame squeaking, the headboard smacking the wall behind. My victory fills me with unreasonable pride. My lips press together and my eyes clench shut as he circles deliciously into me, the friction having me trying to shift my legs beneath him to alleviate the pressure building between my thighs. My actions earn me more restraint. He nails my wrists to the mattress. \u2018You want me?\u2019 he breathes in my face, gently thrusting forward, pushing the bated breath from my lungs. I cry out, my eyes flying open. Dark lashes greet me, framing intoxicating blues. \u2018Don\u2019t make me ask you again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 I yelp at the delivery of another calculated thrust, feeling him solid beneath the material of his trousers. Dizziness overwhelms me and the room starts spinning wildly, yet Miller\u2019s perfect face is still perfectly clear before me. \u2018Miller,\u2019 I pant, loving and hating his control over my body all at once.</p><p>Smug satisfaction plagues his features. And then he pushes himself off me and sets about sorting his suit out again. \u2018Come. Your grandmother has gone to a lot of trouble.\u2019</p><p>My mouth falls open in utter disbelief. \u2018You\u2019re not . . .\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, I am.\u2019 He collects me from the bed and begins to make me look presentable while I stand unequivocally dumbstruck by his underhanded game. He\u2019s solid. It must be painful, because I know that I\u2019m suffering. He brushes my wild hair over each shoulder, looking satisfied with the result. \u2018Your cheeks are flushed,\u2019 he says, his voice loaded with smugness.</p><p>\u2018How\u2014\u2019 His finger meets my lips to hush me before he replaces it with his lips, escalating my sexed-up condition. \u2018Just think how much more you\u2019ll enjoy me later when I can take my time with you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re unbelievably cruel,\u2019 I whimper, throwing my arms around his neck and tackling his wonderful mouth, desperate to get all I can before he wrestles me off him.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t prise me away, instead lifting me from my feet and carrying me to the door while returning my kiss, accepting my tongue dancing wildly in his mouth and moaning his appreciation as he does. In an attempt to trap him further, I curl my thighs around his tight h*ps and arch my spine, sealing our chests and balling my fists in his hair. I hum, I whimper, I sigh. My head tilts, my mouth tracks the lines of his lips, and my teeth bite down in between plunges of my tongue. This isn\u2019t improving my thirst, but if it\u2019s all I\u2019m getting for the time being, then I\u2019m making the most of it. My eyes are closed and Miller\u2019s palms are cupping my bottom, squeezing, massaging and smoothing as he takes the stairs down to the hallway. My time\u2019s running out.</p> <p>\u2018Olivia,\u2019 he pants, breaking our mouth contact.</p><p>\u2018Nuh-uh,\u2019 I moan, pushing into the back of his head, reattaching my lips to his.</p><p>\u2018Jesus, you\u2019re ruining me.\u2019</p><p>Through my dizziness, I register the stupidity of such a statement. \u2018Take me to your place,\u2019 I beg, knowing I\u2019m pleading in vain. Miller\u2019s far too polite to stand my grandmother up. I can smell a hearty meal, something stodgy simmering upon the stove, and I hear Nan singing chirpily in the kitchen.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s gone to too much trouble.\u2019 He peels me away from his suit and sets me on my feet, tugging my top into place. \u2018Aren\u2019t you hungry?\u2019 His eyes drop to my too-flat stomach.</p><p>\u2018Not really,\u2019 I concede. There\u2019s no room in my brain to register hunger.</p><p>\u2018We need to resolve this appetite issue,\u2019 he quips curtly, \u2018before you disappear before my eyes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s no issue.\u2019 I reach up and take Miller\u2019s tie, jiggling with the dislodged knot for a short time before I\u2019m happy that it\u2019s straight and tidy. \u2018I eat when I\u2019m hungry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Which is when?\u2019 He throws me an expectant look as he removes his jacket and hangs it on the coat hooks before he turns into the mirror and undoes what I\u2019ve just spent thirty seconds of my time perfecting. His back broadens with the position of his hands at his neck, the material of his waistcoat pulling taut. I sigh my appreciation. \u2018We need to get you to the doctor\u2019s.\u2019</p><p>His statement yanks me back to the here and now, having me look up to a serious face. \u2018I\u2019ve been,\u2019 I whisper.</p><p>He can\u2019t hide his shock. I love that I can spike all of these emotions from him, but not now. \u2018You went without me?\u2019</p><p>My shoulders jump up a little, displaying detachment. \u2018The receptionist said it\u2019s best to take the morning-after pill as soon as possible, and they only had an available appointment this morning.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 He drops his hands from his tie, looking uncomfortable. \u2018I didn\u2019t want you to have to do it alone, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I swallowed a pill.\u2019 I smile, trying to lighten him up. He feels guilty.</p><p>\u2018And birth control?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Done.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Have you started?\u2019</p><p>\u2018On the first day of my next period.\u2019 I definitely remember that part, but not much else.</p><p>\u2018Which is when?\u2019</p><p>I mentally sprint through my cycle, frowning to myself. \u2018Three weeks.\u2019 This won\u2019t please him. I only just had a period while Miller was . . . absent.</p><p>\u2018Excellent,\u2019 he says, all formal, like he\u2019s just secured a profitable business deal. I roll my eyes and ignore his inquisitive look.</p><p>\u2018And before you ask, yes, there\u2019s a need for insolence.\u2019</p><p>His lips purse and his blistering blue eyes narrow slightly. \u2018Sass,\u2019 he whispers, making me smile. \u2018I would have come.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m a big girl.\u2019 I brush off his concern with ease, despite it being entirely his fault that I wound up in that position. It won\u2019t happen again. \u2018And, anyway, you did come.\u2019 I grin, trying to ease his guilt. \u2018Inside me.\u2019</p><p>He matches my grin. \u2018Double sass.\u2019</p><p>Footsteps interrupt us and Nan appears, her jolly face jollier than normal, and I know it\u2019s because Miller is here and he\u2019s agreed to let her feed him. \u2018Hotpot!\u2019 she sings, delighted. \u2018I didn\u2019t have time for anything more extravagant.\u2019</p><p>Miller rips his eyes from mine and pivots on his expensive shoes. Nan\u2019s delight increases, even if she\u2019s lost the lovely view of Miller\u2019s buns. \u2018I\u2019m sure that whatever you\u2019ve decided on, it\u2019ll be just perfect, Mrs Taylor.\u2019</p><p>She flaps a tea towel at Miller, all bashful and giggly. \u2018I\u2019ve laid the table in the kitchen.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Had I known we\u2019d be eating together, I would have brought something,\u2019 Miller says, taking my nape and encouraging me to follow Nan to the kitchen.</p><p>\u2018Nonsense!\u2019 Nan laughs. \u2018Besides, I still have the champagne and the caviar.\u2019</p><p>\u2018With hotpot?\u2019 I ask on a frown.</p><p>\u2018No, but I doubt Miller would have brought a barrel of cheap ale to slurp.\u2019 Nan flips her hand, indicating a chair. \u2018Sit.\u2019</p><p>My chair is pulled out for me and tucked back under once I\u2019ve taken my seat. His mouth meets my ear. \u2018How fast can you eat hotpot?\u2019</p><p>I ignore him and concentrate on soaking up the heat of his breath in my ear, probably a stupid thing to do, but it doesn\u2019t matter how fast I can eat because Miller\u2019s manners prevent him from scoffing down food.</p><p>He takes his seat next to me and gives me a salacious smirk, just as a huge pot lands in the centre of the table. I inhale the smell of meat, veggies and potatoes. And grimace. I\u2019m not in the least bit hungry, only for the infuriating male seated next to me.</p><p>\u2018Where has George got to?\u2019 Nan gripes, looking impatiently down at her watch. \u2018He\u2019s five minutes late.\u2019</p><p>\u2018George is joining us?\u2019 Miller asks, nodding at the steaming pot, his instruction for me to dive in. \u2018It\u2019ll be nice to see him again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hmmm, it\u2019s not like him to be late.\u2019</p><p>She\u2019s right. He\u2019s usually sitting at the table armed with his knife and fork in plenty of time to be the first into the pot. Unfortunately, I get the pleasure today. I take the serving spoon with as much enthusiasm as I feel and plunge it into the middle, wafting the smell into the air surrounding us.</p><p>\u2018Smells delicious,\u2019 Miller informs Nan, keeping his eyes on me. I\u2019m not sure how much I can stomach, but with Nan and Miller both taking a vested interest in my eating habits, I\u2019m destined to struggle my way through a whole bowl.</p><p>The chime of the doorbell saves me. \u2018I\u2019ll get it.\u2019 I drop the spoon and lift my bum from the chair, only to be pushed back down.</p><p>\u2018Allow me,\u2019 Miller interjects, taking the serving spoon and transferring a heaped spoonful into my dish before he makes off down the hallway.</p><p>\u2018Thank you, Miller,\u2019 Nan croons, smiling brightly. \u2018Such a gentleman.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Some of the time,\u2019 I mutter under my breath, collecting the serving spoon and piling Miller\u2019s bowl high until it\u2019s near to overflowing.</p><p>\u2018Is he hungry?\u2019 Nan asks, her old eyes following the spoon travelling back and forth from the pot to Miller\u2019s dish.</p><p>\u2018Starving,\u2019 I declare, silently smug.</p><p>\u2018Save some for George. He\u2019ll blow a gasket if he doesn\u2019t get at least two helpings.\u2019 She peeks into the pot, noting the remaining contents. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018There\u2019s plenty.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good. Tuck in.\u2019 She waves her finger at my bowl, and I wonder where the table etiquette has disappeared to \u2013 the one where we wait for everyone to start together. Nan glances down the hallway on a wrinkle of her brow. \u2018Do you think he got lost?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll go.\u2019 I jump up, anything to delay eating, hoping by some miracle I\u2019ll find my appetite while I\u2019m finding Miller and George. Showing no urgency, I stroll down the hallway, catching a glimpse of Miller\u2019s back as the door closes behind him.</p><p>\u2018What do you want?\u2019 I hear him spit on an attempted hush. It\u2019s a mega fail.</p> <p>It takes me only a split second to figure that whoever rang the doorbell wasn\u2019t George. They would be back at the table by now, and Miller wouldn\u2019t be asking that question in such a vicious tone. My pace quickens and so does my heart. I take the door handle and pull, but it shifts only millimetres, the resistance increasing slightly under my tug. I don\u2019t want to shout at him and attract Nan\u2019s attention, so I wait a few moments until I feel the resistance ease up; then I throw all of my might into yanking it open. It works. Miller staggers slightly from his unexpected loss of grip, his hair falling onto his brow, his shocked blues darting to me.</p><p>\u2018Olivia.\u2019 He hardly contains his sigh of exasperation as he steps towards me and slides a palm onto my nape. Then he shifts to the side, revealing the mystery guest.</p><p>\u2018Gregory,\u2019 I breathe, delighted and cautious all at once. This isn\u2019t ideal. I would never have chosen to try and repair our friendship with Miller around, but he\u2019s here now and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. Gregory\u2019s ticking jaw isn\u2019t a good sign that his tolerance of Miller has improved, and Miller\u2019s buzzing form touching mine indicates the same response to my friend.</p><p>\u2018Nice and cosy,\u2019 Gregory grinds out with scathing eyes roaming from Miller to me.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be like that,\u2019 I say softly, attempting to move towards him and getting nowhere. Miller isn\u2019t releasing me, come hell or high water. \u2018Miller, please.\u2019 I twist out of his hold and get growled at for my trouble.</p> <p>\u2018Forget it, Olivia.\u2019 He reclaims me and I glance up, seeing murder etched all over his face. I don\u2019t need this. \u2018What do you want?\u2019 Miller\u2019s tone is soaked in threat.</p><p>\u2018I want to speak to Olivia.\u2019 Gregory states his request on a snarl, matching Miller\u2019s fieriness. They\u2019re like two wolves in a staring stand-off, heaving and gnashing jaws, each one getting ready to attack, except I\u2019m not sure which one will lose their control first. Gregory\u2019s bravado is commendable.</p><p>\u2018Then speak.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Alone.\u2019</p><p>Miller\u2019s head shakes mildly, confidently, supremacy oozing from every pore of his refined physique. \u2018No,\u2019 he says on a whisper, but the near-silent word is loaded with determination \u2013 no raised volume necessary.</p><p>Gregory rips his brown eyes from Miller and they land on me with a contemptuous bang. \u2018Fine, you can stay,\u2019 he relents, the vein in his neck throbbing.</p> <p>\u2018That\u2019s not up for negotiation,\u2019 Miller clarifies.</p><p>My best friend doesn\u2019t bless Miller with a disdainful look, instead keeping cold eyes on me. \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 he says, with zero sincerity, his face holding the look of indifference that\u2019s been apparent since I clapped eyes on him. He doesn\u2019t appear or sound sorry in the slightest, yet I\u2019m willing him to be. I want to apologise, too, but for what I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think I have anything to be remorseful for. Nevertheless, I\u2019ll willingly offer up an apology if it means I\u2019ll get Gregory back. I may have been distracted since our altercation, but he\u2019s not been around and it\u2019s been gnawing on my conscience. I\u2019ve missed him terribly.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry, too,\u2019 I whisper, ignoring Miller\u2019s increased breathing and twitching beside me. \u2018I hate this.\u2019</p><p>I watch as his face drops to match his broad shoulders. He slips a hand into his jeans pocket, his work boots scuffing the pathway beneath. \u2018Baby girl, I hate this, too, but I\u2019m here for you.\u2019 He lifts tortured eyes to mine. \u2018You need to know that.\u2019</p><p>Happiness floods me, the hugest weight lifting from my tired shoulders. \u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re welcome,\u2019 he replies, and then removes something from his pocket. His arm extends towards me with something gripped between his fingers. Confusion replaces the relief, and I definitely don\u2019t imagine Miller turning stone cold next to me. \u2018Take it,\u2019 Gregory prompts, waving his arm forward.</p><p>A shimmer of silver catches the porch light, seeming to blind me like low, winter sunlight. Then I notice the perfect scrolled font. Miller\u2019s \u2018business\u2019 card. My heart beats up to my throat and wedges itself there.</p><p>Miller\u2019s hand flies out and snatches the card. \u2018Where the f**k did you get this?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter,\u2019 Gregory says calmly, in total control, while I lose control completely, my body vibrating violently with shakes.</p><p>\u2018It f**king matters,\u2019 Miller growls, balling his fist, folding his business card in on itself until it\u2019s out of sight. \u2018Where?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fuck you.\u2019</p><p>Miller\u2019s gone from my side in a heartbeat. \u2018Miller!\u2019 I scream, but he\u2019s fallen into a zone of rage and nothing will pull him back.</p><p>Gregory manages to dodge the first blow, but it\u2019s not long before both men are crashing to the concrete on a thunderous bang. \u2018Miller!\u2019 My frantic screams are hopeless and so are my frozen limbs, which I vaguely appreciate through my fog of panic. Getting between these two would be foolish, but I hate feeling so useless. \u2018Please stop,\u2019 I cry quietly. The tears building in my eyes swell and release, streaming down my cheeks, blurring the painful sight before me.</p><p>\u2018You should\u2019ve kept your f**king nose out!\u2019 Miller roars, yanking Gregory up by his shirt and landing a sickening punch to his jaw, sending my friend\u2019s head snapping to the side. \u2018Why the f**k does everyone think they have some god-given right to interfere?\u2019</p><p>Smack!</p><p>Another punishing blow splits Gregory\u2019s lip and blood bursts from the wound, coating Miller\u2019s knuckles. \u2018Leave us the f**k alone!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miller, stop!\u2019 I shout, attempting to step forward, but my legs turn to jelly, making grasping the wall essential if I\u2019m to stay on my feet. \u2018Miller!\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s straddling Gregory on the ground, his whole body heaving, sweat streaming down his face. This is the worst I\u2019ve seen him. He\u2019s completely out of control. He yanks Gregory\u2019s torso up by the scruff of his collar bunched in each fist. \u2018I\u2019ll rip out the spine of anyone who tries to take her away from me. You\u2019re no exception.\u2019 He shoves Gregory to his back and stands, all the while keeping wild eyes on my friend. \u2018You\u2019ll keep this to yourself.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miller,\u2019 I cry on a sniffle, struggling to gain a steadying breath through my choked sobbing.</p><p>He turns slowly towards me and I don\u2019t like what I see. Irrationality. Unruliness. Lunacy. This side of him, the violent, crazy, reckless part, I don\u2019t like at all. It frightens me, not only because of the damage that he can so easily inflict, but also because he seems so unaware while he\u2019s in this destructive mode. Our eyes hold for the longest time, me trying to bring him back around before he does further damage, him heaving uncontrollably before me. Gregory\u2019s in a bad way, struggling to get to his feet behind Miller, clutching his stomach and hissing in pain. He didn\u2019t deserve that.</p><p>\u2018She needs to know,\u2019 Gregory mumbles, standing half bent, clearly in tremendous pain. His barely decipherable words register loud and clear. He thinks I don\u2019t know. He thought he was coming here to share some information on the man he hates that would see me throwing him out of my life. He thinks that\u2019s why Miller has lost the plot, not simply because of his interference and risk of exposure to Nan, which I know now is a massive concern to him. My poor heart is still in overdrive, pounding in my chest, and this realisation has just flipped it up another gear.</p><p>\u2018I already knew,\u2019 I say on a breathy gasp, keeping my eyes on Miller\u2019s. \u2018I know what he was and what he did.\u2019 And I know this news will cripple Gregory. He thought he had the perfect reason for me to leave Miller, and he thought he\u2019d be able to comfort me as I dealt with the horrid revelation. He was hoping for that the most. But he\u2019s wrong, and I\u2019m fully aware that this could equal the final blow to our friendship. He\u2019ll never understand why I\u2019m still with Miller, and I doubt my ability to make him see why or the strength required to do it.</p><p>\u2018You knew?\u2019 His tone is now dripping with pure shock. \u2018You know that this piece of shit is a f**king gigolo?\u2019</p><p>\u2018An escort,\u2019 I correct. \u2018And was.\u2019 I allow my eyes to travel over Miller\u2019s pulsing shoulders to Gregory\u2019s folded body. He\u2019s starting to straighten up.</p><p>The disbelief on his face spikes unwanted and unwarranted shame to attack me. \u2018What the f**k has happened to you?\u2019 His look of hatred slices right through me, and I clamp my lips together to prevent a sob from ripping past them, knowing it\u2019ll trigger Miller\u2019s insanity again.</p><p>I don\u2019t register the door swinging open behind me, but I do register Nan\u2019s age-worn voice. \u2018Dinner\u2019s getting cold!\u2019 she snaps, and then silence falls for the briefest of moments while she takes in the scene she\u2019s happened upon. \u2018What the devil . . .?\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t get the chance to even think of what explanation can be given to my grandmother. Gregory springs to life and charges at Miller, throwing himself at his mid-section and taking them tumbling down the path onto the street. \u2018You bastard!\u2019 he yells, pulling back his fist and sending it catapulting forward on an angry bellow, but Miller\u2019s head dodges it, sending Gregory\u2019s balled fist into the concrete beside his head. \u2018Fuck!\u2019</p><p>Miller\u2019s up and dragging Gregory with him, pinning him to the low wall at the end of our front garden.</p><p>\u2018Goodness gracious!\u2019 Nan flies past me and throws herself into the middle of the two men, her notorious spunk rearing its ugly head. There\u2019s no display of fear on her old face, just sheer determination. \u2018Pack it in!\u2019 she yells, muscling between them and pushing them apart on a shout. \u2018That\u2019s enough!\u2019 Both men heave on each side of her, sweating and glaring over her head. She\u2019s brave, but my fear for her is rife as I absorb potent anger firing off from both men, showing no sign of receding. She\u2019s far from frail, but she\u2019s an old lady nonetheless. She shouldn\u2019t be intervening between these two men, especially not Miller. He\u2019s frenzied, unable to rationalise. \u2018I\u2019m giving you one chance!\u2019 she warns. \u2018Cut it out or deal with me!\u2019</p><p>Her words put the fear of God in me, but I doubt they\u2019ll have any effect on these two. So imagine my shock when both men relax and break the staring deadlock in unison. Then I remember William\u2019s light quip.</p><p>No one ever made me quake in my boots, Olivia. Only your grandmother.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s more like it.\u2019 She releases her palms from each man\u2019s chest slowly, ensuring they\u2019ll remain in place. Her face screws up in disgust as she flicks eyes heated with anger between Miller and Gregory. \u2018Don\u2019t you dare make me pull you apart again. Do you hear me?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m staggered when Miller nods short and sharp and Gregory sniffs an agreement, wiping his bleeding nose.</p><p>\u2018Good.\u2019 She points to the front door. \u2018Get in the house before the neighbours start talking.\u2019</p><p>I remain a quiet, stunned observer as Nan takes the reins and regains control of the horrid situation, pushing both men towards the house when neither moves fast enough for her liking. Miller\u2019s head is dropped, and I know it\u2019s in shame at having my dear grandmother, a woman who he respects, bear witness to this aggression. I\u2019m only thankful that she didn\u2019t appear moments earlier when she would\u2019ve caught Miller in full psycho action. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gregory passes me first, then Nan, and when Miller approaches my motionless form, he slowly drags disturbed eyes to my traumatised ones and stops in front of me. He\u2019s a dishevelled wreck, his shirt and waistcoat all askew and ripped at the shoulder, his hair wild and tangled.</p><p>\u2018I apologise,\u2019 he says quietly, and then turns and strides down the pathway, his long legs eating up the distance to his car in no time.</p><p>\u2018Miller!\u2019 I shout, panicked as I go in pursuit of him. My unsteady legs are of no assistance and tyres screech away from the kerb before I make it to the end of the path. My hand instinctively reaches for my chest, like a bit of pressure might calm the erratic thumping. It doesn\u2019t and I\u2019m not sure there is anything that will.</p><p>\u2018Livy?\u2019 George\u2019s low husk brings my eyes away from Miller\u2019s disappearing Mercedes to his confused form approaching the house. \u2018Sweetheart, what\u2019s going on?\u2019</p> <p>I give in to my emotions again and fall apart, letting him wrap me in a bear hug and hold my weak body up. \u2018It\u2019s all gone horribly wrong,\u2019 I cry into his cable-knit jumper, letting his squidgy chest mould around my diminutive frame.</p><p>\u2018Oh dearie me,\u2019 he soothes, rubbing calming circles into my back. \u2018Let\u2019s get you inside.\u2019</p><p>George takes a firm hold of my shoulders and guides me up the path, shutting the door gently behind us. Then he steers me to the kitchen, where we find Nan dabbing Gregory\u2019s nose with a damp compress. I can smell the TCP and hear Gregory\u2019s continued hisses, proof that it\u2019s Nan\u2019s treatment of choice. \u2018Hold still,\u2019 she chastises him, annoyance still rife in her tone.</p><p>Gregory eyes me as George pushes me into a chair and hands me his clean hanky, and Nan swings around, clocking the loss of one person and the gain of another. \u2018You\u2019re late!\u2019 she yells at poor, innocent George. \u2018Dinner\u2019s ruined and I\u2019ve had a wrestling match in my front garden!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Now hold on one minute, Josephine Taylor!\u2019 George\u2019s back straightens and mine tenses. She\u2019s in no mood to take any backchat, and George should note this from the annoyance pouring from her short, plump body. It doesn\u2019t deter him, though. \u2018I\u2019ve just arrived and I can see that dinner being ruined is the least of our worries, so why don\u2019t you put a lid on it and let me help sort out these two sorry states.\u2019</p> <p>She dabs the compress over Gregory\u2019s lip on a few stutters of shock. \u2018Where\u2019s Miller?\u2019 she blurts, her fury now directed at me.</p><p>\u2018He left,\u2019 I admit, wiping at my eyes with the hanky and stealing a risky glance at Gregory. His eyes are narrowed and it isn\u2019t because they\u2019re closing up from the swelling. He\u2019s going to have a shiner on one eye for sure, the opposite eye to the one Miller blackened during their last clash.</p><p>My battered friend grumbles something on a sardonic laugh, but I don\u2019t ask him to repeat himself because I know for certain I won\u2019t want to hear whatever he\u2019s said, and neither will Nan or George.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s happened?\u2019 George asks, taking up the seat next to me.</p><p>\u2018Damned if I know.\u2019 Nan covers Gregory\u2019s split lip with a padded plaster and presses around the edges to ensure it\u2019s stuck tight, ignoring the hisses of protest coming from her patient. \u2018All I know is that Gregory and Miller seem to dislike each other, yet no one is willing to enlighten me as to why.\u2019 She turns her expectant eyes towards me, making me drop my gaze to the table, evading her.</p><p>Truth is, Miller and Gregory hated each other before Gregory found out about Miller\u2019s tainted past. Now I can only surmise that they categorically despise each other. There\u2019s nothing that\u2019ll fix this. I can have one man or the other. Guilt rips through me as I watch my oldest friend, my only friend, being taped up \u2013 guilt for being the root cause of his pain and injuries, and guilt because I know that I won\u2019t pick him.</p> <p>I stand and pull every set of eyes in the room to me, each body stilling to gauge my next move.</p><p>Rounding the table calmly, I lean down to kiss Gregory\u2019s cheek. \u2018When you love someone, you love them because of who they are and how they came to be that person,\u2019 I whisper into his ear, and immediately appreciate that Nan\u2019s acute hearing might have caught my declaration. I pray Gregory keeps this information to himself \u2013 not for me or Miller, but for Nan. It\u2019ll stir too many ghosts. \u2018I didn\u2019t give up on him and I\u2019m not about to now.\u2019 I straighten up and walk calmly out of the kitchen, leaving my family behind to go and comfort my someone.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>The masses of sparkling mirrors lining the lobby of Miller\u2019s apartment block bounce my reflection everywhere, the image of me, tear-stained and hopeless, unavoidable. The doorman tips his hat politely, and I force a meagre smile in return, choosing to ride up to Miller\u2019s in the lift rather than take the few hundred stairs that I\u2019ve almost become unaffected by. I keep my eyes forward when the doors meet and I\u2019m confronted with more mirrors, looking through myself and avoiding the ugly sight of the waif-like woman that I\u2019m faced with.</p><p>Once I\u2019ve been in the lift for what seems like for ever, the doors slide open and I force my legs to carry me to the shiny black front door. It takes even more mental encouragement to knock. I would question whether he\u2019s even here . . . if it weren\u2019t for the heavy air surrounding me. Miller\u2019s anger is lingering in the space, closing me in and suffocating me. I can feel it spreading over my skin and settling deep.</p><p>I jump back when the door flies open on a harsh yank and I\u2019m met by Miller, looking no better than he did when he stalked away nearly an hour ago. There\u2019s been no attempt to restore his perfect self, his hair still messy, his shirt and waistcoat still ripped, and his eyes still reflecting rage. A glass of whisky sits in his hand, his fingers coated in Gregory\u2019s blood. White fingertips indicate the unforgiving grip he has of the glass as he brings it to his mouth and tips the rest of the contents down his throat, keeping steely eyes on me. I\u2019m fidgeting, my eyes now darting across the floor at my feet, but they fly up when I catch an almost undetectable shift of his shoes. Or stagger. He\u2019s drunk, and when I look harder, focus on those eyes that never fail to capture my attention, I see something more \u2013 something unfamiliar \u2013 and it catapults my unease to a place beyond anything I\u2019ve ever experienced while in Miller\u2019s presence. I\u2019ve felt vulnerable before, hopeless and helpless, but always on an unsure level. I\u2019ve never felt frightened like this, not even during his psychotic displays of madness. This is a different fear. It\u2019s snaking up my spine and wrapping itself around my neck, making words impossible and breathing challenging. It\u2019s my nightmare. The one where he leaves me.</p><p>\u2018Go home, Livy.\u2019 His tongue is heavy in his mouth, making his words slur slowly, but it\u2019s not his usual, purposeful lazy rasp. The door slams in my face, echoing around me, and I jump back, startled at his maliciousness. I\u2019m pounding the wood with my fist before I can decide if it\u2019s a wise move, fear sailing through me.</p><p>\u2018Open the door, Miller!\u2019 I yell, not relenting with my hammering of the black, shiny wood, ignoring the fast numbing sensation spreading across the side of my balled hand. \u2018Open!\u2019</p> <p>Bang, bang, bang!</p><p>I\u2019m going nowhere. I\u2019ll hammer all night long if I have to. He doesn\u2019t get to shut me out of his apartment or his life.</p><p>Bang, bang, bang!</p><p>\u2018Miller!\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly attempting to hit thin air, and it sends me on a few disorientated staggers forward. I just manage to steady my flailing body before it collides with Miller\u2019s.</p><p>\u2018I said go home.\u2019 He\u2019s restocked on dark liquid, the tumbler near to overflowing.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I raise my chin in a brave act of defiance.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want you to see me like this.\u2019 He steps forward hostilely, an attempt to make me retreat, but I stand firm, unwilling to be frightened off. We\u2019re closer because of my tenacity, nearly chest to chest, and he\u2019s breathing liquor vapours all over my heated cheeks. \u2018I won\u2019t ask again.\u2019</p><p>I inwardly wither on the spot, yet sheer determination is refusing to allow him to see it. \u2018No,\u2019 I fire simply and confidently. He\u2019s trying to repel me. \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019</p><p>In obvious uncertainty, he polishes off the tumbler of dark liquid, a slight wince and gasp spilling from his mouth, accompanied by potent liquor fumes. They make my nose wrinkle in distaste, both at the sight of Miller and the smell of the alcohol.</p><p>\u2018I won\u2019t ask again.\u2019 I push the words through my clenched jaw, playing him at his own game.</p><p>He looks me up and down, musing quietly, mumbling incoherent words under his breath as he does. Then his heavy gaze lazily climbs back up the length of my body, apparently in its usual manner, but drunkenness is the cause this time, not Miller\u2019s customary sultry way. He begins to sway. \u2018I\u2019m f**ked up.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019 I don\u2019t disagree with him. He\u2019s speaking the cold, hard truth.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m dangerous.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But not to you.\u2019</p><p>My heart shows signs of life again. I knew that. Deep down, I knew that. \u2018I know.\u2019</p><p>His head performs something between a nod of satisfaction and an uncontrolled bob upon his wide shoulders. \u2018Good.\u2019 He turns and wobbles through his apartment, leaving me to shut the door and follow behind. I know where he\u2019s headed before he momentarily stops and changes course, going to the drinks cabinet. He\u2019s drunk enough, at least to me. However, Miller has other ideas. He clangs the bottle against the glass and tips more on the cabinet than into his glass. \u2018Bollocks!\u2019 he curses, dropping the empty bottle haphazardly between the masses of other bottles, causing a loud clattering of glass. \u2018Fucking mess!\u2019</p><p>On an exasperated sigh, I wander up behind him and set about rearranging the bottles and wiping down the mess he\u2019s made, hoping that restoring part of his perfect world might inject some peace into him.</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 he murmurs, so quietly I almost don\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re welcome.\u2019 I can feel his stare burning through my profile as I mess with the bottles, taking my time . . . or biding it.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>I fly around quickly towards the sound, Miller a little slower.</p><p>Bang, bang, bang!</p><p>My previously settling heart rate ramps up a few gears, and I look to Miller, who\u2019s staring in the direction of the door, too. But he doesn\u2019t seem in a rush to go and find out what the commotion is, so I make for the entrance hall and circle the table, just as another harsh knock rings out through Miller\u2019s apartment.</p><p>\u2018Wait,\u2019 Miller snaps, grabbing my upper arm and pulling me to a stop. \u2018Stay here.\u2019 He passes me, his usually easy strides challenged by alcohol. I remain still, my mind racing as I watch him glance through the peephole. I can virtually see his hackles rise, and it prompts me to step forward, cautious but too curious to stop myself. He pulls the door open a fraction and makes to step out into the corridor, but his obvious plan to hide our visitor is totally defeated when they push their way into the apartment with ease, no doubt due to Miller\u2019s less-than-stable frame.</p><p>Now my hackles jump up, too, and my jaw instantly tightens when William presents himself to me, his body oozing authority. He regards me closely for a few moments before dragging his grey gaze over to Miller\u2019s wrecked form. This isn\u2019t ideal. Miller looks shocking, and now William is going to want to know why.</p><p>\u2018What have you been up to?\u2019 William asks, flat and even, like it\u2019s no surprise and maybe he already knows.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not your concern,\u2019 Miller slurs, slamming the door. \u2018You\u2019re not welcome here.\u2019</p><p>I feel the need to back Miller up, but that curious part of me has multiplied, as has the caution. So I remain with my lips sealed, soaking up the animosity batting back and forth between these two men. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018And you\u2019re not welcome in Olivia\u2019s life,\u2019 William retorts, turning to me. He must see the disbelief on my face, not that he seems in the least bit perturbed by it. \u2018You\u2019re coming with me.\u2019</p><p>I cough my objection, noting Miller behind William twitching slightly, but not nearly enough for me to be sure that he\u2019ll intervene. Please don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s going to back William up!</p><p>\u2018No, I\u2019m not,\u2019 I reply surely, squaring my shoulders. I\u2019m staggered by Miller\u2019s lack of input thus far, especially after his violent reaction to Gregory\u2019s interference only an hour ago.</p><p>\u2018Olivia,\u2019 William sighs, \u2018you really are trying my patience.\u2019</p> <p>I brace myself for another comment on my mother, worrying about the anger simmering within me just at the thought of William making reference to her. If he comes out and says what I know he\u2019s thinking, then I might be giving Miller a run for his money in the crazy department. \u2018You are trying mine!\u2019</p><p>William disguises his recoil well, and I know it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t want to show a scrap of compassion in front of Miller. No, now he\u2019ll uphold that powerful reputation . . . which means it could get very ugly, very quickly. \u2018I\u2019ve told you, you don\u2019t belong here with him.\u2019</p><p>My breath catches slightly, remembering William saying a version of those words to me when I was seventeen. I was sitting in his office, drunk. I didn\u2019t belong with William. I don\u2019t belong with Miller. \u2018Where do I belong?\u2019 I ask, making William eye me cautiously. \u2018It seems you don\u2019t think I belong anywhere. So tell me, where the f**king hell do I belong?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oliv\u2014\u2019 Miller pipes up, stepping forward, but I cut him straight off, not liking the potential of him agreeing with William.</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I yell. \u2018Everyone thinks they know what\u2019s best for me. What about me? What about what I know?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Calm down.\u2019 Miller\u2019s by my side, unsteady, trying to soothe me by taking my nape and kneading gently. It won\u2019t work. Not now.</p><p>\u2018I know I\u2019m supposed to be here!\u2019 I yell, making myself shake with my building frustration. \u2018I\u2019ve been stumbling through my life since you sent me away.\u2019 I point an accusing finger in William\u2019s direction. It makes him withdraw slightly. \u2018Now I have him.\u2019 I throw my arm around Miller\u2019s waist and plant myself to his side. \u2018The only way you\u2019ll stop me from being with him is if you put me six feet under!\u2019</p><p>William\u2019s speechless, Miller is stiff beside me, and I\u2019m convulsing with anger, searching deep for the focus I need to take some steadying breaths and calm down. I gulp back air. I feel like I\u2019m having a panic attack.</p><p>\u2018Shhh.\u2019 Miller pulls me in closer and drops a kiss on the top of my head. It\u2019s not a full-on thing, but it\u2019s working to a degree. I turn into him and hide, and his lips meet the top of my head, pecking and humming as I clench my eyes shut.</p><p>It\u2019s a long, long time before someone speaks. \u2018How do you feel about her?\u2019 William asks, reluctance and caution rife in his tone.</p><p>I stay where I am, dreading what Miller might say. Fascination just won\u2019t cut it. I can feel his heart pounding, can almost hear it, too.</p> <p>\u2018She\u2019s the blood in my veins.\u2019 He speaks clearly and softly. \u2018She\u2019s the air in my lungs.\u2019 There\u2019s a slight pause, and I\u2019m sure I hear William inhale a shocked breath. \u2018She\u2019s the bright, hopeful light in my tortured darkness. I\u2019m warning you, Anderson. Don\u2019t try to take her away from me.\u2019</p><p>I blink back my tears and burrow deeper into his chest, grateful he\u2019s backed me up. That silence falls again. It\u2019s eerily quiet, and then I hear breath being drawn and I know whose it is. \u2018I couldn\u2019t care less what happens to you,\u2019 William says. \u2018But the second I get a whiff that Olivia is in danger, I\u2019ll be coming for you, Hart.\u2019</p><p>And with that, the door slams shut and we\u2019re alone. Miller\u2019s hold loosens on me, the vibrations of his body receding, and he releases me when I really want him to hold me tighter. He paces on unsteady legs to his drinks cabinet and clumsily restocks on whisky, knocking it back fast and gasping. I remain still and silent, then after what seems like centuries, he sighs. \u2018Why are you still in my life, sweet girl?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because you fought to keep me in it,\u2019 I remind him without hesitation, forcing myself to sound sure. \u2018You\u2019ve threatened to rip the spine out of anyone who tries to take me away from you. Are you regretting that?\u2019</p><p>I steel myself for an unwanted reply as he faces me, but his gaze is dropped. \u2018I regret dragging you into my world.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t,\u2019 I snap, not liking his loss of fortitude now that William has gone. \u2018I came willingly and I\u2019m staying willingly.\u2019 I choose to ignore the referral to my world. I\u2019m getting sick of hearing the words my world, yet hardly anything about it.</p><p>More whisky is tipped down his neck. \u2018I meant it.\u2019 He makes an attempt to focus on my eyes but gives up, turning and wandering off across the lounge instead.</p><p>\u2018Meant what?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018My threat.\u2019 His arse meets the low coffee table and he places his glass accurately to the side, despite his drunkenness. He even swivels it before releasing it, now happy with its placing. His curl is present and clearly tickling his forehead because he flicks it away and then drops his face into his palms, elbows braced on his knees. \u2018My temper has always been a burden, Olivia, but I frighten myself when it comes to my overprotectiveness with you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Possessiveness.\u2019</p><p>His head lifts and a frown wriggles its way onto his forehead. \u2018Pardon?\u2019</p><p>A diminutive smile pulls at the corners of my mouth at his show of manners when he\u2019s so intoxicated and we\u2019re in such a wretched place. I walk across to him and kneel between his feet, and he looks down at me, watching as I remove his elbows from his knees and hold his hands in mine. \u2018Possessiveness,\u2019 I repeat.</p><p>\u2018I want to protect you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018From what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Interferers.\u2019 He drifts into thought, his eyes looking past me for a few moments before returning to me. \u2018I\u2019ll wind up killing someone.\u2019 His admission should shock me, yet his acknowledgment of his unreasonable flaw strangely settles me. I\u2019m about to suggest counselling, anger management, anything to get this under control, but something stops me.</p><p>\u2018William is interfering,\u2019 I blurt.</p><p>\u2018William and I have an understanding.\u2019 Miller stumbles over his words. \u2018Although you were never in the equation before. He\u2019s walking a thin line.\u2019 The abhorrence in his drunken tone is palpable.</p><p>\u2018What understanding?\u2019 I don\u2019t like the sound of this. They both have terrible tempers. My guess is that both men know what damage they can do to each other.</p><p>He shakes his head on a frustrated curse. \u2018He wants to protect you, as do I. You\u2019re probably the safest woman in London.\u2019</p><p>My eyes widen at the inaccuracy of his comment and my hands drop his. I disagree. I feel like the most exposed woman in London. But I don\u2019t tell him so. I fight off my urge to continue the William\u2013Miller debate. William hates Miller, and the feeling is totally mutual. I know why, so I should just get used to it. \u2018Do you want the good news or the bad news?\u2019 I ask as I stand and offer my hand. My unease subsides slightly when I catch a brief twinkle in Miller\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s familiar and needed.</p><p>\u2018Bad.\u2019 He rests his hand in mine and studies our joining as I secure my grip and give a little tug, encouraging him to stand, which he does with too much effort.</p><p>\u2018The bad news is you\u2019re going to have a bitch of a hangover.\u2019 I mirror his tiny smile and start leading him to his bedroom. \u2018The good news is I\u2019ll be here to nurse you when you\u2019re feeling sorry for yourself.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll let me worship you. That\u2019ll make me feel better.\u2019</p><p>I raise doubtful eyebrows over my shoulder as we enter his bedroom. \u2018Will you be in any fit state?\u2019</p><p>He drops his arse to the bed when I give him a little shove in the shoulder. \u2018Don\u2019t question my ability to satisfy you, sweet girl.\u2019 His palms slide around to my bum and apply pressure, pulling me between his spread thighs. He\u2019s looking up at me with a carnal stare that\u2019s leading to one thing.</p><p>I shake my head. \u2018I\u2019m not sleeping with you when you\u2019re drunk.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ,\u2019 he counters, his hands working their way to my front and sliding under my top. His eyes are challenging me to stop him, and although I have just been flung into desire overload, I\u2019m not budging. It takes every molecule of strength that I possess, but I locate it fast before I\u2019m tossed into surrender mode. I don\u2019t want to be worshipped by a drunken Miller. I remove his hands on another shake of my head.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t deny me,\u2019 he breathes, pulling me forward onto his lap and arranging my legs across him. I have no choice but to curl an arm around his shoulder, bringing me closer to his face. The alcohol fumes only increase my willpower.</p><p>\u2018Stop it,\u2019 I warn, not prepared to fall victim to his tactics. \u2018You\u2019re in no fit state and if I kiss you, then I\u2019ll probably end up as drunk as you are.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m fine and perfectly capable.\u2019 His h*ps push into my bottom. \u2018I need destressing.\u2019</p><p>He has a nerve! I\u2019m the one who needs destressing, but if I\u2019m honest with myself, then Miller taking me under the influence of alcohol makes me nervous. I know he fights to maintain control during our encounters and a belly full of whisky won\u2019t aid him.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 he asks, regarding me with suspicion, obviously perceiving my wandering thoughts. \u2018Tell me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s nothing.\u2019 I brush off his concern and attempt to remove my body from his lap. And get nowhere.</p><p>\u2018Olivia?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Let me give you your thing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, tell me what\u2019s troubling that beautiful mind of yours.\u2019 He\u2019s insistent, firming up his hold of me. \u2018I won\u2019t ask again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re drunk,\u2019 I blurt quietly, ashamed for doubting the care he takes with me. \u2018Alcohol makes people lose reason and control.\u2019 Now I\u2019m cringing. Miller doesn\u2019t need whisky to lose control and both scrapes with Gregory are evidence of that. And the hotel encounter . . .</p><p>I remain on his lap and let him process my worries while I twist my ring nervously around and around, wishing I could retract my words. He\u2019s rigid beneath me, every hard plane of his body seeming to bruise my flesh. Then he takes hold of my face, squeezing my cheeks gently, and brings it to confront him. He looks remorseful, which increases my guilt and my shame. \u2018My self-hatred claws at my dark soul daily.\u2019 He seems to have rapidly gathered something close to soberness, maybe my omission feeding it. His blue eyes seem stronger and his mouth is now forming clear, exact words. \u2018Never fear me, I beg you. I could be of no harm to you, Olivia.\u2019 His sombre statement takes the edge off my despondency, but only a little. Miller fails to comprehend the destruction he can cause by hurting me emotionally. That\u2019s what I fear the most. Losing him. I can recover from physical injuries in time, if unintentionally caught up in one of his psychotic outbursts, but no amount of time will fix the mental injuries he can inflict upon me. And that terrifies me.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s like you take leave of your senses,\u2019 I begin cautiously, choosing my words wisely.</p><p>\u2018I do,\u2019 he mutters, before nodding for me to continue.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not frightened for me; I\u2019m scared for your victim and you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018My victim?\u2019 He coughs. He\u2019s not happy with my choice of word. \u2018Livy, I don\u2019t prey on innocent people. And please don\u2019t worry about me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do worry about you, Miller. You\u2019ll be thrown into jail if someone presses charges and I don\u2019t like seeing you hurt.\u2019 I reach up and brush over a faint blemish on his bristly cheek. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018That won\u2019t happen,\u2019 he sighs, pulling me into his chest and attempting to rub some comfort into me. Weirdly, it works, and I melt into his relaxed body, matching his tired sigh. He sounds confident. Too confident. \u2018Gorgeous girl, I\u2019ve said it once before and on this occasion I have no problem repeating myself.\u2019 He falls to his back, taking me with him, and tussles with me until I\u2019m cuddled into his side and he has access to my face. Feathery kisses trail from one cheek to the other and back again. \u2018The only thing in this world that can cause me pain is currently being held in my arms.\u2019 He lifts my chin so my lips are level with his and the lingering stench of whisky invades my nose. I find it easy to disregard. He\u2019s gazing at me like I\u2019m the only thing that exists in his world, those eyes easing my remaining anxiety from this long day. His lips move in and I brace myself, my hand slipping onto his chest to feel him. \u2018May I?\u2019 he whispers, pausing mere millimetres from my mouth.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re asking?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m aware that I smell like a distillery,\u2019 he murmurs, making me smile. \u2018And I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t taste much better.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ.\u2019 All of my reluctance to let him have me in these circumstances diminishes under his tenderness, and I close the small gap between us, our mouths clashing more forcefully than I intended. I don\u2019t care. Disinclination has been hijacked by an urgent need to reinstate my serenity and Miller\u2019s recently relaxing disposition. I can taste the whisky, but Miller\u2019s essence dominates the alcohol, drowning my senses with pure yearning. It\u2019s making me light-headed. The only instructions I can find in my suddenly lust-filled mind are ones telling me to let him worship me. That that will chase away my woes. That will make the world right again. That will calm him. Our passion collides and everything else is of no importance. It\u2019s perfect in these moments, but hard to hold on to when faced with endless resistance.</p> <p>Miller rolls to his back, keeping our mouths fused, and locks one palm on my nape and his other under my bottom, ensuring I\u2019m secure in his clutch. \u2018Savoured,\u2019 he mumbles against my lips, that one familiar word making me see past my consuming desperation for him and follow his demand to slow things down. My fear was unwarranted. I\u2019m the one being told to rein it in, Miller appearing to have full control and lucidity, despite the obscene amount of whisky that must have passed his lips. \u2018Better,\u2019 he praises, moulding at my neck. \u2018So much better.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hmmm.\u2019 I\u2019m not prepared to release him to speak my agreement, choosing to hum it instead. I feel his lips spread into a smile through our kiss and that does make me pull away, and pull away fast. Catching a glimpse of one of Miller\u2019s rare smiles will send me delirious with happiness. I\u2019m sitting up fast, wiping my hair from my eyes, and when my view is clear, I see it. It\u2019s something else, a no-holds-barred, megawatt smile that sends me giddy. He\u2019s always devastating, even when he looks downright miserable, but right now he\u2019s surpassed perfect. He\u2019s ruffled, tatty and messy, but utterly beautiful, and when I should be returning his smile, matching his ease and cherishing the rare sight, I start crying instead. All of the crap that today has dealt me seems to come collectively together and pour from my eyes in silent, uncontrollable sobs. I feel silly, overwrought and weak, and in an attempt to hide it, I bury my face in my palms and blindly remove my body from his.</p><p>The only sound in the peaceful air encompassing us is my shallow sobs as Miller silently shifts, seeming to take for ever to find my shuddering body \u2013 probably because his usually stealthy movements are hampered by too much alcohol. But he eventually makes it to me and embraces me, sighing heavily into my neck and delicately rubbing calming circles into my back. \u2018Don\u2019t cry,\u2019 he whispers, his voice like sandpaper, rough and low. \u2018We\u2019ll survive. Please don\u2019t cry.\u2019 His tenderness and barely spoken understanding only escalates my emotions, making clinging to him tightly my only purpose.</p><p>\u2018Why can\u2019t people leave us alone?\u2019 I ask, my words disjointed.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 he admits. \u2018Come here.\u2019 He collects my hands from the back of his neck and holds them between us, fiddling with my ring unconsciously as he watches me fight my tears away. \u2018I wish I could be perfect for you.\u2019</p> <p>His admission cripples me. \u2018You are perfect,\u2019 I argue, however wrong I know I am deep down. There\u2019s nothing perfect about Miller Hart, except for his visual appeal and incessant obsession to have everything surrounding him precise. \u2018You\u2019re perfect to me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I appreciate your unrelenting belief, especially since I\u2019m drunk right now and have shamed myself in front of your grandmother.\u2019 He shakes his head on a frustrated exhale and reaches for his head, holding it for a few moments as if the consequences of his actions have just registered, or maybe a hangover has.</p><p>\u2018She was pissy,\u2019 I tell him, seeing no reason to try and make him feel better. He\u2019ll need to face her wrath eventually.</p><p>\u2018I gathered that when she manhandled me up the garden path.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You deserved it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I concur,\u2019 he accepts willingly. \u2018I\u2019ll call her. No, I\u2019ll visit.\u2019 His lips straighten and he appears to think hard about something before refocusing his attention on me. \u2018Do you think I can win her over by offering a bite of my buns?\u2019</p> <p>My lips press together as he raises his eyebrows, looking for a serious answer. Then he loses the battle to maintain his serious face, his twitching lip lifting a smidgen. \u2018Ha!\u2019 I laugh, shocked by his comedy streak, all sadness sucked up by humour. I lose control. My head falls back and I fall apart, shoulders jumping, stomach aching, and tears now springing from amusement, which is so much more appealing than the despair of a few moments ago.</p><p>\u2018Much better,\u2019 I hear Miller conclude, gathering me into his arms and striding across his room to the bathroom. I\u2019m not sure if the staggers and sways are a result of his drunkenness or my persistent jerks in his arms. He places me with accuracy onto the vanity unit and leaves me to collect my hysteria while he unbuttons his waistcoat, regarding me with a dash of humour on his heart-stopping face.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 I chuckle, concentrating on breathing deeply to dampen down the shakes.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be. Nothing gives me greater pleasure than seeing you so happy.\u2019 He shrugs out of his waistcoat and I\u2019m stupidly delighted when I see him fold it neatly before slipping it deftly into the washing basket. \u2018Well, something else does, but your happiness comes a close second.\u2019 He starts on his shirt, the first button revealing a sliver of taut, tempting flesh.</p><p>I stop laughing immediately. \u2018You should laugh more. It\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Makes me less intimidating,\u2019 he finishes for me. \u2018Yes, you\u2019ve told me. But I think I\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Express yourself just fine.\u2019 I reach forward and assist his fumbling fingers with the tiny buttons, then help him slide the white cotton from his shoulders. \u2018Perfect,\u2019 I sigh, sitting back to relish my stunning view, watching with lusty eyes as every muscle of his super-perfect torso undulates while he folds his shirt. He places it skilfully in the washing basket and he\u2019s back before me, arms draped limply at his sides, chin dropped, eyes heavy. I soak up his concentrated stare and lift my hands to catch a feel of the harsh stubble that\u2019s darkening his face. I\u2019m allowed to take my time feeling him, my fingers tracing the planes of his jaw, drifting up to the corners of his eyes, and tenderly smoothing over his lids when they close for me. I cherish every part of him with my eyes and touch until I\u2019m working my fingertips down his arms and onto his hands. \u2018Let me fix this,\u2019 I say, turning over his hand, revealing knuckles reddened with blood and a little blemishing.</p><p>His eyes open and fall to my fingers threading through his, and his hand flexes in my hold, but he doesn\u2019t wince or hiss with pain. \u2018In the shower.\u2019 He shakes me away and takes the hem of my top, working it up my body, forcing me to lift my arms so he can rid me of the material. Then my bra is slowly removed, exposing my modest br**sts that feel swollen and heavy under his appreciative, if a little drunken, gaze. My ni**les harden to pebbles, tingling sweetly as the pad of his thumb brushes gently over each in turn. \u2018Perfect,\u2019 he says, leaning in and planting a chaste kiss on my parted lips. \u2018Jump down.\u2019</p> <p>I follow through on his soft order and slide from the counter to my feet, kicking my Converse off and taking the initiative to begin on his trousers while he, too, removes his shoes. There\u2019s no rush, each of us happy to take our time undressing the other until we\u2019re both naked. I watch him collect a foil packet from the cupboard, his fingers fiddling clumsily as he slides the condom out, so I step forward and take it from him. I feel comfortable as I sheathe him, feeling his blues burning into my face, and once I\u2019m done, he\u2019s swiftly lifting me to his body with ease. My limbs respond on impulse and coil around him. We\u2019re nothing but skin on skin, heart on heart, need on need. He keeps us to the side of the shower spray while it warms up, and once he\u2019s happy that it\u2019s at a comfortable temperature, he takes us under and stands silently holding me while water rains down and washes away the dirt, the tension, the doubt, the pain.</p><p>\u2018Are you comfortable?\u2019 he asks.</p><p>\u2018Perfect.\u2019 It\u2019s the only word I can think to use. I smile into his shoulder and pull back, getting his perfect face, all wet and dazzling, into my sight. \u2018Can I stay with you tonight?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 I show my appreciation by nibbling at his rough chin.</p><p>\u2018It wasn\u2019t really up for discussion,\u2019 he informs me, taking me to the wall and encouraging me to rest my back against it. \u2018Too cold?\u2019</p><p>I suck in a shocked breath as the coolness of the mosaic tiles spreads across my back. \u2018A little.\u2019 He goes to peel me away but I stiffen, stopping him. \u2018No, I\u2019m used to it now.\u2019</p><p>He eyes me doubtfully but doesn\u2019t challenge my little white lie. \u2018You\u2019re all slippery and wet,\u2019 he muses, widening his stance and moving his palms to the rear of my thighs. His intentions are clear and longed for, and my hitching breath tells him so. \u2018I want to slide myself into your core and bathe in the fulfilment that you reward me with.\u2019</p><p>I wheeze shallow breaths of anticipation. \u2018Fulfilment by worshipping.\u2019</p><p>\u2018By acceptance,\u2019 he corrects me, rearing back and taking a hold of his arousal. \u2018You give me the greatest pleasure by accepting me in my entirety, not just by accepting me into this beautiful body.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m at serious risk of breaking down on him again, his reverent words immobilising me. \u2018There\u2019s nothing more natural to me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018My gorgeous, sweet girl.\u2019 He takes my lips as he slips past my swelling folds, pushing deep and high on a strangled groan.</p><p>The instant sensation of his thickness submerged to capacity within me pulls my back straight and I whimper, trying to meet the steady rhythm of his tongue as it seduces my mouth while he holds himself inside me, unmoving, twitching, and groaning.</p><p>\u2018Am I hurting you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I\u2019m adamant, regardless of the fact that there\u2019s mild discomfort.</p><p>\u2018Still scope for breaking in?\u2019</p><p>It will determine whether I f**k you hard immediately, or break you in first.</p><p>\u2018Always.\u2019 I smile and pull away, resting the back of my head against the wall to lose myself in Miller and his wondrous eyes, rather than savour the attention of his addictive mouth.</p><p>On a subtle nod, he withdraws slowly, making my eyes flutter and my stomach furl, too many gratifying elements attacking me at once \u2013 the feel of him, his worshipping, the sight of him, his smell, his attentiveness, and my favourite wayward curl \u2013 all giving me glorious, inexorable pleasure. I brace myself for his advance and when it happens, exact and expertly, a shallow cry of gratification gushes past my lips. I pant, refusing to shut my eyes and miss a moment of his face contorting with heady craving. It sharpens his features. I could pass out just at the sight of him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018How does that feel?\u2019 He chokes the words out and retreats again, slipping out almost all the way before tilting his h*ps up, sending him plunging on a shaky exhale of breath.</p><p>\u2018Good.\u2019 I grasp his shoulders and clench my teeth, soaking up each delicious drive. He\u2019s into his stride now, pumping his h*ps continuously, each thrust as controlled and measured as the last.</p><p>\u2018Just good?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Amazing!\u2019 I yelp, catching a dash of friction on my clitoris that sends me wild. \u2018Shit!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018That\u2019s more like it,\u2019 he muses to himself, repeating the move that had me cursing a second before.</p><p>\u2018Oh God! Oh shit! Miller!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Again?\u2019 he teases, not waiting for the answer he knows I\u2019m going to give, delivering hastily instead.</p><p>I\u2019m out of my mind. His rigorous flow is crippling me, but he\u2019s as controlled as ever, watching me fall apart against him. \u2018I need to come,\u2019 I breathe, feeling desperation setting in. I need to release all of the day\u2019s stress and trauma on a satisfied moan, maybe even a scream, as I cl**ax.</p><p>I bear down onto him when his momentum remains slow and defined, bunching his sodden hair in my fingers. The onslaught of pressure is becoming too much to handle and Miller\u2019s expanding and throbbing length buried deep is a massive relief. He\u2019s close, too.</p> <p>\u2018It feels too good, Olivia.\u2019 His eyes clench shut and his h*ps judder forward, pushing me a little closer. I\u2019m teetering on the edge, half my body dangling, waiting for the rest to follow and send me into an abyss of exploding stars.</p><p>\u2018Please,\u2019 I plead, as always never opposed to begging during these moments. \u2018Please, please, please!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Bollocks!\u2019 His curse signals his surrender and he pulls back, takes a long, disciplined breath, then fixes me in place with darkening eyes as he surges forward on a harsh shout. \u2018Jesus, Olivia!\u2019</p><p>My eyes close as my orgasm takes hold, my head going lax but my body rigid as it strives to cope with the flashes of pressure stabbing harshly at the very tip of my sex. I\u2019m pinned against the tiles, our bodies compressed together, vibrating and slipping, and fitful breathing sings around my fuzzy mind. He\u2019s stealing nibbles and sucks of my throat as I pant up to the ceiling, and my arms refuse to play ball any longer, dropping to my sides, my palms slapping against the wall. The only thing holding me in place is Miller\u2019s body. My world has clicked back into place and is turning steadily on its axis, and an intoxicating cocktail of sweat, sex and alcohol is rife, reminding me that he\u2019s still drunk.</p><p>\u2018You okay?\u2019 I wheeze, letting my head drop to bury my nose in his sopping hair. That\u2019s the only action I can muster, leaving my arms hanging lifelessly by my sides.</p><p>He shifts and straightens a little, the movement causing his softening length to stroke my inner wall deliciously. \u2018How could I not be?\u2019 Pulling his face from my neck, he takes both of my hands and brings them to his lips, pressing them firmly against my knuckles and keeping me pinned to the wall by his body. \u2018How could I be anything but blissful when I have you safe in my arms?\u2019</p> <p>My sated smile of contentment doesn\u2019t encourage one from Miller. He\u2019s content, too, but I don\u2019t need to hear it. I can see it. \u2018I love your drunken bones, Miller Hart.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And my drunken bones are deeply fascinated by you, Olivia Taylor.\u2019 He indulges in my mouth for a few blissful moments before gently easing me away from the wall. \u2018I didn\u2019t hurt you, did I?\u2019 His lovely face is etched with genuine concern as his wobbly gaze travels all over my wet face.</p><p>I\u2019m quick to reassure him. \u2018You were the perfect gentleman.\u2019</p><p>His grin is immediate.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I was just thinking how lovely you look in my shower.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You think I look lovely everywhere.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Best of all in my bed. Can you stand?\u2019</p> <p>I nod and let my legs slide down his body, but my mind starts venturing off in another direction. My hands meet his pecs and I drift down his body while keeping my eyes on him as he watches me. I want to taste him, but my tempting tactics are halted when the tops of my arms are seized and I\u2019m tugged back up to his lips. \u2018I get to taste you,\u2019 he mumbles quietly, ravishing me with his lips. My wayward thoughts scatter all over the shower. \u2018And you taste out of this world.\u2019 He takes my neck once the wall isn\u2019t supporting us any longer, almost certainly using me for assistance. Then I\u2019m gently guided to the shower\u2019s exit as he slides the condom off. \u2018I need to wash my hair.\u2019</p><p>He pushes onward, unconcerned by my concern. \u2018We\u2019ll do it in the morning.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But it\u2019ll look like I\u2019ve shoved my finger in a plug socket.\u2019 It\u2019s wild enough with the backing of a good conditioner . . . which reminds me. \u2018You have very untamed hair, too.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So we\u2019ll be untamed together.\u2019 He disposes of the condom and collects a towel, then slowly drags it all over me before taking care of himself.</p><p>\u2018How\u2019s your head?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m gently pushed on, into the bedroom. \u2018Fine and dandy,\u2019 he mutters, and I laugh, earning a frown as we reach the bed. \u2018Please share what\u2019s got you all giggly.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You!\u2019 What else?</p><p>\u2018What about me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You saying you\u2019re fine and dandy when you\u2019re clearly not. Headache?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Early signs, yes,\u2019 he concedes on a huff, releasing his clasp of me to clutch his head instead.</p><p>I smile and set about removing all of the fancy cushions from his bed and placing them neatly in the designated storage compartment. Then I pull the covers back. \u2018Hop in.\u2019 I drag my greedy gaze from his eyes, all the way down the perfection of his lean physique to his perfect feet. They start to pace the carpet towards me, prompting my eyes to climb back up the length of him, reaching those blues as he reaches me. \u2018Please,\u2019 I whisper.</p><p>\u2018Please what?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019ve forgotten what I\u2019m asking of him. I search my empty head under the observation of knowing, salacious blue eyes and find nothing. \u2018I can\u2019t remember,\u2019 I admit.</p><p>Bright white teeth blind me. \u2018I believe my sweet girl was bossing me into bed.\u2019</p><p>My lips purse. \u2018I wasn\u2019t bossing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ,\u2019 he chuckles. \u2018I quite like it. After you.\u2019 His arm sweeps in direction of the bed, his gentlemanly manners taking over.</p><p>\u2018I should call Nan.\u2019</p><p>His smile drops in an instant. I hate that I can draw those rare beams but just as quickly wipe them away. The result is as if they were never there and they might not ever return. He\u2019s thoughtful for a long moment, struggling to keep his eyes on me. He\u2019s ashamed. \u2018Would you be kind enough to enquire if she might be home tomorrow morning?\u2019</p><p>I nod my answer. \u2018Get in. I\u2019ll be back as soon as I\u2019ve pacified her.\u2019</p><p>He slips into the sheets and onto his side, his back to me. I shouldn\u2019t feel compassion, but his remorse is strong and so is my hope that Nan will accept what I know will be a sincere apology.</p><p>Finding my top, I wriggle it on and go in search of my bag, getting out my phone and seeing endless missed calls from her already. My guilt surges and I don\u2019t delay calling her right back.</p><p>\u2018Olivia! Damn you, child!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nan,\u2019 I breathe, letting my na**d bottom hit the chair. My eyes close as I prepare for the rant that I know is coming.</p><p>\u2018Are you okay?\u2019 she asks softly.</p><p>I snap my eyes wide open in shock. \u2018Yeah.\u2019 The word rolls off my tongue slowly, uncertainty plaguing me. There has to be more than that.</p><p>\u2018Is Miller okay?\u2019</p><p>This question stuns me further, my na**d bum starting to shift nervously on the chair. \u2018He\u2019s okay.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Me too.\u2019 It\u2019s all I can think to say. No rant? No prying questions? No demand to walk away? I hear her breathe thoughtfully down the line, a lingering, empty space of unspoken words stretching between us.</p><p>\u2018Olivia?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m here.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sweetheart, those words you whispered to Gregory.\u2019</p><p>I swallow hard. I knew she\u2019d heard but hoped she hadn\u2019t. There\u2019s nothing aged about my grandmother\u2019s acute hearing. Humming my acknowledgement, I sit back in my chair and lay my palm across my forehead, ready to ease the pounding head that\u2019s about to ensue. It\u2019s already working up to a light thudding, just at the thought of explaining those words. \u2018What about them?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re right.\u2019</p><p>My hand drops and I gaze ahead at nothing in particular, confusion replacing the threatening headache. \u2018I\u2019m right?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 she sighs. \u2018I\u2019ve told you before, we don\u2019t choose who we fall in love with. Falling in love is special. Holding on to that love, despite circumstances that could destroy it, is even more special. I hope Miller realises how lucky he is to have you, my darling girl.\u2019</p><p>My bottom lip begins to tremble, my throat closing off any words that I\u2019d like to say in return \u2013 the most important words being thank you. Thank you for supporting me \u2013 for supporting us, when it feels like the whole of London is on a mission to sabotage what we have. Thank you for accepting Miller. Thank you for understanding, even if you don\u2019t know the full truth. Gregory knows what this could do to her. \u2018I love you, Nan.\u2019 I swallow hard around my words and the puddles of tears in my eyes start to tumble down my cheeks.</p><p>\u2018I love you, too, darling.\u2019 Her voice is even and strong, yet soaked in emotion. \u2018Are you staying with Miller tonight?\u2019</p><p>I nod and sniff, just spitting out a \u2018yes\u2019 in response.</p><p>\u2018Okay. Sleep tight.\u2019</p><p>I smile through my tears and use the sound of her loving tone and her words to gather myself and speak. \u2018I won\u2019t let the bedbugs bite.\u2019</p><p>She chuckles, joining me in my fond memories of one of Granddad\u2019s favourite bedtime lines. \u2018Get yourself off up those apples and pears,\u2019 she says, reminding me of another.</p><p>\u2018Miller lives in an apartment. There are no stairs to the bedroom.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, okay.\u2019 She falls silent for a while. \u2018Are you cream crackered?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Exhausted,\u2019 I confirm on a laugh. \u2018I\u2019m going to bed now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good. Nighty-night.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Night, Nan.\u2019 I smile as I cut the call and immediately consider calling back to ask how Gregory is, but stop myself. The ball\u2019s in his court. He knows the deal; he knows I\u2019m going nowhere, and he knows that nothing he can say will change that, especially not now. There\u2019s nothing more I can say and there\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll listen. It kills me, but I\u2019m not putting myself in the firing line again. If he wants to talk, then he\u2019ll call. Satisfied with my decision, I make to leave the kitchen but pause at the doorway, my mind wandering to silly places.</p><p>Like the top drawer where I know Miller\u2019s date book to be.</p><p>I try to disregard my bout of irritating curiosity, I really do, but my damn feet take on a mind of their own and I\u2019m standing looking at the drawer before I can convince myself that it\u2019s so very wrong to snoop. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust him, I wholeheartedly do, but I just feel in the dark, unaware and ignorant, and while that\u2019s undoubtedly a good thing, I can\u2019t help the raging inquisitiveness from getting the better of me.</p><p>Curiosity killed the cat. Curiosity killed the cat. Damn curiosity killed the f**king cat.</p><p>I open the drawer, and it\u2019s looking up at me, teasing me . . . tempting me. It\u2019s like a magnet to my hand, drawing me in, pulling me closer, and before I know what\u2019s happened, the leather book is lying in my palms, feeling like a forbidden spell book. Now I just need the pages to miraculously start flapping open, but after staring at it for way too long, it\u2019s still closed. And it should probably stay that way \u2013 sealed for ever, never to be looked upon again. History closed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But that would be in a world where curiosity doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>I shift the book in my palms and slowly pull the front cover open, but my eyes don\u2019t home in on the first page. They drift down to the floor, following a square of paper that\u2019s slipped from the inside cover, until it comes to rest by my na**d feet. Closing the book on a frown, I scoot down and collect the wayward piece and immediately note the paper to be thick and glossy. Photograph paper. The chill that sneaks up my backbone confounds me. I can\u2019t see the photo, it\u2019s still face-down in my hand, but the presence of it unsettles me. I glance to the doorway, trying to think, and then return my curious eyes to the mystery picture. He has said there\u2019s just him. No one else, no matter how many ways I ask the question. Just Miller \u2013 no family, nothing \u2013 and while I was shocked and curious, I never pressed too hard on the matter. There were too many other Miller revelations that came about to be dealt with.</p><p>Drawing a deep breath, I slowly turn it over, knowing that a piece of Miller\u2019s history is about to be revealed. I\u2019m chewing my lip nervously, my eyes closed to slits in preparation for what I might be confronted with, and when the full picture comes into view . . . I relax. My shoulders loosen and my head cocks to the side as I study the image, placing Miller\u2019s organiser back in the drawer without looking.</p><p>Boys.</p> <p>Lots of little boys \u2013 laughing, some with cowboy hats on and some with Indian feathers protruding from their happy heads. I count fourteen in total and guess an age range of five to fifteen. They\u2019re in the overgrown garden of an old Victorian terraced house \u2013 a tatty-looking house, with what look like rags hanging at the windows. A quick assessment of the boys\u2019 clothing tells me this picture was taken in the late eighties, maybe early nineties, and I smile fondly as my eyes travel across the photograph, feeling the elation of the boys\u2019 happiness, mentally hearing them shout their delight as they chase each other with bows and arrows and pistols. But my smile is short-lived, dropping away the moment my gaze creeps onto a lone little boy standing to the side, looking on at the shenanigans of the other boys.</p><p>\u2018Miller,\u2019 I whisper, my fingertip meeting the picture, stroking across the image like I could rub some life into his little body. It\u2019s him; I have no doubt whatsoever. There are too many of the traits I\u2019ve come to know and love \u2013 his wavy hair, looking wilder than ever, his wayward curl present and correct, his impassive, emotionless face and his piercing blue eyes. They look haunted . . . dead. Yet this child is inconceivably beautiful. I can\u2019t pull my eyes off him, can\u2019t even blink. He must be around seven or eight. His jeans are ripped, his T-shirt far too small, and his trainers are wrecked. He looks neglected, and that thought, plus this image of him looking despondent and lost, cripples me with unrelenting sadness. I don\u2019t realise that I\u2019m sobbing, not until a tear splashes onto the glossy surface of the photograph, blurring the painful sight of Miller as a boy. I want to leave it that way, blurry and masked. I want to pretend that I never saw it.</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>My heart is breaking for the lost boy. If I could, I\u2019d reach into this picture and cuddle the child \u2013 hold him, comfort him. But I can\u2019t. I look towards the kitchen doorway in a haze of sorrow and suddenly wonder why I\u2019m still standing here when I can cuddle, hold and comfort the man who that child has become. I rush to wipe my tears away, from the picture and my face, then slip the photo back into Miller\u2019s organiser and shut the drawer. Shut it away. For ever. Then I virtually sprint back to his bedroom, at the same time pulling my top off, and slip between the sheets behind him, snuggling as close as I can get and breathing him into me. My comfort is restored quickly.</p><p>\u2018Where have you been?\u2019 He takes my hand from his stomach and pulls it to his mouth, kissing it sweetly.</p> <p>\u2018Nan.\u2019 I give one word, knowing my simple reply will halt further questions. But it doesn\u2019t halt him from turning over to find my eyes.</p><p>\u2018Is she okay?\u2019 He\u2019s timid. It magnifies the pain in my chest and swells the lump in my throat. I don\u2019t want him to see my sadness, so I hum my answer, hoping the restricted light is hindering his vision of me. \u2018Then why are you sad?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m okay.\u2019 I try for a reassuring tone but manage only an unconvincing whisper. I won\u2019t ask him about the picture because I already know that anything he tells me will be agonising.</p><p>His face is dubious, but he doesn\u2019t pressure me. He uses the last of his drunken energy to pull me into his chest and envelop me completely in his strong arms. I\u2019m home. \u2018I have a request,\u2019 he murmurs into my hair, squeezing me further into him.</p><p>\u2018Anything.\u2019</p><p>We\u2019re briefly bathed in a peaceful silence while he sprinkles kisses in my hair before he softly whispers his wish. \u2018Never stop loving me, Olivia Taylor.\u2019</p> <p>His plea requires no thought. \u2018Never.\u2019</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Morning greets me a split second later, or that\u2019s what it feels like. It also feels like I\u2019m restrained, and a quick assessment of the position of my limbs confirms that I actually am restrained. Tightly. Shifting a little, I monitor his peaceful face, watching for any sign of disturbing him. There\u2019s none, and the heavy odour of stale whisky tells me why. My nose crinkles and I hold my breath, edging my way out of his hold until he rolls onto his back with a grumble. I check the clock, seeing it\u2019s only seven, then quickly throw my clothes on and hurry for the front door. I won\u2019t even bother attempting to make him a coffee to his liking. There\u2019s a Costa Coffee around the corner. They can make it for me.</p><p>Taking Miller\u2019s keys from the table, I leave him in bed and automatically head for the stairs, hoping I can return before he wakes and serve him coffee in bed. Aspirin, too. Echoes ring around the concrete walls of the stairwell as I dance down the steps, flashbacks of a lost little boy jumping all over my mind, dragging me back to sorrow. It doesn\u2019t matter how hard I try to kick them to the back of my brain; the memory of Miller\u2019s face in that picture is too vivid. But the thought of being able to make up for lost cuddles \u2013 lost things \u2013 fills me with purpose.</p><p>I crash through the exit door into the lobby and wave a hand over my shoulder to the doorman when he greets me, breaking into the fresh morning air feeling breathless. I don\u2019t let my laboured breathing hold me back, though, and jog down the street, landing in the bustling coffee house in no time at all.</p><p>\u2018Medium Americano, four shots, two sugars, and topped up halfway,\u2019 I gasp to the young guy behind the counter, slapping my purse down. \u2018Please.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure thing,\u2019 he replies, a little alarmed by my flustered form. \u2018Drinking in?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Take out.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018And four shots?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, topped up halfway,\u2019 I reiterate. If I knew how it should taste by Miller\u2019s standards, then I\u2019d take a slurp to test it, but I can only imagine that it tastes like coffee beans have been grinded to a pulp and that it resembles something close to tar.</p><p>He gets straight to work at the coffee machine, and I find myself counting the shots as they are added to the cup. He isn\u2019t going fast enough, but my manners prevent me from chivvying him along, so I shuffle impatiently instead, glancing over my shoulder on a frown when that strange sensation settles over me. I feel like I\u2019m being watched again, but when I scan the coffee house, I find only businessmen and women with their faces in laptops, slurping and tapping, so I shrug off the strange feeling and return my attention to the dithering server. Now he\u2019s taking his time wiping the steam pipe, whistling as he does.</p><p>\u2018Would you . . .\u2019 I pause, halted by the return sense of being observed, but this time I have the cold chill across my shoulders and raised neck hair to accompany it. A shiver reverberates through me, gliding slowly down my spine.</p><p>\u2018What did ya say?\u2019</p><p>I look blankly at the guy, who has turned from his task and is looking at me expectantly. What did I say? \u2018Nothing,\u2019 I breathe, reaching up to run my palm over my nape, unease settling over me like a blanket. I shake my head mildly and he shrugs, returning to the coffee machine.</p><p>I look around but only find other customers waiting impatiently, nothing out of the ordinary, yet my body\u2019s screaming that something isn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u2018Three-twenty, please.\u2019</p><p>I drag my wary eyes to the counter, finding Miller\u2019s coffee and a hand being held out. \u2018Sorry.\u2019 I shake myself back to life and fumble for my purse, taking for ever to locate a fiver before shoving it into his hand. Scooping up the take-out cup, I slowly turn, my eyes darting everywhere looking for something, but I haven\u2019t the first idea what. I feel stifled by anxiety. Claustrophobic. My steps are careful as I make for the exit, my eyes measuring every person I pass. None of them return my gaze. No one seems interested in me. I\u2019d brush off my discomfort as paranoia, if my internal alarm bells weren\u2019t still ringing like crackers.</p><p>\u2018Miss, your change!\u2019</p><p>The muffled yell of the server doesn\u2019t make my steps falter. My legs have switched to automatic and seem hell-bent on carrying me away from the source of my distress, even if it\u2019s not obvious what that source is. I break free of the confines of the coffee house, hoping my freedom will restore some rationality and calmness. It doesn\u2019t. My legs take off down the street at a steady jog, and I glance over my shoulder repeatedly, every time finding absolutely nothing. I\u2019m frustrated with myself but can\u2019t seem to convince my legs to slow, and I\u2019m not sure whether I should be grateful or frightened by this. The increasing coldness of my skin tells me frightened. My strides quicken, my breath instantly drained as I weave through the passers-by, stupidly careful not to spill or drop Miller\u2019s coffee as I do. My relief is immense when Miller\u2019s apartment block comes into view and a quick check over my shoulder reveals . . . something.</p><p>A man. A hooded man chasing me.</p><p>And that confirmation registers in the part of my brain that\u2019s feeding the instructions to my legs. My pace rockets, and I return my focus forward, my mind oblivious to my surroundings. The vision of someone hooded bursting through the crowds behind me is all I can see. The pounding of my heart is all I can feel.</p><p>I rush into the lobby and head for the lift, autopilot not taking me to the stairs this time. Now autopilot is desperately trying to get me away from my cloaked shadow.</p><p>\u2018Lift\u2019s broken,\u2019 the doorman calls, pulling me to a sharp halt. \u2018Engineer\u2019s on his way.\u2019 He shrugs before returning to his desk.</p><p>I growl my frustration and dart towards the stairwell, trying to gather some level-headedness. The door bashes against the wall behind me and I hit the concrete stairs, sprinting up them two at a time. The combination of my heavy breathing and pounding feet combine, ricocheting loudly off the walls around me.</p><p>Then a loud crash from below brings me to an abrupt halt on the sixth floor.</p><p>I freeze, my legs now refusing to work at all, and listen as the echo of that crash travels up the shaft of the stairwell, eventually fading to nothing above my head. I hold my breath, listening carefully. Silence. My lungs are screaming for some air, but I refuse them, concentrating on the stillness around me and the continued anxiety coursing through my cold veins. Long seconds pass before I brave a step forward, craning my neck to peer down the shaft, seeing nothing but steps, stair rails and cold, grey concrete.</p><p>I roll my eyes to myself, thinking I\u2019m being ridiculous. It could have been a runner. There are hundreds on the streets of London. Get a grip! Allowing some air into my burning lungs, I bring my body further forward, almost laughing at my silliness. What the hell is wrong with me?</p><p>Feeling foolish, I begin to pull back from the rail, but when I see a hand grip one of the stair rails a few floors below, I turn to stone. Then I watch in silent terror as it glides silently upward, getting closer, but there\u2019s no evidence of feet hitting the steps, like whatever\u2019s heading towards me has no feet . . . or they don\u2019t want me to know they\u2019re there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My head is screaming instructions to run, that I need to get away, yet none of my muscles are listening. I\u2019m frustrated, mentally screaming back at my mind\u2019s torrent of urgent instructions, but the deafening shrill of a mobile phone breaking through my mental argument brings me crashing back into the stairwell. It takes me a few confused seconds to register that it isn\u2019t mine. Then I hear thundering footsteps coming closer. I can\u2019t move. I\u2019ve never been so terrified.</p><p>Nothing is working \u2013 my legs, my brain, my voice, nothing, but when I hear another crash of a door from below, energy seems to surge through me, snapping me into action and sending me sprinting up the remaining flights of stairs. The other set of footsteps increases its pace, which only catapults my fear and, subsequently, my speed.</p><p>Relief nearly knocks me to my arse when I reach the tenth floor, and I fall through the door into the corridor that\u2019ll take me to safety, the sight of Miller\u2019s shiny black door probably the most welcome vision ever \u2013 the most welcome until the door swings open and I\u2019m powering towards a semi-naked, alarmed-looking Miller.</p><p>\u2018Miller!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Livy?\u2019 He starts towards me, his sleepy eyes widening by the second the closer we become, until it\u2019s quite apparent that he\u2019s wide awake and wondering what the hell is going on.</p><p>I drop the coffee and my purse as I reach him and launch myself into his arms, my panic now subsiding, making way for emotion. \u2018Oh God,\u2019 I gasp, letting him lift me from my feet and pin my full length to him, securing me to his bare chest with a firm hold at my neck and lower back. \u2018Someone\u2019s following me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 He doesn\u2019t ease up on his fierce hold.</p><p>\u2018They\u2019re in the stairwell.\u2019 My words are strained through my breathing, but I fight to spit it all out of my exhausted lungs. I wasn\u2019t imagining it before. Someone\u2019s been following me.</p><p>He\u2019s suddenly prising my numb limbs from his na**d body, fighting to free himself. \u2018Livy.\u2019</p> <p>I shake my head into his neck, not willing to let him go. I know where he\u2019ll head. \u2018Please don\u2019t,\u2019 I beg.</p><p>\u2018Livy, please!\u2019 he shouts, pulling impatiently at my body. \u2018Let go!\u2019 His anger doesn\u2019t deter me, and I grapple at his body, my fear rocketing, but my tenacity is flattened by an irate yell and a fast shift in movement that detaches me from his body. I\u2019m being held at arm\u2019s length in a heartbeat. My eyes are full of terror, his full of anger. \u2018Stay,\u2019 he orders, releasing me slowly to ensure I do as I\u2019m bid. Overpowering fear prevents me from doing anything else.</p><p>The loss of his hold leaves me unsteady, and I watch through my haze of tears as he stalks to the stairwell. His dignity is concealed only by his boxer shorts, but his lack of cover only enhances the fury emanating from his lean, na**d physique. He\u2019s quaking with anger, the muscles of his back rolling in waves, appearing to be flexing in preparation for what he might find beyond that door. He shoves it open with no caution or care, and passes the threshold, disappearing from my sight quickly. I attempt to get my breathing under control so I can listen, but I can\u2019t hear a thing.</p><p>Then life seems to stop as a high-pitched ding rings out in the corridor air.</p><p>The lift.</p><p>The broken lift.</p> <p>My heartbeat begins to pulse in my ears as I remain frozen, my eyes casting slowly over to the lift. The doors begin to slide open. I start to back away, terrified.</p><p>Then I gasp, my back hitting the wall as a man falls out. It seems to take an age for his boiler suit and tool belt to register in my distraught mind.</p><p>\u2018Sorry, love. Didn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u2019</p><p>I sag, my palm pressing into my chest as I exhale my held breath and watch him disappear back into the lift.</p><p>\u2018Nothing.\u2019 Miller appears, pacing towards me, looking no less angry than when he left. He takes my nape, guiding me into his apartment, and I hear the door slam, making me wince. He\u2019s buzzing with anger. \u2018Sit,\u2019 he instructs, releasing me and indicating the couch.</p><p>\u2018I saw someone this time,\u2019 I say, lowering myself to the sofa.</p><p>\u2018This time?\u2019 He recoils. \u2018Why haven\u2019t you said anything? You should have said something!\u2019</p><p>My hands meet in my lap, my gaze dropping to them as I thumb my ring. \u2018I thought I was being silly,\u2019 I confess, now realising that my inner alarm bells are working and they\u2019re working well.</p> <p>Miller is standing above me, twitching. I can\u2019t look at him. I know he\u2019s right, and now I\u2019m feeling more foolish than ever.</p><p>Firm hands land on my thighs and I force my eyes to lift a fraction in an attempt to gauge his expression. He\u2019s crouched before me, his hands have begun a soothing caress, and he\u2019s reinstated his impassive demeanour. All of these things restore my lost comfort. \u2018Tell me when,\u2019 he encourages me with an easy, gentle tone.</p><p>\u2018On my way to work the other day when you dropped me off. In the club.\u2019 I\u2019m watching Miller, and I\u2019m not liking what I\u2019m seeing. \u2018Do you know who it could be?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not sure,\u2019 he replies, replacing my returned comfort with a little disbelief.</p><p>\u2018You must have some idea. Who would want to follow me, Miller?\u2019</p><p>His eyes drop, hiding from my questioning glare.</p><p>\u2018Miller, who?\u2019 I\u2019m not letting this drop. \u2018Am I in danger?\u2019 When fear should be slicing me, I find anger brimming instead. If I\u2019m at risk, then I should know about it. Be prepared.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re in no danger when you\u2019re with me, Olivia.\u2019 He keeps his eyes down, refusing to face me.</p><p>\u2018But I\u2019m not always with you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve told you\u2019 \u2013 he grates the words slowly \u2013 \u2018you\u2019re probably the safest woman in London.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ!\u2019 I blurt, shocked. \u2018I\u2019m mixed up with you and William Anderson. I think I\u2019m intelligent enough to figure out that that probably places me in the high-risk category.\u2019 Good God, I dread to think of the enemies these two men have between them.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re wrong,\u2019 Miller says quietly but insistently. \u2018Anderson and I may not like each other, but we have one key interest.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Me,\u2019 I answer for him, but I don\u2019t see how that makes me safe.</p><p>\u2018Yes, you, and with Anderson and me being on, let\u2019s say, rival teams, it places you in safe hands.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then who the hell has been following me?\u2019 I yell, yanking Miller\u2019s startled face up. \u2018I don\u2019t feel safe. I feel very unsafe!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t need to worry.\u2019</p><p>I can see the strength it\u2019s taking for him to remain calm. I\u2019m past that. I\u2019m pissed off and annoyed that he\u2019s attempting to brush off my warranted fear with excuses of being in safe hands.</p><p>I stand abruptly, forcing Miller back on his heels. His steel-blue gaze regards me closely as I try to pull a valid claim together, something to put his claim to shame. It\u2019s quite easy. \u2018I didn\u2019t feel very safe when I was being chased down out there,\u2019 I yell, throwing my arm out to the side to point at the door.</p><p>\u2018You shouldn\u2019t have left without me.\u2019 He stands and holds my hips, keeping me in place, then hunkers down, unleashing his curl and sinking into my angry eyes with worried blue ones. \u2018Promise you\u2019ll never go anywhere alone.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just promise me, Olivia. Please don\u2019t hit me with your sass.\u2019</p><p>My sass is the only thing holding me up right now. I\u2019m angry but frightened. I feel safe but exposed. \u2018Please tell me why.\u2019</p><p>His eyes close, clearly trying to gather some patience. \u2018An interferer,\u2019 he whispers on a sigh, his whole body deflating but his grip of my h*ps firming up to steady me when I wobble on a gulp. \u2018Now promise.\u2019</p><p>My eyes are wide and I\u2019m frightened, no words coming to me.</p><p>\u2018Olivia, please, I beg you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why? Who\u2019s the interferer and why are they following me?\u2019</p><p>He holds my eyes, speaking to me through the intensity of his gaze as well as his words. \u2018I don\u2019t know, but whoever it is can obviously predict my next move.\u2019</p><p>His next move? Realisation sucker-punches me in the gut. \u2018You haven\u2019t stopped?\u2019 I gasp.</p><p>It\u2019s not as easy as just quitting.</p><p>His clients. They\u2019ve all had him at the drop of a hat and a few thousand quid. Not any more, and it\u2019s obvious that some won\u2019t give him up easily. Everyone wants what they can\u2019t have and now, because of me, he\u2019s even more unobtainable.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve not officially quit, Olivia. I know the upset this will cause. I need to do this right.\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s abruptly very clear. \u2018They\u2019ll hate me.\u2019 Cassie hates me, and she\u2019s not even a client.</p><p>He huffs an agreeable puff of sarcastic air. Then he sinks into me with reassuring eyes. \u2018I\u2019m not sleeping with anyone else.\u2019 He articulates the words slowly and precisely, a desperate attempt to make himself clear, and I don\u2019t doubt for a moment that he\u2019s telling me the truth. \u2018Olivia, I\u2019ve not tasted anyone or let anyone taste me. Tell me you believe me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I believe you.\u2019 I don\u2019t hesitate. My faith is profound, despite my muddle, with no evidence except Miller\u2019s say-so. I have no explanation for why this might be, but something deep and powerful is guiding me. It\u2019s instinct, and instinct has served me well up to this point. I\u2019m sticking with it. \u2018I believe you,\u2019 I affirm again.</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 He takes me in his arms and hugs me with the most incredible amount of relief. I\u2019m confused and shocked. Women scorned and following me? They can predict his next move. They know he\u2019s going to quit and they don\u2019t want him to.</p><p>\u2018I have a request,\u2019 he breathes into my neck, his hands skating every inch of my back.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Never stop loving me.\u2019</p><p>I shake my head, wondering if he recalls making that request last night when alcohol and tiredness were consuming him, and that makes me wonder whether he recalls my reply. \u2018Never.\u2019 My confirmation is as resolute as it was before sleep took us last night, despite my short delay in delivering it.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Nan\u2019s waiting on the doorstep when we pull up outside the house, arms crossed over her bosom and guarded sapphire eyes set firmly on Miller. I check for a tapping slipper as she follows our path to the house, anything to avoid the risk of meeting her gaze. She may have been understanding and compassionate on the telephone last night, but I don\u2019t mistake that as being the end of it. We\u2019re face to face now. There\u2019s no escaping. She\u2019ll be pouncing on Miller, and judging by his quiet thoughtfulness since we left his apartment, he\u2019s fully expecting it.</p><p>His warm palm slides onto my neck as we approach and begins massaging gently, his attempt to rub the nerves out of me. He\u2019s wasting his time. \u2018Mrs Taylor,\u2019 Miller says formally, bringing us to a stop.</p><p>\u2018Hmmm,\u2019 she hums, not relenting on her threatening glare. \u2018It\u2019s past nine.\u2019 She\u2019s speaking to me now but still holding Miller in place with suspicious eyes. \u2018You\u2019ll be late.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Olivia isn\u2019t going to work today,\u2019 Miller cuts me off. \u2018Her boss has agreed to give her the day off.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, really?\u2019 Nan asks, grey eyebrows high in surprise. I feel like I should be the one explaining, but instead I\u2019m a spare part between these two while Miller continues to speak.</p><p>\u2018Yes, I\u2019m taking her out for the day. A bit of respite and quality time together.\u2019</p><p>I find it easy to suck back the condescending laugh that\u2019s threatening. Miller insisted that I needed a break, and the opportunity to spend a whole day with him is rare and should be seized with both hands. But I\u2019m not naive enough to believe that that\u2019s the only reason. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Miller looks down at me with a little reassurance in his gaze. \u2018Go and take a shower.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 I say reluctantly, knowing there\u2019s no avoiding leaving Miller to handle Nan on his own. His insistence that I didn\u2019t have time to shower at his apartment this morning now makes sense. It gives him the perfect opportunity to speak with Nan while I\u2019m out of the way.</p><p>\u2018Go,\u2019 he encourages me softly. \u2018I\u2019ll be here.\u2019</p><p>I nod, nibbling on my lip, not in any rush to part company with them. In fact, I\u2019d like to turn, run, and take Miller with me. Nan subtly cocks her head, her way of saying scoot. There\u2019s no avoiding the inevitable, but if it wasn\u2019t for Miller\u2019s desire to apologise, then I wouldn\u2019t now be taking the stairs slowly and leaving them behind to talk. I\u2019ve given Miller the low-down on my conversation with my grandmother last night, and he smiled fondly when I relayed what Nan had told me about special love. But Nan doesn\u2019t know the gruesome details, and it has to remain that way.</p> <p>I glance over my shoulder when I reach the top of the stairs, finding them watching me, neither prepared to speak until I\u2019m out of earshot. Nan is radiating authority and my finicky, fine Miller is oozing respect. It\u2019s an amusing sight. \u2018Chop-chop,\u2019 Miller calls on a mild grin. He finds my worry amusing? Rolling my eyes on an exasperated sigh, I resign myself to the fact there\u2019s nothing I can do.</p><p>I take myself into the bathroom and shower in record time. The water is cool, but I\u2019m not prepared to wait until it\u2019s more tolerable, and the conditioner barely touches my hair before I\u2019m rinsing it off. My mind has plenty of things to focus on, all unpleasant and worrying, but it\u2019s hijacked by images of Nan\u2019s finger waving in Miller\u2019s face and her asking prying questions that I hope to God he can wriggle out of answering.</p><p>Flinging a towel around my cold, sopping body, I dart across the landing to get dressed, listening briefly for heated words \u2013 Nan\u2019s mainly \u2013 before I charge into my bedroom and throw my towel to the side.</p><p>\u2018Well, hello.\u2019</p><p>I jump back against the door, my hand clutching my heart. \u2018Jesus!\u2019</p> <p>Miller\u2019s sitting on my bed, phone to his ear, with a devilish grin on his perfect face. He doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s just been verbally terrorised. \u2018Apologies,\u2019 he says into the phone, eyes on me. \u2018Something\u2019s just come up.\u2019 Clicking to end the call, he lets his phone slide to the centre of his palm while he taps his knee pensively with his fingertips. \u2018Cold?\u2019</p><p>His one-word question and the area that his twinkling eyes are focused on pulls my eyes downward. Yes, I am, and it\u2019s plain to see, but my chilly ni**les start to tingle with something other than coldness as I remain under his examination. \u2018A little,\u2019 I concede, cupping my boobs, hiding them from view. \u2018Where\u2019s Nan?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Downstairs.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u2019 He\u2019s calm and collected, not displaying any signs of unease after dealing with my protective grandmother.</p><p>\u2018Well, because . . . it\u2019s just . . .\u2019 I stutter and stammer all over my words, stupidly uncomfortable. This is ridiculous. I roll my eyes and drop my hands. \u2018What did she say?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You mean while she was tapping her biggest carving knife on the table?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She wasn\u2019t,\u2019 I laugh, but halt my nervous giggling when Miller remains completely serious. \u2018Was she?\u2019</p><p>He tucks his phone into the inside pocket of his jacket and stands, resting his hands in his trouser pockets. \u2018Olivia, I\u2019m not prepared to go any further with this line of conversation while you\u2019re wet and naked.\u2019 He shakes his head, like he\u2019s shaking away wicked thoughts. He probably is. \u2018Either get dressed or shimmy that gorgeous little body over here so I can taste it.\u2019</p><p>My spine lengthens and I fight off the shots of desire that fire like bullets across the room, from Miller to me. \u2018You wouldn\u2019t disrespect my nan,\u2019 I stupidly remind him.</p><p>\u2018That was before she threatened to remove my manhood.\u2019</p><p>I laugh. He\u2019s serious and there\u2019s no question that Nan was, too. \u2018So now the rule doesn\u2019t apply?\u2019</p><p>He pouts, a wicked glint in his stunning eyes. \u2018I\u2019ve assessed and mitigated the risks associated with worshipping you in your nan\u2019s home.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You have?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yes, and the best thing is that you can put measures in place to lower a risk.\u2019 He\u2019s talking like he\u2019s negotiating a business transaction again.</p><p>\u2018Like what?\u2019</p><p>Miller\u2019s lovely lips press into a straight line as he considers my question; then he wanders over to my chair and picks it up. \u2018Excuse me,\u2019 he says, waiting for me to move from the door, which I do without complaint, watching in amusement as he wedges the top of the backrest under the handle. \u2018I believe we may be close to a risk-free worshipping session.\u2019 A huge smile spreads across my face as I watch him checking the stability of the chair before he jiggles the handle. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he concludes on a satisfied nod of his handsome head. \u2018I believe I\u2019ve covered every eventuality.\u2019 He turns towards me and spends a few moments burning my na**d skin with his scorching gaze. \u2018Now I get to taste you.\u2019</p><p>My libido responds fast. I\u2019m in full-on responsive mode, and I\u2019m delighted to see Miller is, too. I can see the evidence through his trousers.</p><p>\u2018Olivia!\u2019 Nan\u2019s screech slices straight through the sexual tension and kills it dead. \u2018Olivia, I\u2019m putting on a white wash. You have any?\u2019 The creaking floorboards indicate her close proximity.</p><p>\u2018Fucking perfect,\u2019 Miller grumbles with one hundred per cent frustration. \u2018Just . . . f**king . . . perfect.\u2019</p><p>I grin and dip to retrieve my towel. \u2018You missed a risk,\u2019 I muse, wrapping myself up.</p><p>Adjusting his groin area, he drills holes into me, unmistakably unamused. \u2018I didn\u2019t anticipate a white-wash day.\u2019 He removes the chair from the door and pulls it open, revealing Nan with her arms full of white material. Miller plasters an insincere smile on his face, but it\u2019s still a smile and it\u2019s still relatively rare, even if it\u2019s fake. Not that Nan would know. \u2018You should have someone to do that for you, Mrs Taylor.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Pfft! You rich people!\u2019 She shoos him out of the way and stalks around my room, collecting anything white on her travels. \u2018I\u2019m not scared of hard work.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Neither is Miller,\u2019 I pipe up. \u2018He cleans and cooks.\u2019</p><p>Nan halts, shuffling the masses of white material between her arms. \u2018Oh, so it\u2019s just my age that suggests I should have some help, then, hmmm?\u2019</p><p>I smirk when I see Nan hit Miller with a contemptuous look, making him shift awkwardly on his expensive shoes. \u2018Not at all,\u2019 he says, flicking pleading eyes to mine. I\u2019m smug. Now he\u2019s getting the gist. She can be a pain in the royal arse and I\u2019ll remind him of this little scene when he chastises me for saying it as it is. \u2018I didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Save it, mister,\u2019 she spits, marching past him and giving me a devious wink. Then she stops in front of me and runs old eyes up and down my white towel. The one that\u2019s covering my dignity. \u2018I\u2019m doing whites,\u2019 she muses, holding back an impish grin.</p><p>\u2018Well this can go in the next load.\u2019 I pull my towel in, narrowing my eyes in warning.</p><p>\u2018But this doesn\u2019t make a full load.\u2019 She gestures to the pile of washing in her arms with a minuscule nod of her head. \u2018It\u2019ll be a terrible waste of water and energy. I should fill the machine.\u2019</p><p>My lips purse and hers curve. \u2018You should fill your mouth so you can\u2019t speak,\u2019 I retort, making her grin widen. She\u2019s incorrigible, the old minx.</p><p>\u2018Miller!\u2019 she gasps. \u2018Do you hear how she speaks to an old lady?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do, Mrs Taylor,\u2019 he replies speedily, rounding her short, plump body until he\u2019s standing behind me, looking at Nan\u2019s now serious face over my shoulder. She\u2019s a bugger, playing the old, sweet lady. I know better, and I\u2019ll make sure Miller does, too. He bends and rests his chin next to my ear, his arm curling around my waist so his hand is splayed on my towel-covered tummy. \u2018I have an apple in the car that\u2019ll fit your mouth perfectly. Should do the trick.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ha!\u2019 I laugh.</p><p>She gasps in horror, her face contorting in irritation. \u2018Well!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well what?\u2019 I ask. \u2018Quit the defenceless old bird act, Nan. It\u2019s past its sell-by date.\u2019</p><p>She huffs and puffs on the spot, looking back and forth to me and Miller, whose chin is still settled on my bare shoulder. I take his hand on my tummy and squeeze, craning my head to get his delicious face in eyeshot. He smiles brightly and kisses me hard on the lips.</p><p>\u2018Respect!\u2019 Nan squawks, snapping us out of our moment. \u2018Give me that!\u2019 She yanks the towel from my body.</p><p>\u2018Nan!\u2019</p><p>She starts laughing menacingly as she bunches it up with the existing pile. \u2018That\u2019ll teach ya!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shit!\u2019 I grab the first available thing in sight to cover my modesty . . . which happens to be Miller\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u2018Oh!\u2019 Nan bends over, chuckling uncontrollably as I slap Miller\u2019s palms over my br**sts.</p><p>\u2018Well, hello again,\u2019 he rasps in my ear, giving a little squeeze.</p><p>\u2018Miller!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You put them there!\u2019 he chuckles, making the most of my panic-induced error.</p><p>\u2018Bloody hell!\u2019 I shrug him off and rush over to the bed, yanking at the covers until I\u2019m concealed again. My face is flaming, Nan is in bits, and Miller isn\u2019t helping, chuckling to himself. It\u2019s the most beautiful sight, but my embarrassment and irritation won\u2019t allow me to appreciate it for long. \u2018Don\u2019t egg her on!\u2019 This is wrong on so many levels!</p><p>\u2018Sorry.\u2019 He attempts to compose himself, pulling at his suit and brushing down his front, his shoulders still jiggling.</p><p>\u2018Nan, get out!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m going, I\u2019m going,\u2019 she breathes tiredly as she trots towards the door. I know she\u2019s just winked cheekily at Miller because he quickly diverts his straying eyes from her, and his lips have straightened. He\u2019s also still rearranging his perfect suit, which isn\u2019t unusual, but the frantic hand movements and tense shoulders are giving away what would be a normal undertaking as a diversion. I\u2019m thoroughly unamused by the time she leaves, highly smug and tittering her way down the landing.</p><p>Fighting with the mass of material surrounding me, I march to the door and slam it behind her, sending Miller on a startled jump. He fails to hold back his delight any longer.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re supposed to be on my side,\u2019 I snap, pulling at the material tangled at my feet.</p><p>\u2018I am,\u2019 he laughs. \u2018Honest, I am.\u2019</p><p>I eye him moodily as he saunters over to me and whips the bedding away before he scoops me into his arms. \u2018She\u2019s a treasure.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s a pain in the arse,\u2019 I counter, and I don\u2019t care if I get scorned for it. \u2018What did she say?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I told you, my manhood is at risk.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That doesn\u2019t mean you get to back her up for fear of losing it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I wasn\u2019t backing her up.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, you were.\u2019</p><p>\u2018If your grandmother is happy to expose your gorgeous na**d body in my presence, then I\u2019m not going to complain about it.\u2019 He carries me to the bed and settles on the edge with me spread across his lap. \u2018In fact, I\u2019ll be highly grateful for it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t show your gratitude so willingly,\u2019 I grumble. \u2018And I love it when you laugh, but not at my expense.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Would you prefer I showed you my gratitude?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 My reply is decisive and haughty. \u2018Just me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your request has been noted, Miss Taylor.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jolly good, Mr Hart.\u2019</p><p>He grins, restoring my contentment, and lavishes one of his mind-blanking kisses on me. Not for long enough, though. \u2018The day is passing quickly and we haven\u2019t even made it to breakfast yet.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018We\u2019ll do brunch.\u2019 I don\u2019t allow him to break our kiss, reaching to his neck and pulling him in.</p><p>\u2018You need to eat.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not hungry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Olivia,\u2019 he warns, \u2018please. I\u2019d like to feed you and I\u2019d like you to accept.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Strawberries?\u2019 I try. \u2018British for the sweetness and dipped in yummy dark chocolate.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll get away with that in public.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then let\u2019s go back to your place.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re insatiable.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Agreed. I\u2019ve awakened this unquenchable desire in you and I\u2019m the only man who\u2019ll ever get to sate it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Agreed.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve cleared that up, not\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018That I have a choice, I know.\u2019 I bite his lip and drag it through my teeth. \u2018I don\u2019t want a choice.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good job.\u2019 He places me on my feet and looks up at me with soft eyes, a hint of a smile gracing his lovely lips.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I ask, mirroring his mild beam.</p><p>Smooth hands slide around to my bum and pull me between his spread thighs. Then he plants a light kiss on my tummy. \u2018I was just thinking how lovely you look standing na**d before me.\u2019 His chin rests on my navel and he gazes up at me, his divine blues bursting with contentment. \u2018What would you like to do today?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh . . .\u2019 My brain kicks into gear, running over all of the fun stuff we could do together. I bet Miller\u2019s never partaken in fun stuff. \u2018Roam, meander, wander.\u2019 I\u2019d love to ramble the streets of London with Miller, point out my favourite buildings and give him a rundown on their histories. Mind you, he\u2019s hardly dressed for wandering. My eyes flick over his perfectly precise three-piece suit on a frown.</p><p>\u2018You mean walk?\u2019 he asks, a little taken aback, pulling my eyes back to his. He doesn\u2019t seem impressed.</p><p>\u2018Nice walking.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Where?\u2019</p><p>I shrug, a little saddened that Miller doesn\u2019t appear to find my idea of fun very appealing. \u2018What do you suggest, then?\u2019</p><p>He ponders my question for a few moments before he speaks. \u2018I have lots to do at Ice. You could come and tidy my office.\u2019</p><p>I recoil in disgust. His office is clinical. It doesn\u2019t need tidying, and no amount of enthusiasm injected into his tone will convince me that going to work with Miller will be fun. \u2018You said quality time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You can sit on my lap while I work.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be daft.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not.\u2019</p><p>I feared he was serious. \u2018I\u2019m not taking a day off work just to go to work with you.\u2019 I stand back and fold my arms across my chest, hoping he comprehends just how adamant I am. The smile that graces his yummy lips makes my resolve waver. He\u2019s dishing out smiles left, right and centre, and it\u2019s delightful and maddening all at once. \u2018What?\u2019 I ask, thinking I should stop questioning his reasons for his obvious joy and simply accept it without a word. But this exasperating man piques my curiosity constantly.</p><p>\u2018I was just thinking how lovely you look with your arms pushing your br**sts up.\u2019 His eyes gleam relentlessly, and I look down, sizing up my lack of chest.</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s nothing there.\u2019 I push into my boobs a little more, not being able to fathom what he can see that I can\u2019t.</p><p>\u2018They\u2019re perfect.\u2019 He snatches me up quickly, and I squeal as I\u2019m tossed onto the bed and covered in his suit-clad body. \u2018I request that they remain exactly how they are.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 I agree, just before his mouth swamps me, smothering my lips delicately but purposely. I\u2019m blindsided, totally swallowed up, loving Miller\u2019s relaxed condition. All uptight behaviour is lost.</p><p>Well, almost.</p><p>\u2018My suit,\u2019 he murmurs, pecking a path to my ear. \u2018My appearance has never been so questionable since you invaded my life, sweet girl.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You look perfect.\u2019</p><p>Snorting his disagreement, he lifts from my desire-drenched nakedness and stands to rearrange his suit, finishing by fiddling with the knot of his tie as I watch him. \u2018Get dressed.\u2019</p><p>I sigh and shift to the edge of the bed as he meanders over to my mirror so he can see what he\u2019s doing. Even though I\u2019m now used to Miller and his fussy ways, my fascination remains strong. Everything about him, everything that he does is always undertaken with the utmost care and attention, and it has fast become endearing . . . except when his temper is unleashed. Kicking that thought away, I leave Miller playing with his tie and get myself ready, throwing on a floral tea dress and some flip-flops before blasting my hair dry and messing with it for a good few minutes, cursing myself for not allowing the conditioner to work its magic before I rinsed. I tie it up, pull it back down, ruffle it a few times, and finally exhale my exasperation at my untamed locks, pulling it into a loose ponytail over my shoulder.</p><p>\u2018Cute,\u2019 Miller concludes when I turn to present myself to him, his eyes taking a leisurely jaunt up and down my frame, still messing with his tie. \u2018No Converse today?\u2019</p><p>I look down at my pink toenails and wriggle my feet. \u2018Don\u2019t you like them?\u2019 I bet Miller\u2019s feet have never seen a pair of flip-flops in their life. In fact, I bet Miller\u2019s feet have been nothing but spoiled with handmade, top-quality fancy leather shoes. He doesn\u2019t even wear trainers at the gym, going barefoot instead.</p><p>\u2018Olivia, you could wear a rag and look like a princess.\u2019</p><p>I smile and collect my satchel, throwing it across my body, allowing myself a few riveting moments to regard Miller\u2019s preciseness. \u2018People must think we\u2019re a strange match.\u2019</p><p>His face contorts with a frown as he approaches and takes my nape, leading me out of the bedroom. \u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, you all suited and booted and me\u2019 \u2013 I look down, searching for the right word \u2013 \u2018cutesy.\u2019 I can\u2019t think of a better one.</p><p>\u2018Enough of that,\u2019 he scolds me quietly as we take the stairs. \u2018Say goodbye to your grandmother.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Bye, Nan!\u2019 I call, not being given the opportunity to find her. I\u2019m led straight to the door.</p><p>\u2018Have fun!\u2019 she calls from the kitchen.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll deliver Olivia home later,\u2019 Miller says, back to formal, just as the front door shuts behind us. I glance up at him with resigned eyes and ignore his questioning look when he catches it. \u2018Get in.\u2019 He opens the door of his Mercedes for me, and I slip into the soft leather of the passenger seat.</p><p>The door is shut gently and he\u2019s beside me, starting the car and pulling off before I have a chance to put my seat belt on. \u2018So what are we doing?\u2019 I enquire again as I pull my belt across my body.</p><p>\u2018You tell me.\u2019</p><p>I look across at him, surprised, but don\u2019t delay my answer. \u2018Park up near Mayfair.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mayfair?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, we\u2019ll wander.\u2019 I return my stare forward, noticing the dual temperature display glowing the digits \u201816\u2019, just as they were last time, except now it\u2019s far warmer. I suddenly feel stifled, but not wanting to upset Miller\u2019s perfect world, I open the window a touch instead.</p><p>\u2018Wander,\u2019 he muses thoughtfully, like it worries him. It probably does, but I ignore the concern in his tone and remain quiet in my seat. \u2018Wander,\u2019 he says to himself again, starting to tap the steering wheel. I can feel the uncertainty rolling off him in waves. \u2018She wants to wander.\u2019</p><p>I smile on an undetectable shake of my head, then settle further into my seat when Miller kills the stretching silence by turning the media system on. Kid Mac\u2019s \u2018Pursuit of Happiness\u2019 fills the car, and my face scrunches up in utter wonder at Miller\u2019s continued surprising choices in music. I know for sure he\u2019s flicking occasional glances in my direction, but I don\u2019t humour him with my curious mind. Instead, I remain silent for the rest of the journey, musing over so many elements of my curious Miller Hart and the curious world that I\u2019ve come willingly into.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>When Miller slips into a parking space and cuts the engine, I know better than to let myself out of the car. He rounds the front, fastening his jacket, and opens the door for me. \u2018Thank you, sir.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Most welcome,\u2019 he replies, with no hint of acknowledging my sarcasm. \u2018Now what?\u2019 He glances around at our surroundings briefly, then pulls the sleeve of his jacket up to check the time.</p><p>\u2018Are you in a rush?\u2019 I ask, immediately irritated by his rude gesture.</p><p>His eyes flick to mine and his arm drops. \u2018Not in the least bit.\u2019 He straightens his suit again, anything to avoid my bitter tone. \u2018What now?\u2019 he repeats.</p><p>\u2018We wander.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Where?\u2019</p><p>My shoulders droop. This is going to be hard work. \u2018This is supposed to be relaxing. Something leisurely and enjoyable.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can think of far more gratifying ways to pass my time, Olivia, and it doesn\u2019t involve keeping you in public.\u2019 He\u2019s wholly serious, and my thighs clench as he takes another fill of his surroundings.</p><p>\u2018Have you ever wandered?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>Curious eyes return to mine quickly. \u2018I go from A to B.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve never basked in the opulence London has to offer?\u2019 I ask, astounded that anyone could live in this beautifully grand city and not immerse themselves in its history. It\u2019s a travesty.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re one of London\u2019s finest opulences, and I\u2019d love to bask in you right now.\u2019 He studies me thoughtfully, and I know what\u2019s coming. The increased beat between my legs is a good sign, and so is the desire pooling in his eyes after executing one of those lazy blinks. \u2018But I can\u2019t very well worship you here, can I?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I answer quickly and decidedly staunchly before I\u2019m hauled deeper into those riveting blue eyes. He doesn\u2019t want to wander, but I do. I\u2019m bubbling everywhere, my desire tangible in the open air around us, but I want to take pleasure from Miller in another way. \u2018What about your paintings?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What about them?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You must appreciate the beauty of the things you paint or you wouldn\u2019t bother painting them.\u2019 I disregard the fact that they could be even more beautiful if they were clearer.</p><p>He shrugs nonchalantly, again looking around us. It\u2019s really irritating me now. \u2018I see something I admire, I take a picture and I paint it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just like that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t give me his eyes.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you think it would be far more rewarding if you painted it in the flesh?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t see why.\u2019</p><p>On a tired exhale of breath, I toss my bag over my shoulder. I still don\u2019t fully get him, despite constantly telling myself that I do. I\u2019m kidding myself. \u2018Ready?\u2019</p><p>He answers by taking my nape and pushing onward, but I halt and wriggle free of his hold. Then I hit him with a contemptuous look as he stares down at me, puzzlement obvious on his lovely face. \u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re not guiding me around London by my neck.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why ever not?\u2019 He\u2019s truly flummoxed. \u2018I like having you that close. I assumed you like it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do,\u2019 I admit. The warmth of his palm spread across my nape is always an appreciated comfort. But not while wandering around London. \u2018Hold my hand.\u2019 I can\u2019t imagine that Miller has ever held a woman\u2019s hand casually, and I also can\u2019t picture it. He\u2019s led me by my hand on a few occasions, but it\u2019s always been purposeful \u2013 to put me somewhere he wants me to be, never relaxed and lovingly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He spends way too long thinking about my request before he eventually takes my offering with a little pucker of his brow.</p><p>\u2018Boo!\u2019 I yell with a smirk, making him wince and give a little startled jump before he quickly composes himself and slowly lifts unamused blue eyes to mine. I smile. \u2018I don\u2019t bite.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s full to the brim with aggravation, I can tell, but he\u2019s giving me nothing but his cool impassiveness. It doesn\u2019t affect my smiling face, though. I\u2019m properly grinning. \u2018Sass,\u2019 he says simply, firming up his grip, refusing to humour me as he takes the lead.</p><p>I follow, changing the hold of our joined hands as we wander down the street so our fingers are entwined. I keep the direction of my stare forward, only allowing myself a brief glimpse of Miller. I don\u2019t need to look, but I do, seeing him gazing down at our hands and feeling the flex of his grip as he gets used to his hold. He really hasn\u2019t held a woman\u2019s hand like this before, and while the thought delights me, it also tarnishes the immense comforting feeling that I relish in when he holds me by my nape. Is that how he holds all women? Do they get the rush of warmth bolting through their body when he does that? Do their eyes slowly close and their neck flex a little in absorption and satisfaction? These questions have my hand tightening around his and my head turning to gaze up at him, just to get a good fill of the look on his face, just to see how uncomfortable our connection is making him. He\u2019s stiff as a board, his hand constantly flexing in my grasp, and his expression is almost mystified.</p> <p>\u2018You okay?\u2019 I ask quietly as we turn onto Bury Street.</p><p>The even beats of his expensive shoes hitting the pavement falter very slightly, but he doesn\u2019t look down at me. \u2018Fine and dandy,\u2019 he says, and I laugh, letting my head fall onto his upper arm.</p><p>He\u2019s far from fine and dandy. He looks awkward and inconvenienced. Miller, despite being dressed in exquisite finery that blends into London-by-day just fine, is exuding an air of unease. I look around as we continue towards Piccadilly, seeing businessmen everywhere, all suited, some on mobile phones, some carrying briefcases, and all look perfectly comfortable. They look full of purpose, probably because they are. They\u2019re on their way to brunch or a meeting or maybe to the office. And as I return my eyes to Miller, I realise that he\u2019s lacking that purpose right now. He goes from A to B. He doesn\u2019t wander, yet he\u2019s trying his hardest for me. And failing terribly. My mind dips momentarily into the possibility that Miller looks so out of place because I\u2019m attached to his arm, but I toss that thought out just as quickly. I\u2019m here and I\u2019m staying, and not just because Miller says so. The notion of attempting to continue my life without him in it is unthinkable, and my train of thought alone sends a chilliness coursing through my current contentment, making me shiver into his lean body. My spare arm lifts without instruction and my palm wraps around his upper arm, just below my chin.</p><p>\u2018Olivia?\u2019 I leave my head and palm exactly where they are, lifting only my eyes to find him looking down at me with mild concern etched on his face. I force a tiny smile through the anxiety that my wayward thoughts have spiked.</p><p>\u2018I know and love my sweet girl\u2019s look of bliss, and she\u2019s trying to fool me now.\u2019 He stops and turns into me, making releasing him unavoidable and tremendously painful, but I allow myself to be detached. Masses of blond ponytail are collected from my shoulder and released to cascade down my back before his palms encase my cheeks. He bends a little, making sure his face is level with mine; then he reinstates a little of my contentment by blinking so incredibly lazily, I think he might not ever open his eyes again. But he does, and I\u2019m blasted back by the unreserved comfort that\u2019s pouring relentlessly from every fibre of his beautiful being. He knows. \u2018Share with me your burden.\u2019</p> <p>I smile on the inside and try to mentally pull it together. \u2018I\u2019m fine,\u2019 I assure him, taking one of his hands from my cheek and kissing his palm gently.</p><p>\u2018Overthinking, Olivia. How many times do we need to go over this?\u2019 He seems cross, although continuing to be super gentle.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m okay,\u2019 I insist, diverting my eyes from the intensity of his questioning stare, letting them fall down the length of his body to his posh brogues. My mind captures every fine thread of his attire and the outstanding quality of his shoes. And then I think of something and look across the street. \u2018Come with me,\u2019 I say, taking his hand and tugging him into the road.</p><p>He follows obediently, with not a murmur of protest, to the end of Bury Street and a little way down Jermyn Street until we\u2019re standing outside a men\u2019s clothes store \u2013 a boutique-style one, all stuffy and proper, but I see something I like the look of.</p><p>\u2018What are you doing?\u2019 he questions, looking nervously at the shop window.</p><p>\u2018Window-shopping,\u2019 I answer nonchalantly as I drop his hand and turn to face the window, taking in the solid wooden mannequins dressed in top-quality men\u2019s wear. I can see mainly suits, but they\u2019re not what have my attention.</p> <p>Miller joins me, slipping his hands into his trouser pockets, and we both just stand there for an age, me pretending to browse, when all I\u2019m thinking is how I\u2019ll get him in there, and Miller twitching nervously beside me.</p><p>He clears his throat. \u2018I think that\u2019s enough window-shopping for now,\u2019 he declares, taking my neck to lead me away.</p><p>I don\u2019t budge, not even when his strong fingers increase their pressure a bit. It\u2019s hard, but I root myself to the spot, making moving me of the utmost difficulty \u2018Let\u2019s go in and take a look,\u2019 I suggest.</p><p>He stills, halting his attempts to get me shifting. \u2018I\u2019m particular about where I shop.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re particular about everything, Miller.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, and I\u2019d like to keep it that way.\u2019 He tries to move me again, but I dip from his hold and head hastily for the entrance.</p><p>\u2018Come on,\u2019 I urge.</p><p>\u2018Olivia,\u2019 he calls, his tone laced with warning.</p> <p>I stop on the shop step and swing around, plastering a huge smile on my face. \u2018Nothing fills you with greater pleasure than seeing me so happy,\u2019 I remind him, leaning up against the door frame and casually crossing one leg over the other. \u2018And it would make me really happy if you would accompany me into this shop.\u2019</p><p>Blue eyes twinkle but narrow, as if he\u2019s trying to conceal his amusement at my smart-arse comment. His lips are twitching, too, which only broadens my happiness into overwhelming elation. This is just perfect because Miller loves it when I\u2019m happy, and I couldn\u2019t be any happier right now. I\u2019m being playful and he\u2019s reciprocating . . . nearly.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re very hard to resist, Olivia Taylor.\u2019 He shakes his head wistfully, propelling my happiness further as he takes the few remaining strides towards me. I stay on the shop step, looking down at him, unable to wipe the smile from my face. He keeps his hands to himself and reaches up with his lips, bringing them close to mine. \u2018It\u2019s almost impossible,\u2019 he whispers, engulfing my face with his soft breath and my nose with his manly scent. My resolve wanes, but I quickly snatch it back and disappear into the shop before I\u2019m swallowed up and led away from the store.</p><p>On entering, I\u2019m immediately given the once-over by a stout man, who appears from the back of the store. He looks like he\u2019s just wandered out of an estate in the English countryside. His tweed suit is crisp and neat and, on closer inspection, I notice the knot of his tie is as perfect as Miller\u2019s. Stupidly, I think that Miller will approve of this, which will only enhance his good mood, so I pivot to face him, but deflate fast when I find he\u2019s disappeared from the door and is now looking through the shop window again, his mask slipped back into place. He\u2019s hovering, looking around cautiously . . . dubiously.</p><p>\u2018Can I help you?\u2019</p><p>I leave Miller contemplating whether he\u2019s going to venture into the store and return my attention to the store assistant. Yes, he can help me. \u2018You do casual wear?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>He laughs a pompous laugh before signalling to the back of the store. \u2018Why, of course; however, we are far more renowned for our suits and shirts.\u2019</p><p>My eyes follow the direction of his pointed finger and find a section to the rear of the store with just a few rails of casual garments. It\u2019s quite sparse, but I\u2019m not risking leaving to try and get Miller to a shop with a wider range. It\u2019ll give him too long to worm out of it. And on that thought, I swivel again to see if he\u2019s braved venturing into the shop. He hasn\u2019t.</p><p>On a sigh loud enough for him to hear, even from outside, I turn to find the assistant again. \u2018I\u2019ll have a look.\u2019 I go to pass him, but he shifts on an uncomfortable shuffle of his portly body, blocking my path. I frown and throw him a questioning look as he runs disapproving eyes down my floral dress, all the way to my exposed pink toenails.</p><p>\u2018Miss,\u2019 he begins, returning his beady eyes to mine, \u2018you\u2019ll find most shops here on Jermyn Street will be of the . . . how should I say?\u2019 He hums in thought, but I don\u2019t know why. He knows what he wants to say, and I know it, too. \u2018The higher end of the clothing spectrum.\u2019</p><p>My sass runs and hides. I\u2019m not his typical clientele, and he isn\u2019t afraid to voice it. \u2018Right,\u2019 I whisper, too many unwanted thoughts running through my mind. Like posh people eating posh food and drinking posh champagne . . . all of which I serve to them from time to time.</p><p>He smiles the most insincere smile and starts fiddling with the sleeve of a nearby shirt on a mannequin. \u2018Maybe Oxford Street would be more suitable.\u2019</p><p>I feel foolish, and this rotten man\u2019s reaction to my enquiry has only confirmed my constant worries, and he hasn\u2019t even seen Miller. That\u2019ll shock him. Me with a finely dressed specimen such as Miller?</p><p>\u2018I believe the young lady would like to be shown the casual department.\u2019 Miller\u2019s voice creeps over my shoulders and makes them seize up. I\u2019ve heard that tone. Only a few times before, but I\u2019ll never forget or mistake it. He\u2019s angry. I note the shop assistant\u2019s widened eyes and stunned expression before I chance a very wary glance at Miller as he joins me in the store. To the man not trying to help me, I know he\u2019ll look perfectly composed, but I can see the brimming fury. He\u2019s not happy and I expect Mr My-Garments-Are-too-Posh-for-You will know about it very soon.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry, sir. Is the young lady with you?\u2019 I can see the surprise and it eats away all of the reassurance that Miller constantly fills me with. It\u2019s gone. I\u2019ll face this daily if I continue to try and immerse myself in Miller\u2019s world. I know I\u2019ll never leave him \u2013 not ever, not a chance \u2013 so it should be something that I must either learn to accept or learn to deal with better. I have copious amounts of sass for my uptight, part-time gentleman, but I seem to struggle on some occasions beyond that. Like now.</p><p>Miller\u2019s arm slips around my waist and pulls me closer. I can feel the tightness of his strung-out muscles, and panic makes me want to remove him from the store before they release and knock this old guy on his plump arse. \u2018Would it matter if she wasn\u2019t?\u2019 Miller asks tightly.</p><p>The man shifts and shuffles in his tweed, laughing nervously. \u2018I thought I was being helpful,\u2019 he insists.</p><p>\u2018You weren\u2019t,\u2019 Miller retorts. \u2018She was shopping for me, not that it should matter.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course!\u2019 Stout Man gives Miller a quick appraisal, nodding his approval before carefully pulling down a white shirt. \u2018I believe we have much that you would find appealing, sir.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Probably.\u2019 Miller shifts his hand to my neck and starts rubbing that reassurance back into me. He never fails. I\u2019m warm and feeling less exposed to the demeaning words that have been directed at me, despite him being perfectly polite in his insult. Miller steps forward and runs a fingertip over the luxury material of the shirt, humming his approval. I watch him cautiously, still sensing those coiled muscles and knowing for damn sure that that hum of approval was entirely fake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Wonderful piece,\u2019 the assistant says proudly.</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ.\u2019 Miller returns to my side. \u2018And it could be made of the finest material money could buy, but I wouldn\u2019t buy it from you.\u2019 I\u2019m turned by a gentle flex of his hold. \u2018Good day, sir.\u2019 We exit the store, leaving a dumbfounded man with a lovely white shirt hanging from his limp hands. \u2018Fucking prick,\u2019 Miller spits, pushing me onward.</p><p>I keep my mouth shut. I can\u2019t even locate the need to be annoyed that I haven\u2019t managed to get Miller interested in some casual clothes, and after that scene, my determination should be stronger. But I never want to face another confrontation such as that, not just because it was humiliating, but also because of my lingering worry about Miller\u2019s temper. He looked feral, bordering on becoming that frightening creature who takes leave of his senses and doesn\u2019t seem able to control himself.</p><p>I\u2019m marched down the street, my heart sinking with each step we take when it becomes apparent that we\u2019re heading for his car. That\u2019s it? Our quality time together consisted of a reality check in a posh clothes store? Disappointed doesn\u2019t cover it.</p> <p>We arrive at Miller\u2019s Mercedes, where he places me neatly in the passenger seat. I watch silently with careful eyes, not daring to voice my discontent as he steams around the front of the car and throws himself into the driver\u2019s side.</p><p>I\u2019m nervous.</p><p>He\u2019s pissed off.</p><p>I\u2019m silent.</p><p>He\u2019s breathing erratically.</p> <p>The anger seems to be intensifying rather than dulling. I\u2019m struck stupid, not knowing what to say or do. He slams the key into the ignition on a hiss, turns it, and revs the engine so hard I think the car might blow up. Sinking further into my seat, I start toying with my ring.</p><p>\u2018Fuck!\u2019 he roars, smashing his fist into the centre of the steering wheel. The punch alone startles me, making me fly back in my seat, but the horn sounding off drags out my alarm. That nasty fear bolts through my speeding heart, but I keep my eyes on my lap. I can\u2019t look at him. I know what I\u2019ll see and Miller\u2019s rage isn\u2019t a pretty sight.</p><p>It seems like for ever before the echo of the horn fades to nothing, leaving a ringing in my ears, and it\u2019s even longer before I find the courage to glimpse at him. His forehead is resting on the steering wheel, his palms gripping the circle of leather, and his back is rising and falling erratically.</p><p>\u2018Miller?\u2019 I say quietly as I lean forward a fraction, cautious, but I soon retreat when his palms lift and smash back down on another shout. He flings his body back into the seat, falls silent for a few, long moments, and then he yanks at the handle of the door, getting out and slamming it behind him. \u2018Miller!\u2019 I shout as he paces away from the car. \u2018Shit!\u2019 He\u2019s going back to the shop! I blindly feel for the door handle, watching his long legs eat up the pavement, but then I halt my frenzied grappling when he comes to a sudden standstill and his hands fly into his hair. I\u2019m frozen, weighing up the merits of trying to calm him down. I don\u2019t relish the thought. Not at all. My heart continues to clatter in my chest, threatening to break free as I wait for his next move, praying he doesn\u2019t push onward because there isn\u2019t a chance on earth that I can stop him from doing whatever he intends to do.</p><p>My whole being relaxes a tad when I see his arms drop, and a little more when I see his head fall back on his shoulders, looking up to the heavens. He\u2019s calming down, letting rationality push through the fuzz of rage. I swallow and follow his steps to a nearby wall, then relax even more on an inward sob when his palms meet the bricks and he braces himself, head dropped and his back rising and falling in a controlled, steady manner. He\u2019s taking deep breaths. My hands relax in my lap and my back against the leather seat as I watch quietly, leaving him undisturbed while he gathers himself. It doesn\u2019t take as long as I anticipated, and the relief that floods my seated form when he begins to straighten out his suit and hair is beyond comprehension. Enough air to fill a thousand balloons leaves my lungs on a thankful exhale. He\u2019s pulled it back, although why he lost it so badly in such a silly situation is beyond me.</p><p>After spending a few minutes ensuring he\u2019s presentable, Miller makes his way back to the car, opening the door calmly, sliding into the seat like liquid, calmly, and relaxing back in his seat, very calmly.</p> <p>I wait cautiously.</p><p>He thinks deeply.</p><p>Then he turns to me with tortured blues and takes both of my hands, bringing them to his lips and closing his eyes. \u2018I\u2019m so sorry. Forgive me, please.\u2019</p><p>A hint of a smile traces the edges of my lips at his plea and at his ability to revert from gentleman to madman to gentleman, all in the space of a few minutes. His temper is a worry that our relationship doesn\u2019t need. \u2018Why?\u2019 I ask simply, pulling his eyes open and up. \u2018That man wasn\u2019t trying to interfere. He wasn\u2019t driving a wedge between us or threatening our relationship.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ,\u2019 Miller counters quietly. My brow wrinkles at his claim, more so when he insists on me joining him on his side of the car by tugging me over. He\u2019s crumpled enough after his little flip-out, even though he\u2019s spent plenty of time ironing himself out again. I\u2019m positioned on his lap, my knees straddling his thighs, and my hands placed on his shoulders before he circles my waist with his palms. Drawing a deep breath, he firms up his grip of my waist and locks eyes with mine. They have lost their wildness and are now serious. \u2018He most certainly was driving a wedge between us, Livy.\u2019</p><p>I try to hold back my confusion but my face muscles let me down and I\u2019m awash with perplexity before I can retract it. \u2018How?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What were you thinking?\u2019</p><p>\u2018When?\u2019</p> <p>He sighs deeply, frustration starting to brim. \u2018When that pri\u2014\u2019 He snaps his mouth shut and rethinks his words before continuing. \u2018When that undesirable gentleman was speaking to you, what were you thinking?\u2019</p><p>I catch his drift immediately. He really doesn\u2019t want to know what I was thinking. It\u2019ll make him mad again, so I shrug, dropping my eyes and keeping my mouth firmly sealed. I\u2019m not risking it.</p><p>Miller lightly digs into my flesh with a flex of his fingertips. \u2018Don\u2019t deprive me of that face, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You know what I was thinking.\u2019 I refuse to look at him.</p><p>\u2018Please look at me when we\u2019re talking.\u2019</p><p>I take my eyes straight to his. \u2018I f**king hate your manners sometimes.\u2019 I\u2019m cranky because he\u2019s nailed me and my thought process, and I\u2019m thrilled because his soft lips are batting off the threat of a smile at my sass.</p><p>\u2018What were you thinking?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why do you want me to say it?\u2019 I ask. \u2018What point are you trying to prove?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, I\u2019ll say it. I\u2019ll explain why I very nearly returned to teach that man some manners.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Go on, then,\u2019 I goad.</p><p>\u2018Every time someone makes you unhappy or speaks to you in such a way, it makes you overthink. You know how I feel about overthinking.\u2019 He nudges me again, reinforcing his point.</p><p>\u2018Yes, I know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And my gorgeous, sweet girl already overthinks too much all on her own.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, I know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So when these people get your lovely little mind racing further, I get mad because you start doubting us.\u2019</p><p>I narrow my eyes on him, but I can\u2019t deny it. He\u2019s one hundred per cent right. \u2018Yes, I know.\u2019 My teeth are clenched.</p><p>His voice drops. \u2018And that heightens the risk of you leaving me. You\u2019ll conclude these people are right and leave me. So, yes, they are driving a wedge between us. They are interfering, and when it comes to people poking their noses into our relationship, then I have something to say about it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You have more than something to say!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I concur.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, that\u2019s a relief.\u2019</p><p>He frowns. \u2018What is?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your agreement.\u2019 I remove my hands from his shoulders and lean back against the steering wheel, keen to put as much distance between us as possible. It\u2019s hardly worth it, in all honesty. \u2018I think you need anger management or therapy or something.\u2019 I blurt it all before I can chicken out. Then I brace myself for his scoff.</p><p>But it doesn\u2019t come. In fact, he laughs a little. \u2018Olivia, enough people have intruded on my life. I\u2019m not going to invite a stranger in to interfere some more.\u2019</p><p>\u2018They won\u2019t interfere. They\u2019ll help.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ.\u2019 He gazes at me fondly, like I\u2019m naive. \u2018I\u2019ve been there. I think it was concluded that I\u2019m beyond help.\u2019</p><p>My heart dies a little. He\u2019s already tried therapy? \u2018You\u2019re not beyond help.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re right,\u2019 he answers, surprising me and filling me with hope. \u2018All the help I need is sitting on my lap.\u2019</p><p>My optimism is sucked up in a second. \u2018So you behaved like a loon before you met me?\u2019 I ask doubtfully, already knowing that he\u2019s never touched rage like he has since I\u2019ve been in his perfect life. That little line of thought is laughable. Perfect life? No, Miller tries to make it perfect by keeping everything surrounding him perfect \u2013 namely his appearance and his possessions, and given that it has been established that I am also one of Miller\u2019s possessions, then that means me, too. And that\u2019s the problem. I\u2019m not perfect. I\u2019m not impeccably dressed or impeccably mannered, and it\u2019s sending my finicky Miller and his perfectness spiralling into chaos. I\u2019m all the help he needs? He\u2019s putting an obscene amount of pressure on my shoulders.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m a loon now?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your temper really isn\u2019t something to toy with,\u2019 I say quietly, remembering Miller delivering those words and now appreciating his warning fully.</p><p>His palm slips around my neck and pulls me gently forward until we\u2019re forehead to forehead. He\u2019s already distracted me from my undesirable thoughts with his touch on my skin and his eyes stuck to mine, but I can tell that I\u2019m about to be distracted further. \u2018I\u2019m madly fascinated by you, Olivia Taylor.\u2019 He ensures our eyes hold. \u2018You fill my dark world with light and my hollow heart with feelings. I\u2019ve persistently informed you that I\u2019ll never go down easily.\u2019 Soft lips meld to mine and we share the most incredibly soft, slow kiss. \u2018I\u2019m not prepared to be immersed constantly in that darkness again. You are my habit. Just mine. I need only you.\u2019</p><p>On an agreeable sigh and a happy skip of my heart, I encase Miller in my hold and spend a few blissful moments expressing my understanding. And he accepts. The fluidity of our joined mouths yanks me from the harsh reality we\u2019re faced with and puts me firmly back into Miller\u2019s realm, where comfort, anxiety, safety and danger all conflict with one another. In Miller\u2019s eyes, everyone is trying to interfere, and sadly he is probably right. I\u2019ve taken the day off work under Miller\u2019s instruction so we can spend some quality time together after yesterday\u2019s diabolical events and this morning\u2019s fright. He\u2019s trying to repair the mess of the past couple of days, and I need no one to interfere \u2013 not just today, but ever.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve cleared that up,\u2019 Miller mumbles, nibbling at my lips. He pulls his head back and leaves me a worked-up pile of hormones on his lap. Hot. Wanton. Blinded by perfection. \u2018Let\u2019s be on our way.\u2019 My lithe body is transferred to the passenger seat with care before he starts the engine and pulls into the traffic.</p><p>\u2018Where are we going?\u2019 I ask, the disappointment of our day being cut too short still rife.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer, instead twiddling a few buttons on his steering wheel, prompting the Stone Roses to join us in the car. I smile, rest back in my chair while humming to \u2018Waterfall\u2019, and let him take me wherever he likes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>I look up at the posh windows of Harrods, remembering my last visit here with Nan. I remember Cassie. And I remember a pink silk tie cascading down Miller\u2019s chest. All are things I\u2019d like to forget, and I groan my annoyance at the reminders. But I\u2019m ignored, and Miller slips from the car and rounds it to collect me. He opens the door and offers his hand, and I let my eyes slowly climb up his body until my exasperated gaze settles on his contented one. He flashes me an expectant look as his hand thrusts forward in prompt. \u2018Chop-chop.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve changed my mind,\u2019 I say coolly, ignoring his demand for my hand. \u2018Let\u2019s get something to eat.\u2019 I may win with this diversion because with all of the palaver at the previous shop, Miller hasn\u2019t fulfilled his insistence for me to eat yet. And I can think of nothing worse than assisting Miller in buying more masks.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ll eat soon.\u2019 My hand is claimed and I\u2019m pulled from the car before he transfers his hold to my nape. \u2018I don\u2019t plan on this taking long.\u2019</p> <p>Optimism gushes into my unenthusiastic mind as I\u2019m led into the store, where I immediately feel overwhelmed by the hustle and bustle and flurry of activity. \u2018It\u2019s so busy,\u2019 I moan, following Miller\u2019s purposeful strides. My gripe is brushed off as we weave through the masses of shoppers, mostly tourists.</p><p>\u2018You wanted to shop,\u2019 Miller reminds me, coming to a stop at the men\u2019s fragrance counter.</p><p>\u2018Would you like any help, sir?\u2019 a painted lady asks, smiling brightly. She\u2019s definitely checking him out. It makes me even grumpier.</p><p>\u2018Tom Ford, original,\u2019 Miller orders shortly.</p><p>\u2018Certainly.\u2019 She indicates the shelf behind her. \u2018Would sir like the fifty or the hundred millilitres?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Hundred.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Would you like a tester?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I would,\u2019 I cut in, moving closer to the counter. \u2018Please.\u2019 I smile and watch her eyebrows rise in surprise before she spritzes some onto a card and hands it to me. \u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Most welcome.\u2019</p><p>I hold the card to my nose and sniff. And very nearly die of pleasure. It\u2019s like Miller has been bottled. \u2018Hmmm.\u2019 My eyes close and I keep the card to my nose. Heaven.</p> <p>\u2018Good?\u2019 he whispers in my ear, his closeness adding to my delighted sense of smell.</p><p>\u2018Out of this world,\u2019 I say quietly. \u2018It smells just like you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Or I smell like that,\u2019 Miller corrects me as he hands a credit card to the women, whose eyes are now bouncing back and forth between us. She runs the transaction through and smiles as she hands the bag over to me. It\u2019s a fake smile.</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 I accept it, finally relenting and removing the fragranced card from my nose, popping it in the bag. Then I claim Miller\u2019s hand. \u2018Have a good day.\u2019</p><p>He leads me away to the escalators, Miller choosing to walk the stairs instead of letting them carry us to the top.</p><p>We leave the escalator and Miller fights our way through more people, guiding us onto another set of stairs, and then through more people and departments.</p><p>I\u2019m all disorientated, the buzz of activity and the twists and turns through the giant store sending me dizzy. I\u2019m just following Miller\u2019s lead, gazing around blankly while he strides on with purpose, clearly knowing exactly where he wants to be. This doesn\u2019t sit well. If I see a suit, I might rip it up.</p><p>\u2018Here we are.\u2019 He stops on the threshold of an area designated for men and drops my grasp, sliding his hands into his pockets. My eyes widen at the array of clothes before me. Heaps of them. Things are jumping out already, my legs eager to take me off in one direction, but then my eyes spot something else I quite fancy and halt me. There\u2019s too much.</p> <p>And it\u2019s predominantly casual.</p><p>His breath hits my ear. \u2018I believe this is what you are looking for.\u2019</p><p>Happiness and exhilaration sail through me and I turn to look up at him, finding a satisfied glimmer in his brilliant blue eyes. \u2018You must be soaring in your second favourite pleasure,\u2019 I tell him, because I\u2019m beside myself with glee. He\u2019s going to let me dress him. He\u2019s like a human clothes-horse, every inch of his physique just perfect and ready for me to grace it with something other than a three-piece suit.</p><p>\u2018Indeed I am,\u2019 he confirms, making me want to squeal in excitement when he scrambles my elation further by smiling.</p><p>I hold my breath to stop the screech of joy and grab his hand. Then I practically haul him through the department, my eyes darting everywhere, looking for perfect casual pieces to dress my perfect Miller in.</p><p>\u2018Livy!\u2019 he gasps in alarm as he virtually staggers along behind me. But I don\u2019t stop. \u2018Olivia!\u2019 He\u2019s laughing now, and that does snap me out of my dogged march through Harrods, having me flying around to catch a glimpse of it.</p><p>I nearly pass out at the sight . . . nearly. My wooziness is an improvement on bursting into tears. \u2018Oh shit, Miller,\u2019 I whisper, my hand gliding across the back of my neck and stroking . . . soothing . . . doing what Miller usually does. I\u2019m missing it. I\u2019m like a kid in a candy shop with too many appealing things surrounding me \u2013 Miller smiling, Miller laughing, and an abundance of casual wear to dress him in. I\u2019m getting all confused by it, not knowing whether to soak up the pleasure of seeing Miller so animated or drag him into the dressing rooms before he changes his mind.</p><p>His face gets closer to mine, his eyes still shimmering and his lips still stretched into a smile. It leaves me with my usual dilemma.</p><p>Eyes or mouth.</p><p>\u2018Earth to Olivia.\u2019 He speaks softly, displaying enjoyment at my muddled state. \u2018Do you need my thing?\u2019 His delicate touch ghosts my pale cheek, and I nod for fear of wailing on him again. I feel emotional, which is stupid. He\u2019s making me happy, even if a fraction of the reason why we\u2019re here is guilt because of his outburst at the previous store.</p><p>Miller holds my eyes with his as he moves in closer until his scent drowns me and his nose is nuzzling my cheek. Then he presses the firmness of his body into me and slowly lifts me from my feet and moves his nuzzle into my neck. I cling on tightly. Very tightly. And so does he.</p><p>We remain entwined, lost in each other\u2019s embrace, right in the middle of Harrods, and neither of us is bothered by any potential observers. I suddenly don\u2019t care so much for trying to strip down Miller\u2019s suit-clad fa\u00e7ade. I want him to take me home, put me in his bed, and worship me.</p><p>\u2018I said I didn\u2019t want to be long,\u2019 he whispers into my neck, still holding on to me securely.</p><p>\u2018Hmmm.\u2019 I muster the strength from somewhere to release him and find my feet. \u2018Thank you.\u2019 I spend a few seconds brushing down the sleeves of his suit while he watches me.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t ever thank me, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll always be grateful for you.\u2019 I finish up with my smoothing hands and step back. He\u2019s brought me back to life, even if that life is questionable and stressful. But I have my fastidious part-time gentleman and his perfect, precise world now.</p><p>Superb shoes appear in my downcast vision, prompting my eyes to flip up to his. He\u2019s still smiling, but it\u2019s subsided a little. \u2018You have thirty minutes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Right!\u2019 I snap from my thoughtfulness and immediately stride off towards a wall of shelves with piles and piles of jeans filling them. Miller in jeans just seems . . . weird, but I\u2019m desperate to see the back of those suits, or at least reduce their appearances. And the potential of his perfect arse encased in perfect denim is far too appealing to resist. I scan the tags that describe the fit of each style and finally snatch down a stonewash pair that claim to be a relaxed fit. Which sounds perfect. \u2018Here.\u2019 I turn as I shake them out, trying to gauge the size. The legs of these are way too short for Miller\u2019s long, lean limbs. I quickly fold them back up and swap them for a longer leg. \u2018There.\u2019 I hold them up against my front, smiling to myself when I have to raise the waist to the base of my chest just to get the hem of the legs off the floor. \u2018These should fit.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Would you like to know my size?\u2019 he asks, pulling my stare from the blue denim to the blue of his smiling eyes. They\u2019re nearly a perfect match.</p><p>My lips press together and I make a quick scan of his physique.</p><p>\u2018This body should be carved onto that lovely mind of yours, Livy.\u2019 His voice is low, seductive, and sexy as sin.</p><p>\u2018It is\u2019 \u2013 I shuffle on the spot \u2013 \u2018but I couldn\u2019t put numbers on it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Those are perfect.\u2019 He takes them from my hands and gives the garment a dubious look. \u2018And what would my gorgeous girl have me wear with them?\u2019</p><p>I grin at his willingness to humour me and pivot, spotting a T-shirt across the way. \u2018That.\u2019 I point and watch from the corner of my eye as Miller follows my gesture.</p><p>\u2018That?\u2019 he questions, a hint of alarm in his tone.</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 I wander over and unhook the faded, vintage-look T-shirt from the rail. \u2018Plain, casual, laid-back.\u2019 I hold it up. \u2018Perfect.\u2019</p><p>He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s perfect at all, but he still joins me and takes it from my hand. \u2018Feet?\u2019</p><p>I glance around on a frown. \u2018Where\u2019s the shoe department?\u2019</p><p>A heavy sigh engulfs my hearing. \u2018I\u2019ll show you.\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s a strain for him, but I\u2019m utterly stunned by his willingness, not that I\u2019ll show it. Right now, I\u2019m in my element. \u2018Lead the way.\u2019 I swoop my hand out on a grin and immediately follow him when he strides off. My hands are twitching at my sides, desperate to grab a few more items on our travels, but I know this is taking all of his patience and the risk of him running out of it deters me. One step at a time.</p><p>I watch Miller with interest as we pass through another department, this one bursting at the seams with suits. They\u2019re everywhere, teasing him, and it takes everything in me not to laugh when I catch him having a cheeky peek. \u2018Ralph Lauren does some exquisite suits,\u2019 he remarks quietly, forcing himself to push on.</p><p>\u2018He also does lovely casual wear,\u2019 I counter, knowing Miller wouldn\u2019t know that.</p><p>\u2018Miller!\u2019 The high-pitched shrill eats away at the flesh on my shoulders and when I turn to see an annoyingly preened woman approaching, a sour expression replaces my happy face. She\u2019s glowing, hurrying her steps to make it to him faster. She\u2019s near-on perfect, just like the rest of them, all shiny hair, flawless make-up, and expensive clothes. I\u2019m bracing myself for another reality check. I immediately hate her.</p><p>\u2018How are you?\u2019 she sings at him, not giving me a second glance. No, her attention is rooted on my perfect Miller. \u2018You look as dashing as always.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Bethany,\u2019 Miller greets, flat and cold, all evidence of the ease that was delighting me disappearing in a flash of red lips and perfectly styled hair. \u2018I\u2019m very well, thank you. Yourself?\u2019</p><p>She pouts her lips and transfers her weight onto one hip, tilting her body to the side. Her body language is throwing off vibes of attraction left, right, and full-force centre. \u2018Always well, you know that.\u2019</p><p>I roll my eyes and bite my tongue, wilting on the inside. Another one. Now she just needs to spot me and finish me off with one of those looks or the delivery of some mocking words. And if she pulls out one of his cards, I won\u2019t be held responsible for my actions.</p><p>\u2018Excellent,\u2019 he replies, short and sharp, despite being perfectly polite. I can sense his restlessness, all of the signs of Miller and his need to repel people surfacing, and it\u2019s in this moment that I wonder why these women are so taken by him when he can be so hostile. He\u2019s a perfect gentleman on dates \u2013 he said so himself \u2013 but what\u2019s the pull beyond that? How would they respond to him if he were to bless them with his worshipping ways? I inwardly laugh. They\u2019d be like me. Non-functioning without him. Doomed. Dead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Miller clears his throat and shifts the clothes in his hands. \u2018We\u2019ll be on our way,\u2019 he says, sidestepping Bethany, obviously expecting me to follow, but when I feel a pair of inquisitive eyes land on me, I\u2019m unable to convince my legs to move. Here it comes.</p><p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 she breathes, running interested eyes down the full length of me. \u2018Looks like someone beat me to him today.\u2019 My mouth drops open and she smiles, clearly unperturbed by my affronted state. \u2018I\u2019m sorry, you are?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m going to tell her exactly who I am. Accept it or learn to deal with it better. Those are my options. I have sass, that\u2019s been confirmed, and I need to start using it wisely. This woman, just like the rest of them, makes me feel inferior, yet Miller isn\u2019t showing signs of anger at the potential of this woman driving a wedge between us or making me doubt my worthiness. \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Oli\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sorry, we\u2019re late,\u2019 Miller cuts me off, just when I\u2019ve located my sass and am about to unleash it. \u2018Always a pleasure.\u2019 He nods at Bethany, who now looks really interested, and gently pushes into my back rather than take his customary hold of my neck.</p> <p>\u2018Oh, it is,\u2019 Bethany purrs. The rigidity that dominates Miller\u2019s entire being is instant. \u2018Hope to see you soon.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m pushed away fast, both of us silent, the tension palpable. Always a pleasure. I bristle on the inside and out. We round a corner, arriving at the men\u2019s shoe department, and Miller immediately grabs the first pair in sight and presents them to me. I don\u2019t look. Bethany has undone all of our progress this morning. \u2018These?\u2019 He\u2019s desperately trying to divert me. It won\u2019t work. The sass I was about to hit that woman with is now bubbling, a bit of anger mixing in for good measure, and there\u2019s only one other person to release it on.</p><p>I bat the shoes away. \u2018No.\u2019</p><p>He recoils, eyes wide and perfect lips slightly agape. \u2018I beg your pardon?\u2019</p><p>My eyes narrow into angry slits. \u2018Don\u2019t start with the begging,\u2019 I warn. \u2018She was a client. Could she be following me?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No.\u2019 He almost laughs.</p><p>\u2018Why didn\u2019t you just let me introduce myself? And why didn\u2019t you put her straight?\u2019</p><p>Miller places the shoe carefully back onto the display stand and even tweaks the damn thing into position before stepping into me thoughtfully. My body\u2019s response is irritating and unwanted, but a given. \u2018I\u2019ve told you before, I don\u2019t want anyone interfering, so the fewer people who know, the better.\u2019 The pad of his index finger brings my tense chin up to his dark stubbled face. I can see annoyance hovering on the edges of his beauty. \u2018When I say there is only us \u2013 no me or you \u2013 I also mean no them.\u2019</p><p>However tempting an existence with only me and Miller is, it\u2019s also impossible. \u2018How many are there?\u2019 I ask. I need to know how many of them I have to face. I need a tick sheet, something to mark them all off as I\u2019m confronted with them. How many will predict his next move? How many will follow me?</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s of no importance\u2019 \u2013 he slides his palm over my shoulder and starts massaging some calm into me \u2013 \u2018because now there is only my sweet girl.\u2019 His sincerity creeps into me, chasing my doubts away.</p><p>Leave it.</p> <p>Gathering myself, I find no words in reply, so I grab a boot from a nearby table. \u2018These,\u2019 I announce, not giving Miller the chance to refuse and handing it straight to an assistant instead.</p><p>She smiles, her back straightening when she captures her first look of Miller. \u2018Yes, madam. Size?\u2019 She keeps her greedy eyes on him, unwittingly goading me. I\u2019d love to tell her what size, but I\u2019m devastated to have to turn to Miller to ask.</p><p>\u2018Eleven,\u2019 he says quietly, regarding me closely. I hate the inward gasp of delight that emanates from the sales assistant, and I hate myself for rising to her clear interest.</p><p>I step in front of Miller and turn annoyed eyes onto her. \u2018An eleven,\u2019 I confirm, nodding at the shoe. \u2018And it\u2019s true what they say.\u2019 I\u2019m stunned by my blatant suggestion, and Miller\u2019s shocked cough behind me tells me he is, too. But I don\u2019t care. Today has been far from quality time, and all the interference is beginning to piss me off.</p><p>\u2018Certainly!\u2019 The shop assistant jumps at the decibel level of her own voice, avoiding my eyes and fighting a furious blush. \u2018Please, take a seat. I\u2019ll be right back.\u2019 She\u2019s off without delay, no swaying arse or coy look over her shoulder in sight. I grin to myself, getting a satisfied thrill from the discomfort I\u2019ve caused while making a mental promise to maintain this sass.</p><p>\u2018I have a request.\u2019 Miller\u2019s whisper in my ear wipes my smugness clean from my face. I don\u2019t want to confront him, but I\u2019m given little choice when my shoulders are clasped and I\u2019m turned in his hold. I brace myself, knowing what I\u2019ll find. I\u2019m right. He\u2019s expressionless with a familiar hint of disapproval in his eyes.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 All satisfaction has been drawn from my body by the condemnation leaking from Miller in droves. I\u2019ve overstepped the mark.</p><p>His hands slide into his pockets. \u2018What\u2019s true and who says it?\u2019</p> <p>My lips stretch to the point of ripping. \u2018You know what and who.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Elaborate,\u2019 he orders, not returning my delight.</p><p>It makes me grin harder. \u2018In Harrods?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well\u2019 \u2013 I shift and quickly scan our surroundings, seeing too many shoppers in close proximity to speak of such a thing \u2013 \u2018I\u2019ll tell you later.\u2019 He\u2019s doing this on purpose. He knows.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 He moves in, bringing his chest to mine, breathing down on me. \u2018I\u2019d like to know now. I feel in the dark.\u2019 If he\u2019s struggling to maintain his seriousness, then he\u2019s not showing it. He\u2019s perfectly composed, even grave.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re playing.\u2019 I step back, but he\u2019s having none of it and closes the small space that I\u2019ve created.</p><p>\u2018Tell me.\u2019</p><p>Damn him. I search deep for my sass and piece together an explanation on an embarrassed whisper. \u2018Feet and a male\u2019s\u2019 \u2013 I cough \u2013 \u2018manhood.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What about them?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miller!\u2019 I fidget, feeling my cheeks heat under the pressure.</p><p>\u2018Tell me, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine!\u2019 I snap, reaching up on my tiptoes to push my mouth to his ear. \u2018Big feet are said to equal big cocks.\u2019 My face flames as I feel his head nod thoughtfully against me, his hair tickling my cheek.</p><p>\u2018Is that so?\u2019 he asks, maintaining all seriousness. The bastard.</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Interesting,\u2019 he muses, then blows hot breath into my ear. It knocks me even more off-kilter and my stability fails me, sending me on a little stagger forward. I collide with his chest on a gasp. \u2018Okay there?\u2019 His tone is loaded with conceit.</p><p>\u2018Fine and dandy,\u2019 I mutter, forcing some strength into my weakness and pulling out of his chest.</p><p>\u2018Fine and dandy,\u2019 he muses quietly, a roving eye watching me struggling to compose myself. \u2018Oh look.\u2019 He nods over my shoulder, prompting me to turn. \u2018Here are my size elevens.\u2019</p><p>I chuckle to myself, earning a poke in the back by Miller and a puzzled look from the sales assistant. \u2018Elevens!\u2019 she sings, making my laughter cross the line into uncontrollable body spasms. \u2018You okay, miss?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 I yell, turning away and picking up the first shoe I can find, anything to distract me from the size elevens. I cough when I look at the size, seeing it stated in big, bold type that the shoe I\u2019ve chosen to distract myself with is, in fact, a size eleven also. I fold over on a titter and shove it back.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s fine,\u2019 Miller confirms. I\u2019m not looking at him, but I know he\u2019s staring at my back, appearing expressionless to the assistant, but he\u2019ll have that playful twinkle in his eyes. If I could face Miller and the flirty assistant without snorting all over them, then I\u2019d be swivelling fast to catch the wonderful sight. But I can\u2019t stop laughing, my shoulders bouncing violently.</p><p>Studying the random shoe carefully, grinning like an idiot, I listen to the crumpling of tissue paper as the assistant removes the boots from the box. \u2018Do you need a shoehorn, sir?\u2019 she asks.</p><p>\u2018Doubt it,\u2019 Miller grumbles, probably inspecting the boots and mentally complaining about their lack of leather soles. I pull it together and rotate slowly, finding Miller sitting on a suede seat, wrestling his foot into a boot. Observing quietly, as does the assistant, I think how lovely the boots are, all casual in soft, worn brown leather.</p><p>\u2018Comfy?\u2019 I ask hopefully, bracing myself for his scoff, but he ignores me and stands, looking down at his feet before hastily returning to sitting.</p><p>He undoes the laces and places the boot neatly back in the box. I want to scream my excitement when I see him shift it, making the pair as neat as possible amid the tissue paper. He likes them, and I know that for sure because he has an appreciation for his possessions and those boots are now his possession. \u2018They\u2019ll do,\u2019 he says to himself, like he doesn\u2019t want to admit it out loud.</p><p>My grin is back. He will concede, damn him. \u2018Do. You. Like?\u2019</p><p>Tying his laces with the utmost care, he turns his face up and studies me. \u2018Yes.\u2019 He draws the word out with raised brows, daring me to make a big deal of it.</p><p>I can\u2019t hide my happiness. I know it, Miller knows it, and when I grab the box, then turn and thrust it into the assistant\u2019s hand with a huge smile, she knows it, too. \u2018We\u2019ll take them, thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wonderful, I\u2019ll place them behind the counter.\u2019 She\u2019s off with the box, leaving Miller and me alone.</p><p>I scoop up the jeans and T-shirt. \u2018Let\u2019s try these on.\u2019 His sigh of tiredness won\u2019t make me give in. Nothing will. I\u2019ll get him kitted out in a casual outfit if it kills me. \u2018This way.\u2019 I march off in the direction of the changing rooms, knowing Miller is following because my skin is alight with the signs of his close proximity.</p><p>I turn and hand him the clothes, then watch as he takes them without a word of complaint and disappears into the changing room. I take a seat to watch the hustle and bustle of Harrods, spotting every walk of life: the tourists; the people here to treat themselves, like Nan and her fifteen-quid pineapple; and the people who clearly shop here on a regular basis, like Miller and his bespoke suits. The mix is eclectic and so is the stock. There\u2019s something for everyone; no one leaves empty-handed, even if it\u2019s a simple tin of Harrods biscuits that they\u2019ll give as a special gift or save for Christmas. I smile, then whip my head around when I hear a familiar cough.</p><p>My smile widens into silly territory at the sight of his expression, stressed and challenged \u2013 then falls away when I cop a load of what\u2019s below his neck. He\u2019s standing barefoot in the doorway, jeans hanging low, a perfect fit, and his T-shirt clinging in all of the right places. I bite my lip to stop my mouth from falling open. Fucking hell, he looks too sexy. His hair is all ruffled from where he\u2019s pulled the T-shirt over his head, a flushed look on his cheeks from the stress of it, which is laughable. There\u2019s no buttons to neatly fasten or hem to tuck in, no belt to secure or tie to knot, no collar to arrange, making it a stress-free task.</p><p>Supposedly.</p><p>He looks stressed to breaking point. \u2018You look amazing,\u2019 I say quietly, taking a quick glimpse over my shoulder, finding what I knew I would: women at every turn staring, mouths agape at the otherworldly man before them. Closing my eyes on a calming suck of air, I leave the sight of the dozens of observers and confront my spectacular part-time gentleman. Miller adorned in the finest of fine suits is a sight to behold, but strip him bare of all of the exquisite cloth and throw him in some worn jeans and a plain T-shirt, then we\u2019re bordering unreal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He fidgets and pulls at the T-shirt and kicks his feet out, uncomfortable with the hems of the jeans. \u2018You look amazing, Olivia. I look like I\u2019ve been dragged through a hedge backwards.\u2019</p><p>I restrain my smirk, Miller\u2019s agitation giving me the strength to do so. I need to win him over, not irritate him further, so I move in slowly, watching as he notices me nearing. He stops fiddling and follows my path until I\u2019m looking up at him. \u2018I beg to differ,\u2019 I whisper, my eyes running all over his bristly face.</p><p>\u2018Why do you want me in these clothes?\u2019</p><p>His question brings our eyes together. I know why, but I can\u2019t articulate my answer so he\u2019ll understand. He won\u2019t get it, and I also run the risk of angering him. \u2018Because . . . I . . .\u2019 I stumble all over my words under his crowding frame. \u2018I . . .\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m not wearing these clothes if the reason is simply to make you feel better about us or if you think it\u2019ll change me.\u2019 He slides a palm onto my shoulder and rubs soothing strokes into my tense muscles. \u2018I\u2019m not wearing these clothes if you think it\u2019ll stop people interfering . . . looking . . . commenting.\u2019 His other hand rests on my other shoulder, his arms braced, his head dipping to hold our eyes level. \u2018It is me who is the unworthy one, Olivia. And you help me. Not the clothes. Why don\u2019t you see that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not finished,\u2019 he cuts me off, firming up his grip and drilling into me with warning eyes. I\u2019d be stupid to argue. His suit has gone, but this casual attire hasn\u2019t chased away his authority or powerful presence. And I\u2019m glad. I need that. \u2018Olivia, take me as I am.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do.\u2019 Guilt consumes me.</p><p>\u2018Then let me put my suit back on.\u2019 He\u2019s begging me with his absorbing blues, and for the first time ever, I realise that Miller\u2019s suits aren\u2019t just a mask; they are armour, too. He needs them. He feels safe in them. He feels in control in them. His perfect suits are a part of his perfect world and a perfect addition to my perfect Miller. I want him to keep them. I don\u2019t think forcing him to wear jeans will lighten him up in the least bit, and I wonder whether I even want him to lose his uptight demeanour. I understand him. It\u2019s of no consequence to me how he behaves in public, because for me, he\u2019s worshipful. Loving. My finicky fine Miller. It\u2019s me who\u2019s the issue here. My hang-ups. I need to get a grip.</p> <p>Nodding, I take the hem of his T-shirt and pull it over his head as he lifts his arms willingly. A mass of lean, cut flesh is revealed, drawing more attention from shoppers nearby, even the men, and I hand the crumpled T-shirt to the assistant, keeping my sorry eyes on Miller. \u2018It\u2019s not suitable,\u2019 I murmur. Miller smiles at me \u2013 a grateful smile that yanks painfully at my selfish, fallen heart.</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 he says softly, taking me in his arms and pressing me against his na**d chest. My cheek rests into a pec and I sigh, sliding my hands beneath his upper arms and holding him tightly.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t ever thank me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll always be thankful for you, Olivia Taylor.\u2019 He mimics my words and kisses my forehead. \u2018Always.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And me you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve cleared that up. Now, would you like to remove these jeans?\u2019</p> <p>I let my gaze fall to his thighs, a stupid move because I\u2019ve just been reminded of how incredible Miller looks in denim. \u2018No, you go.\u2019 I push him into the changing room, eager to deprive my eyes of the glorious vision, especially since it\u2019s quite apparent that I won\u2019t be seeing it again. \u2018I\u2019ll wait here.\u2019</p><p>Happy with myself, I take a seat, feeling a million eyes on me. From every direction. But I don\u2019t humour any of the onlookers and instead retrieve my phone from my bag . . . to be greeted with two missed calls and a text message from William. My body sags on an almighty groan. Facing interested stares is suddenly very appealing.</p><p>You\u2019re maddening, Olivia. I\u2019m sending a car for you this evening. 7 p.m. I presume you will be at Josephine\u2019s. William.</p><p>My neck retracts, as if taking my eyes further from the screen will change what the message says. It doesn\u2019t. Irritation consumes me and my thumb bashes over the touch screen automatically.</p><p>I\u2019m busy.</p><p>There. He\u2019ll send a car? Like hell he will, and I don\u2019t plan on being there anyway. Which prompts me to send another message.</p><p>I won\u2019t be there.</p><p>I don\u2019t need the curtains twitching and Nan\u2019s inquisitive nose pushed up against the glass. She\u2019ll fly into meltdown if she sniffs William out. His response is instant.</p> <p>Don\u2019t push me, Olivia. We need to talk about your shadow.</p><p>I gasp, recalling his vow when he walked out of Miller\u2019s apartment yesterday. How does he know? I spin my phone in my hand, thinking this is the ammo he needs to follow through on his threat. I\u2019m not confirming it, despite my overwhelming need to know how he knows, and just as I reach that decision, my phone starts ringing. I tense and automatically stab at the Reject button before I send him a quick text, telling him I\u2019ll call him later, hoping it\u2019ll buy me some time. I phone Nan to tell her that my battery is dying and I\u2019ll call her from Miller\u2019s, earning a rant about pointless mobile telephones. Then I turn my phone off.</p><p>\u2018Olivia?\u2019</p><p>I look up and feel all irritation and panic evaporate from my body at the sight of Miller restored to his normal, perfect, suit-adorned self. \u2018My phone\u2019s died,\u2019 I tell him, tossing it carelessly into my bag and standing. \u2018Lunch?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, let\u2019s eat.\u2019 My neck is grasped and we\u2019re on our way without delay, leaving behind a casual outfit that I love but don\u2019t care for now and a flurry of women reassessing Miller now that he\u2019s changed. They still like what they see, which is a given. \u2018Well, that\u2019s half an hour of our lives together that we\u2019ll never get back.\u2019</p><p>I hum my agreement, trying not to let my mind wander too much, yet appreciating that no matter how much I pray, William Anderson isn\u2019t going away, especially if he knows about my shadow.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s a good thing we\u2019re no longer limited to one night.\u2019</p><p>I gasp and twist my neck in his palm to see him. He\u2019s staring blankly forward, not a hint of irony on his face. \u2018I want more hours,\u2019 I murmur, seeing blues full of recognition flick down to me.</p><p>He dips and kisses my nose chastely before straightening and leading on. \u2018My sweet girl, you have a whole lifetime.\u2019</p><p>Happiness bombards me and I slip my arm around his waist, hugging his side, feeling his forearm rest against the top of my spine so that he can maintain his hold while accommodating my demand for closeness. The chaos of Harrods is no longer registering. Nothing is, except memories of a one-night proposition and all of the events that have led us here. My fallen heart bursts with happiness.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>I flap the fleece blanket and let it settle on the grass, visiting each corner to get it as straight as possible in the hopes of reducing any obsessive need that Miller may have to fix it. \u2018Sit.\u2019 I point on my command.</p><p>\u2018Whatever was wrong with a restaurant?\u2019 he asks, placing two M&amp;S carrier bags on the grass.</p><p>\u2018You can\u2019t picnic in a restaurant.\u2019 I watch him lower himself awkwardly to the ground, pulling the tails of his suit jacket from beneath his arse when he sits on them. \u2018Take your jacket off.\u2019</p><p>Blue eyes hit me, awash with shock. \u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll be more comfortable.\u2019 I drop to my knees and start pushing his jacket from his shoulders, encouraging him to pull his arms out. He doesn\u2019t complain or object, but he does watch worriedly while I fold it in half and lay it as neatly as possible at one end of the blanket. \u2018Better,\u2019 I conclude, grabbing the carrier bags. I ignore the slight twitching that Miller\u2019s body has developed. It requires no acknowledgment, because within a minute he\u2019ll be rearranging his jacket to fit his compulsive need, whether I acknowledge the issue or not. I could iron it into position and it would still be wrong. \u2018Would you like prawn or chicken?\u2019 I hold up two containers of salad, just catching him quickly yanking his eyes from his jacket.</p><p>He tries his damn hardest to look unbothered and unaffected, flicking an indifferent look at me and then signalling between the bowls with a casual flick of a hand. \u2018I really don\u2019t mind.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I like chicken.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then I\u2019ll have prawn.\u2019</p><p>I can see the muscles of his eyes pulling his blues in their sockets towards his jacket as I hand him the prawn salad. \u2018There\u2019s a fork in the lid.\u2019 I pop the lid of my salad and settle on my haunches, watching as he inspects the container.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s plastic?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, it\u2019s plastic!\u2019 I laugh, placing my bowl on the blanket and taking Miller\u2019s. I remove the lid, snap the fork into one, and plunge it in the array of salad and prawn. \u2018Enjoy.\u2019</p><p>He takes the bowl and has a little poke before taking a tentative mouthful and chewing slowly. He\u2019s like a science project. The need to study him in action is overwhelming. I follow his lead and take my own salad and fork, popping a forkful in my mouth. It\u2019s all done absent-mindedly, my desire to continue my engrossed examination of Miller too much to resist. I bet Miller Hart has never sat on his arse in Hyde Park. I bet he\u2019s never eaten a salad from a plastic container, and I bet he\u2019s never entertained the idea of disposable cutlery. It\u2019s all very fascinating \u2013 always has been, probably always will be.</p><p>\u2018I hope you\u2019re not overthinking.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m pulled so fast from my musing by Miller\u2019s declaration that I drop a lump of chicken into my lap. \u2018Shit!\u2019 I curse, scooping it up.</p><p>\u2018See,\u2019 Miller says, his tone full of smugness. \u2018That wouldn\u2019t happen in a restaurant and you\u2019d have a napkin.\u2019 He pops a forkful of lettuce in his mouth and chews smugly.</p><p>I glare at him, unamused, and reach for the bag, pulling out a handful of disposable napkins. With precision and on a sarcastic hum, I wipe up the mayo smearing my floral dress. \u2018Problem solved.\u2019 I screw up the paper and toss it to the side.</p><p>\u2018And a waiter would be available to clear our litter.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miller,\u2019 I sigh. \u2018Everyone should picnic in Hyde Park.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just because!\u2019 I point my fork at him. \u2018Stop looking for issues.\u2019</p><p>He snorts and rids his hands of his salad bowl, then moves stealthily towards his jacket. \u2018I\u2019m not looking. They are quite apparent without the need to search for them.\u2019 He collects his jacket and refolds it before placing it gently down. \u2018Seasoning?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Huh?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Seasoning.\u2019 He takes his place again, and his salad. \u2018What if I required some extra seasoning on this\u2019 \u2013 he glances down at the bowl doubtfully \u2013 \u2018meal.\u2019</p><p>I drop my bowl and collapse to my back in exasperation. The sky is blue and clear and I\u2019d usually be captured by it, but the pleasant view is being hampered by a mind crammed with frustration. A picnic. That\u2019s all.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong, sweet girl?\u2019 His face appears, hovering above me.</p><p>\u2018You!\u2019 I accuse. \u2018Quality time, that\u2019s what you said, and this could be it if you\u2019d stop being such a snob and enjoy the scenery, food and company.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I love the company.\u2019 He drops his mouth to mine and blindsides me with his worshipping, soft lips. \u2018I\u2019m merely pointing out the drawbacks of picnicking, the biggest drawback being unable to worship you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You couldn\u2019t do that in a restaurant.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ.\u2019 He cocks a suggestive eyebrow at me.</p><p>\u2018For being such a \u201cgentleman\u201d, sometimes your sexual etiquette is questionable.\u2019 I wince at my careless words, but Miller doesn\u2019t acknowledge them, choosing to nudge my thighs apart and cradle himself between them. I\u2019m stunned. He\u2019ll be a crumpled mess. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He clasps my cheeks and his nose meets mine. \u2018For a sweet girl, sometimes your sweetness is questionable. Give me my thing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll be all creased.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve asked once.\u2019</p><p>I smile and waste no time embracing Miller\u2019s momentary spontaneity and his body. Soaking up the weight of him, I inhale the fresh air that\u2019s diluted by his scent. My eyes close and I bliss out completely, finally relishing in the quality time that I\u2019ve been promised. He\u2019s warm and soothing and all mine, and as I start to zone out, the hustle and bustle of Hyde Park fading into a distant hum, thoughts start tickling the edges of my contented mind \u2013 tickling for a nanosecond, before something so stupidly obvious wraps around my entire brain, leaving no room for contentment and making my relaxed body solidify beneath Miller. He senses it, because probing eyes are gazing up at me in a heartbeat.</p> <p>\u2018Share with me,\u2019 he says simply, smoothing my hair from my face.</p><p>I shake my head in his hold, hoping to shake away my uninvited thoughts.</p><p>And fail.</p><p>Miller\u2019s face is close, but all I can see is a grubby, lost little boy. You can\u2019t tell me that the child in the photograph ate like a king, and I know for sure there were no expensive threads adorning his young body, more rags instead.</p><p>\u2018Olivia?\u2019 I detect concern in his tone. \u2018Please, share your burden with me.\u2019 There\u2019s no evading him, even less so when he pushes himself up to his knees and pulls me to mine. We\u2019re mirroring each other, our hands clasped and resting in his lap while he rubs gentle circles across my skin with his thumbs. \u2018Olivia?\u2019</p> <p>I make a point of holding his eyes when I speak, searching for any mild reaction to my question. \u2018Please tell me why everything needs to be so perfect.\u2019</p><p>There\u2019s nothing. No frown, no expression or telling signs in his eyes. He\u2019s perfectly composed. \u2018We\u2019ve had this discussion before, and I\u2019m certain we agreed that we\u2019d exhausted that subject.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, you told me that the subject was exhausted.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t exhausted at all, and now my horrible thought process is stamping all over my conclusions. He\u2019s ashamed of his upbringing. He wants to eradicate it all from his memory. He wants to hide it.</p><p>\u2018For good reason.\u2019 He drops my hands and looks away from me, searching for something to do other than face me and my pressing questions. He settles on messing with his suit jacket, smoothing the already immaculately folded garment.</p><p>\u2018And what is that reason?\u2019 My heart breaks when he glances at me out of the corner of his eye, caution on his handsome face. \u2018Miller, what is that reason?\u2019 I inch towards him slowly, as if approaching a frightened animal, and rest my hand on his forearm. He looks down, frozen in position, clearly in a muddle. I\u2019m patient. I\u2019ve drawn my conclusion, yet I\u2019m unable to share it with him. He\u2019ll know I\u2019ve snooped, and I want him to volunteer this information about his history. Share it with me.</p><p>It\u2019s merely seconds, but it feels like an eternity, before he shakes himself back to life and stands, leaving my hand falling to the blanket and my eyes looking up at him. He takes his jacket and slips it on, buttoning it fast before pulling at the sleeves. \u2018Because it was exhausted,\u2019 he says, insulting my intelligence with his pathetic brush-off. \u2018I need to go to Ice.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Right,\u2019 I sigh, and start to collect the remnants of our brief picnic, piling the rubbish into a carrier bag. \u2018Actually, no.\u2019 I toss the bag aside and stand, getting up close and personal with Miller\u2019s tall frame. I must look tiny and fragile next to him, but my resolve is huge. He\u2019s constantly demanding I share my burdens, yet he\u2019s happy to shoulder his own. \u2018I\u2019m not coming to Ice,\u2019 I say, drilling holes into him, knowing he won\u2019t go without me. Not after this morning. He wants to keep me close, which is fine by me, but not at Ice.</p><p>\u2018I beg to differ,\u2019 he snorts, but his tone is lacking its usual confidence and in an attempt to show he means business, he takes my neck and tries to turn me.</p><p>\u2018Miller, I said no!\u2019 I shrug him off, anger and frustration afflicting me, and hit him with burning eyes of determination. \u2018I\u2019m not coming.\u2019 I sit down again, kick my flip-flops off and collapse to my back, swapping the blue of Miller\u2019s eyes for the blue of the sky. \u2018I\u2019m going to enjoy some quiet time in the park. You can go to Ice alone.\u2019 I\u2019ll kick and scream if he tries to manhandle me.</p><p>I take my arms behind my head and keep my eyes on the sky, sensing him fidgeting over me. He doesn\u2019t know what to do. He loves my sass, supposedly. Bet he doesn\u2019t now. I settle in for the show, getting comfy, determined not to budge, and find my thoughts drifting back to what had my sass rearing its ugly head in the first place. Miller and his perfect world. My conclusion is simple, and it\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. He had a poor upbringing, with shabby rags for clothes, and now he\u2019s obsessive about wearing the finest threads he can buy.</p><p>How he came to have the money to buy the millions of suits of armour he possesses is irrelevant. Kind of. Not at all. My conclusion has only led to more questions \u2013 questions I dare not ask, not for fear of upsetting him, but for fear of what the answer might be. How did he come to be in \u2018this world\u2019? That house was a children\u2019s home. Miller has spoken of no parents and confirmed there is only him. He\u2019s an orphan. My fussy, fine, perfect Miller has been alone for ever. My heart\u2019s breaking for him.</p><p>I\u2019m so lost in my sobering thoughts I jump a little when a warm hardness is suddenly pressing into my side. My head falls to the side to find his eyes. He\u2019s snuggled right in and after laying a gentle kiss on my cheek, he rests his head on my shoulder and slides his arm over my stomach.</p><p>\u2018I want to be with you,\u2019 he whispers. His actions and his words have my arms relinquishing cushion duties for my head and wrapping around him where I can. \u2018Every minute of every day, I want to be with you.\u2019</p><p>My smile is sad, because having reached my assumption, I know that Miller hasn\u2019t had a someone before. \u2018Us,\u2019 I confirm, squeezing some comfort into him. \u2018I love your bones, Miller Hart.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018And I\u2019m deeply fascinated by you, Olivia Taylor.\u2019</p><p>I squeeze him harder. We lie on the fleece blanket for ever, Miller humming and painting pictures across my midriff with the tip of his finger, me just feeling him, listening to him, smelling him, and giving him his thing. It is quality time, and it\u2019s the most blissful quality time imaginable.</p><p>\u2018This has been nice,\u2019 he muses, pushing up onto his elbow, resting his perfectly stubbled chin in his palm. He continues to trace faint lines across my tummy, observing his tender motions thoughtfully. I\u2019m happy to watch him. It\u2019s unbelievably pleasurable, total heaven. We\u2019re captured in our own private moment, surrounded by the ramblings of Hyde Park and the distant chaos of London by day. Yet totally alone. \u2018Are you chilly?\u2019 He looks up at me, then skates his gaze down my little floral dress. The evening is drawing in and a light breeze is whipping up. I look up to the sky and note a few grey clouds slowly drifting over.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m okay, but it looks like rain is on its way.\u2019</p><p>Miller follows my eyes to the sky and sighs. \u2018And London casts its black shadow,\u2019 he muses to himself, so quietly I almost don\u2019t hear him. But I did hear him, and I know there\u2019s a deeper meaning to that statement. I draw breath to speak but think better of it, and he pushes himself to his feet before I can ask, anyway. \u2018Give me your hand.\u2019</p><p>I take his offering and let him pull me effortlessly to my feet. He\u2019s creased as hell, but apparently not too bothered by it. \u2018Can we do this again sometime?\u2019 I ask as I gather up our half-finished salads and place them in a bag.</p><p>Miller sets about folding the blanket into a tidy bundle. \u2018Of course,\u2019 he agrees gladly, with no trace of unwillingness. He really has enjoyed himself, and that warms my contented heart further. \u2018I really must stop by the club.\u2019 My delicate shoulders sag and Miller spots it. \u2018I\u2019ll be quick,\u2019 he assures me, moving in and dipping to brush our lips lightly. \u2018I promise.\u2019</p><p>Refusing to let anything more spoil our quality time, I link arms with him and let him walk us across the grass until we hit the pathway. \u2018Can I stay with you tonight?\u2019 I\u2019m feeling guilty for my regular absence from home, but I know Nan\u2019s not in the least bit bothered by it, and I\u2019ll call her as soon as we\u2019re back at Miller\u2019s.</p><p>\u2018Livy, you stay with me whenever you choose. You don\u2019t have to ask.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I shouldn\u2019t leave Nan alone.\u2019</p><p>He laughs lightly, pulling my eyes up his chest to his face. \u2018Your grandmother would put the most ferocious guard dog to shame.\u2019</p><p>I return his amusement and rest my head on his arm as we amble along. \u2018I concur.\u2019</p><p>A strong arm wraps around my shoulder and hugs me to his side. \u2018If you\u2019d prefer me to take you home, then I will.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But I want to stay with you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And I\u2019d love to have you in my bed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll call Nan as soon as we\u2019re back at your place,\u2019 I affirm, making a point to remember to ask her if she minds, even though I know for sure that she doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 he agrees on a little laugh.</p><p>\u2018Oh, there\u2019s a bin.\u2019 I rustle the bags in my hand and head over to the bin, but my stride falters when I spot a sorrowful-looking man slumped on the bench nearby. He looks tatty, dirty and vacant \u2013 one of the many homeless people who frequent the streets of London. My pace to the litter bin slows as I watch him twitching, and I conclude very quickly that drugs or alcohol are probably the cause. Human nature stokes the compassion within me, and when he raises empty eyes to mine, I stop walking completely. I stare at the man, who\u2019s probably barely a man \u2013 late teens, perhaps, but life on the streets has taken its toll. His skin is sallow, his lips dry.</p><p>\u2018Spare any change, miss?\u2019 he croaks at me, yanking tighter at my heartstrings. It\u2019s not uncommon to be asked such a question, and I usually find it reasonably easy to walk on by, especially since Nan reminds me every time that by lining their pockets with money, you\u2019re also probably funding their drug or drink habit. But this dishevelled young man with scruffy, ripped clothes and disintegrating sneakers is reminding me of something, and I can\u2019t seem to push my legs on.</p><p>After spending far too long staring at him, his open palm extends towards me, snapping me from my miserable thoughts and the flashbacks of a lost-looking child. \u2018Miss?\u2019 he repeats.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 I shake my head and continue, but as I lift the bag to drop it into the bin, a warm palm wraps around my wrist and holds it firm.</p><p>\u2018Wait.\u2019 Miller\u2019s low timbre strokes my skin and pulls my eyes to his. Without another word, he claims the bag and takes the two half-eaten salads out, then places the carrier in the rubbish bin before turning and striding over to the homeless man. I watch in astonished silence as Miller reaches him and drops to his haunches, handing the two bowls over, followed by the fleece blanket. Tentative hands accept Miller\u2019s offering and a heavy head nods its thanks. Tears pinch at the back of my eyes and very nearly fall when my perfect part-time gentleman lays a palm on the man\u2019s knee and rubs a reassuring circle into the dirty leg of his jeans. Miller\u2019s actions are delicate, caring and knowing. They are the actions of someone who understands. He\u2019s telling me his story slowly, but with no words. They are not needed. His actions speak volumes, and I\u2019m shocked by them, but most of all saddened.</p><p>That lost little boy was still lost.</p><p>Until I found him.</p><p>I watch closely as Miller rises to his full height and slips his hands into the pockets of his expensive suit trousers, then slowly turns to face me. He just stands there, regarding me carefully as I draw another gut-wrenching conclusion. An orphan? Homeless? I bite painfully on my lip, anything to prevent the threatening sorrow from gushing from my eyes at the sight of my beautifully broken man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Don\u2019t cry,\u2019 he murmurs, closing the distance between us.</p><p>I shake my head, feeling silly. \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>My forehead meets the crook under his chin when he\u2019s near enough, holding my distraught body up, and strong arms surround me in his safety. \u2018Give him money and he\u2019ll likely buy drugs, alcohol or cigarettes,\u2019 he tells me quietly. \u2018Give him food and a blanket, then he\u2019ll sate his hunger and keep warm.\u2019 He kisses the top of my head and breaks away from me, quickly wiping the stream of tears trailing down my cheeks. \u2018Do you know how many lost children there are on the streets of London, Olivia?\u2019</p><p>I shake my head a little.</p> <p>\u2018It\u2019s not all opulence and grandeur. This city is beautiful, but tainted by a dark underworld.\u2019</p><p>I absorb his quiet words, feeling ignorant and incredibly guilty. I know he speaks the truth. And I know because not only have I skimmed the edge of it, but also because Miller has been immersed in it his whole life.</p><p>His eyes remain focused on mine, a million messages passing between us. Him telling me. And me understanding. \u2018I\u2019ve had a wonderful afternoon, thank you.\u2019 He ghosts my eyebrow with his thumb and leans in to kiss my forehead.</p><p>\u2018Me too.\u2019</p><p>He smiles and takes his customary hold of my neck, turning me and taking us towards the exit of Hyde Park. \u2018We\u2019re going to get caught in the coming downpour if we\u2019re not careful,\u2019 he says, looking up to the sky.</p> <p>Following his indication, I see the grey clouds have now turned black, and then the huge splash of a fat raindrop on my cheek confirms that Miller is probably right. \u2018We\u2019d better run,\u2019 I say quietly. Miller\u2019s suit is already a pile of creases. Sodden material to boot will tip him over the edge.</p><p>And with that thought, the heavens open.</p><p>\u2018Oh shit!\u2019 I gasp as I\u2019m suddenly pelted with cold, giant raindrops. \u2018Bloody hell!\u2019 It\u2019s relentless, pounding the ground at our feet and splashing up our legs, the sound deafening.</p><p>\u2018Run!\u2019 Miller shouts, but I\u2019m so shocked by the sudden chilliness attacking me, I can\u2019t figure out if he\u2019s alarmed or laughing. But I do run. Fast. Miller grabs my hand and pulls me, and I look up through my wet hair to see his dark waves flattened against his head, water beads coating his face and emphasising his long, dark lashes.</p><p>The sight makes me stop dead in my tracks and causes Miller to lose grip of my wet hand, our skin slipping apart. He skids to a halt and turns the most incredibly bright blues onto me. \u2018Olivia, come on.\u2019 He\u2019s saturated, wet through, totally drowned. He looks obscenely handsome, if a little panicked.</p><p>\u2018Kiss me,\u2019 I demand, remaining static, ignoring the pounding of rain that\u2019s now making my flesh numb from the cold.</p> <p>His stunning brow furrows. It makes me smile. \u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I said kiss me!\u2019 I shout over the thundering rain, wondering if he really didn\u2019t catch it.</p><p>He laughs a little, widening his stance, and then casts his eyes around us and relaxes in his standing pose. I keep my eyes on him. Nothing will pull them away. I wait for Miller to absorb our surroundings, now unbothered and unaffected by the relentless rain.</p><p>It\u2019s only a few moments before glimmering blue eyes return to me.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t make me ask again,\u2019 I warn, and then take the longest inhale of breath when he strides towards me, conviction and a ton of pure, raw love overflowing from his mesmerising orbs. He lifts me up, squeezes me to his wet suit, and takes me dramatically. His palm slides to the back of my head to hold me in place and my legs part and find their way around his waist. It\u2019s a no-holds-barred, passionate kiss \u2013 full of want, lust, adoration, and comfort, and it signifies everything I feel for Miller Hart.</p><p>Our wet lips slip across each other with ease, our tongues battle furiously but gently, and my palms encase his neck, my body pushing into his. I could kiss him for ever like this. The cold has been chased away by the heat of our mingling bodies, leaving no room for discomfort, just acres of space for serenity.</p><p>I have that serenity, and I know Miller does, too.</p><p>\u2018You taste even better in the rain,\u2019 he says between our hectic tongues, not prepared to stop. \u2018Jesus, f**king divine.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Hmmm.\u2019 I could never find any words to describe how he\u2019s making me feel right now. There are none. So I show him by hardening my kiss and squeezing him tighter.</p><p>\u2018Savoured,\u2019 he mumbles weakly. I hum again as he slows our kiss until our tongues are barely moving. \u2018It turns out that I can worship you in Hyde Park.\u2019 He pecks my lips and pushes my wet hair from my face.</p><p>\u2018Not to your full ability.\u2019 I keep myself coiled around his drenched body. I\u2019m not ready to let go yet.</p><p>\u2018I concur.\u2019 He turns and starts an unhurried stride out of the park as the rain continues to beat down. \u2018So I need to get finished at the club and get you home so I can show you my full ability.\u2019</p><p>I nod and bury my face in his neck, letting him carry me back to the car.</p><p>If there is perfect beyond Miller\u2019s perfect world, then this is it.</p><p>I\u2019m squelching in the leather seat of Miller\u2019s Mercedes, sensing a growing concern from beside me at the soggy state of his fine car. The dual temperature control displays a medium sixteen degrees, the right number to keep Miller calm, but the wrong number given how damn cold I am. I\u2019m dying to turn the dial up, but mindful that I\u2019m pushing Miller\u2019s boundaries already \u2013 what with wet suits, picnics in Hyde Park, and unexpected shopping exhibitions. Turning that dial might be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. I shiver and sink further into my seat, catching Miller out of the corner of my eye sweeping his waves off his forehead.</p><p>Tracy Chapman coos about fast cars, which makes me smile as Miller is driving incredibly slowly. The air of calm and the serenity floating around our wet bodies is tangible. No words are spoken and they don\u2019t need to be. Today has been better than I could ever have imagined, hiccups earlier in the day aside. Miller has worked through some tough issues, and not only has it filled me with the most incredible amount of pride, but it\u2019s also enriched the feelings I have for him. And most satisfying of all, I know that Miller has stepped outside his perfect box and liked where he\u2019s found himself. The fact that I am now freezing in my seat and dare not touch the temperature control of his swanky car is irrelevant.</p><p>\u2018Are you chilly?\u2019 Miller\u2019s concerned tone doesn\u2019t grab my attention, but his question does. He\u2019s surely not going to give me heat as well as a picnic, almost casual clothes, and a kiss in the rain?</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m fine,\u2019 I lie, forcing myself to stop shaking.</p><p>\u2018Olivia, you are far from fine.\u2019 He reaches forward and rotates each dial in turn, ensuring they match, taking the car\u2019s temperature to a toasty twenty-five degrees.</p><p>My elation soars and I reach over to catch a feel of his lovely stubble, all coarse and scratchy, but familiar and soothing. \u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>He pushes his cheek into my touch, then takes my hand and kisses the tips of my fingers before placing our joined hands in his lap and holding them there, choosing to drive one-handed.</p><p>I never want this day to end.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>\u2018Tony.\u2019 Miller nods in greeting, directing me past his bar manager by my neck and not seeming to notice the worried look on his face. He looks really worried, and while Miller appears fine with ignoring it, I\u2019m not.</p><p>\u2018Livy?\u2019 Tony says it like a question, like he\u2019s surprised to see me. He once said Miller was happy in his own precise little world. But I know better. Miller wasn\u2019t happy. He may have pretended to be, but I know \u2013 because he told me so himself \u2013 that he had a lovely time today.</p><p>It\u2019s clear that Tony doesn\u2019t know what to think of this soaking wet, dishevelled man before him. I don\u2019t speak, just giving a small smile of acknowledgment as we disappear from view.</p><p>\u2018He doesn\u2019t like me,\u2019 I muse quietly, almost reluctantly, wondering if my time will be wasted asking why that might be.</p><p>\u2018He worries too much.\u2019 Miller\u2019s reply is short, sharp and final as he guides me through the maze of corridors to his office. I know Tony is against us, just like everyone else, so I\u2019m not sure why his disapproval bothers me more than the rest of the interferers. The looks? The words? And why isn\u2019t Miller more upset about it, like he gets with the others?</p><p>Miller taps in the code for his office and pushes the door open, and I\u2019m immediately faced with the extreme precision of his office. Everything is how it should be.</p><p>Except us.</p><p>I look down at my soaking state, then to Miller\u2019s, thinking how wrecked we both look. Strangely, now that I\u2019m surrounded by the familiarity and exactness of Miller\u2019s world, I feel all uncomfortable and . . . wrong.</p><p>\u2018Olivia?\u2019 I look across to Miller, who\u2019s at his drinks cabinet pouring a Scotch while yanking at his tie.</p><p>\u2018Sorry, daydreaming.\u2019 I shake myself out of my silly reverie and close the door behind me.</p><p>\u2018Go and sit.\u2019 He indicates his office chair. \u2018Can I get you a drink?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sit,\u2019 he prompts again when I\u2019m still standing by the door a few seconds later. \u2018Go.\u2019</p><p>I look down at my dress, then to Miller\u2019s fancy office chair. It was a trial and a concern sitting in Miller\u2019s car while all soggy, and now I\u2019m faced with his lovely leather office chair. \u2018But I\u2019m all wet.\u2019 I pull at the hem of my dress and release it, letting it slap against my thigh in demonstration. I\u2019m not just wet; I\u2019m dripping.</p><p>His glass pauses at his lips as his eyes skip over my body, absorbing the mess I\u2019m in. Or maybe not. His eyes land on my chest and then flip to mine. They\u2019ve gone all smoky. \u2018I quite like you wet.\u2019 His glass points at me, his fiery gaze slicing through my chilliness and igniting my dormant desire. My body lights up and my breathing stutters under the heat of cool blues.</p><p>He starts to slowly wander over to me, casually, calm, and with a million emotions sparkling in his eyes. Want, lust, desire, resolve, and a ton of others, but I don\u2019t get the chance to continue my mental list because his free arm slides under my bottom and lifts me to his mouth. I smell and taste Scotch, reminding me of a drunken Miller, but it\u2019s easily dismissed under the attention of his divine mouth. Our wet clothes stick together, and my fingers delve into the messy array of his hair. This kiss is slow, meticulous and soft. He moans his pleasure and nibbles gently on my bottom lip each time he pulls away before lazily pecking me softly and pushing his tongue back into my mouth.</p><p>\u2018I need destressing,\u2019 he mumbles, making me laugh. He\u2019s probably the most relaxed I\u2019ve ever seen him. \u2018What\u2019s so funny?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You.\u2019 I pull back and take my time feeling his face \u2013 relishing in the harshness of his stubble. \u2018You are funny, Miller.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I am?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, you are.\u2019</p><p>He cocks his head in thought as he carries me over to his desk in one arm. \u2018I\u2019ve never been called funny before.\u2019 I\u2019m placed in his leather seat and turned to face his pristine desk, finding a stupid sense of calm when I note everything is in its rightful place, namely the solitary item that always graces Miller\u2019s desk \u2013 a phone. \u2018You don\u2019t have a computer?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>He taps the section of desk that hides all of the screens, and I mildly smile my acknowledgment. How . . . tidy.</p><p>\u2018I promised I\u2019d be quick.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You did,\u2019 I agree, relaxing back in his chair. \u2018What do you need to do?\u2019 It\u2019s only now I wonder where any paperwork is kept, too, or stationery and files.</p><p>The silver tie gracing his neck is removed along with his suit jacket, leaving him in his waistcoat and shirt. \u2018A few calls, this and that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018This and that,\u2019 I whisper as I watch him place his drink accurately on his desk and kneel on the floor on the other side. He rests his forearms on the white surface and looks at me thoughtfully. It makes me sit further back in his chair. What\u2019s he going to say? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I have a request.\u2019</p><p>That doesn\u2019t improve my wariness. \u2018What?\u2019</p><p>He smiles, obviously at my clear worry as he reaches into his pocket. \u2018I\u2019d like you to have this.\u2019 He places something on the desk but holds his hand over it so I can\u2019t see what\u2019s beneath.</p><p>My eyes flick up and down, my cautiousness magnifying. \u2018What is it?\u2019</p> <p>His smile slips a little, and I detect nerves. It only escalates mine. \u2018A key to my apartment.\u2019 He lifts his palm, revealing a Yale key.</p><p>My muscles relax, my mind refusing to centre any attention on where my silly thoughts were heading. \u2018A key,\u2019 I breathe on a laugh.</p><p>\u2018You can stay at my place whenever you wish. Come and go as you please. Will you accept?\u2019 He looks hopeful as he slides it across the desk towards me.</p><p>I roll my eyes and then jump on a gasp as the door flies open and Cassie staggers in. \u2018Shit!\u2019 I curse under my breath, my heart speeding with fright. Miller\u2019s on his feet in an instant and crossing the room.</p><p>\u2018Cassie,\u2019 he sighs tiredly, his broad shoulders slumping as he comes to a halt.</p> <p>\u2018Well, hello!\u2019 she laughs, holding the door for support. She\u2019s drunk, and not just the tipsy, merry kind. I\u2019m not looking forward to this, but however pissed she might be, she still looks sickeningly perfect. Her wobbly gaze is as rooted to Miller as it could be, given her drunken state. She hasn\u2019t even noticed I\u2019m here. I\u2019m invisible.</p><p>\u2018What are you doing here?\u2019</p><p>\u2018My date was cancelled.\u2019 She waves an indifferent hand through the air before slamming the door shut so hard that shock waves ripple up the walls of Miller\u2019s office.</p><p>My eyes creep between the two of them, back and forth, liking the fact that she\u2019s been in here only a second and Miller\u2019s patience already seems exhausted. I hope he manhandles her from the room again. What I don\u2019t like, though, are Cassie\u2019s inquisitive eyes that are rooted on Miller. And I know why.</p><p>\u2018Look at the state of you!\u2019 She\u2019s truly shocked, and I join her in the shock department when she stumbles over to Miller and starts laying her manicured hands all over his wet body. It takes a whole lifetime\u2019s worth of restraint not to throw myself across Miller\u2019s office and wrestle her to the ground. I want to scream at her to remove her hands from him. \u2018Oh, Miller, baby, you\u2019re all wet.\u2019</p><p>Baby?</p> <p>In an attempt to distract myself, I start twisting my ring around my finger, over and over until I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve rubbed a blister into my skin. She\u2019s stroking him, cooing and fussing, like he might die because he\u2019s got a little wet.</p><p>Get your f**king hands off him!</p><p>\u2018Miller, what happened? Who did this to you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I did it to myself, Cassie,\u2019 he says touchily, taking her palms from his chest and releasing them. He steps away, and I relax a little at the distance he\u2019s put between them. Not for long, though, because the relentless trollop closes it back up. I\u2019m stiff as a board, conjuring up a pile of verbal abuse to lob across the room, and I\u2019m quite alarmed by it. I force some calming thoughts, but they\u2019re fast transforming into blood-boiling fury.</p><p>\u2018What do you mean?\u2019 she questions uncertainly, eyes and hands beginning to roam again.</p><p>\u2018We were having a picnic in the park,\u2019 I pipe up, no longer prepared to sit back and watch Miller tackle the pressing presence of Cassie alone. \u2018We had a lovely time,\u2019 I add, just for good measure.</p><p>Her hands freeze in place on Miller\u2019s torso, both of them gawking at me, Miller tired, Cassie shocked. \u2018Olivia,\u2019 she purrs. \u2018What a surprise.\u2019</p><p>I would think she\u2019s being sarcastic, but even if her low purr isn\u2019t shocked, her face is. Then she turns her incredulous look onto Miller, who exhales his building frustration.</p> <p>\u2018What do you want, Cassie?\u2019 He removes her greedy palms from his chest again and starts unbuttoning his waistcoat. \u2018I don\u2019t plan on being here long.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well\u2019 \u2013 she saunters over to the drinks cabinet and pours herself a large straight vodka \u2013 \u2018I was hoping you\u2019d take me out for drinks.\u2019</p><p>My hackles rise, and I shoot a look to Miller, who\u2019s now shrugging off his waistcoat. His wet shirt is transparent and clinging everywhere. I cough on a choke. He looks dreamlike, and Cassie has noticed, too. All sorts of conflicting things are happening, my sass telling me to rip a strip off Cassie, my lust telling me to tackle Miller to the floor and eat him alive. Nothing about this situation is comfortable. Then Miller removes his wet shirt, exposing vast planes of taut, smooth, cut leanness, and my mouth drops open, not because of what I\u2019m presented with, but because he\u2019s openly offered the stunning sight to Cassie\u2019s greedy eyes.</p><p>Her body sways as she studies Miller\u2019s wet, flexing muscles, her vodka paused at her lips. \u2018I think you\u2019ve had enough to drink,\u2019 Miller grumbles, making his way to the bathroom. I watch his back disappear through the doorway, knowing Cassie has followed his path, too. My skin starts to prickle, feeling animosity hitting me. Now she\u2019s looking at me, and even though I know I\u2019ll probably be reduced to cinders from her filthy look, I can\u2019t help chancing a glance.</p><p>\u2018What have you done to him?\u2019 she spits across the room, waving her glass of vodka at the bathroom doorway.</p><p>I need to remain calm. I\u2019m struggling to keep my rage at bay, dying to lash out at her. She\u2019s interfering, probably better than anyone. Yet Miller\u2019s not displaying the same psychotic flip-outs with Cassie, just like he isn\u2019t with Tony. Is he going to tell me that Cassie is worried, too? Yeah, she\u2019s worried all right. She\u2019s worried I\u2019m going to take Miller away from her, and she\u2019d be right to worry. I bet this woman has cattiness down to a fine art. I\u2019ll never match her on that, it just isn\u2019t my style, so I keep my focus on her and sit back in Miller\u2019s chair. \u2018I\u2019ve made him see light through his darkness.\u2019</p><p>She recoils and exhales quietly. I\u2019ve stunned her, shocked her into silence. It feels good, but I hear footsteps nearing, so I leave Cassie and her disbelief and carry my calm eyes across the room until I find him. He\u2019s rubbing a towel over his head, looking at me with sparkly blues. \u2018Come here,\u2019 he says quietly, his head cocked. I\u2019m out of the chair and across the room to join him without delay. I know that glimmer. Cassie is about to witness a little Miller-style worshipping. This will beat any kind of tongue-lashing that I could invoke. A warm palm has claimed my neck within a heartbeat and warm lips have claimed my mouth a heartbeat after that. His kiss is brief but holds all of the usual qualities and spikes all of the usual reactions, and I definitely don\u2019t mistake the shocked inhale of breath from behind me. Yes, he lets me kiss him, and in a sad fit of ownership, I place my hands on his na**d chest, just so she can see me feeling him, too. \u2018Here.\u2019 He drapes the towel across my shoulders and uses the corners to wipe my wet forehead. \u2018Go and dry off in the bathroom.\u2019</p><p>I hesitate, not keen on leaving the room with a drunk and now-silent Cassie on the prowl. \u2018I\u2019m fine,\u2019 I try feebly, making him smile. After dropping a chaste kiss on my cheek, he strides over to the concealed wardrobe and pulls the doors open, scans the rows of posh shirts, and then yanks one down by the sleeve. Cassie gasps in horror, Miller throws her a dirty look . . . and I go dizzy with happiness.</p><p>\u2018Put this on.\u2019 He hands me the shirt and turns me in his arms before giving me a gentle nudge in the back. \u2018Give me your dress and I\u2019ll have someone hold it under the hand dryers for a while.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can do that,\u2019 I protest, thinking it\u2019ll be a perfect chore to pass the time while Miller gets his work done.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll do no such thing,\u2019 he scoffs, pushing me onward. I turn once I\u2019m in the bathroom, finding Miller pulling the door shut and Cassie still staring, struck dumb at Miller\u2019s back. \u2018Five minutes.\u2019 He nods sternly and disappears from view when the wood comes between us. I frown at the door as the fireworks within settle down, making way for a little bewilderment. I\u2019ve just allowed him to ship me out of his office with no complaint or protest. Now the fact that he\u2019s just manhandled one of his precious shirts and given it to me to wear doesn\u2019t feel like progress at all. It feels like distraction. I laugh out loud. I\u2019m stupid, and on that conclusion I open the door and present myself back into the room. Both heads turn, both faces looking heated. They are far too close, probably to keep their conversation from my earshot.</p><p>\u2018Oh, for God\u2019s sake,\u2019 Cassie hisses, taking a huge swig of her vodka. \u2018Can\u2019t you just get rid of it?\u2019</p><p>I cough my disgust as Miller swings around violently and snatches the glass from her hand. \u2018Learn when to shut the f**k up!\u2019 He slams the glass down, sending Cassie on a startled stagger. Now I can see his fury, and that is the only thing that keeps my mouth from spilling a torrent of expletives. There\u2019s no need for me to put this woman in her place because Miller is about to do it for me. He pushes his face near hers. \u2018The only thing I\u2019ll be ridding from my life is you.\u2019 His voice is scathing. \u2018Don\u2019t f**king push me, Cassie.\u2019</p><p>She grabs the cabinet for support and takes a moment to compose herself, her eyes shooting to mine briefly. \u2018You\u2019ll be crucified.\u2019 Her words are factual. I can tell by the stiffening of Miller\u2019s na**d shoulders.</p><p>\u2018Some things are worth the risk,\u2019 he whispers, uncertainty rife in his tone.</p><p>\u2018Nothing is worth that risk,\u2019 Cassie whispers. There\u2019s an element of fear in her, and that fear spreads across the room and settles within me. Deeply.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re wrong.\u2019 Miller takes a long pull of calming air and steps away from her, turning impassive eyes onto me. \u2018She\u2019s worth it. I want out.\u2019</p><p>Cassie gasps, and if I could rip my welling eyes from Miller, then I know I\u2019d see an astounded expression all over her perfect face. \u2018You . . . Miller . . . You can\u2019t,\u2019 she stammers all over her words, swiping up her drink and taking a shaky gulp.</p><p>\u2018I can.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Get out, Cassie.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miller!\u2019 She\u2019s beginning to panic.</p><p>His jaw tightens, his eyes remaining on my frozen form in the doorway as he pulls his phone from his trouser pocket, hits one button, and holds it to his ear. \u2018Tony, come and get Cassie.\u2019</p><p>What happens next leaves me wide-eyed and open-mouthed.</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 She launches herself at him, knocking him into the cabinet, sending glasses and bottles crashing to the office floor. I flinch, but my legs refuse to carry me across the office to intervene. All I can do is watch in shock as Miller tries to restrain her flailing hands as she screams at him, scratches and begs. \u2018You can\u2019t! Please!\u2019</p><p>The signs of Miller\u2019s frightening rage are all in the room with us, his puffing chest, wild eyes and sweating form. I hate to think what damage he could do to a woman. I despise Cassie, I hate everything about her, but even I am worried for her.</p><p>Miller\u2019s about to take leave of his senses.</p><p>I drop his shirt and run across the room, disregarding the danger I may be putting myself in. I just need to make him see me, hear me, feel me. Anything to divert him from the direction I know he\u2019s headed.</p><p>\u2018Miller!\u2019 I shout, reluctantly accepting this will never work. I yelled at him repeatedly outside Nan\u2019s to no avail. \u2018Fuck!\u2019 I curse, standing close, watching the frantic wrestling of arms. Cassie is crying now, her perfect hair looking rough and messy.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you dare leave me,\u2019 she wails. \u2018I won\u2019t let you leave me!\u2019</p><p>My eyes widen in alarm. There\u2019s more than business between these two. She\u2019s flipped her lid, and while I\u2019m fearful for her, I\u2019m quite concerned for Miller, too. Those nails are like claws and thrashing all over him while he tries to seize her and she continues to scream persistently. She\u2019s deranged and Miller\u2019s heading that way, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I try to catch Miller\u2019s eye, try time and time again to reach and touch him, but each attempt has me retracting to avoid being caught by a flailing limb. Panic starts to eat me alive but before I can figure out my best move, Tony comes crashing through the door.</p><p>His dramatic arrival pulls my attention away from the scrapping of bodies but doesn\u2019t interrupt Miller and Cassie. \u2018Tony, do something!\u2019 I plead, swinging back towards them, feeling helpless and small. \u2018Miller, stop!\u2019</p><p>I reach out when I see a clear path to his torso, my body moving closer, desperate to stop them. \u2018Livy, no!\u2019 Tony bellows, but his tone doesn\u2019t stop me. I\u2019m getting close, I can reach him, but then the most searing sting spreads across my cheek, sending me flying back on a painful yelp, my hand instantly cupping my burning face and tears stabbing at my eyes.</p><p>The blow to my face sends me all disorientated. \u2018Shit!\u2019 I find nothing to grab to steady myself, and instead give up on the inevitable, letting my body crash to the floor.</p> <p>Everything blurs around me \u2013 vision, sound \u2013 and pain flames the flesh of my face. I try to shake some clear thoughts back into my mind, or at least gain some straight vision, but it takes the feel of strong hands on my shoulders to bring me back into the room.</p><p>It\u2019s silent.</p><p>Deadly silent.</p><p>I look up and see traumatised blue eyes scanning my face, eventually settling on my burning cheek. Cassie is by the drinks cabinet, tremors of shock riding through her body and a look of apprehension on her flustered face. She takes shaky hands to the bottle of vodka and skips pouring a glass, instead taking the neck of the bottle to her lips. I\u2019m not certain who struck me, but after a few seconds of watching Cassie through blurred vision, I quickly conclude it\u2019s her, and she\u2019s now bracing herself for . . . something.</p><p>\u2018Tony?\u2019 Miller\u2019s voice is rampant with rage.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m here, son.\u2019 Tony moves in, looking down at me with sorry eyes. I feel stupid, a burden and weak.</p><p>\u2018Get that bitch the f**k out of my office.\u2019 Miller sweeps me up from the floor and cradles me in his arms before turning to face Cassie. She\u2019s nearly polished off the whole bottle.</p><p>\u2018I can stand,\u2019 I protest, my throat scratchy from my scream of alarm.</p><p>\u2018Shhhh,\u2019 he soothes quietly, pressing soft lips to my temple, all the while keeping burning rings of fury on Cassie.</p><p>She\u2019s wary and shifting drunkenly, but she still carries that air of superiority. \u2018She shouldn\u2019t have got in the way.\u2019 She dismisses the whole incident easily, gulping down the rest of the vodka.</p><p>Tony moves in and takes Cassie\u2019s arm. \u2018Let\u2019s go,\u2019 he orders, removing the bottle from her hand and slamming it down.</p> <p>\u2018No!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Get her out!\u2019 Miller yells. \u2018Get her the f**k out before I kill her!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You wouldn\u2019t hurt me!\u2019 she laughs. \u2018You couldn\u2019t!\u2019</p><p>Tony starts pulling her to the door, but she doggedly fights him off. She\u2019s relentless. \u2018For crying out loud, Cassie! Sober up and sort this shit out later.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m fine!\u2019 She wriggles from Tony\u2019s hold and staggers over to the desk, plonking herself down in Miller\u2019s chair. I may have only just got my clear sight back, but I definitely don\u2019t mistake her flip a scowl in my direction. Even now? She\u2019s just clobbered me one, attacked Miller, and she\u2019s still all hostile. Can she not detect the aggression radiating from every refined pore of my part-time gentleman? Is she stupid? \u2018Give me a f**king break,\u2019 she grumbles, reaching up to the intricate cross that\u2019s always decorating her neck. She fumbles with it, cursing under her breath.</p><p>\u2018Cassie,\u2019 Miller warns. I can feel his chest heaving double in pace under me. \u2018Don\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fuck off!\u2019</p><p>Tony\u2019s very quickly by her side, leaning down to get level with her, his palms flat on Miller\u2019s desk. \u2018I won\u2019t allow it, Cassandra.\u2019</p> <p>She turns a defiant chin up to Tony and moves in close, getting nose to nose with him as she continues to play with her silver cross. \u2018Fuck . . . off.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cassie!\u2019</p><p>\u2018He wants out! Have you ever heard something so funny? They\u2019ll never allow it.\u2019</p><p>I want to scream that all those women don\u2019t have a choice, that he\u2019s mine now, but Miller squeezes me to him. It\u2019s a reassuring squeeze.</p><p>She laughs. \u2018It\u2019s f**king hilarious.\u2019 The metal of her necklace splits into two pieces and I watch in horror as white powder scatters Miller\u2019s perfect white desk. I gasp, Tony curses, and Miller tenses from head to toe.</p><p>Cocaine?</p><p>If I hadn\u2019t seen the fine particles drop from Cassie\u2019s beautiful piece of jewellery, I probably would never know it was there; the residue is camouflaged perfectly by the expanse of white gloss beneath it. I\u2019m speechless as I watch her snatch a credit card from her bra, along with a note, before she starts shifting the powder around on Miller\u2019s desk, encouraging it into a perfect, long line. She\u2019s an expert.</p><p>Tony\u2019s pacing the room, swearing profusely, and Miller is just staring at her while keeping me in his vicelike grip. The tension in the room is palpable, and I\u2019m truly anxious about who\u2019s going to make the next move. There\u2019s an overwhelming need to free myself from Miller, but that would leave him to let loose. Everyone is safer while I\u2019m in his arms, but then I\u2019m suddenly not in his arms any more. I\u2019ve been placed on a couch in the corner and Miller is on his way over to Cassie, not that she\u2019s aware. She\u2019s too busy hoovering up the powder on Miller\u2019s desk through a rolled note.</p><p>\u2018Easy, son,\u2019 Tony soothes, flicking his worried eyes to me. The pain in my face has been replaced by awful apprehension. Every person in this room, except me, is like a ticking bomb. And it\u2019s Miller\u2019s fuse that\u2019s burning the fastest.</p><p>His palms hit the desk and his bare chest leans forward, getting close to Cassie. She\u2019s now sniffing and wiping at her nose, a smug smile creeping onto her face. \u2018I\u2019ve asked more than once. If you make me ask again, I will not be held accountable for my actions.\u2019</p><p>She huffs her lack of concern and relaxes back in his chair. I can see arrogance slinking its way across her face. Fearlessness.</p><p>\u2018Smile,\u2019 she says simply, crossing one leg over the other and . . . smiling.</p><p>I frown. Smile? What is there to smile about? Nothing.</p><p>\u2018Miller, come on.\u2019 Tony\u2019s trying his hardest to talk some calm into the situation, and I\u2019m willing him to succeed.</p><p>Cassie\u2019s perfectly arched eyebrows arch further. \u2018Want some?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 Miller spits.</p><p>She pouts and lets it drift slowly into a sly smile. \u2018That\u2019s a first.\u2019</p><p>I gasp, I cough, unable to halt any of the shocked reactions from spilling from my mouth. He does drugs? On top of everything else, I now have addict to add to my list?</p><p>\u2018I f**king hate you,\u2019 Miller seethes, moving closer.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s ruining you.\u2019</p><p>He leans closer to her, threateningly, his palms twitching where they rest on the glossy white surface. \u2018She\u2019s saving me.\u2019</p><p>Cassie\u2019s laugh is cold and sardonic as she moves in nearer to him. \u2018Nothing can save you.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m completely numb, trying to process this new blast of enlightenment while desperately trying to cling on to the strength I need to help Miller. I look to Tony, pleading with my eyes for him to intervene.</p><p>But it\u2019s too late.</p><p>Miller launches himself across his desk, grabbing Cassie by the throat.</p><p>I scream.</p><p>The scene is manic. Unreal. Miller has lost control, and when the crazy woman seated at his desk should be fearing for her life, she\u2019s just laughing at him instead.</p><p>\u2018For f**k\u2019s sake!\u2019 Tony throws himself into the mix, getting a smack across his jaw for his trouble, but instead of yielding, he fights harder. He knows, just as well as I do, that this will end only one way, and that\u2019ll be with Cassie in the hospital. \u2018Get off her!\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s a f**king parasite!\u2019 Miller roars. \u2018Life is miserable enough without her help!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miller!\u2019 Tony jabs him in the ribs, making Miller shriek and me wince. \u2018Back off!\u2019</p><p>Miller pushes away from his desk and swings around aggressively. \u2018Get her out and back in rehab!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t need help!\u2019 Cassie spits nastily. \u2018You\u2019re the one who needs f**king help.\u2019 She squirms free of Tony\u2019s hold and starts pulling at her untidy dress, yanking the hem back down to her knee. \u2018You\u2019re prepared to risk everything for that?\u2019 Her arm shoots out towards me.</p><p>It? That? Oh, I might be stunned by the events unravelling before me, but her persistent insolence and insults are beginning to piss me off. \u2018Who the hell do you think you are?\u2019 I stand, immediately aware that Miller has halted with his gritty marching. \u2018You think a few temper tantrums and bitter words will break him?\u2019 I step forward, feeling my confidence swell, especially when Cassie snaps her rotten mouth shut. \u2018You can\u2019t stop him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not me you should be worried about.\u2019 Her lip curls. They\u2019re just more words, but the acute manner in which they are delivered sends anxious tingles shooting up my spine.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s it.\u2019 Tony intervenes, taking Cassie\u2019s arm and leading her from the office. \u2018You are your own worst enemy, Cassandra.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Always have been,\u2019 she agrees on a laugh, allowing herself to be guided to the doorway without a fuss or fight. But then she slows to a halt at the threshold and turns leisurely, sniffing as she does. \u2018It was nice knowing you, Miller Hart.\u2019</p><p>Her parting words cool the heated emotions that are dominating the atmosphere in Miller\u2019s office, leaving the air thick with tension. The door slams, courtesy of a riled Tony, and Miller and I are left alone.</p><p>He\u2019s edgy.</p><p>I\u2019m disturbed.</p><p>We both remain silent for what seems like for ever, my mind playing repeats of the past ten minutes as my wet body and injured face slowly start to register. I begin to shiver and my arms instinctively wrap around my body. It\u2019s a protection mechanism. It has nothing to do with my chilly bones.</p><p>My gaze is cemented to the floor, not daring or wanting to torture my eyes with the sight of Miller in full-force psycho mode. They\u2019ve had more than they can handle in the last couple of days. These outbursts are becoming too frequent. He needs help. The stark reality of Miller\u2019s life just keeps getting starker.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t deprive me of your face, Olivia Taylor.\u2019 The softness of his voice is strained, an attempt to instil some ease into me. I\u2019m not sure it can work. I don\u2019t think anything can work. I\u2019m again questioning my ability to chase Miller\u2019s demons away because as I see it right now, I\u2019m fuelling the fire. And I hate that. I hate my constant doubting because of these interferers. \u2018Olivia.\u2019 I hear the light thud of footsteps approaching, but I keep my eyes down.</p><p>I shake my head and my chin begins to tremble.</p><p>\u2018Let me see those sparkling eyes.\u2019 The warmth of his palm connects with my sore cheek, sending a flash of pain coursing through me. I recoil on a hiss, turning my face away from his view. I already know that it will be glowing red from the brute force of the whack I\u2019ve just absorbed and that will undoubtedly enrage Miller more. He seems to be calming. I need to keep it that way. His hand retracts slightly, hovering just in my field of vision. \u2018May I?\u2019 he asks quietly.</p><p>I fold, inside and out, my fallen heart crumbling, my weak body collapsing. He\u2019s silent as he catches me, like he fully expected my body to give, and he takes us down to the floor, rocking me in his strong arms. The familiarity of his bare chest against me doesn\u2019t have its usual effect. I sob \u2013 horrible gut-wrenching sobs. It\u2019s all too much. The strength that Miller feeds me seems to have been swallowed up, leaving me a weak waif of nothing. I\u2019m no good for him. I can\u2019t see him through his darkness because my own world is becoming too dark in the process. William is right. A relationship with Miller Hart is impossible. Apart, we are barely functioning. Together, we\u2019re dead and incredibly alive at the same time. We\u2019re impossible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Please don\u2019t cry,\u2019 he begs, squeezing me to him, his low tone now sincere and unforced. \u2018I can\u2019t bear to see you like this.\u2019</p><p>I say nothing, my sniffles preventing me from speaking, even if I knew what to say.

But Miller Hart has taken me and put me in the centre of that world.</p><p>And I know I will never escape.</p><p>His face is buried in my hair, and he\u2019s humming that comforting melody. It\u2019s a desperate attempt to pull me round. He feels my despondency. He\u2019s worried, and when he\u2019s hummed for minutes upon minutes and I still haven\u2019t ceased weeping, he growls low and stands with me secured against him, then carries me quietly into the bathroom.</p> <p>He positions me on the toilet, with no need for precision, and pushes my matted hair from my face with the utmost care to avoid my sore cheek. I finally allow my stinging eyes to lift along with my head to face him. His blue eyes reveal horror as they focus on the side of my face, and he takes a deep, calming breath.</p><p>\u2018Wait,\u2019 he orders harshly as he retrieves a facecloth from a small pile beside the sink and runs it under the cold tap. He\u2019s kneeling at my feet quickly, the cloth coating the palm of his hand. \u2018I\u2019ll be gentle.\u2019</p><p>I nod my acceptance and wince before he\u2019s even connected the cool cloth to my face.</p><p>\u2018Shhh.\u2019 The chilliness hits my tender cheek, making me recoil on a painful gasp. \u2018Hey, hey, hey.\u2019 His other palm reaches for my shoulder to steady me. \u2018Let it settle.\u2019 Taking a deep breath, I brace myself for the pressure I know he\u2019s about to apply. \u2018Better?\u2019 he asks, searching for comfort in my eyes. I can\u2019t find the energy to speak, so I give a pathetic nod, depriving Miller of my eyes when I clench them shut in pain. Everything feels heavy \u2013 my eyes, my tongue, my body . . . my heart.</p><p>Reaching up, I rub at my tired eyes, massaging into the sockets rigorously with the heels of my hands, hoping to work away the lingering visions, not just of this evening\u2019s outburst but of all Miller\u2019s recent rages and the horrid images of him shoving coc**ne up his nose. I\u2019m being naive and ambitious.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019ll get some ice,\u2019 Miller murmurs, sounding as pitiful as I feel. He takes my hand and replaces his with mine gently on my cheek before he pushes himself from the floor.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I grab his wrist to stop him leaving. \u2018Don\u2019t go.\u2019</p><p>The hope that flickers through his blank eyes spikes guilt. He falls to his haunches and rests his palms on my knees.</p><p>\u2018You do coc**ne,\u2019 I state, not making it a question. There\u2019s no scope for denying here.</p><p>\u2018Not since I\u2019ve met you, Olivia. There are many things I haven\u2019t done since I\u2019ve met you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You quit just like that?\u2019 I know I sound cynical, but it\u2019s not something I can help.</p> <p>\u2018Just like that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How bad?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Does it matter? I\u2019ve stopped.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It matters to me. How often do you use?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did I use.\u2019 His jaw ticks and his eyes clench shut. \u2018Once in a while.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Once in a while?\u2019</p><p>Blue eyes slowly appear again, pouring with regret, sorrow . . . shame. \u2018It helped me get through . . .\u2019</p><p>I gasp. \u2018Oh God.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Livy, I\u2019ve never had a reason to stop doing any of the things I did. That simple. I don\u2019t need any of it any more. Not now that I have you.\u2019</p><p>I drop my eyes, confused, shocked and hurt. \u2018Who\u2019ll crucify you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Many.\u2019 He laughs nervously, and it prompts my eyes to find his again. \u2018But I\u2019ll never give up on us. I\u2019ll do anything you want me to,\u2019 he vows.</p><p>\u2018See a doctor,\u2019 I blurt without thought. \u2018Please.\u2019 He can\u2019t possibly deal with all these problems. He can\u2019t be beyond help. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s been told that before.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t need a doctor. I need people to stop interfering.\u2019 His jaw is tight, just the mention of meddlesome people spiking the rage that\u2019s so very worrying. \u2018I need people to stop making you overthink.\u2019</p><p>I shake my head on a sad smile. He doesn\u2019t see it. \u2018I can learn to deal with interference, Miller.\u2019 I have to. Miller will take all of the interference personally. Maybe it\u2019s paranoia. Drugs make people paranoid, right? I have no idea, but it\u2019s a problem and it can be fixed, I\u2019m certain. \u2018It\u2019s you who\u2019s making me sad.\u2019</p><p>His hands halt their calming rubs on my knees. \u2018Me?\u2019 he asks quietly.</p><p>\u2018Yes, you. Your temper.\u2019 Cassie\u2019s hate is unpleasant and mystifying, but it didn\u2019t make me feel hopeless like this. That\u2019s his doing. \u2018I can help you, but you need to help yourself. You need to see a doctor.\u2019</p><p>Blue eyes deepen as they explore my face, and he drops from his crouching position to his knees. I look down at him, immersing myself in the tranquillity that his telling gaze always offers, like right now, even when we\u2019re in such a mess \u2013 when Miller is in such a mess \u2013 the comfort I\u2019m feeling is immeasurable. He squeezes my thighs before he takes my hands in his and brings my knuckles to his soft lips, all the time maintaining the consuming connection of our eyes. \u2018Olivia, do you understand the extent of my feelings for you?\u2019 His eyes close tightly, robbing me of the comfort I partly survive on. \u2018Do you comprehend it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Open your eyes,\u2019 I demand softly, and on a strengthening inhale of air, he lazily pulls them open. \u2018I comprehend the extent of my feelings for you. If this is how you feel about me, then I get it. I understand, Miller. But you don\u2019t see me attacking anyone who threatens us. Our united front is enough. Let us do the talking.\u2019</p><p>Emotional pain invades his perfect face, making his lips press together and his eyes snap shut again. \u2018It\u2019s not something I can help,\u2019 he admits, letting his face drop into my lap. He\u2019s hiding, ashamed of his confession. I know he takes leave of his senses, but he has to try to stop. I sever the contact of our hands and plunge my fingers into his wet hair, looking down at my touch massaging the back of his head. His palms sweep around to my bottom and cling on desperately, his face turning so his cheek is now resting on my thighs. I can see him staring blankly at nothing, and I transfer my caress to his cheek and gently trace the contours of his profile, hoping my touch will have the same effect as his does on me.</p><p>Peace.</p><p>Comfort.</p><p>Strength.</p><p>\u2018Everything I had as a child was taken from me,\u2019 he whispers, stealing my breath with a hint of willingness to tell me of his childhood. \u2018I didn\u2019t have many possessions, but they were dear to me and they were mine. Just mine. But they were always taken from me. Nothing was precious.\u2019</p><p>I smile wistfully. \u2018You were an orphan.\u2019 I state it as a fact, because Miller has just told me in his own little way. The photo doesn\u2019t need to be mentioned.</p><p>He nods. \u2018I was in a home for boys for as long as I can remember.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What happened to your parents?\u2019</p><p>He sighs, and I immediately fathom that this is something that he has never spoken of. \u2018My mother was a young Irish girl who ran away from Belfast.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Irish,\u2019 I breathe, seeing Miller\u2019s bright blues and dark hair for what they are \u2013 typically Irish.</p><p>\u2018Have you heard of the Magdalene Asylums?\u2019 he asks.</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I gasp, horrified. The Magdalene nuns were folk of the Catholic Church who claimed to be working for God to cleanse the young women who were unfortunate enough to fall into their clutches \u2013 or who were sent there by their ashamed relatives, often pregnant.</p><p>\u2018She escaped, apparently. She came to London to give birth to me, but my grandparents eventually tracked her down and took her back to Ireland.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018They dumped me in an orphanage so they could return home, free of the disgrace. No one need know I existed. I\u2019ve never been a people person, Olivia. I was a loner. I didn\u2019t get along with others, and I spent a lot of time in a black cupboard as a result.\u2019</p><p>My eyes widen in realisation. I\u2019m disgusted, but most of all I\u2019m sad. Especially since I can detect the shame he feels. He has nothing to be ashamed of. \u2018They locked you in a cupboard?\u2019</p><p>He nods lightly. \u2018I didn\u2019t mix well.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 I say on a guilty gush of air. He still doesn\u2019t mix well, only with me.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be.\u2019 He smooths his palms up my back. \u2018You\u2019re not the only one who was abandoned, Olivia. I know how it feels, and that is only a very small part of why I will never leave you. A very small part.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And because I\u2019m your possession,\u2019 I remind him.</p><p>\u2018And because you are my possession. The most treasured possession I\u2019ve ever owned,\u2019 he confirms, lifting his head to find my dejected eyes. Everything was taken away from him. I get it. He smiles mildly at my sadness. \u2018My sweet girl, don\u2019t be sad for me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019 Of course I will be sad for him. It\u2019s an incredibly sad story, and just the beginning of Miller\u2019s wretched life up to this point. It\u2019s all disjointed \u2013 the orphan, the homeless man, and the escort. There are things that connect these stages of Miller\u2019s life and I\u2019m scared to death of hearing them. What he\u2019s told me, both vocally and emotionally, has taken me to the front line of agony and sadness. What connects these dots may be an enlightenment that will break my fallen heart beyond repair.</p><p>Warmth slides across my wet back, onto my hips, and up my sides, until his grip is creeping onto my collarbones and he\u2019s encasing my neck. \u2018If my twenty-nine-year tale of misery has led me to you, then that makes every unbearable part of it worthwhile. I\u2019d do it all again in a heartbeat, Olivia Taylor.\u2019 He dips and sweetly kisses my cheek. \u2018Accept me as I am, sweet girl, because it\u2019s so much better than what I was.\u2019</p><p>The lump in my throat swells, making breathing too difficult. It\u2019s too late. My heart is already broken, and so is Miller. \u2018I love you,\u2019 I utter pitifully. \u2018I love you so much.\u2019</p><p>The gaping hole in my chest rips even more when Miller\u2019s unshaven chin quivers the tiniest bit. He shakes his head in wonder before rising to claim my whole body, pulling me into him and giving me the most fierce thing in the history of things. \u2018I thank everything holy for that, and I\u2019m not a religious man.\u2019</p><p>Breathing into the wet hair sticking to his neck, I close my eyes and sink into the lean planes of his body, taking everything he has to give and returning it. My strength is restored, stronger than ever before, and determination is rushing violently through my bloodstream. He hasn\u2019t agreed to seeing a therapist or a counsellor, but my widened knowledge of this confounding man and his confessions is the best start. Helping him, pulling him from his self-professed journey to hell will be easier now that I\u2019m armed with the knowledge I need to understand him.</p><p>The interfering would seem inconsequential if it wasn\u2019t for Miller\u2019s extreme reaction to the interferers. He sees me as his possession, and he sees them as wanting to take me away from him. In an ideal world, all of the meddling idiots would disappear with a magic click of my fingers, but being as we don\u2019t exist in a mystical realm, other options need to be explored. And the primary one is getting Miller\u2019s temper under control, since it has become glaringly obvious that all of these meddling idiots are not only meddling, but persistent too. He\u2019ll always see interference as people trying to take his possession \u2013 his most treasured possession. It\u2019s natural for him to react this way.</p><p>My bones are being constricted to crumbling point under Miller\u2019s embrace, my lungs being squeezed, too. I\u2019m soaking up the luxury of his thing and savouring it, but my depleted body and exhausted mind is also desperate for rest. We\u2019re still at Ice, meddlers are loitering, we\u2019re both still wet and dishevelled, and Miller hasn\u2019t done a thing work-wise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I squirm a little in his hold, encouraging him to ease up so I can look at him. I find eyes matching my tiredness. \u2018I\u2019d like you to put me in your bed,\u2019 I say quietly, and drop a delicate kiss on his soft lips.</p><p>He swings into action instantly, releasing me and steadying me before stalking off into his office and returning before I have a chance to follow, fastening a dry shirt \u2013 all the buttons in the wrong holes. \u2018Do you want a shirt?\u2019 he asks, running a quick check over my body. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he answers for me, turning and disappearing from view again. I sigh and follow him, this time meeting him in the doorway. \u2018Put this on,\u2019 he orders, flapping a shirt out.</p><p>\u2018I have no bottoms.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 He frowns at my dress and turns undecided eyes onto the shirt. I wouldn\u2019t walk out of here in just one of Miller\u2019s shirts, even if he allowed it, which I highly doubt he would.</p> <p>I take the shirt and place it on a nearby sideboard. \u2018Just take me home.\u2019 I\u2019m on the brink of collapsing.</p><p>He sighs, taking up his usual hold of me. \u2018As you wish.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m guided out of the club, knowing we\u2019re being watched by Cassie and Tony, but our clear closeness speaks for itself \u2013 no words or smug smile of victory required. I\u2019m placed in Miller\u2019s Mercedes, the heat is cranked up, although with matching temperatures on both sides of the car, and I\u2019m driven to Miller\u2019s in silence. He\u2019s touching me almost the whole way, not prepared to lose contact, until we\u2019re in the underground car park of his apartment block and he has to release me to exit the vehicle. I stay where I am, warm and snug in the passenger seat, until Miller collects me in his arms and carries me the ten flights of stairs to the shiny black door that\u2019ll take us into privacy.</p><p>\u2018Call your grandmother,\u2019 he instructs, placing me on a stool. \u2018Then we\u2019ll have a bath.\u2019</p><p>My hopefulness dissipates at the suggestion. Bathing with Miller is beyond blissful, but so is him holding me in his thing in his bed, and I\u2019m favouring the latter option right now. \u2018I\u2019m so tired,\u2019 I sigh, reaching for my phone from my bag. I\u2019ll barely muster the energy to speak with Nan.</p> <p>\u2018Too tired to bathe?\u2019 he asks, disappointment invading his face. I don\u2019t even have the energy to feel guilty.</p><p>\u2018In the morning?\u2019 I try, thinking my hair will have dried into something beyond wild by the time I\u2019ve slept on it, and Miller\u2019s will have, too. The mental image brings a small smile to my lifeless face.</p><p>He thinks for a few moments, and the pad of his thumb smooths across my eyebrow, his tired eyes following its path. \u2018Please, let me clean us.\u2019 His face is beseeching. How could I possibly refuse?</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 I agree.</p><p>\u2018Thank you. I\u2019ll give you some privacy to call your grandmother while I draw the bath.\u2019 Dropping a kiss on my forehead, he turns to leave.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t need any privacy,\u2019 I protest, wondering what he thinks we might speak about. My declaration stalls his escape, and he nibbles at his lip thoughtfully. \u2018Why would you think I need privacy?\u2019</p> <p>He shrugs those perfect shoulders, and those perfect eyes lose a little exhaustion, finding mischievousness instead. I smile warily at the signs of playful Miller. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 he muses. \u2018Maybe you\u2019d like to discuss my buns.\u2019</p><p>The stupidest grin stretches to my cheeks. \u2018I\u2019d do that in your company.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You shouldn\u2019t. I get all embarrassed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, you don\u2019t!\u2019</p><p>A bright smile diminishes any lingering gloom that may have remained, sending me giddy. \u2018Call your nan, sweet girl. I want to bathe and get my habit under the sheets.\u2019</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>I can hear talking. It\u2019s faint, but it\u2019s there. The room is illuminated only by spots of London\u2019s night-time light on the skyline. If I didn\u2019t know better, I would think I was outside on a balcony staring out across the city, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m on Miller\u2019s worn sofa in front of the huge glass window, na**d and with a cashmere throw draped over me \u2013 somewhere better.</p><p>I sit up, dragging the blanket with me, and blink back my tiredness, yawning and stretching as I do. The view and my sleepiness distract me from the voices I heard a few moments ago, but then Miller\u2019s slightly raised and agitated tone reminds me of his absence from the couch. I pull myself to my feet and make the best job of wrapping the blanket around me before I pad across the wooden floor to the door, pulling it open soundlessly and listening for him. He\u2019s speaking quietly again, but he sounds irritated. The last time he took a call in the night he disappeared. Flashbacks of our hotel encounter ricochet around my head like a bullet, making me wince. I can\u2019t think of him like that. The man I faced in that hotel room wasn\u2019t the Miller Hart I know and love. He needs to change his number, make it impossible for these women to get hold of him. He\u2019s not at their disposal any more, although I begrudgingly note that they don\u2019t know this yet.</p> <p>I start towards the sound of his muffled voice, his words becoming clearer the closer I get until I\u2019m standing at the doorway of his kitchen staring at the scratch marks Cassie left on his na**d back.</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t,\u2019 he says, resolute and completely fixed. \u2018It\u2019s just not possible.\u2019 His words fill me with pride, but then he collapses to his arse on a chair, revealing another person in the room.</p><p>A woman.</p><p>My spine lengthens.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 she asks, her surprise evident.</p><p>\u2018Things have changed.\u2019 He reaches up and drags his palm through his hair. \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>I gulp. Is this it? Is this him officially quitting?</p><p>\u2018I won\u2019t take no for an answer, Miller. I need you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll have to find someone else.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Excuse me!\u2019 she laughs, flicking her eyes past Miller\u2019s seated form and catching me at the doorway.</p><p>I jump back out of sight, like she hasn\u2019t already seen me. She\u2019s mature, but very attractive, her ash-blond, perfectly styled bob fixed in place and her fingers wrapped around a wine glass. She has long, red talons for nails. That\u2019s about all I got a glimpse of before I stupidly hid and, feeling very foolish about it, I turn to make my way to the bedroom, trying in vain to steady my erratic heartbeat. He\u2019s declining her. My intervention isn\u2019t needed and I distinctively recall Miller saying the fewer people who know about me, the better. I hate it, but I have to follow his lead, given that I have no clue where we\u2019re headed.</p><p>\u2018Well, well.\u2019 I hear her smooth voice as I\u2019m making my escape, my shoulders jumping up to meet my earlobes. I know she saw me, but a silly little part of me was hoping my stealthy movement removed my body from view before her beady eyes captured me.</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>Now I feel like a peeping Tom, when she\u2019s the one who has invaded Miller\u2019s apartment in the middle of the night. Is she going to hand me his card, too, and tell me to keep it safe? Is she going to offer a share? After everything, I might skin her alive.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Miller\u2019s voice tenses my shoulders further.</p><p>\u2018You didn\u2019t say you had company, darling.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Company?\u2019 He sounds confused and, knowing I\u2019m completely rumbled, I back up and turn to face the music, showing my face just as Miller looks around to see what\u2019s captured his guest\u2019s attention. \u2018Livy.\u2019 His chair scrapes across the marble floor as he stands hastily.</p><p>I feel awkward and stupid, standing in a blanket with my hair all over my face and my bare feet shifting nervously.</p><p>Miller looks edgy, which isn\u2019t surprising, but the woman in his kitchen looks interested as she relaxes back in her chair and holds her wine glass to her deep-red lips. \u2018So we\u2019re entertaining at home now?\u2019 she purrs.</p><p>Miller ignores her question and approaches me quickly, turning me in his arms and pushing me gently from the kitchen. \u2018Let me put you in bed,\u2019 he whispers.</p><p>\u2018Is she one of them?\u2019 I ask, letting him lead me away. I already know she is. I can tell by the air of superiority surrounding her confident persona and her designer clothes.</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 he answers tightly. \u2018I\u2019ll get rid of her and come and join you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why is she here?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because she takes liberties.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She has,\u2019 I agree.</p><p>\u2018Darling!\u2019 Her cocky, self-assured voice has the same effect as the last time one of Miller\u2019s clients spoke. I tense under Miller\u2019s hold, and he tenses, too. \u2018Don\u2019t hide her away for my benefit.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not hiding her,\u2019 he spits over his shoulder, striding on. \u2018I\u2019ll be back in a minute, Sophia.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll look forward to it.\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s only at the mention of her name and the follow-up of her overconfident words that I realise she has an accent. European, definitely. It\u2019s mild but detectable. She\u2019s like the woman from Quaglino\u2019s, except brasher and more confident, and I wouldn\u2019t have thought that possible.</p><p>When I\u2019ve been directed into his room, he pulls back the neat covers and lifts me into bed, gently laying me down and resting his lips on my forehead. \u2018Go back to sleep.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How long will you be?\u2019 I ask, uncomfortable with him going back out to that woman. She\u2019s arrogant. I don\u2019t like her, and I definitely don\u2019t like the potential of her drooling all over Miller.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re in my bed and you\u2019re naked.\u2019 He pushes my hair from my face and nuzzles into my cheek. \u2018I want to have my thing with my habit. Please let me deal with this. I\u2019ll be as quick as I can, I promise.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay.\u2019 I resist latching on to him with my arms because letting go when he leaves will be too hard. \u2018Stay calm, please.\u2019</p><p>He nods his acknowledgment. One more kiss on the lips and he slips out of the room, shutting the door behind him and leaving me with only the darkness and my thoughts \u2013 unwanted thoughts, thoughts that if I give too much time to will drive me positively insane.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>I\u2019m tossing and turning, burying my head under the pillow, sitting up and listening for a commotion and deliberating returning to Miller, my anger bubbling. But when I hear the door handle shift, I\u2019m lying back down again, pretending I haven\u2019t just spent the last ten minutes driving myself nuts with thoughts of rules, restraints, hard cash and worrying about Miller\u2019s temper.</p><p>Dusky light floods into the room and within only moments he\u2019s pressed up against my back, moving my hair from my neck and saying hello with a wet lick up the column of my throat.</p><p>\u2018Hi,\u2019 I whisper, shuffling over until I\u2019m happy to have his face close to mine.</p><p>\u2018Hello.\u2019 He kisses my nose tenderly and strokes my hair.</p><p>\u2018Has she gone?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 he answers swiftly and assertively, but says no more, which is fine by me. I want to forget she was ever here.</p><p>\u2018What are you thinking about?\u2019 I ask when a long silence has stretched between us, him seeming happy to keep it that way but me breaking it to try and drag my mind away from night visitors.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m thinking how lovely you look in my bed.\u2019</p><p>I smile. \u2018You can barely see me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can see you just fine, Livy,\u2019 he argues quietly. \u2018I see you everywhere I look, whether it\u2019s dark or light.\u2019</p><p>His words and warm breath on my face settle me completely. \u2018Messy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018A little.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hum to me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t hum on demand,\u2019 he objects, looking a little shy.</p><p>\u2018Can you try?\u2019</p><p>He thinks for a few moments and then tucks me further into his chest, resting his chin on top of my head. \u2018You\u2019ve put too much pressure on me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Pressure to hum?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 he confirms simply, kissing my hair instead. It\u2019s a good compromise, but as the silence stretches and we\u2019re lost in a world of peace and comfort, holding each other, he overcomes the pressure of my request and begins to hum quietly, sending me into a deep, peaceful slumber. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Livy.\u2019 His quiet whisper stirs me, and I try to roll over but go nowhere. \u2018Olivia.\u2019</p><p>My eyes creep open, finding sparkling blues and his signature shadow covering his jawline, now even longer. \u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re awake.\u2019 He lifts onto his forearms and rubs his groin into mine, indicating his current hard condition. \u2018Shall we?\u2019 he asks, the potential of some Miller-style worshipping waking me up as if Big Ben were ringing from the side of the bed.</p><p>\u2018Condom,\u2019 I breathe.</p> <p>\u2018Done.\u2019 His hand wanders down my hip until he\u2019s at my entrance spreading my heated wetness on a little gasp of gratification. \u2018Were you dreaming of me?\u2019 he asks surely, replacing his hand on the mattress and rearing back.</p><p>\u2018Might have.\u2019 I\u2019m nonchalant, but then he\u2019s pushing into me and my attempts to appear casual diminish with one smooth thrust. \u2018Ooh,\u2019 I groan, lifting my arms and linking my fingers around his neck, the delicious fullness of him within me taking me to places beyond pleasure \u2013 just as Miller has promised.</p><p>I really was dreaming of him. I was dreaming that this was for ever, and not just a lifetime, but beyond that, too \u2013 a life of perfect preciseness in everything, especially when he makes love to me. I\u2019m over his finicky nature. It\u2019ll always fascinate me but, more significant than that, I\u2019m irrevocably head over heels, painfully and utterly in love with him \u2013 no matter who he was, what he did, and how damn obsessive he is.</p><p>The gliding of our bodies together exceeds pleasurable. He\u2019s looking down at me with total devotion, bolstering my feelings more and more with each and every careful pump of his hips. I\u2019m ablaze, rippling, breathing sharp gasping breaths in his face as my palms dampen from the sweat riddling his nape.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m desperate to kiss you,\u2019 he mumbles, pushing deep, holding himself as he reins in his laboured breathing. \u2018So desperate, but I can\u2019t deprive my eyes of your face. I need to see your face.\u2019</p> <p>I squeeze my internal muscles instinctively, feeling him pulse steady and slow.</p><p>\u2018Jesus, Livy, you put perfection to shame.\u2019</p><p>I want to counter his claim, but all of my concentration is going into matching the meticulous tempo of his dreamy hips, each drive firm and flawless, each retreat steady and controlled. The stirrings in the pit of my tummy are preparing to travel further down, preparing to erupt and send me wild with overwhelming sensations, and not just of the physical kind. My heart is bursting, too.</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly moving, being pulled up carefully to his kneeling lap and guided around time and time again. \u2018You fit me just right,\u2019 he groans, slowly closing his eyes. \u2018The only thing in my life that has ever been truly perfect is you.\u2019</p><p>In my blissed-out state, I manage to comprehend what that means, especially for a man who craves exactness. \u2018I want to be perfect for you,\u2019 I pledge, pushing my body into his, planting my face in his neck. \u2018I want to be everything you need.\u2019 I have no issue with admitting that. In moments like this, I see a man who\u2019s relaxed and content, not uptight and broody or unpredictable and dangerous. If I can help to shift some of these attributes from the bedroom into Miller\u2019s life when he\u2019s not worshipping me, then I will, every day for the rest of my days. The middle part of yesterday was a perfect start.</p><p>I feel hypnotised as I pull back and stare into his eyes, clinging to his hair and moving exactly where guided. The power he exudes from being so gentle is incredible, his speed and measure mind-blowing. He gasps, touching our foreheads. \u2018Sweet girl, you already are.\u2019 His head rolls, taking his lips down to mine, and we kiss fervently, tongues clashing and rolling as I\u2019m lifted and grounded continuously. \u2018You\u2019re too special, Livy.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018So are you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, I\u2019m a fraud.\u2019 His h*ps buck a little, enticing a collective cry from us both. \u2018Good God!\u2019 he yelps, raising his arse from his heels and kneeling, holding me against him with no strain at all. My head falls back as I grapple at his back, my ankles linking to gain more stability. \u2018Don\u2019t deprive me of your face, Livy.\u2019</p><p>My head is too heavy and rolling freely as the pressure accumulates and buzzes. I\u2019m going to burst. \u2018I\u2019m coming.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please, Livy. Let me see you.\u2019 He delivers the words on a lazy grind. \u2018Please.\u2019</p><p>I force myself to fulfil his plea, using what energy I have to pull against his neck to help me. I cry out.</p><p>\u2018Lie back.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I yell, closing my eyes, feeling my muscles contracting persistently. I can\u2019t control it any more.</p><p>\u2018Lie back.\u2019 His palm rests at the base of my spine, letting me lean against it, and he eases me down until my upper back is on the mattress and my lower body is held against his kneeling frame. \u2018Comfortable?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I gasp, bowing my back and plunging my fingers into my blond, knotted waves.</p><p>\u2018Good,\u2019 he rumbles.</p><p>The strain in his face tells me he\u2019s close, too, the rippling of his stomach an indication of the tension building. \u2018Are you ready, Livy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh Jesus, I\u2019m so ready.\u2019 His h*ps seem to take on a mind of their own as he shudders into me, the smooth fluidness long gone. He\u2019s shaking, clearly trying to hold his restraint, and I wonder again if it\u2019s a continual battle for him to prevent the hard fierceness that I bore witness to in the hotel.</p><p>That line of thought requires a clear mind, which I don\u2019t have right now. I\u2019m coming.</p><p>\u2018Miller!\u2019</p><p>He pulls his h*ps away and delivers a thrust that sends us both over the edge, Miller on a tight bark, me on a suppressed scream. His fingers are digging into my flesh as he pushes that little bit further into me, twitching, jerking and groaning.</p><p>I\u2019m wiped out, completely useless, struggling to even keep my eyes on Miller\u2019s post-climax, sweaty face. I welcome his weight when he drops onto me, keeping my eyes closed but making up for my loss of seeing him by feeling him everywhere. He\u2019s soaking wet and panting in my hair, and it\u2019s the most amazing feeling and sound ever.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 he whispers out of the blue, and I frown through my exhaustion.</p><p>\u2018For what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tell me what I\u2019m going to do without you.\u2019 He squeezes me ridiculously hard, putting a strain on my ribs. \u2018Tell me how I\u2019m going to survive.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miller, you\u2019re squashing me.\u2019 I practically gasp the words, but he only squeezes harder. \u2018Miller, ease up.\u2019 I feel his head shake in my neck. \u2018Miller, please!\u2019</p><p>He pushes up quickly from my body, dropping his head and eyes, leaving me gasping and heaving on the bed. He won\u2019t look at me. I rub some life back into my arms, my legs, everywhere, but he refuses to acknowledge the discomfort he\u2019s caused me. He looks worryingly beaten. Where\u2019s this come from?</p><p>I scramble to my knees to mirror him and take his hands in mine. \u2018You don\u2019t need to be concerned by that because I\u2019ve told you how it is for me,\u2019 I say calmly, reassuringly, quietly relieved that he appears to be as concerned by the potential of separation as I am.</p><p>\u2018Our feelings are irrelevant,\u2019 he says factually. His declaration makes me back up slightly.</p><p>\u2018Of course they\u2019re relevant,\u2019 I argue, a coldness I don\u2019t like settling over me.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 He shakes his head and pulls his hands from my grip, leaving mine to fall lifelessly to my thighs. \u2018You\u2019re right. I should have let you walk away from me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miller?\u2019 I can feel the panic begin to set in.</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t drag you into my darkness, Olivia. This has to end now.\u2019</p><p>My chest is beginning to crack open slowly. I\u2019m making his world light. What\u2019s the matter with him? \u2018You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying. I\u2019m helping you.\u2019 I try to take his hands again, but he pulls them out of my reach and gets up from the bed.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll take you home.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I whisper, watching as his back disappears into the bathroom. \u2018No!\u2019 Jumping up from the bed, I run after him, grabbing his arm and yanking him around to face me. \u2018What are you doing?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m doing what\u2019s right.\u2019 There\u2019s no feeling, no remorse or sorrow. He\u2019s shut down on me, worse than ever before, the mask fixed firmly in place \u2013 no suit required. \u2018I should never have let it go this far. I shouldn\u2019t have come back for you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It?\u2019 I yell. \u2018You mean us! There is no it, or you, or I now. It\u2019s us!\u2019 I\u2019m falling apart on him, my shaking body refusing to calm \u2013 not until he holds me and tells me I\u2019m hearing things.</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s you, and there is me.\u2019 He looks slowly up at me. His blue eyes are empty. \u2018There can never be an us.\u2019</p><p>His cold words stab at my splitting heart. \u2018No.\u2019 I refuse to accept this. \u2018No!\u2019 I shake him by the arms, but he remains impassive and detached. \u2018I\u2019m your habit.\u2019 I start to sob, the tears bursting from my eyes uncontrollably. \u2018I\u2019m your habit!\u2019</p><p>He pulls his arms away and steps back. \u2018Habits are bad for you.\u2019</p><p>My chest explodes open, exposing my shattered heart. \u2018You\u2019re talking rubbish.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, I\u2019m talking complete sense, Livy.\u2019 He walks away and steps in the shower, not even flinching as the unheated water pours all over him.</p><p>I\u2019m not giving up. There must be something wrong with him. My panic fuels my doggedness and I\u2019m in the shower, pushing at his body as he attempts to shampoo his hair.</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t get to do this to me again, not now! Not after everything!\u2019</p><p>He ignores me and rinses his hair before he\u2019s even really washed it. Then he hastily escapes me, exiting the other side of the shower, but I\u2019m relentless, shouting as I go after him. I\u2019m grabbing at his wet back, trying to stop him, but he shrugs me off, trying to dry himself and fight his way from the bathroom.</p><p>I\u2019m deranged, my heart pounding, my body quaking. \u2018Miller, please!\u2019 I cry, dropping to my knees and watching him disappear again. \u2018Please.\u2019 My head falls into my palms, like darkness and hiding might drag me from my nightmare.</p><p>\u2018Get up, Livy.\u2019 His impatient tone only serves to make me sob harder. \u2018Get up!\u2019</p><p>I confront his stone-cold face with my tear-drenched eyes. \u2018You just made love to me. I\u2019ve accepted you. You wanted me to forget that man and I have.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s still here, Livy,\u2019 he grinds harshly. \u2018He\u2019s never going away!\u2019</p><p>\u2018He was gone!\u2019 I insist desperately. \u2018He\u2019s never here when we\u2019re together.\u2019 That\u2019s not true, and I know it, but I\u2019m falling further into hell and I\u2019ll try anything to claw my way back.</p><p>\u2018Yes, he is,\u2019 he spits, leaning down and pulling my waiflike frame from the floor. \u2018I was stupid to think I could do this.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do what?\u2019</p><p>He recoils and releases me, waving up and down my body. \u2018This!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You mean feel?\u2019 I smack him on the chest. \u2018You mean love?\u2019</p><p>His mouth snaps shut and he steps back, clearly fighting to control his twitching body. \u2018I can\u2019t love you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t,\u2019 I murmur pitifully. \u2018Don\u2019t say that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018The truth hurts, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s that woman from last night, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 I ask, her smug face suddenly all I see through my fear. \u2018Sophia. What did she say?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s got nothing to do with her.\u2019 He stalks from the bathroom, and I know it\u2019s because I\u2019m working my way closer to the issue.</p><p>\u2018Did you really want to stop?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 he barks, swinging around and nailing me with incensed eyes, but he soon backs down, realising what he\u2019s said. \u2018No!\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Yes or no?\u2019 I scream.</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s happened since last night when you came back to bed?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Too f**king much!\u2019 He\u2019s gone from my sight, slipping into the wardrobe. I go after him again and watch as he yanks on some shorts and a T-shirt. \u2018You\u2019re young. You\u2019ll get over me.\u2019 He\u2019s refusing to look at me or acknowledge my words, the coward.</p> <p>\u2018Do you want me to get over you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, you deserve more than I can give. I told you from the start, Livy. I\u2019m emotionally unavailable.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And since then you\u2019ve worshipped me and given me everything you\u2019ve hidden from the world.\u2019 I keep my eyes on empty blues, desperately trying to find something in them. \u2018You\u2019ve destroyed me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t say that!\u2019 he yells, guilt clear in his tone and expression. He knows it to be true. \u2018I brought you back to life.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Congratulations!\u2019 I scream, outraged. \u2018Yes! You did, but the moment I saw light and hope, you\u2019ve cruelly slayed me.\u2019</p> <p>He recoils at my words that are nothing but truth, and with no worthy response, he passes me to escape his wrongs, ensuring no contact is made. \u2018I have to go away.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Where?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Paris. I leave at noon.\u2019</p><p>A sharp inhale of breath chokes me. The city of love? \u2018You\u2019re going with that woman, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 My heart is completely severed now, the thought of Miller, posh women, restraints, money, and gifts . . .</p><p>And all I can see is my mother\u2019s beautiful, selfish face. My face. And now Miller\u2019s face.</p><p>He will not do this to me! \u2018I\u2019ll get over you.\u2019 I straighten my shoulders and watch as he halts at the sound of my even promise. \u2018I\u2019ll make sure of it.\u2019</p> <p>He slowly turns and gives me warning eyes. I couldn\u2019t care less. \u2018Don\u2019t do anything stupid, Livy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve just relinquished your right to make requests, so you\u2019ll forgive me if I choose to ignore you.\u2019 I barge past him, fully aware of what I\u2019m doing and totally prepared to see my threat through.</p><p>\u2018Livy!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Have a nice trip.\u2019 I retrieve my damp dress and throw it on as I make my way through his apartment.</p><p>\u2018Livy, it\u2019s not as easy as just stopping.\u2019 He\u2019s coming after me, the sound of his bare feet slapping on the marble floor behind me getting louder as I hurry to the door. He\u2019s concerned now, my indirect promise spiking his possessive streak. He doesn\u2019t want another man to taste me. \u2018Livy!\u2019 I feel him grab my arm, and I swing around, boiling with rage, finding the mask lifting slightly. But the smidgen of hope doesn\u2019t stop me from lashing his cheek with my palm. His head snaps to the side and remains there while I attempt in vain to cool my temper.</p><p>\u2018Yes! You should have let me walk away from you!\u2019 I fire with complete resoluteness. \u2018You should have let me forget!\u2019</p><p>His face slowly comes back to me. \u2018I didn\u2019t want you to remember me like that. I didn\u2019t want you to hate me.\u2019</p><p>I laugh, stunned by his selfish motives. He doesn\u2019t care what anyone else thinks of him. But me? I\u2019m different? \u2018How honourable of you, but you\u2019ve made a fatal mistake, Miller Hart.\u2019</p> <p>He looks wary as he drops his hold of me. \u2018How?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because I hate you more now than I ever did when you made me one of your whores! Now you\u2019re just a coward. Now you\u2019re a quitter, a chicken!\u2019 I gulp down some calming breaths, feeling ashamed of my desperate behaviour and begging. He knows how I feel, and I know how he feels, yet he\u2019s the one walking away, when it\u2019s me who would be taking the biggest leap of faith here. It\u2019s me going against all of my rules and morals. It\u2019s me taking on the mountain of flaws this man has. \u2018I\u2019ll never let you have me again,\u2019 I vow. \u2018Not ever.\u2019 The grit in my tone is a surprise.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s undoubtedly a good thing,\u2019 he barely whispers, taking another step away from me, like he\u2019s concerned that if I\u2019m within touching distance, he might contradict his words. \u2018Be safe, Livy.\u2019</p><p>The double meaning in his statement is an insult. \u2018I\u2019m safe now,\u2019 I proclaim, turning my back on a man clearly torn and walking away from him for the last time ever.</p><p>My despair has vanished at his cowardly words and actions. I know how he feels. He knows how he feels \u2013 which makes him a weak, spineless coward.</p><p>Now all I want to do is hurt him. I want to take the most resilient part of him and destroy it.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>It\u2019s past nine at night, and I\u2019m wiped out by overflowing emotion, but my vengeful mind won\u2019t allow me to sleep. I\u2019m being spurred on, encouraged by resentment to stick the knife in and twist it continuously. Four missed calls from William haven\u2019t helped my state of mind. If anything, it\u2019s only encouraged me. I know without question that I\u2019m about to prove him right once and for all. I\u2019m my mother\u2019s daughter.</p><p>I no longer have my Ice membership card, but it won\u2019t stop me. Nothing will stop me. Bypassing the short queue, I present myself to the doorman, who performs a sigh of exasperation before granting me access without a word. I strut past him and head straight for one of the bars, taking in my surroundings, the music, the happy atmosphere. The music tonight seems dark, and playing right now is Faithless\u2019s \u2018Insomnia\u2019. It\u2019s purposeful. It\u2019s apt.</p><p>\u2018Champagne,\u2019 I order, resting my arse against the bar and gazing around at the blue glow engulfing Miller\u2019s club. It\u2019s rammed full of London\u2019s elite, the usual masses of well-dressed revellers filling every available space, but despite the amount of people closing me in from every direction, I know the security cameras will be focused on me and me alone. Miller will have given Tony the heads-up, and I\u2019ve no doubt the doorman has already advised Tony of my arrival.</p><p>\u2018Miss?\u2019</p><p>I turn and accept the glass of champagne, ignoring the strawberry and downing it. Then I immediately demand another. I\u2019m handed a fresh glass and, as I turn, I spot Tony striding across the dance floor in my direction. He looks fuming mad, and knowing what\u2019s about to transpire, I disappear amid the sea of people, taking off towards the roof terrace.</p><p>As I make my way up the frosted glass steps, I glance over my shoulder and smile when I see Tony standing where I\u2019ve just fled, looking around in confusion. He leans over the bar and speaks to the barman, who quickly shrugs before tending to a waiting customer. I see Tony bash his fist on the glass counter of the bar and swing around, scanning the club. Smug, I continue on my way until I round the corner and break the threshold of the giant glass wall, finding myself among a sea of people laughing, drinking and chatting, none of them taking a bit of notice of the stunning outlook.</p><p>I take a sip of my champagne and wait, and I don\u2019t have to wait for long. I catch the eye of a guy across the terrace and smile coyly before slowly turning away from him to enjoy the view.</p><p>\u2018Alone?\u2019</p><p>I leisurely pivot on my heels, coming face to face with him. He\u2019s dressed in dark jeans and a white shirt. My eyes drag the entire length of his body until I\u2019m at his face. It\u2019s a handsome face \u2013 clean-shaven and fresh, and his short brown hair is longer on top, combed to the side.</p><p>\u2018You?\u2019 I ask, relaxing in my pose and taking my glass to my lips.</p><p>He smiles a little and directs me to the edge of the terrace, his hand resting lightly on the small of my back. There are no internal sparks ricocheting around my body from his touch, but he\u2019s a man and that\u2019s all I need.</p><p>\u2018Danny.\u2019 He leans down and pecks each of my cheeks. \u2018You are?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Livy.\u2019 I glance up to the camera and smile as he takes his time introducing himself.</p><p>\u2018Pleasure to meet you, Livy,\u2019 he says as he pulls away. \u2018I love your dress.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019ve no doubt he loves it. It\u2019s tight and short. \u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re welcome.\u2019 His eyes sparkle.</p><p>We spend a short while chatting and I reciprocate when he smiles and laughs, finding it easy, but not because I\u2019m attracted to him. It\u2019s because I know cameras are focused on me from every direction, recording everything and saving it for Miller\u2019s eyes once he\u2019s returned from Paris.</p><p>\u2018Is there a protocol you like to follow?\u2019</p><p>I struggle to prevent my brow from furrowing in confusion. \u2018You mean whether I\u2019d like you to take me for dinner or just take me to bed?\u2019</p><p>He smirks. \u2018I\u2019m happy to do both.\u2019</p><p>My confidence wavers momentarily, but I quickly rein it in. \u2018We\u2019ll call the strawberry dinner.\u2019 I tip my flute and catch the fruit, making a point of chewing it slowly and swallowing even slower.</p><p>He follows suit and mimics my actions with a knowing smile. \u2018It\u2019s a stunning view.\u2019 He tips his empty glass towards the open space beyond, and I follow his indication to look.</p><p>\u2018I agree,\u2019 I muse, \u2018but I can think of far better ways to spend the rest of the evening.\u2019 My boldness should stun me, but it doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m on a mission \u2013 a dangerous mission. Miller isn\u2019t the only one with a mask. This is too easy.</p><p>Turning my eyes back to Danny, my lips tip seductively and he moves in, slowly lowering his face to mine until our lips brush. In an attempt to maintain my cool confidence, I close my eyes and conjure up images of Miller. It\u2019s weak and pathetic, but it\u2019s the only way I\u2019ll see through my cruel actions. Danny\u2019s lips don\u2019t help me achieve my objective; they feel and taste nothing like Miller\u2019s, yet I don\u2019t hold back. I let him kiss me, and I relish only in the knowledge of what this will do to the man I love \u2013 the man who I know loves me but is too much of a weak coward to fight for it.</p><p>\u2018My place,\u2019 Danny mumbles against my lips, slipping his palm onto my bottom. I nod against him and he immediately takes my hand to start leading me from the terrace. Miller Hart has ignited a dormant recklessness. I\u2019ve proven William right. I\u2019m my mother\u2019s daughter, and the realisation should send me into meltdown, but the only meltdown I predict is the cold reality of my life without Miller in it. He\u2019s a massive mess of complications and challenges, yet I crave him and all of the obstacles that accompany him.</p><p>We take the stairs, me following Danny, until we hit the ground floor. He pushes his way through the crowd, eager to escape the roar of people and gain some privacy. But then he halts and stuns me by kissing me again, humming into my mouth on a sigh. \u2018I might do that a few more times before we make it out of here,\u2019 he says, gently pushing his groin into my stomach.</p><p>I don\u2019t protest, mainly because I\u2019m jumping all over the fact that there is a camera directly above us, so I wrap my arms around his broad shoulders and let him have his way, my way of saying, Fine by me.</p><p>Dragging his body from mine, he reclaims my hand and leads on, stopping only a few more paces into his determined stride. But he doesn\u2019t kiss me this time. \u2018Excuse me,\u2019 he says, trying to sidestep someone, only for them to move with him. I can\u2019t see who it is. I don\u2019t need to see who it is.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re not leaving with the girl.\u2019 Tony\u2019s gruff voice makes me sag behind Danny, but it also boosts my resolve.</p><p>Danny turns to look at me. \u2018Ignore him,\u2019 I say tightly, pushing into his back, encouraging him to move on.</p><p>\u2018Who is he?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No one.\u2019 I take over the lead, tugging a bemused Danny with me. Tony can\u2019t stop me, and that will destroy Miller further.</p><p>\u2018Livy, quit the games.\u2019 Tony\u2019s annoyed growl pulls me to a stop.</p><p>\u2018Who said this is a game?\u2019 I ask shortly.</p><p>\u2018Me.\u2019 He steps forward, flicking warning eyes to a perplexed Danny, who\u2019s since dropped my hand.</p><p>Danny laughs. \u2018Okay, I don\u2019t know what the craic is, but you can leave me out of it.\u2019 He strides off, leaving Tony and me glaring at each other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Smart guy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why do you care?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then why bother intervening?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Because you\u2019ll get yourself in trouble.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll find someone else,\u2019 I spit, barging past him, my legs like jelly as I make my way back to the bar. \u2018Champagne,\u2019 I demand, once I\u2019ve fought my way to the front. Tony appears in front of me on the other side of the bar, shooing away the barman who was set to serve me.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re not being served any more alcohol.\u2019</p><p>My teeth grit. \u2018Why don\u2019t you mind your own business?\u2019</p><p>He leans over the bar, his own teeth grating. \u2018If you realised the damage you\u2019re doing, you\u2019d cut the shit, sweetheart.\u2019</p> <p>Me? Damage? My temper flares into dangerous territory. If I was operating on resentment before, then now it\u2019s in pure, raw rage. \u2018That man has destroyed me!\u2019</p><p>\u2018That man is shackled, Livy!\u2019 he yells, making me recoil. \u2018And regardless of what you and he ever thought, you can\u2019t free him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018From what?\u2019 I don\u2019t like the resolve in Tony\u2019s tone or the look on his round face. He sounds too certain.</p><p>\u2018From the invisible chains.\u2019 He speaks in a near whisper, but I hear the words perfectly over the deafening music and crowds. My throat starts to close off. I can\u2019t breathe. Tony is watching me absorb his statement, probably wondering what I\u2019m making of it. I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s talking in code. He\u2019s insinuating that Miller is powerless \u2013 a weak man. That\u2019s not true. He\u2019s very powerful, physically and mentally. I\u2019ve experienced both.</p><p>I remain silent, mind spinning, body shaking, unsure of my next move. I feel distressed and in the dark, my damn eyes beginning to sting with the onset of hopeless tears.</p><p>\u2018Go home, Livy. Get on with your life and forget you ever met Miller Hart.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Impossible,\u2019 I sob, my face quickly drenched as I lose the battle to retain my grief.</p><p>Tony\u2019s body deflates through the mist of water clouding my vision, and he\u2019s suddenly gone, but my body won\u2019t kick into action, leaving me standing at the bar, lost and useless.</p><p>\u2018Come with me.\u2019 I feel a hand gently take my arm and guide me away from the busy bar, through the club, and down the stairs to the maze beneath Ice. Tony\u2019s information, albeit vague and cryptic, indicates this isn\u2019t Miller\u2019s decision.</p><p>I stagger and trip in front of Tony, almost disorientated, and when we arrive at the door to Miller\u2019s office, he punches in the code, swings the door open, and guides me to Miller\u2019s desk. He places me carefully in the chair. \u2018I don\u2019t want to be here,\u2019 I murmur pitifully, blanking out the comfort I gain from being in one of Miller\u2019s perfectly precise spaces. \u2018Why did you bring me here?\u2019 He should have put me in a taxi and sent me home.</p><p>Tony shuts the door and turns to face me. \u2018There\u2019s something on the desk for you,\u2019 he says with zero enthusiasm, and I can tell it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t want me to have whatever it is. I cast my eyes across the glossy white surface, seeing the cordless phone in its usual spot, and in the centre of the desk is an envelope, placed so accurately, the bottom flush with the edge of the desk, only Miller could have put it there.</p><p>Instinct makes me sink into the leather of his chair, putting distance between the harmless piece of paper and me. I\u2019m cautious and certain that I\u2019m not going to want to read what\u2019s contained inside. \u2018From him?\u2019 I ask, not removing my eyes from the envelope.</p><p>\u2018Yes. He stopped by on his way to St Pancras.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m not looking at Tony, but I know he\u2019s just exhaled a silent stream of weary breath. My hand lifts slowly and takes the envelope, which has my full name scrolled across the front in writing I recognise. Miller\u2019s writing. The shakes are unavoidable, no matter how hard I try to control them, as I pull the note from inside. I\u2019m vainly attempting to regulate my breathing, but heart palpitations are making it an impossible task to achieve. I unfold the paper and brush at my eyes to restore my clear vision. Then I hold my breath.</p> <p>My sweet girl,</p><p>How did I know you would end up here? The security cameras have been turned off this evening by my request. If you choose to allow another man to taste you, then it is no more than I deserve, but I could never bear to witness it. Thinking about it is torturous enough. Seeing it could push me to kill. I\u2019ve hurt you and for that I hope I burn in hell when I arrive there. Of all my wrongs, you are my biggest regret, Olivia Taylor. I don\u2019t regret worshipping you or indulging in you. I regret the impossibility of my life and my inability to give you for ever. You must trust me and the decision that I\u2019ve made, and know I\u2019ve made it with a heavy heart. It kills me to say it, but I hope you can forget about me and find a man worthy of your love. I\u2019m not that man.</p><p>My fascination will never die, sweet girl. I can deprive my eyes of seeing you and deny my mouth from tasting you. But there is nothing I can do to heal my shattered heart.</p><p>Eternally yours,</p><p>Miller Hart</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I sob, all built-up air in my lungs rushing from my mouth on painful gasps. The H of Miller\u2019s name blurs when a tear hits the paper and makes the ink run down the page. The sight of the smudged, distorted letter matches me.</p><p>\u2018Are you all right?\u2019 Tony\u2019s voice breaks into my chaotic thoughts, and I lift my heavy eyes to another person opposed to our relationship. Everyone is hell-bent on breaking us, as I once was, too. And after all of Miller\u2019s loss of temper when he\u2019d feared I\u2019d lapsed in fortitude, it\u2019s now him.</p><p>\u2018I hate him.\u2019 I spit the hurtful words with total sincerity. This letter hasn\u2019t eased the pain. His words are conflicting, making coming to terms with his decision harder to accept. His decision. What about mine? What about me and my willingness to accept him and let him fill me with the strength I need to help him? Or is he beyond help? Is he too close to the depths of hell for me to pull him back? All of these thoughts and questions are only assisting in turning my pain into hatred. After everything we have endured, he shouldn\u2019t get to make this decision on his own. I drop the letter to his desk and stand sharply. He\u2019s hiding. He has hidden all of his life . . . until he met me. He showed me a man I\u2019m certain no one else has seen before. He hides behind manners that defy the brusque, arrogant arsehole and suits that defy the relaxed Miller when we\u2019re lost in each other. He\u2019s a fraud, just like he said.</p><p>A red mist engulfs me and I stumble past his desk, practically falling to the drinks cabinet on the other side of his office. I spend a few moments running my eyes across the perfectly placed bottles and glasses, my breathing loud and erratic.</p><p>\u2018Livy?\u2019 Tony sounds close and very alarmed.</p><p>I scream, deranged, swiping my arm across the surface, sending every perfectly placed item that adorned the unit smashing to the office floor on a loud crash.</p><p>\u2018Livy!\u2019 Tony\u2019s suddenly grabbing at my thrashing limbs, fighting to restrain me as I continue to shriek and battle against him like a woman possessed. \u2018Calm down!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Get off!\u2019 I shout, heaving my body from his grasp and sprinting across Miller\u2019s office to the exit. My legs are moving fast, in time to my thundering heart, taking me away from Miller\u2019s perfection, up the stairs and out into the midnight air. I all but throw myself into the road, giving a cab no choice but to stop or run me down. I jump in. \u2018Belgravia,\u2019 I pant, slamming the door and watching as Tony barrels out of Ice, his arms flailing violently at the doorman as he watches me pull away. I fall back against the leather, giving my heart time to recover, my forehead hitting the cold glass as I watch a dark London pass by.</p><p>London really has cast its black shadow.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>His apartment block looks uninviting, the glass-adorned lobby cold and silent. The doorman tips his hat as I pass, my heels breaking the eerie quiet and echoing around the vast space. I don\u2019t take the lift, instead pushing my way through the door that leads to the stairwell, hoping the energy it\u2019ll take to get me up the ten flights might dull down some of the anger burning a hole in my gut.</p><p>My plan fails. I fly up the stairs and find myself slipping my key into the lock of his shiny front door in no time, with no sign that my temper has cooled. Knowing exactly where I\u2019m heading, I run through his quiet apartment, into the kitchen, and start yanking drawers open. I find what I\u2019m looking for; then I fly down the corridor to his bedroom, taking the first door into his wardrobe.</p><p>As I stand at the threshold, armed with the most vicious knife I could find, I cast my eyes around the three walls that are all filled with rails and rails of bespoke and designer suits and shirts. Or masks. I see them as masks. Something for Miller to hide behind. His armour and protection.</p><p>And at that thought, I scream, deranged, and start yanking down the rows and rows of expensive garments. I begin slashing at the material, dropping the knife sporadically to rip the expensive fabric into strips. The power in my arms makes my task easy, my anger my friend, the knife only reclaimed and utilised to make random holes everywhere before I tear with my bare hands.</p><p>\u2018I hate you!\u2019 I scream, slashing through his racks of ties.</p><p>I\u2019m bordering the level of psychosis that Miller has shown all too often in recent days, and I only relent when every piece of his clothing is a mess of torn fabric. Then I fall to my arse, exhausted, my breathing laboured, and stare at the piles of ruined material surrounding me. It wasn\u2019t a given that my mission to destroy all of his masks would make me feel any better, and it doesn\u2019t. My hands feel raw, my face is stinging, and my throat is sore from screaming my way through my task. I\u2019m as big a wreck as the mess I\u2019ve caused. Shuffling back, I find the cabinet that sits in the centre of Miller\u2019s wardrobe and slump against it, my shoes lost amid the mess, my dress riding up to my waist. I just sit there in silence, heaving and panting, for the longest time, wondering . . . what now? Being destructive might momentarily divert me from thinking, but the relief is short-lived. There will come a point when I\u2019ve destroyed everything, possibly even myself. Beyond recognition. Then what will I do? I\u2019m teetering on the edge of self-annihilation already.</p><p>I let my head fall limply back, but jump when a loud crash rings through the apartment. My body stills, my breath catching in my throat. Then the hammering starts. I\u2019m immobilised by a familiar fear, just sitting here listening to the persistent bangs on the front door, my eyes wide, my heart fighting to break free from my chest. I look around at the mess surrounding me. And spot the knife. Picking it up slowly, I watch the blade glimmer as I turn it in my hand. Then I stand on shaky legs. Perhaps I should hide, but my bare feet start moving of their own accord, my hand gripping the handle of the knife tightly. I wade through the remnants of Miller\u2019s clothes towards the racket, cautious, wary, until I\u2019m tiptoeing down the corridor and emerging into the lounge. I can see across the room to the entrance hall, and I can see the door physically moving with each hard bang.</p><p>Then the banging stops and an unnerving silence falls. I go to step forward, choking down my fear, determined to face the unknown threat, but halt when the mechanical lock on the door shifts and the door bursts open on a loud curse.</p><p>I stagger back in shock, my pulse bursting through my eardrums, making me dizzy and disorientated. It takes a few frightening moments to register what I\u2019m confronted with. He looks unbalanced, a shocking thing for me to claim after the time I\u2019ve just spent in his wardrobe. He\u2019s a wreck, heaving and sweating, almost vibrating with anger.</p><p>He hasn\u2019t seen me. The door is smashed shut and his fist thrown into the back of it, splintering the glossy wood, making Miller roar when his knuckles split open, and me stagger back in alarm.</p><p>\u2018Fuck!\u2019 His expletive bounces around the colossal open space, hitting me from every direction, making me cower on the spot. I want to run to his aid or shout at him to notice that I\u2019m here, but I dare not speak. He\u2019s completely unhinged, leaving me wondering what the cause is for his violent lash-out. His own interference? I stand, distressed and disturbed, as his back heaves and the echo of his boom fades. It\u2019s only mere seconds before his shoulders visibly tense and he swings his messy body to face me. The perfection that is Miller is lost. The lump in my throat explodes, choking me, and I bite down on my lip to stop a sob from slipping past my lips. The sweat trailing down his temples is dripping onto his jacket, but he\u2019s unbothered by the potential of his posh suit being dampened. His eyes are wild as he stares at me; then he throws his head back again and yells to the ceiling before collapsing to his knees. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His head drops in defeat.</p><p>And Miller Hart cries \u2013 massive, body-jerking sobs.</p><p>Nothing could cause me more pain. Years of holding his emotions in check are pouring out of him, and I can do nothing more than watch, my heart aching for him. My own agony has made way for the torture this confounding man is suffering. I want to hold him and comfort him, but my legs weigh a thousand tons and refuse to carry me to him. I\u2019m useless. I try to speak his name, but achieve nothing but an agonised gasp.</p><p>A lifetime passes. I cry a lifetime\u2019s worth of tears and so does Miller, except for him it\u2019s probably literally. I\u2019m beginning to wonder if he\u2019ll ever stop when his injured hand lifts and roughly brushes over his stubbled cheeks, replacing the tears with smears of blood.</p> <p>His head rises, revealing a blemished face and blue eyes rimmed in redness. But he won\u2019t allow them to focus on me. He\u2019s doing everything to avoid making eye contact with me. Agitated, he pushes himself from the floor and moves towards me, making me retreat, but he passes me, still avoiding my eyes, and makes for his bedroom. After tossing my weapon on the round table in the hallway, I finally convince my dead legs to move and follow him. He strips out of his jacket, waistcoat and shirt as he strides across his bedroom, heading for the bathroom. His clothes are being tossed aside, his bedroom floor scattered in garments that are being torn from his body. Halting at the foot of the doorway to his bathroom, he kicks his shoes and socks off and then yanks his trousers and boxers from his legs, leaving him naked, his back shimmering in sweat.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t venture any further, standing silent in the doorway, his head lowered, his muscled arms outstretched to grip the door frame. Not knowing what to do but knowing I can\u2019t bear to see him in this state any longer, I begin to approach him gingerly, until I\u2019m close enough to smell his manly scent mixed with the clean sweat that\u2019s dripping from his body.</p><p>\u2018Miller,\u2019 I say quietly, lifting my hand and reaching for his shoulder, but when I tentatively rest my hand on his flesh, I have to resist yanking it back on a gasp. He\u2019s boiling hot, but I don\u2019t have to withstand the burning heat for too long. He hisses on a flinch, making me wince at his rejection, and paces to the shower, stepping in and turning it on.</p><p>He\u2019s frantic in his task. After grabbing the sponge and loading it with shower gel, he carelessly tosses the bottle to the floor before scrubbing at his skin. I\u2019m alarmed, not only by his uncharacteristic show of untidiness, but also by his urgency to clean his body, and so harshly. He\u2019s scrubbing, working the sponge everywhere, rinsing and reloading with more shower gel. Steam is quickly engulfing the huge space, telling me the shower is far too hot, not that he seems affected. \u2018Miller.\u2019 I take a few paces, getting more and more concerned the steamier the room becomes. \u2018Miller, please!\u2019 I slap my palm on the glass to try and get his attention. His hair is sopping and hanging all over his face, hampering his vision, but he\u2019s not deterred. There\u2019s a mixture of terror and anger being injected into the desperate motions of the sponge flying across his body. He\u2019s going to blister himself. \u2018Miller, stop it!\u2019 I try to enter the shower fully dressed, but jump out when the water makes contact with me. \u2018Shit!\u2019 It\u2019s scorching hot. \u2018Miller, turn the water off!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t stand it!\u2019 he yells, scooping the shower gel from the floor and squeezing the bottle all over his chest. \u2018They make my skin crawl! I can feel them through my clothes!\u2019</p> <p>My breath catches in my throat, his words registering loud and clear. But that\u2019s the least of my worries. He\u2019s going to injure himself terribly if I don\u2019t get him out. \u2018Miller, listen to me.\u2019 I try for a calming tone, but my voice is anxious, and I cannot help it.</p><p>\u2018I have to be clean! I need to remove every trace of them from me.\u2019</p><p>I need to get in and shut the shower off, but even from the outside the water is scalding me. \u2018Turn the shower off!\u2019 I shout, losing my composure. \u2018Miller! Turn the f**king shower off!\u2019 I\u2019m ignored, and when his scrubbing moves from his chest to his arms, I see angry red welts materialising on his pecs. It kicks my scared arse into action and before I can consider the pain I\u2019ll endure, I\u2019m in the shower, feeling the wall for the controls. \u2018Shit shit shit!\u2019 I yell as I\u2019m attacked by blisteringly hot water from every angle.</p><p>I push Miller\u2019s body out of my way, snapping him from his insanity, and frantically turn the knob to halt the infliction of pain on both Miller and me. When the water dries up above us, I roll my back against the wall, exhausted, my skin stinging and sore, and wait for the steam to disperse, revealing Miller\u2019s naked, motionless form. He\u2019s expressionless. There is nothing on that heart-stopping face, not even a hint of discomfort after tolerating the boiling shower for far longer than I did.</p><p>I move towards him and reach up to gently stroke the wet strands of hair out of his face as I gather the depleted air that has been sucked from my lungs. \u2018Don\u2019t ever try to push me away again,\u2019 I warn firmly. \u2018I love you, Miller Hart. All of you.\u2019</p><p>His tortured blue eyes drag slowly up my wet, slumped body and gaze longingly at me. \u2018How?\u2019 He asks the simple, reasonable question on a whisper. This man has tested my resilience to the absolute maximum. He\u2019s tossed me from crippling despair to crippling pleasure. He\u2019s made me reckless, stupid, blind . . . and he\u2019s made me brave.</p> <p>I can love him because he touches my soul.</p><p>\u2018I love you,\u2019 I repeat, feeling no need to justify it to anyone, not even Miller. \u2018I love you,\u2019 I murmur. \u2018I won\u2019t go down without a fight. I\u2019ll take anyone on and I\u2019ll win against them all. Even you.\u2019 My palm cups his nape and pulls his face to mine, watching as he scans my face with blank eyes. \u2018I\u2019m strong enough to love you.\u2019 My lips push to his, instigating our reunion, and my tongue delicately enters his mouth, coaxing a moan before he pulls away.</p><p>\u2018I couldn\u2019t do it,\u2019 he says quietly. \u2018I couldn\u2019t do it to you, Livy.\u2019 He lifts me to his body, my thighs curling around his hips, but I\u2019m mindful of his tender skin, keeping my hands on his shoulders. I can\u2019t stop my face from seeking the comfort of his neck, though. I lay my cheek on his shoulder and inhale him into me, feeling the solace he feeds me sink into my body through our contact. He couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>\u2018I want to worship you,\u2019 I say into his neck, my hot breath colliding with his heated skin. The mixture of the two is almost intolerable. I need to remind him of what we have. I need to show him I can do this. That he can do this.</p><p>\u2018I do the worshipping.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not today.\u2019 I unwrap myself from his body and lead him from the shower, taking him to his bed and pushing him down to the sheets. His tall body stretches across the mattress as he watches me arrange his limbs until I\u2019m sure he\u2019s comfortable. Then I kiss his impassive face and leave him to relax while I start running a bath. I ensure the water is only tepid and look through his ridiculously neat cupboard, making sure I don\u2019t upset his perfect arrangement of bottles, tubes and pots until I find some bath soak. The horrific mess that I\u2019ve left his wardrobe in is likely to make him disintegrate, but I\u2019ll deal with that later. I\u2019m not delusional enough to think that a picnic in the park and a kiss in the rain have eliminated Miller\u2019s obsessive ways completely.</p><p>Leaving the bath running, I remove my sodden dress and wander back into the bedroom, then start to collect his discarded clothes, probably the only ones that he still has intact. I fold them neatly and place them in a pile on a dresser, glancing up when I feel blue eyes burning my na**d skin.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I ask, shifting under his close scrutiny.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m just thinking how lovely you look tidying my bedroom.\u2019 He shifts onto his side and props his head on his bent arm. \u2018Continue.\u2019</p><p>The anguish dulls a little more, and I smile, making his blue orbs win a little sparkle back. It\u2019s familiar and comforting. \u2018Would you like a drink?\u2019</p><p>He nods.</p><p>\u2018Any preference?\u2019</p><p>He shakes his head.</p><p>I feel my forehead crease as I start to make my way from the room, glancing back over my shoulder, finding him following my path closely until he disappears from view. I\u2019m hasty, rushing down the corridor and across the lounge, landing in front of the drinks cabinet.</p><p>I swipe up a short glass, certain it resembles the ones that I\u2019ve seen Miller drinking from. Then I take on a really amateur tactic for picking Scotch, closing my eyes, waving my hand, and pointing at a bottle. Satisfied with my random selection, I pour the glass halfway, spilling some as I do. \u2018Shit!\u2019 I swear, clattering the bottle against the others when I put it back too clumsily.</p><p>Now I\u2019m hopeless for a whole different reason. The charismatic \u2013 if a little messed up right now \u2013 man in the room down the hall has refinement down to a fine art. I haven\u2019t.</p><p>I roll my eyes to myself and lift the glass to my lips, taking a big glug and immediately gagging at the taste. \u2018Oh God!\u2019 My lips smack together, my face screwing up as I hold the glass up and look at the dark liquid with disgust. \u2018Vile,\u2019 I mutter, swivelling and trekking back to Miller.</p><p>He\u2019s still on his side, looking at the door when I enter. \u2018Scotch.\u2019 I hold the drink up and his eyes travel across to the glass before landing back on me with a bang. But he says nothing, maintaining his quiet state.</p><p>I wander over to the bed thoughtfully, holding his eyes, and extend my arm once I\u2019ve reached him. His muscled arm lifts slowly and takes the glass. Then he blinks painfully lazily, making me cross my legs in my standing position to stop the pulsing from breaking out into a hard throb. Just the fact that these familiar traits are present is delightful, whether he\u2019s doing it on purpose or not. My huge bag of intensity is back, his messed-up condition aside. I can see bright, hopeful light.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve drawn a bath,\u2019 I tell him, watching as he lifts the whisky to his lips and takes a languid sip. \u2018It\u2019s not too hot.\u2019</p><p>He looks to the glass for a brief moment before making me melt with a slight tip of his wonderful mouth. \u2018Come here.\u2019 He flicks his head to follow up his demand, and I slip in beside him, letting him tuck me into his chest so he can sip his drink with one hand and stroke my hair with the other.</p><p>\u2018Your knuckles look sore,\u2019 I say, loving being back in my comfort zone even if the events that have brought me here are killing us.</p><p>\u2018They\u2019re fine.\u2019 He pushes his lips to the top of my head and says no more. I can feel and hear him taking frequent sips of his drink, and while I\u2019m happy tucked closely to his body, I\u2019d like to look after him and try to gently coax an explanation from him.</p><p>I reluctantly pull myself away from the hard, warm security of his chest and take his hand. He frowns but lets me help him up and lead him to the bathroom, bringing his drink with him. The giant bath is full enough, so I flick the tap off, then signal for him to climb in. He\u2019s quiet as he sets his drink down on a nearby counter, and I finally feel it appropriate to spend a few silent moments absorbing his nakedness while he\u2019s turned away from me. The muscles of his back are sharp, defined by the spotlights shining down, and the cheeks of his smooth backside are solid, drifting into long, lean thighs, then perfectly formed calves. I ignore the scratch marks. This impeccably formed man is perfectly flawed. He\u2019s damaged, more than me, and he believes he\u2019s destined for hell. I need to know why he\u2019s so adamant about his destiny. I want to be the one who changes his fate.</p><p>Miller turns and my gaze that was happily focused on his buns is now staring at something else firm and smooth and . . . ready. My eyes fly up to shimmering blues but a straight face. And I blush. Why do I blush? My cheeks are on fire as he regards me, my bare feet shifting as I\u2019m bombarded by pure, raw, inexorable shots of heated desire. I\u2019ve lost my poise completely. My earlier resolution is being beaten down by his intoxicating presence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I want to worship you,\u2019 I breathe, reaching back with shaking hands and unhooking my bra, letting it drop down my arms and tumble to my feet. His eyes drop to my knickers and I do as I\u2019m silently bid, removing them slowly. Now we\u2019re both na**d and his desire mixed with mine is creating a heady cocktail that\u2019s rife in the quiet air around us. I nod to the bath. It\u2019s that or fall to my knees and beg him to indulge me with some Miller-style worshipping, but I need him to see I\u2019m strong, that I can help him.</p><p>Licking his lips is his last-ditch attempt to make me fold. I struggle terribly but manage to sustain my strength, nodding to the bath again. His mouth doesn\u2019t smile, but his eyes do. He climbs the steps and settles in the bubbly water.</p><p>\u2018Would you do me the honour of joining me?\u2019 he asks quietly.</p><p>I answer by taking the steps unhurriedly, using the time to weigh up my best position, settling on behind him. A c**k of my head tells him to shift forward, which he does with a very slight pucker of his brow, allowing space behind him for me to sink into. I spread my thighs, slide my hands over his shoulders, and pull him back to my chest. His dark, wet waves tickle the side of my cheek and his body is a little heavy, despite the water lightening him, but I\u2019m coiled around him, breathing him into me, giving him my thing.</p> <p>\u2018This feels so nice.\u2019 His voice is soft and low. Peaceful.</p><p>I hum my agreement, encasing his shoulders with my arms, undoubtedly restricting his movement, yet there are no complaints. He answers my constriction by relaxing his head back and feeling out my lower legs that are linked and resting on his stomach.</p><p>\u2018This isn\u2019t going to be easy.\u2019 His words are spoken with an edge of pain. They confuse me. I already know that.</p><p>\u2018It wasn\u2019t easy yesterday or the day before, but you had fight in you. What\u2019s changed?\u2019</p><p>\u2018A reality check.\u2019</p> <p>I want to see his face, but I worry what I might find in his eyes if I do. \u2018What do you mean?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Some decisions I\u2019m not at liberty to make.\u2019 He utters the words quietly, reluctantly. The stiffening of my body is unavoidable, and I know he\u2019s noticed because he squeezes my calves almost in reassurance. I\u2019m not sure Miller feels any reassurance himself, so trying to comfort me is a silly venture.</p><p>I try to process what that could mean and come up with no obvious answer. \u2018Elaborate,\u2019 I instruct sternly, making him turn his face into my cheek and bite down lightly.</p><p>\u2018As you wish.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do,\u2019 I affirm.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m chained to this life, Olivia.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t look at me when delivering his shocking declaration, making me gently cup his rough cheek and pull his face up so I can see him, all the while Tony\u2019s words bouncing around in my head.</p> <p>I use his one-word demand again. \u2018Elaborate.\u2019 Then I kiss him tenderly on his beautiful mouth, hoping I\u2019ll give him back some of the strength he fills me with. Our mouths move slowly together, and I know he\u2019ll make it last for ever if I don\u2019t break it, so I do. Grudgingly. \u2018Tell me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m indebted to them.\u2019</p><p>I try to keep a brave face, but those words fill me with dread. There are two questions I need to ask in response to his statement and I can\u2019t decide which should take priority. \u2018Why are you indebted to them?\u2019</p><p>He blinks on an uncomfortable sigh. I can see him becoming more and more reluctant as the conversation progresses and the enlightenments unfold. His minimal answers are a sign. He\u2019s making me ask, rather than openly share. \u2018They gave me control.\u2019</p><p>Another puzzling answer, leaving a huge hole for further questioning. \u2018Elaborate.\u2019 I sound impatient when I\u2019m trying my hardest not to be.</p><p>He breaks free from my palm and rests his head back. \u2018Remember me explaining about my talent?\u2019</p><p>I stare down at the back on his head, wanting to remind him of his manners. \u2018Yes.\u2019 My reply is slow and cautious. It makes him shift slightly.</p><p>\u2018My talent earned me a certain amount of freedom.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I don\u2019t understand.\u2019 I\u2019m beyond confused.</p><p>\u2018I was a regular male prostitute, Livy. I had no control nor received any respect.\u2019 He spells it out, making me flinch. \u2018I ran away from the orphanage when I was fifteen. Spent four years on the streets. That\u2019s how I met Cassie. I broke into empty houses for shelter.\u2019 I gulp back my shock before I can interrupt his flow, but he turns and catches my stunned face. \u2018Bet you never considered your man was an expert lock breaker.\u2019</p><p>What does he want me to say to that? No, I didn\u2019t, but I also never considered that he would be an escort, a drug addict . . . I halt that train of thought immediately. I could be here a while. And Cassie. She was homeless, too?</p><p>Miller smiles a little and turns back away from my startled face. \u2018They found us. Put us to work. But I was beautiful and on top of that, I was good. So I was taken from the lowly and utilised to my full ability. Glamour and sex. I make them a fortune. I\u2019m the Special One.\u2019</p><p>I go cold, life itself draining from my body, horrible chills jumping onto my wet skin. It\u2019s happening too often. And I\u2019m struck dumb. Taken from the lowly? \u2018You\u2019re my special one.\u2019 I can\u2019t think of anything else to say, other than reinforcing my feelings for him, making him feel like more than a walking, talking pleasure machine. \u2018You\u2019re my special one, but special because you\u2019re beautiful and adoring, not because you give me mind-blowing orgasms.\u2019 I roughly kiss the back of his head, squeezing him to me.</p><p>\u2018But it helps, right?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well . . .\u2019 I can\u2019t say no. How he makes me feel physically is amazing, but it comes nowhere close to how he makes me feel emotionally.</p><p>He laughs lightly, annoying me, not because it\u2019s quite inappropriate to find anything about this humorous but because I can\u2019t see it. \u2018You can say yes, Livy.\u2019</p><p>I yank his face to mine, finding that mild boyish grin. \u2018Fine, yes, but I love you for reasons other than your sexual capabilities.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But I\u2019m good.\u2019 His grin widens.</p><p>\u2018The best.\u2019</p><p>His grin falls away instantly. \u2018Tony called me.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m tense again. Everywhere. The cameras were off, but Tony saw me. Would he have told Miller? I can\u2019t be certain, although Miller\u2019s loss of control outside Ice that time should make Tony\u2019s silence easy. He studies me, assessing my reaction. I must look as guilty as sin. \u2018I\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t tell me.\u2019 He turns away from me. \u2018I\u2019m likely to kill.\u2019</p><p>My eyes dart all over the bathroom, mentally thanking every god in existence for Miller\u2019s initiative in turning the cameras off. I hate that I reacted that way, and I hate that he predicted it. In an attempt to divert my guilt and Miller\u2019s thinking, I prepare my next question. \u2018And Cassie?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I convinced them to bring her with me.\u2019</p><p>I want to resent him requesting that, but compassion halts it in its tracks.</p><p>\u2018Being the Special One gives me clout.\u2019 He sighs. \u2018I choose my clients, arrange dates to suit me, and make my own rules. The no touching was a given. They don\u2019t need to touch me to achieve their aim, and I was sick of being used as an object. Kissing is intimate.\u2019 He detaches my snaked legs from his body and leisurely turns over so he\u2019s spread front forward on my torso and looking up at me. My hand reaching out and brushing his stray curl off his forehead is natural. \u2018Tasting someone is intimate.\u2019 He slides up my body and plunges his tongue into my mouth, moaning and biting gently at my lips. \u2018Once I\u2019d tasted you, I knew I was getting into something I shouldn\u2019t. But you taste so f**king good.\u2019 My legs rewrap around his tight waist and my desire rockets, the feel of him locked securely between my thighs making me wonder if I can ever bear releasing him. I think I understand him a little more now. Discounting our awful encounter in the hotel, he\u2019s done nothing but worship me. He lets me touch and kiss him. He wants intimacy with me.</p><p>\u2018Who are \u201cthey\u201d?\u2019 I ask into his mouth. Tony\u2019s confounding riddles are suddenly very clear. He knows. He knows who \u2018they\u2019 are.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll die before I expose you to them.\u2019 He bites my lip and lets it drag through his grip. \u2018Which is why I need you to trust me while I figure this out.\u2019 His eyes are pleading. \u2018Can you do that for me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s to figure out?\u2019 I don\u2019t like the sound of this.</p><p>\u2018So much. Please, I beg you, don\u2019t give up on me. I want to be with you. For ever. Just me and you. Us. It\u2019s all I see now, Olivia. It\u2019s all I want. But I know they\u2019ll do anything to stop me from having you.\u2019 Reaching up, he smooths down my cheek with a fingertip and runs his thumb across my bottom lip. He\u2019s answerable to someone \u2013 someone unpleasant. \u2018I owe them.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What do you owe them?\u2019 That\u2019s stupid!</p><p>\u2018They took me off the streets, Livy. To them, I owe them my life. I make them a lot of money.\u2019</p><p>I have no idea what to say, and I certainly can\u2019t fathom how \u2018they\u2019, whoever they are, can keep him in this world for ever. A lifetime debt is plain unreasonable. They can\u2019t expect that.</p><p>\u2018I haven\u2019t had sex with anyone since I met you, Olivia. Tell me you believe that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I believe you.\u2019 I don\u2019t hesitate. I trust him.</p><p>\u2018I know these women. I can\u2019t have people asking questions. I can\u2019t let them find out about you.\u2019</p><p>Realisation dawns as things begin to make sense, and panic settles deep. \u2018What about that woman in Quaglino\u2019s?\u2019 I remember her face, the shock, the delight, and then the smugness. She said she wasn\u2019t a gossip. I don\u2019t believe her.</p><p>\u2018I have too much dirt on Crystal and she knows it. I have nothing to worry about there.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m not even going to ask what dirt that is. I don\u2019t want to know. \u2018Tony and Cassie,\u2019 I remind him. I don\u2019t trust Cassie, not one little bit.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t have to worry.\u2019 He\u2019s adamant, and I\u2019m not sure if that makes me feel better or worse. Tied? Chained? He\u2019ll die before he exposes me to these people? Cassie and Tony know these people and they know the consequences of our relationship.</p><p>But how many people have seen us together? We\u2019ve been at the club, shopping, in the park. My eyes are darting everywhere. \u2018Anyone could have seen us.\u2019 I sound worried, which is just fine because I am.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve taken damage control where necessary.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wait!\u2019 I shoot my stare back to Miller. \u2018That time you found me at the hospital.\u2019</p><p>He recalls, and I know it because discomfort riddles his wet face, yet I don\u2019t bother giving him the chance to either confirm or deny it.</p><p>\u2018We were being followed, weren\u2019t we? You abandoned your car and took us down to the Tube because we were being followed.\u2019 How many times have we been followed? How many times have I been followed? \u2018Do they already know about me?\u2019</p><p>Miller sighs. \u2018There are signs. I was careless. I\u2019ve exposed you. I thought . . .\u2019 He takes a few moments and comes up with no thoughts.</p><p>Signs? I don\u2019t need clarification. My innocent mind is spinning.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve dealt with anyone who may have been an issue.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t ask, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>My lips straighten, jilted. \u2018That woman saw me in your apartment.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So what have you told her?\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s suddenly evading my eyes, so I yank his chin to me and purse my lips. \u2018I told her you were paying.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I gasp. \u2018You told her I\u2019m a client?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I had nothing else, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>I shake my head, not believing what he\u2019s telling me. Do I look like I would pay for sex? I wince when images of a thousand pounds scattered on a dining table jump all over my tortured mind. \u2018What happened after Sophia left last night? Why the change from coming back to bed to waking this morning?\u2019 He totally imploded, with no warning or reason. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018She said some things. Made me overthink.\u2019 He looks ashamed, and he bloody well should be when I\u2019ve been repeatedly chastised for doing exactly that. \u2018She pointed out my obligations.\u2019</p><p>Obligations? My f**king brain is in a whirlwind. \u2018And what happened today?\u2019 This I have to know. There seems like too many obvious cover-breakers to me, yet Miller seems confident of their silence.</p><p>He drops his eyes. \u2018I frightened myself.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018If I was punishing with these women before, then now I could be dangerous. I could hurt them.\u2019</p><p>I frown, wrestling his face up and seeing fear in his eyes, which only serves to escalate mine. \u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>He takes a long, controlled breath of air and lets it all breeze out with his words. \u2018Because when I look at any one of them, I see a reason why I can\u2019t have my sweet girl.\u2019 He lets me absorb his words for a few moments. I know what he means. \u2018I see interferers.\u2019</p><p>I clamp my lips together, tears stinging the backs of my sore eyes.</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t risk taking them when all I\u2019m seeing is that. They\u2019ll end up dead. But more importantly, I can\u2019t do it to us.\u2019</p> <p>A small sob escapes me and he pushes himself into my body, coating me everywhere, my arms locking around his wet back in a vice grip. \u2018You need to hide me,\u2019 I sob, hating the cold reality that Miller\u2019s life signifies.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to.\u2019 His mouth pushes into my neck and sucks softly. \u2018But they\u2019re going to make this difficult and I have to protect you. I\u2019ve tried to walk away from you, I know I should walk away, but I\u2019m too fascinated by you.\u2019</p><p>I smile through my sadness. \u2018I\u2019m too fascinated by you to let you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to fix this, Olivia. Don\u2019t give up on me.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m feeling strong and determined and I\u2019m going to transfer some of that into Miller. \u2018Never. I\u2019m going to worship you now,\u2019 I declare, turning my face into his. I don\u2019t know what lies ahead and that scares me, but a life without Miller terrifies me. I have no choice but to trust him and trust he\u2019s doing what he thinks is right. He knows these people. It\u2019s not just the women I need to worry about. \u2018Savoured, not rushed,\u2019 I whisper.</p><p>His face slowly moves towards mine. \u2018Thank you,\u2019 he murmurs, and then he swallows me up with a long, unhurried, delicate kiss, our tongues swirling dreamily as he rises and pulls me to his kneeling lap.</p> <p>\u2018I want to worship you,\u2019 I mumble against his mouth, feeling him taking over with his worshipping ways.</p><p>\u2018Your request has been noted,\u2019 he assures me, but doesn\u2019t relent on the kiss that he has complete control over, his hands running over every square inch of my back. \u2018And ignored.\u2019 He lifts from the water, taking me with him, holding me firmly against him as he negotiates the stairs and carries me across his bathroom, blindly collecting a condom from the cupboard before he heads into his bedroom. But he bypasses the bed, making me frown while he keeps up the delicious pace of his tongue. We\u2019re in the hallway briefly before Miller opens the door to his studio and carries me in. I smile, the disorder and chaos of the room warming me. He picks up a black device while holding me and presses a few buttons, and I nearly break down when Imagine Dragons\u2019s \u2018Demons\u2019 begins to seep from somewhere.</p><p>\u2018Oh Jesus, Miller,\u2019 I sob against his mouth, letting the words settle into the deepest part of me.</p><p>\u2018Let\u2019s paint perfect,\u2019 he breathes, resting my wet bum on the edge of the table that\u2019s running the length of a wall. I feel my body collide with things, sending them scattering across the surface, but there\u2019s no gasp of horror or rush to replace them.</p><p>Our kiss is broken, leaving me wheezing in his face as his lips part and he pushes me down to the cold table. The chilliness of the hard surface barely registers over my wet, blazing skin. I\u2019m burning up. Spreading my thighs, he positions himself between them. \u2018Shall we?\u2019 he asks, reaching forward and circling a nipple, sending a thrilling surge of blood to the tip of my sex. He really is the Special One. I could cl**ax now.</p><p>I nod, pulling in a sharp breath when he tweaks one of my tingling nubs, only gently, but my br**sts are sensitive, hungry for his touch.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve asked once.\u2019 His voice is rough, his question serious as he removes the condom and slides it on, his jaw tense.</p><p>My back arches and my heels push into his arse, pulling him into me. \u2018Please,\u2019 I beg, forgetting all plans of me worshipping him. My hands grip the edge of the table, my eyes clenching shut.</p> <p>\u2018You\u2019re depriving me, Olivia.\u2019 My nipple is taken and twirled between his thumb and forefinger gently. \u2018You know how that makes me feel.\u2019</p><p>I do, but he\u2019s sucking all of the reason out of me. My head starts shaking and my hands leave the edge of the table, delving into my sopping wet hair. I\u2019m losing my mind, and when his hand shifts down to the inside of my thigh and strokes a teasing circle close to my pulsing centre, I make my despair known. \u2018Miller!\u2019 My stomach muscles contract, pulling my shoulders from the table, and my arms fly out to the side, knocking pots of brushes and trays of paint everywhere. I\u2019m too sidetracked to be bothered and Miller is most unconcerned by the added mess, his eyes glinting, oozing victory. I\u2019m reduced to a convulsing mess of twitching muscles and erratic breaths. And he hasn\u2019t even touched me in my most sensitive place yet. It\u2019s all too much \u2013 his touch, my thoughts . . . the profound lyrics.</p><p>\u2018I make you feel alive.\u2019 He drives two fingers into me, his action pushing all breath from my lungs. I collapse back down to the table, looking up at his straight face. I might be mindless with the pleasure he inflicts on me, but nothing would distort the vision of penetrating blue eyes as they watch me writhe under his touch. They are hooded, but each blink is executed as slowly as ever, taking an eternity to close before being drawn back open. \u2018I make you wonder how you\u2019ll survive without my attention to this exquisite body.\u2019 Pulling his fingers slowly out, he circles his thumb over my twitching bud before surging forward again. \u2018Scream my name, Olivia,\u2019 he orders.</p><p>It\u2019s almost impossible not to close my eyes, but it is impossible to bite back my scream. I cl**ax. My body goes into shock, my hands grappling at nothing on the table as all air rushes from my mouth on a loud, piercing wail of his name in hopeless pleasure. He watches me, his face remaining impassive and his eyes remaining victorious, while I ride out the throbs and contract persistently around the fingers he\u2019s holding within me, deep and high. He keeps them there and lowers his torso over me, getting his face close to mine. \u2018And I constantly wonder how I\u2019d ever survive without the privilege of giving you this attention.\u2019 He kisses me sweetly on the lips. \u2018Especially this part.\u2019 I let him devour me while he gently thrusts his fingers in and out, slowly helping me down from my high, leisurely working my mouth on constant hums of appreciation.</p><p>I could never worship him this well. I\u2019m sure I couldn\u2019t make him feel this good and safe and secure.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to take my time making love to you now.\u2019 He nuzzles into my hair and peels his torso from mine, exposing my wet skin to the cool air of his studio. \u2018I\u2019m going to show you just how much you fascinate me.\u2019</p><p>My eyes follow him up and we regard each other while he withdraws his fingers and wipes them across his bottom lip. Then he licks them slowly. Then he just gazes at me. For a long, long time. His close scrutiny doesn\u2019t make me feel uncomfortable but, as always, it makes me wonder what\u2019s running through that multilayered mind of his.</p><p>\u2018What are you thinking?\u2019 I ask quietly, not resisting a little brush of my fingertip down the rippling muscles of his stomach.</p><p>He follows its path, letting me feel him for a time before taking my hand and lifting it to his lips. Each fingertip is kissed, my palm flattened, and my hand placed gently on my breast. \u2018I\u2019m thinking how lovely you look on my paint table.\u2019</p><p>I smile mildly, and he starts to move my hand, encouraging me to follow his guidance and mould my breast. A moan trickles past my lips and I sigh, long and peacefully.</p><p>\u2018You look lovely everywhere.\u2019 He moves his free hand down to his groin, gasping a little when he wraps his palm around the girth of his arousal. His jaw sharpens. \u2018You\u2019re just too f**king lovely.\u2019 Looking down, he guides himself to my opening and brushes across my entrance. I start to pant, motivating him to deliver another teasing, feathery tickle. It\u2019s too much.</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I shock myself with my little outburst and Miller\u2019s eyes flying to mine display his alarm, too. \u2018Don\u2019t drive me crazy, please!\u2019</p><p>His stunned eyes drift into knowing.</p><p>\u2018I know it delights you, but please don\u2019t torture me.\u2019 I\u2019m a desperate wreck and entirely unbothered by it. After today and everything that has happened, I don\u2019t need to be tormented or teased.</p><p>He says nothing and slowly pushes into me, transferring his hands to my h*ps and lifting me slightly. My worry diminishes, being replaced immediately with a serene, blissful sensation of calmness. Taking my other breast, I relax and let him carry me to ecstasy \u2013 that place where our troubles and challenges don\u2019t exist. That place I want to lose myself in for ever with Miller Hart. His worshipping. His mouth. His eyes. His thing.</p><p>His tall, powerful body pumps lazily into me, controlled, measured, his muscles rolling with each rotation of his hips, his lips parting as he watches me. There\u2019s no strain right now, nothing but easy pleasure, but his talent for delivering such exquisite gratification will quickly send me delirious, the heaviness in my groin already beginning to fight its way to my epicentre. I want this to last. I want to go on and on, so I clench my teeth and squeeze my muscles to try and halt the inevitable, or at least delay it somewhat.</p><p>His concentrated gaze isn\u2019t helping. Neither is the sight of the cut perfection of his body. Alone, each of Miller\u2019s addictive qualities is powerful. Combined, they are deadly. \u2018I love seeing this body trying to fight off the inescapable.\u2019 His palm releases my waist and splays across my throat, slowly dragging down the centre of my chest to my stomach. I moan my pleasure, arching my back, as he continues to flow into me, seeming to find it easy to maintain his steady pace, whereas I\u2019m on the brink of giving up fighting it off. \u2018I love how every muscle tightens.\u2019 He strokes soft circles over the tense muscles of my tummy, and I whimper, battling to keep my eyes on him when I want to throw my head back and scream his name. \u2018Especially here.\u2019 He pulls out and re-enters firmly, shifting his hand to my hip again and pausing while I rein in my shouts. He\u2019s panting, too, now, his wavy hair damp with sweat. \u2018Is it working, Livy?\u2019 he asks cockily, knowing the answer.</p><p>\u2018Nothing works.\u2019 I wriggle under his hold, my hands leaving my br**sts and beginning to flail to the side. I hit something again, but this time I feel a new wetness and I glance to the side to see my hand covered in paint and a pot of water tipped on its side, the murky paint-stained solution trickling down the table towards me. \u2018Oh God! Miller!\u2019 I throw my hands up and brace them on his forearms, digging my nails into his flesh. His jaw tightens, his face distorting, his head dropping back. But his eyes don\u2019t shift. I hold my breath, the sparks winning and fighting their way to my core.</p><p>I get rewarded with his continued, neat rhythm. Lazy advances. Lazy retreats. Lazy grinds. Everything is slow and so purposeful.</p><p>\u2018How?\u2019 I cry, the mystery spiking annoyance in my wanton state. \u2018How can you remain so controlled?\u2019</p><p>He moves, shifting his feet to gain more stability, and takes my hands, threading his fingers through mine and clamping down. \u2018Because of you.\u2019 His arms are used as leverage, pulling my body up slightly with each smooth thrust. I bite down on my lip, accepting drive after drive. \u2018I want to treasure every moment I get to spend with you.\u2019 His strong arms pull hard and hurl me up, sending him deeper on a shout, me on a cry. Our chests collide and he stills, letting me adjust to the inconceivably deep penetration. He breathes in my face, shallow, laboured, pleasure-filled gasps. \u2018I taste you and I want to relish in every moment I get to indulge in you.\u2019 His lips capture mine in a ravenous kiss, his groin swivelling, finding its earlier tempo. \u2018Jesus, Olivia, I wish I could devote every moment of the day and night to worshipping you.\u2019 The softness of his luscious mouth loses a bit of tenderness when he pushes further into me, his kiss now carnal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My craving for my confounding part-time gentleman intensifies. But our reality dulls it. He can\u2019t devote every moment of the day and night to me. He\u2019s chained, and it makes me feel so incredibly helpless. \u2018One day,\u2019 I push the words through our sensual kiss, moving my mouth and biting at his lip before plunging my tongue back in, pushing my br**sts into his chest.</p><p>\u2018Soon,\u2019 he says, nudging my head to the side, homing in on my throat and sucking on my clammy skin. \u2018I promise you. I won\u2019t let you down,\u2019 he whispers into the crook of my neck, kissing softly before encouraging me to pull away from the security of his chest. He gazes at me, filling me with determination and strength. \u2018I won\u2019t let us down.\u2019</p><p>I nod, and then let him lower me back to the table. My hands are released and he reaches to the side of me, collecting something and returning his hands to my stomach. I look down and see the tip of his index finger caked in red paint. Slightly bemused, I flick my eyes to his, seeing him focused on my tummy. Then he slowly drags his finger across my skin, starting to gently thrust into me again, reviving the lingering cl**ax. I begin to tingle and take immense satisfaction from watching Miller concentrate on his task while he effortlessly lets his body flow into mine.</p><p>He\u2019s calm and slow in both of his missions, drawing on my tummy and making love to me. But I\u2019m running out of time. \u2018Miller,\u2019 I gasp, my spine bowing, my fists balling. I\u2019m tipping the edge, bubbling.</p> <p>\u2018I love feeling you,\u2019 he whispers, his h*ps bucking a little, enticing a yelp from me and a gruff shout from him. \u2018You\u2019re pulsing around me,\u2019 he pants. \u2018Fucking hell, Olivia!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please!\u2019 I plead, my head beginning to thrash as I\u2019m tossed into a whirlwind of intense sensations. I can\u2019t escape it. I\u2019m going to shatter. Both of his hands grab my thighs and start pulling me onto him, not incredibly hard, but considerably more powerful than his usual composed tactics. \u2018Oh!\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m desperate to pull myself together, gain a bit of control amid my crazy pleasure, just so I can focus on his face as he cl**axes. I look up to him, going dizzy when he throws his head back, his jaw set to crack from the pressure of his teeth gritting. Now our bodies are slapping together, each collide spiking shouts of pleasure.</p><p>And then it happens.</p><p>For both of us.</p> <p>Miller slams into me on a roar, stilling and pushing deep, and I scream his name. I burst. I can\u2019t see straight, my internal muscles going into spasm to match my body.</p><p>\u2018Oh my God,\u2019 I exhale on a long, satisfied rush of breath, finally gaining something close to normal vision, finding his chest pumping and his face dripping in sweat. Looking down to my stomach, I catch a glimpse of a few lines, but his palm is quickly covering the letters and smudging them, spreading the paint everywhere, the words now a big smear of red dye.</p><p>Then his body collapses onto me, his lips finding mine. \u2018I lost it. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so, so sorry.\u2019 Paying some special attention to my mouth, he smothers me. Body. Mouth . . . Heart.</p><p>I smile and embrace him, taking him in my arms and returning his kiss. \u2018There was feeling,\u2019 I say quietly into his mouth. The absence of it during my encounter with the punishing escort was the issue, not necessarily how hard he took me. It was how unloving and detached he was.</p><p>His face hides in the hollow of my neck. \u2018Did I hurt you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I assure him. \u2018The only pain I feel is when we\u2019re apart.\u2019</p> <p>He slowly lifts, revealing his chest covered in paint. \u2018We just painted perfect, sweet girl.\u2019</p><p>I smile on a breathy exhale. \u2018Hum to me.\u2019</p><p>He matches my smile, giving me one of his most beautiful traits. \u2018Until there is no breath left in my lungs.\u2019</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>There\u2019s something to be said about making the perfect cup of coffee, but I\u2019ll struggle without the aid of an all-singing all-dancing coffee machine, and leaving Miller\u2019s apartment without him is not an option right now.</p><p>I stand in my knickers and one of Miller\u2019s black T-shirts, scanning the lengths of worktop in his kitchen looking for a kettle . . . and don\u2019t find one. In fact, I don\u2019t find much at all \u2013 no toaster, chopping boards, kitchen towels, or any kitchen-related gadgets, for that matter. Every available space is free from clutter. Deciding Miller\u2019s obsessive tidy habit must mean he\u2019s hidden everything away, I start opening cupboards on the hunt for a kettle. I work my way around the rows of base and wall cabinets, swinging each open in turn, getting more and more exasperated with each cupboard that I venture into. All of the contents are stored too perfectly, although it does mean I can quickly see what\u2019s hidden within. But I still find no kettle. I close the last cupboard on a frown and begin tapping my fingers on the empty work surface, but I\u2019m distracted from the mystery of an absent kettle when my skin starts to tingle mildly. My fingers pause and I smile, keeping my back to the doorway, the tingles building up into a delicious flurry of internal sparks.</p><p>\u2018Boom,\u2019 he whispers onto the back of my neck, making every nerve ending explode. Firm hands slide beneath my T-shirt and take my na**d waist, turning me in his arms. I come face to face with a nude, sleepy Miller. \u2018Morning.\u2019 His lips move sleepily, too, hypnotising me momentarily.</p><p>\u2018Morning.\u2019</p> <p>He smiles, swooping down to claim my mouth. \u2018I just had quite a shock,\u2019 he says against my lips, nibbling between words.</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because I just ventured into my wardrobe.\u2019 He pulls back and eyes me while I press my lips together, shame and guilt attacking me. Oh God, he\u2019s . . . calm. I relax but feel wary of his reaction to his shredded wardrobe. His head tilts. \u2018Or I suppose rag shop is more apt now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll replace them,\u2019 I promise sincerely, thinking my mother\u2019s mass of stored cash probably won\u2019t even cover it. \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>His palm slips into my locks at the back of my head and I\u2019m pulled forward until his lips meet my forehead. \u2018I\u2019ve already forgiven you. Looking for something?\u2019</p><p>\u2018A kettle,\u2019 I answer, lifting my eyes to his, staggered by his calm persona.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t have one.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How do you make hot drinks, then?\u2019 My hands slide up his arms to his shoulders as he lifts me onto his worktop.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer, instead leaving me on the counter and moseying over to the sink. I\u2019m curious, but not enough to convince my eyes to watch what he\u2019s doing, rather than watch the incredible vision of his backside tensing with each step. My head cocks thoughtfully on a satisfied smile, and then he turns and I\u2019m suddenly not focused on his buns any longer.</p><p>\u2018Earth to Olivia.\u2019 His soft tone has my line of sight diverting up his torso slowly, eventually arriving at a knowing hint of a smile. He flicks his head in indication for me to look, and I see him press a button on a chrome, state-of-the-art tap. Steam immediately billows from the head. \u2018Instant boiling water.\u2019</p><p>I roll my eyes and rest my hands in my lap. \u2018How very tidy,\u2019 I muse mockingly. \u2018I bet you peed your pants with excitement when that was invented.\u2019</p><p>His lips purse in an attempt to prevent his smile. \u2018It\u2019s a damn good idea, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, for obsessive-compulsives like you, who hate clutter, it\u2019s perfect.\u2019</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s no need for insolence.\u2019 He flips it off and immediately gets a cloth from under the sink to wipe away the water drops that his little demonstration has left behind. It doesn\u2019t escape my notice that he fails to challenge my reference to OCD, and I don\u2019t bother telling him that there really is a need for insolence, choosing to goad him further instead.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m proud of you,\u2019 I tell him, casually casting my eyes around his kitchen with interest, knowing he\u2019ll be studying me curiously.</p><p>\u2018You are?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes. You\u2019ve placed me on your work surface, making it look a little messy, and exposed yourself to some risks.\u2019 My eyes arrive back at Miller\u2019s naked, inquisitive form.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m good at assessing and mitigating risks.\u2019 He takes a few steps towards me, his eyes turning hungry. \u2018But I need to know what the risks are in order to do so.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good point.\u2019 I nod agreeably, stopping my stare from dropping below his neck. I can see from the smoke in his eyes that he\u2019ll be firming up. Catching a glimpse will toss me into surrender mode and I\u2019m having too much fun poking fun at him. \u2018I\u2019ll tell you the risk.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Please do,\u2019 he whispers, low, deep and seductively. My ni**les pucker.</p><p>I slowly remove my T-shirt and swing my bare legs onto the counter, lying flat on my back, my body spread along the length of marble. Maintaining my nonchalance is difficult with a na**d Miller in such close proximity, and even harder when the cold of the marble spreads across my skin. I hold on to my gasp of shock and turn my head to the side to see him.</p><p>He\u2019s smiling, and it punches the stored air from my lungs fast so I can mirror his happiness. \u2018I don\u2019t see this as a risk.\u2019 His eyes skate from my face, all the way to my toes and work slowly up my horizontal body again. The lust in his gaze hits me between the thighs like a sledgehammer. I\u2019m squirming under his obvious intent that\u2019s seeping from his every na**d pore. \u2018I see this as an opportunity.\u2019</p><p>I grip my bottom lip between my teeth and follow his remaining steps until he\u2019s looming over me.</p><p>\u2018Raise your knees,\u2019 he orders gently, his instruction making the pressure of my teeth increase on my lip. \u2018Now, Olivia.\u2019 That authoritative tone is all it takes. I have no shyness, no reluctance or holding back. My knees lift until the soles of my feet are flat on the counter, anticipation for his touch consuming me. I\u2019m zinging from head to toe. He slips his fingers into the top of my knickers and lazily draws them down my thighs, encouraging me to lift my feet when he reaches them. The small, cotton garment is folded neatly and placed accurately on the side before his palms rest on my thighs and pull them apart. I gulp down air and close my eyes, waiting for his next move. \u2018Fingers or tongue?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t care,\u2019 I exhale on a breathy gasp. I\u2019ll take anything. \u2018Just touch me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You sound desperate.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I am,\u2019 I admit, unashamed. He winds me up into a coil of desire and desperation, then teases and tortures me with his expert worshipping ways. It\u2019s excruciating and wonderful all wrapped into one.</p><p>\u2018Fingers,\u2019 he decides, tickling my entrance with a skim of his thumb across my heated flesh. My back bows violently, and I cry out. \u2018That way I get to kiss you if I choose.\u2019</p><p>My eyes open and I find him braced on one arm over me, his face hovering close to mine and his wayward wave of hair tickling his forehead. I remain quiet and endure the agonising wait for another dash of contact as he scans my face. And then it happens and I find my head lifting without thought to capture his lips. Only one finger is half submerged within me, and my greedy muscles try their hardest to hold on to it, tensing harshly, but he pulls out and separates our mouths. I moan despairingly, letting my head rest back down as I pant and twitch.</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t call the shots, sweet girl,\u2019 he warns cockily, stirring my impatience.</p><p>\u2018You always say you\u2019ll do anything I want.\u2019 I\u2019m using his own promise against him, even though I know full well he wasn\u2019t referring to sexual acts.</p><p>\u2018I concur.\u2019 He gets his lips as close to mine as they can be without touching. \u2018But you haven\u2019t told me what you want.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You.\u2019 I don\u2019t hesitate.</p><p>\u2018You have me already. Tell me what you want me to do to you.\u2019 He\u2019s just as speedy with his counter, making my cheeks flush as I grasp his intention. He wants instructions? \u2018Come on, Livy. Think of it as a method statement to support our assessing and mitigating of risks.\u2019 There\u2019s an element of mocking to his tone, which both deepens my blush and sparks a bit of sass. So on a long, confidence-boosting inhale of oxygen, I locate that sass and mentally grab it with both hands, ensuring it can\u2019t disappear on me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Enter me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018With what?\u2019 he deadpans.</p><p>\u2018Your fingers,\u2019 I breathe, seeing instantly that he doesn\u2019t just want instructions. He wants exact, step-by-step commands.</p><p>\u2018Ooh, I see.\u2019 He conceals his amusement well, glancing down at his hand hovering between my thighs. \u2018Hadn\u2019t I ought to check your\u2019 \u2013 he pouts and thinks for a second \u2013 \u2018condition?\u2019</p> <p>Damn him! I\u2019m growing aggravated, my own fingers prepared to do the job if he doesn\u2019t get on with it. \u2018Miller, please.\u2019 I immerse myself in darkness, closing my eyes in desolation. I\u2019m bursting at the seams with need, the heaviness between my thighs pushing deep and starting to throb eagerly.</p><p>\u2018Focus, Livy.\u2019 He pushes my thighs apart again when I attempt to close them to suppress the pulsing.</p><p>\u2018You make it too hard!\u2019 I shout on a futile thrash of my body. Two big palms press into my shoulders, holding me still, and I open my lids to come nose to nose with a triumphant glimmer in deep, satisfied blues. My hand instinctively reaches up and grabs his hair, giving it a bold yank in frustration.</p><p>It has zero effect. He prises my fingers from his dark waves and places my hand on my tummy, giving it a little warning squeeze on a serious face. \u2018I love your sass,\u2019 he whispers, ghosting his lips across mine, flirting, and though I know I won\u2019t get blessed with a heart-stopping kiss, my body responds and lifts in a vain attempt to catch them anyway.</p><p>\u2018You want to taste me?\u2019 he mumbles, only allowing a slight friction of our mouths, denying me the full-on contact. \u2018Do you want to swallow me up and lose yourself in me for ever?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yes!\u2019 My frustration grows as he continues to refuse me the contact I\u2019m demanding.</p><p>\u2018Do you remember who can sate this unyielding need?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You,\u2019 I moan as I squirm beneath the brief contact of his fingers at my entrance.</p><p>He pulls away from me quickly, his sanctimonious expression morphing into something else. I\u2019m not sure what. But I can only compare it to glory. He looks like he\u2019s struck gold. To anyone else, his face is expressionless, blank . . . untelling, but to me it\u2019s spelling a million words of happiness. Miller Hart is happy. He\u2019s content. And I know for sure that that has never happened in the history of Miller. \u2018I don\u2019t just want to be the man who can give you mind-blowing orgasms.\u2019</p><p>My pleasure and musing is interrupted by his statement, and I immediately notice the glory in his eyes has fallen away. I\u2019m a trifle confused. \u2018You always say it,\u2019 I argue quietly, my fizzing settling under his uncertainty. I\u2019ve vowed to make him feel like more than a walking, talking pleasure machine, yet he seems to be happy with the praise he\u2019s rewarded with when we\u2019re intimate. He demands it, working me up into a frenzy and basking in the begging he draws. He deserves it, by God, he needs a medal, but I never considered for a moment that I might be making him feel used. He likes me pleading for his touch. It makes him feel wanted. Needed.</p><p>Everything dies within me when I consider the horrific thought of him pinning the same statement to every woman he\u2019s taken. Does he deliver such compelling words to them? Probably. It\u2019s his job. Does he make them feel as amazing as he makes me feel? I know he does.</p> <p>Miller is brooding when in the heat of the moment, and he\u2019s flaming hot when armed with a belt and a four-poster bed. \u2018Do you express this much passion to every woman you\u2019ve ever taken?\u2019 My question shocks me, especially since I only planned on considering it silently. My subconscious wants an answer.</p><p>\u2018Everything you get from me is natural instinct, Olivia Taylor. I\u2019ve never been fascinated before. I\u2019ve never given all of me before. You get all of me. Every f**ked-up little piece. And I pray every second of every day that you\u2019ll never give up on me, even if I do.\u2019 He pushes his lips gently to mine and leaves them lingering for what seems like for ever, injecting me with strength, intensifying my love. \u2018Keep me in this beautiful light place with you.\u2019 He releases me and hits me with pleading eyes. \u2018Don\u2019t let me fall back into darkness, I beg you.\u2019</p><p>I absorb his words, immobilised under his clear blue gaze. Hearing him reaffirm his feelings, express himself so well, should hold my contentment firm. But I heard the negative line in his statement. Even if I do.</p><p>I\u2019m too aware of Miller\u2019s recent actions. The right words from the wrong people could send him spiralling back into that dark place and only my strength can pull him back.</p><p>\u2018Stroke me,\u2019 I order softly, \u2018with your fingers.\u2019 I take his hand and guide it to the apex of my thighs. \u2018Then enter me and thrust gently.\u2019</p><p>He nods in wordless acknowledgment and braces his hand on the counter as his touch finds me. My breath catches. \u2018Let me taste you,\u2019 he whispers, bringing our faces closer together.</p><p>My response is mechanical, no thoughts necessary, and I lift and seal our mouths on a groan, wrapping my arms around his neck. Every muscle I possess hardens in preparation, my thighs dropping further open, inviting more of him into me. His efforts are lazy and measured, two fingers gliding perfectly across my flesh and working me up deliciously. I\u2019m breathless, my kiss becoming predictably harder as my pleasure builds.</p><p>I gasp, sucking at his bottom lip before letting my head fall back to the worktop.</p> <p>His eyes are hooded, his laboured breathing matching mine, as he maintains the steady slipping of his fingers over my throbbing flesh. \u2018Jesus, Olivia.\u2019 His head drops limply as he finally breaches the threshold of my entrance with his fingers and puts some weight behind his caresses, pushing into me on a low moan.</p><p>My chest flies up on a delirious shout. \u2018Miller!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fuck! I love hearing you scream my name.\u2019 He withdraws and thrusts forward again, the power of his drive not just evident by my continued moans and cries, but clear on the cut edges of his strained face. I\u2019m fighting the urge to squeeze my eyes shut, desperate to lose myself in dark pleasure, but more desperate to watch him. There\u2019s wonder past the dark desire of his addictive eyes, but I lose the glorious sight when he dips and encases my tingling nipple with the heat of his mouth. It catapults me into sensory overload. I start to shake.</p><p>\u2018Oh God!\u2019 My hands in his hair apply pressure, pushing him onto my breast, and my h*ps start lifting, meeting the pumping of his fingers. Every nerve ending is buzzing uncontrollably, my head shaking, my thoughts scattered. I begin to feel my cl**ax take hold, the pleasure dominating every inch of me shifting to one spot, set to explode. And with a nip of my nipple and a deep rotation of strong fingers within me, it happens.</p><p>The world ceases to rotate on its axis. Life stops. My mind goes blank. There\u2019s a distant sound of groaning and once I\u2019ve overcome the initial onslaught of harsh pleasure, I drop my head to the side in exhaustion and peel my eyes open to find Miller at full height, looking down at me as he strokes me softly between the thighs, easing me lightly down. His arousal is thick, pulsing and protruding proudly from his groin.</p><p>I don\u2019t speak, mainly because I haven\u2019t the energy, but I do find a little strength to reach to the side and take a gentle hold of him, wiping my thumb across the swollen head to smear the bead of cum that\u2019s leaking from the tip. Miller hisses, the muscles of his chest quivering aggressively while he battles to cope with my touch. He\u2019s pulsing incessantly, and I can see his heart pounding in his chest. It takes just one delicate swipe of my fisted hand around him to tip him. He knocks my hand out of the way and lifts to rest his iron length on my tummy, groaning, his head rolling as he spills all over me. The warmth of his essence coating me has my body relaxing back into the marble on a lengthy, gratifying sigh. I\u2019m floating in a magical land of perfection.</p><p>\u2018Sleepy?\u2019 His rough voice tickles my ears, and I hum, closing my eyes. His hand gently breaks away from between my thighs and rests on my tummy. Then he spreads his cum everywhere, up to my boobs and down to my legs. I\u2019m coated. And I couldn\u2019t care less. He dips and pecks my lips, encouraging me to open up to him. I let him drench my mouth with his attention. I could fall asleep here on this solid work surface.</p><p>\u2018Come on.\u2019 He pulls me up to a sitting position and muscles between my spread legs, all the while keeping up our kiss. My arms are positioned over his shoulders, he cups my bum, and pulls me in. \u2018You can help me make breakfast.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can?\u2019 I blurt, making him pull back on an inquisitive frown. Messing up his worktop, his clothes . . . me. And now I can help him make breakfast in his perfect kitchen, where tasks are carried out with military precision? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m up to it, and quite frankly, interfering with his obsessive ways to that extent kind of scares me.</p><p>\u2018Let\u2019s not make too big a deal of it,\u2019 he warns.</p><p>But it\u2019s a massive deal. Huge. \u2018You can do it,\u2019 I offer, feeling a little overwhelmed. He\u2019s given me so much already. I don\u2019t want to push my luck.</p><p>\u2018You can\u2019t shirk me that easily.\u2019 He gives my cheek a reassuring flutter of his lips and pulls me down, turning me in his arms so my back\u2019s pressed into his chest. His chin rests on my shoulder. \u2018But first, a quick wash.\u2019</p><p>He urges me forward with his palms resting on my tummy, his steps guiding mine until we\u2019re standing before the sink and he\u2019s turning on the tap. He dampens a towel, pumps in some liquid soap, and efficiently wipes down my front, then kneels down to swipe up my legs. It\u2019s all I can do not to throw my head back and moan for more.</p><p>After washing our hands together, he leans over me and wipes the sink down while I look on with a smile. \u2018To the fridge,\u2019 he whispers, pushing me gently on until we\u2019re before the giant mirrored doors. Miller\u2019s nakedness is concealed. But mine isn\u2019t. \u2018Stunning view.\u2019 He nips at my shoulder, keeping his eyes on mine, and lets his hand slip below my stomach to my entrance. I hold my breath and push my cheek into the side of his face, squirming. \u2018So warm and inviting,\u2019 he whispers, and then licks his bite mark on my shoulder and spreads my dampness with all four fingers. The slippery friction on my sensitive nub of nerves has me moaning as I watch his eyes darken. \u2018You\u2019re still pulsing, sweet girl.\u2019</p><p>My bum pushes into his groin, causing Miller to mimic my sounds of ecstasy. \u2018You wanted to feed me,\u2019 I remind him, quite stupidly. I\u2019ll take more worshipping over the mundane task of eating any day.</p><p>\u2018Correct, but I can\u2019t promise I won\u2019t make the most of your inviting condition while we prepare breakfast.\u2019 He circles around my clitoris slowly, accelerating the dulling pulse.</p><p>Oh God, help me!</p><p>\u2018Miller,\u2019 I squeeze my eyes shut briefly, retreating, my body folding in on itself to escape his inconceivably skilful touch.</p><p>He pushes his mouth to my ear. \u2018I might make a habit of preparing our meals with my habit stuck to my chest.\u2019</p><p>If he does that, then we might not ever eat. My need for him is my undoing and I make to turn.</p><p>And go nowhere.</p><p>\u2018Nuh-uh-uh.\u2019 His hand pushes into the soft flesh of my tummy and his fingers walk up my front slowly until they are resting at the corner of my mouth. Our eyes hold as he wipes my wetness across my lips. \u2018Lick.\u2019</p><p>When his order should probably make me decline shyly, it has my craving multiplying instead. I follow through on his demand, lapping slowly at his fingers while he holds me in place, more with his thirsty eyes than with the firm clamp of his hand.</p><p>\u2018Good, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u2019</p><p>I nod, but I\u2019m more inclined to think that the flesh beneath the wetness is tastier.</p><p>\u2018Enough for now.\u2019 He withdraws his fingers and slides his palms down my arms until he\u2019s at my hands. \u2018This could take some time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Only if you can\u2019t keep your hands to yourself,\u2019 I reply quietly, wishing I didn\u2019t have to go to work so we could prepare breakfast all day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He lifts our hands and threads our fingers so we can open the fridge door together. \u2018You wouldn\u2019t want me to, so this will be a pointless discussion.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Agreed.\u2019 I\u2019m confronted by the contents of Miller\u2019s fridge, noting shelves of neatly stored food \u2013 mostly fruit or something equally healthy, and bottled water. He takes our hands to the basket of strawberries, and I smile. \u2018Chocolate for breakfast?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That would be extremely unhealthy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So?\u2019</p> <p>He nips at my earlobe as he takes the fruit out of the fridge. \u2018For breakfast we have strawberries with Greek yogurt.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Doesn\u2019t sound as tasty,\u2019 I grumble, and I bet it\u2019s fat-free, too.</p><p>I\u2019m ignored, the slight straightening of his lips telling me to quit complaining without the need for a verbal warning. A gentle nudge of his h*ps into my lower back followed by his backward steps has my feet shifting, mirroring his steps and taking us away from the reflection of the fridge doors. His eyes are glued to mine, scorching my na**d flesh, and remain that way until he\u2019s forced to turn us. We move across the kitchen as one, collect a chopping board from one cupboard, two bowls from another, a colander from another, and finally a paring knife from a drawer before everything is placed neatly on the work surface. Our hands work together, although every motion is instigated by Miller, me happy to let that happen because then I can\u2019t do anything wrong. He\u2019s humming his sweet melody in my ear absent-mindedly, seeming so peaceful, which warms me to the core and beyond. He\u2019s happy and content, like me preparing breakfast to his standards and following his way could possibly be the most fulfilling thing in the world. To Miller, it might just be. He helps me lift the knife and covers my hand with his while collecting a strawberry and placing it on the chopping board. Then he guides my hand to lift the knife and directs the blade across the top, removing the stem. He pushes the discarded piece to one corner, halves the red, plump fruit, and places a loving kiss on my cheek before he pops the pieces in the colander.</p><p>\u2018Perfect,\u2019 he praises, like he hasn\u2019t just influenced the string of accurate motions we\u2019ve undertaken, down to the handling of the knife. But if it keeps Miller\u2019s perfect world turning on its perfect axis, then I\u2019ll happily comply. He collects another strawberry, keeping his chin on my shoulder. The nearness of his steady breathing in my ear as he hums is past comforting. This must be the closest one can come to heaven while still on earth.</p><p>\u2018I thought you could stay with me today,\u2019 he says quietly, guiding my hand to the strawberry. A gentle pressure on my hand splits the flesh, revealing its juicy, mouth-watering centre. I wouldn\u2019t dare do something as silly as sneak a piece, not under my finicky Miller\u2019s watch, so I\u2019m utterly gobsmacked when he collects one of the halves and brings it to his mouth. Frowning, I follow its path, momentarily distracted by the slow parting of his lips before he slips it between them. Only momentarily, though. Displeasure soon snuffs it.</p> <p>\u2018That\u2019s\u2014\u2019 I get no further into my objection, Miller\u2019s mouth silencing me. He bites down and juice bursts between our kiss, truly making it the tastiest kiss ever. Miller and strawberry. \u2018Hmmm,\u2019 I hum in pleasure, juice dribbling down my chin.</p><p>\u2018I concur,\u2019 he whispers, breaking our kiss and licking a delicate wet stroke up my chin, fulfilling his self-appointed role of cleaning up our mess. It might be pleasurable for him, but it\u2019s still tidying of some nature, so it figures Miller would jump at the role.</p><p>\u2018I have to go to work today,\u2019 I murmur under his penetrative gaze. My body is on fire and a whole day locked in Miller\u2019s apartment, the world shut safely outside, is almost impossible to resist, but I can\u2019t shirk work again.</p><p>He kisses my nose on an accepting sigh. Too accepting. \u2018I understand, but promise me you won\u2019t venture off on your own.\u2019 His plea drags my contentment and comfort into worry. I\u2019m being followed. \u2018I\u2019ll take you and collect you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How long do you expect to have to chaperone me?\u2019 I ask. While I\u2019m more than concerned by the revelations of an unwanted shadow, I also appreciate that Miller can\u2019t babysit me for ever.</p><p>\u2018Just until we have established who and why.\u2019 He resumes chin on shoulder and strawberry slicing.</p> <p>\u2018Who\u2019s \u201cwe\u201d?\u2019</p><p>I definitely don\u2019t imagine a hesitant pause before he answers. \u2018You and I.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m suspicious. I hate being suspicious. Suspicion is dangerous and it also spikes curiosity. And I hate curiosity, probably more than suspicion. \u2018I can\u2019t establish anything unless you give me the information, which you won\u2019t, leaving you to establish things.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, that\u2019s how it should be,\u2019 he states matter-of-factly, increasing that wretched suspicion and curiosity. \u2018I don\u2019t want your lovely mind worrying about it.\u2019 He affirms his claim by pushing the knife through another strawberry and kissing my temple. \u2018We\u2019ll be leaving that line of conversation right there.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Where?\u2019 I ask on a roll of my eyes. I\u2019ve been put firmly in my place, kind of, yet I can\u2019t help a sarcastic quip.</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s no ne\u2014\u2019</p><p>\u2018Miller,\u2019 I sigh. \u2018Loosen up!\u2019 It\u2019s one step forward, a million back.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m perfectly loose.\u2019 He pushes his groin into my lower back and bites my neck, making me squirm and laugh, and just like that, he contradicts my previous thought.</p> <p>\u2018Stop it!\u2019 I gasp through my laughter.</p><p>\u2018Never.\u2019</p><p>But he does stop, and I stop laughing instantly, too, snapping my head up in attention. \u2018Was that a doorbell?\u2019 I ask, intrigued. I\u2019ve never heard the sound before.</p><p>\u2018I believe it was.\u2019 Miller sounds as interested as I am.</p><p>\u2018Who could it be?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, let\u2019s find out.\u2019 He prises my hand off the knife and lays it parallel to the chopping board before releasing me. Then he tidies his workstation quickly and efficiently and collects my folded knickers and T-shirt.</p><p>He takes my hand and paces through the apartment speedily. We\u2019re in his dressing room in no time, and I hear the doorbell sound again as he mutters under his breath, something about disturbances. He pulls a pair of fresh black boxers on and actually begins to rotate the damn T-shirts while the doorbell rings persistently in the background. I\u2019m silent and watching him grow more and more agitated by the second as he yanks his T-shirt on. He takes my hands and kisses my knuckles. \u2018Take a shower.\u2019 A chaste kiss is dropped on my forehead and he\u2019s gone, leaving me standing like a plum in the middle of his dressing room, with curiosity my only companion. It\u2019s bombarding me, and not prepared to remain alone for it to drive me nuts, I throw my knickers and a shirt on and follow quietly behind Miller, his long, powerful legs eating up the journey to his front door fast.</p><p>Aggression pours from him as he yanks the door open, and it only seems to multiply by a million when whoever\u2019s on the other side is revealed. I can\u2019t see, Miller\u2019s tall frame is blocking my view, but judging from the ice that emanates from Miller\u2019s refined physique, we don\u2019t want to see this person.</p><p>\u2018You can f**k off now, or stay and allow me the pleasure of snapping every bone in your body.\u2019 The hatred in his tone is profound. Frightening. Who is it? I watch Miller\u2019s back heaving, steam virtually pouring from his ears. He\u2019s going to take leave of his senses at any moment. Good God, hasn\u2019t he listened to anything we\u2019ve spoken about? He simply cannot control it.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll stay.\u2019</p><p>The man\u2019s voice sets my heart racing in my chest. He\u2019s come looking for me? Miller\u2019s fists clench, making the veins of his arms bulge. Shit, he\u2019s getting ready to charge. I move forward, conflicted \u2013 intervene or stay well away.</p><p>\u2018As you wish,\u2019 Miller replies casually, like he hasn\u2019t just committed to murdering our guest.</p><p>\u2018I wish you\u2019d back off so my girl can think straight without your influence.\u2019</p><p>Miller moves forward. It\u2019s threatening and intended to be. My anxiety accelerates, as does my heart rate. \u2018I\u2019ll say this once,\u2019 he seethes, fists clenching and releasing into balls. \u2018I have never made Olivia do anything that she doesn\u2019t want to. She belongs with me. She knows it. I know it, and you need to f**king know it, too. If I go anywhere, she\u2019s coming with me.\u2019</p><p>I find my courage and creep up behind Miller, sliding my palm onto his back before circling him and placing my body in front of his. A black eye, bruised cheek and split lip greet me.</p><p>\u2018Gregory,\u2019 I breathe nervously, feeling Miller giving off all sorts of worrying vibes. He\u2019s rigid against my back. \u2018Are you okay?\u2019</p><p>Brown eyes soften at my presence, his face almost relieved. \u2018Amazing,\u2019 he jokes, flicking a filthy look to Miller. \u2018We need to talk.\u2019</p><p>A strong palm grips my neck and begins massaging. If it\u2019s an attempt to knead some of my anxiety out of me, then he\u2019ll fail. It\u2019s swirling through me uncontrollably. Nothing will lessen it, let alone eliminate it. \u2018Talk, then,\u2019 Miller orders.</p><p>\u2018Alone,\u2019 Gregory hisses, eradicating any sniff of a hope I held that he was here to fix things with Miller. I feel helpless.</p><p>\u2018Hell will freeze over before I leave Olivia alone with you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Afraid she\u2019ll leave you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 Miller\u2019s fast, brutally honest answer shocks me, and obviously Gregory, too, because no counter is coming Miller\u2019s way.</p><p>Gregory\u2019s eyes absorb me for a few thoughtful moments before he finds some words. \u2018Would you like to talk alone?\u2019 he asks, stiffening every muscle in my body. I do. I\u2019m not afraid of what he will say or that he\u2019ll try to convince me to leave Miller, which he probably will. It\u2019ll be wasted energy, and Gregory must know this by now. He\u2019s been pummelled twice for his dedicated interfering, and quite badly. He\u2019s surely not going in for a third round. \u2018Well?\u2019 he prompts when I\u2019m still standing silently, mentally figuring out how to handle this. Or handle Miller.</p><p>My blank face is suddenly looking up at Miller after he\u2019s turned me in his arms. All rage and stress has gone, his eyes clear and concerned. \u2018Would you like a moment alone with your friend?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m stunned. Totally dumbfounded. I nod, unable to get any words past my shock. Miller nods, too, exhaling deeply and dipping to kiss my nose as his palm cups the back of my head. He\u2019s prepared to allow someone the opportunity to interfere?</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll take a shower,\u2019 he says quietly. \u2018Take as long as you need.\u2019 The uncharacteristic display has thrown me for a loop, and I know Gregory is slightly taken aback, too. I can practically hear his shock in the form of a surprised, thumping heartbeat. I\u2019m about to nod again, but I\u2019m quickly considering how uncomfortable Gregory might feel remaining in Miller\u2019s apartment. And me, too, for that matter. Miller lurking in the background ready to attack should he overhear some words he doesn\u2019t approve of will do nothing to relax me.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ll walk down to the coffee house,\u2019 I utter, less confidently than I would have liked, my heart sinking when Miller starts shaking his head with worried eyes. \u2018I\u2019ll be with Gregory,\u2019 I add with a pleading gaze, but with no faith that that will sway him. Gregory must be wondering what\u2019s going on. I can\u2019t land him with stalker news, not on top of everything else. \u2018Please.\u2019 My shoulders sag, defeated.</p><p>The confliction riddling him is plain and clear and written all over his face. \u2018Okay,\u2019 he agrees reluctantly, nearly knocking me to my backside in astonishment. His soft eyes leave mine and harden the moment they find Gregory. \u2018I trust you\u2019ll guard her with as much care and attention as I do.\u2019</p><p>I cough on a choke and gape at his perfectly straight face, knowing he\u2019ll be getting the same look from Gregory. He really isn\u2019t helping his cause. I understand him. I get him. I see past his uptight persona and hear past his confounding way with words. But no one else can. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018What?\u2019 Gregory asks, amusement mixed with pure exasperation clear in his tone.</p><p>Miller twitches, his eyes narrowing. \u2018I don\u2019t like repeating myself.\u2019</p><p>\u2018For f**k\u2019s sake,\u2019 Gregory laughs. \u2018Where the f**k did you find this twat?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Greg!\u2019 I gasp, spinning around and backing up into Miller\u2019s chest to prevent the inevitable.</p> <p>\u2018Well, give me a break, please!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll break your f**king neck!\u2019 Miller scathes, punching holes through my beaten friend with raging eyes over my shoulder.</p><p>\u2018Enough!\u2019 I shout, throwing my hands up violently. \u2018Just . . . enough!\u2019 There are a million words I want to throw into the mix, ones for Gregory and for Miller, but at the risk of escalating the situation further, I take some calming breaths and close my eyes to gather a bit of patience. \u2018Gregory, wait in the kitchen.\u2019 I chuck my arm out in gesture. \u2018Miller, come with me.\u2019 I grab his hand and start pulling him away. \u2018I\u2019ll be ten minutes,\u2019 I call over my shoulder, not giving either man a chance to retaliate. I\u2019m not leaving them alone. I\u2019ll return to pools of blood and discarded bones.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll wait in the hallway,\u2019 Gregory spits, and I hear the door slam viciously, shaking the apartment walls.</p><p>Miller splutters, pulling me to a halt. \u2018Did he just slam my f**king door?\u2019 His eyes are wild and he makes to turn, his face screwed up in disgust. \u2018He just slammed my f**king door!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Miller!\u2019 I yell, diving in front of him. \u2018Bedroom! Now!\u2019 I\u2019ve lost it, madness churning in my gut, heat rising to my face. Now he\u2019s being fastidious for the sake of it. \u2018Don\u2019t make me repeat myself!\u2019 I\u2019m shaking. I\u2019ve reached the end of my worn tether with these two, each behaving like a bulldog, letting their egos cloud what matters. Me! \u2018I\u2019m going for coffee with Greg!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine,\u2019 he says, looking sulky, \u2018but if a hair on your head is damaged when I get you back, I won\u2019t be held accountable for my actions.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 What does he think will happen to me?</p><p>\u2018He better make certain of it,\u2019 he scoffs.</p><p>What? \u2018You sound like a conceited idiot!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Olivia.\u2019 He dips and gets nose to nose with me, his eyes burning bright with fervour, while mine are burning bright with frustration. \u2018You know how I feel about people interfering, and you know how I feel about them upsetting you. Not only will I break his spine if you return to me physically harmed, but I\u2019ll hold that promise if he upsets you.\u2019</p> <p>My whole body slumps dramatically. It\u2019s intentional, just so he can physically see how much he frustrates me.</p><p>\u2018Overthinking,\u2019 he whispers, sliding his palm onto my nape and pulling me forward, closing the minuscule gap that remained between our mouths and sealing our lips.</p><p>\u2018I won\u2019t overthink,\u2019 I promise, letting him suck my annoyance out of me. I\u2019m past that now. \u2018And after everything you\u2019ve put me through in the last twenty-four hours, Miller? I\u2019m having coffee with a friend.\u2019</p><p>I feel his lips purse against mine. \u2018As you wish.\u2019 He can\u2019t argue with that. He wraps me in his arms, disconnecting from my mouth so he can sink his face into my wild blond hair. It\u2019s like he knows that a Miller thing can magic some strength into me. It never fails. \u2018I count on your strength, my gorgeous girl.\u2019</p><p>I embrace him and let him squeeze me strong. Or stronger. I might have been hugely annoyed with what\u2019s happened since Gregory rocked up, but my strength didn\u2019t waver. I\u2019ll never run away from us. \u2018I should take a shower.\u2019</p><p>He releases me. My hair is pushed over my shoulders and arranged just so as he scans my face. \u2018Don\u2019t leave me without you for too long.\u2019</p><p>I smile and gently break away from him, taking myself to the shower while mentally preparing for another onslaught of interference from my best friend.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p> <p>Gregory is leaning up against the wall in the hallway when I leave Miller\u2019s apartment, scrolling through his phone. \u2018Hey,\u2019 I say, pulling the door closed behind me.</p><p>He looks up and pushes away from the wall on a strained smile. \u2018Hey, baby girl.\u2019</p><p>Those words alone make me want to sob. \u2018What\u2019s happened to us?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>Gregory looks to Miller\u2019s shiny black door and back to me. \u2018The coffee-hater happened.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s more than a coffee-hater,\u2019 I argue quietly. \u2018And it was only my first coffee that he hated, so we can\u2019t technically call him that any more.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cocksucker.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That one\u2019s reserved for Ben. Seen him lately?\u2019</p><p>His broad shoulders go rigid. It\u2019s guilt. \u2018We\u2019re not here because of my f**ked-up love life.\u2019</p><p>I nearly fall over as a result of his cheek. \u2018My love life isn\u2019t f**ked up!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Get a grip!\u2019 He\u2019s up in my face with two easy strides. \u2018That in there\u2019 \u2013 he points to Miller\u2019s front door \u2013 \u2018is f**ked up and he\u2019s rubbing off on you!\u2019</p><p>My hackles rise, my face twisting with infuriation. \u2018I\u2019m not listening to this.\u2019 I pivot on my Converse, set to abandon our \u2018talk\u2019 in favour of some solace from my f**ked-up, OCD-suffering, demon-holding, possessive, damaged, drug-using, ex-notorious-male-escort/part-time gentleman. Okay, so he is kind of f**ked up, but he\u2019s my f**ked-up, finicky Miller. And I love him.</p><p>\u2018Olivia, wait!\u2019 He grabs the top of my arm a little harshly, but quickly drops it when I yelp. \u2018Shit!\u2019 he curses.</p><p>I swing around, rubbing at my arm on a scowl. \u2018Take it easy!\u2019</p><p>He looks truly nervous. \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I just didn\u2019t want you to go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then tell me so.\u2019</p><p>He casts his brown eyes to my arm. \u2018I hope I haven\u2019t marked you; I quite like my spine where it is and in one piece.\u2019</p><p>I press my lips together to prevent my grin at his sardonic joke. \u2018I\u2019m fine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank f**king God.\u2019 He shoves his hands in his pockets and looks down sheepishly. \u2018Can we start again?\u2019</p><p>Relief floors me. \u2018Please.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Great.\u2019 He looks up to me, remorse rife in his brown eyes. \u2018Can we walk and talk? I\u2019m not all that comfortable bad-mouthing your coffee-hater when he\u2019s in such close proximity.\u2019</p><p>On a roll of my eyes, I link arms with him and lead him to the stairwell. \u2018C\u2019mon.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is the lift broken?\u2019</p><p>I skid to a halt, frowning to myself. I haven\u2019t even realised that I\u2019m picking up on Miller\u2019s obsessive habits. \u2018No.\u2019</p><p>Gregory\u2019s frown matches mine as we stroll over to the lift and board as soon as it arrives. His face looks dreadful, but I\u2019m not sure it would be wise to acknowledge it or ask how he is, given that we\u2019re both smiling now, so I plump for something entirely different. \u2018How\u2019s work?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Same old,\u2019 he mutters unenthusiastically, killing that line of conversation dead in its tracks.</p><p>I think hard again. \u2018Mum and Dad okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018All right.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How are things with Ben?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fragile.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Has he come out?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u2018What the hell did we talk about before I met Miller?\u2019</p><p>He shrugs as the doors open, and I lead on, desperately searching my empty mind for anything to talk about, other than Miller and the inevitable interference that\u2019s on the horizon. I come up with zilch.</p><p>Nodding politely at the doorman and ignoring the reflection of Gregory\u2019s reluctant figure behind me, I push through the doors and emerge into the bright, fresh London air. I would have thought the vast open space engulfing me would instil a sense of freedom, but it doesn\u2019t. Nowhere near. I feel suffocated under the impending interrogation from Gregory, desperate to run back to Miller and take my freedom from being smothered in his apartment. In his thing. In him.</p><p>I turn on a sigh, finding Gregory shifting awkwardly behind me, obviously stumped for what to say or do. He insisted on a talk. He must have things to say, and even though I don\u2019t particularly want to hear them, I wish he\u2019d just get it over and done with so I can tell him that he\u2019s wasting his energy . . . again.</p><p>\u2018Are we going for coffee or not?\u2019 I ask, indicating down the street.</p><p>\u2018Sure,\u2019 he mumbles grumpily, like he\u2019s aware that he\u2019s about to waste his breath. He joins me and we begin to stroll down the street. There\u2019s at least three feet separating us and unrest is filling that gap. It\u2019s never been like this between us, and as there\u2019s no conversation happening, it gives me too much silent reflecting time to wonder how it came to this. Our silly little fumble in my bedroom that time was a cause for concern, but with the animosity and battling between Miller and Gregory, that\u2019s fallen by the wayside, which is undoubtedly a good thing.</p><p>We cross a road, quite easily, given the early hour, and continue at a leisurely pace, Gregory drawing continuous breaths of air to speak but never actually saying anything, and me looking eagerly for the sign that\u2019ll tell me we\u2019re nearing the coffee house. The discomfiture squeezing us is becoming unbearable.</p><p>\u2018Just tell me what it is about him.\u2019 Gregory pulls me to a stop, and I open and close my mouth, trying to figure out how to word it. It\u2019s all clear as daylight in my mind, but trying to voice it to an outsider stumps me. I don\u2019t need to justify myself to anyone, yet the profound need to make Gregory understand why I\u2019m still here is suddenly very important to me.</p><p>\u2018Everything.\u2019 I shake my head, wishing I could come up with something better.</p><p>\u2018The fact that he\u2019s an escort?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Money?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t be stupid. You know I have a bank account full of cash.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s intense.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Very, but it has nothing to do with that. He wouldn\u2019t be Miller if he didn\u2019t have issues. Every part of that man is a result of his life so far. He was orphaned, Gregory. His grandparents dumped him in a questionable children\u2019s home and forced his young mother back to Ireland, leaving him behind because of the shame he\u2019d bring on the family.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Doesn\u2019t mean he can behave like a total twat,\u2019 he mutters, scuffing his boots on the concrete beneath his feet. \u2018Everyone has problems.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Problems?\u2019 I fume indignantly. \u2018Being orphaned, becoming homeless, having OCD, and resorting to prostitution to survive isn\u2019t a problem, Greg. It\u2019s a f**king tragedy!\u2019</p><p>My friend\u2019s eyes widen, making me frown. \u2018Homeless?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, he was homeless.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He has OCD?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not confirmed, but it\u2019s pretty obvious.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Prostitution?\u2019 he shouts in delayed reaction.</p><p>I realise my error immediately. Escort. Gregory didn\u2019t need to know that Miller had been a regular prostitute. \u2018Yes.\u2019 I raise my chin, daring him to pass comment, thinking what he\u2019d say should I add drug addict to the list.</p><p>My ploy fails on every level. \u2018It gets better!\u2019 he laughs, but it\u2019s a nervous laugh. \u2018And I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s psychotic, too, so you really do have your very own head case.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He. Is. Not. A. Head. Case.\u2019 I punctuate each word on a hiss, my blood beginning to boil. \u2018You don\u2019t see him when we\u2019re alone. No one does, except me. Yes, he can be uptight, and so f**king what if he likes things a certain way? He isn\u2019t killing anyone!\u2019</p><p>\u2018He probably has.\u2019</p><p>I recoil in disgust, words collecting and sticking to my tongue, my brain not quite sure which expletives to hurl at Gregory first. \u2018Fuck off!\u2019 It settles on a good all-rounder, and once I\u2019ve lobbed it in his face, I turn back towards Miller\u2019s apartment block, my angry feet pounding the pavement harshly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Ah, Livy, come on!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Piss off.\u2019 I don\u2019t look back. There\u2019s likely to be explosions if I do. But then I think of something and swing around. \u2018Where did you get Miller\u2019s card?\u2019</p><p>He shrugs. \u2018That black-haired bird who was at Ice\u2019s opening night. Hot as f**k!\u2019</p><p>Cassie.</p> <p>I feel my hackles rise and the pressure in my head mount. The bitch! I steam off, worrying about my mounting fury. I want to hit something. Hard.</p><p>\u2018Oh!\u2019 My yelp is high-pitched as I\u2019m captured and tossed up so I\u2019m lying across his arms. He changes direction and strides off down the road, back in the direction of the coffee house, ignoring my incredulous look.</p><p>\u2018Sass,\u2019 he says simply. \u2018I\u2019m kind of glad you\u2019ve hung on to it.\u2019</p><p>My body lets up on the tension stored and I relax in his arms. \u2018I love him, Gregory.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can see that,\u2019 he admits begrudgingly. \u2018And does he love you?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 I answer, because I know for certain that he does. He just doesn\u2019t say it so straightforwardly. But that\u2019s his way.</p><p>\u2018Does he make you happy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018More than you\u2019ll ever know, but I\u2019d be so much happier if people just left us alone.\u2019 I feel him deflate beneath my suspended body on a sigh.</p><p>He stops and places me on my feet, then takes a solid grip of my petite shoulders. \u2018Baby girl, I get a bad vibe. He\u2019s so . . .\u2019 He pauses, his hand reaching to his forehead and rubbing in a clear sign of worry.</p><p>\u2018So what?\u2019</p><p>His lips purse and he drops both hands to his side where they hang lifelessly. \u2018Dark.\u2019</p> <p>I nod, taking a deep breath. \u2018I know every dark thing there is to know about him. I\u2019m making it all light again. I\u2019m helping him and whether you agree and accept it or not, he has helped me, too. He\u2019s my someone, Gregory. I\u2019ll never give him up.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wow.\u2019 My friend exhales, his cheeks puffing. \u2018Those are some strong words, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>I shrug. \u2018That\u2019s how it is. Don\u2019t you see? He isn\u2019t holding me captive or forcing me into anything. I\u2019m there willingly and because I\u2019m supposed to be. I hope you find your someone someday, and I hope you feel as consumed by them as I do Miller. He\u2019s special.\u2019 I mentally wince at my own words, tossing that thought far, far away.</p><p>Peace seems to settle over me under the evident realisation in Gregory\u2019s expression. I\u2019m not sure if he understands, and maybe he never will, but acceptance would be a good starting point. I don\u2019t expect them to be bosom buddies. I don\u2019t think Miller could be bosom buddies with anyone; he\u2019s not a people person. He doesn\u2019t mix well with anyone, least of all interferers. But the least they can do is be civil. For me, they should find the strength to do that.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll try,\u2019 Gregory whispers, almost reluctantly, but it still makes my heart dance with happiness. \u2018If he\u2019s willing to try, then I\u2019m game.\u2019</p><p>I smile, probably the brightest I ever have, and launch myself into his arms, making him stagger back on a small chuckle. \u2018Thank you. He cares about me, too, Gregory. Just as much as you.\u2019 I neglect to mention that he probably cares more, knowing that won\u2019t help my cause.</p><p>There are no more words, just us hugging each other with the energy of too many weeks\u2019 worth of lost time until I finally pull out of his hold, victory and elation spiralling through my whole body. His willingness, of course, is riding on Miller agreeing, but I have no doubt that he will. As long as there\u2019s a promise of zero interference and my happiness, then we should be good. I kiss his handsome cheek and link his arm, turning to continue our journey to the coffee house.</p><p>And freeze.</p> <p>The blood drains from my head and Gregory grabs me with his spare arm to steady me. \u2018Livy? What\u2019s up?\u2019</p><p>The white BMW parked at the kerb is unfamiliar, but it\u2019s not the swanky car that has my interest. It\u2019s the woman leaning up against the side who holds my attention, watching us as she draws on a cigarette. I\u2019ve seen her once before and I\u2019ll never forget her face.</p><p>Sophia.</p><p>She has a beautiful raincoat on that\u2019s as polar white as her vehicle, her lips are blood-red, and her blond, sharp bob is as perfect as it was the last time I had the pleasure. I feel sick.</p><p>\u2018Livy?\u2019 Gregory\u2019s concerned voice shakes me back to life, pulling my eyes away from the smug look splattered all over her flawless face. \u2018Shit, you\u2019re all white.\u2019 His hand rests on my forehead. \u2018You gonna throw up?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I insist weakly, considering the high possibility that I really will. This woman, above all the others in Miller\u2019s life I\u2019ve encountered, I\u2019m wary of most of all. For one thing, she\u2019s been in Miller\u2019s apartment in the middle of the night. She was also sipping wine, all at home, and that thought hasn\u2019t crossed my mind until now. There\u2019s something different about this one, and I don\u2019t like it. Not one little bit. After clearing the air with Gregory, the last thing I need is her making a scene, warning me off or belittling me.</p><p>Trying desperately to gather myself, I force a smile and tug on Gregory\u2019s arm. \u2018Are we ever going to make it to Costa?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I was just wondering that myself.\u2019 He smiles and follows my lead, not appearing to have noticed anything untoward, other than me having a strange moment. Sophia could screw that up, and when I hear the clicking of designer heels on the pavement behind me, I know immediately that she\u2019s about to.</p><p>\u2018Olivia, I believe,\u2019 she purrs, making every muscle in my body tense. My footsteps falter, my eyes clenching shut in silent hope that if I ignore her, she might go away. I doubt it, but I\u2019m willing to give it a go. I continue walking. Gregory\u2019s speaking, yet I can\u2019t hear a word, just the distant hum of his tone rattling on in the distance. I can hear her, though. \u2018Or do you answer to sweet girl these days?\u2019</p><p>My heart stops in my chest and my feet stop beating the pavement. There\u2019s no escape, and when Gregory glances over his shoulder in curiosity, I know I\u2019m about to be forced into a confrontation. I slowly turn, finding her just a few steps behind me. She takes a slow draw on her cigarette, watching me closely.</p><p>\u2018Can I help you?\u2019 I ask, as evenly and casually as I can muster, not bothering to look and gauge Gregory\u2019s expression. I know it\u2019ll be inquisitive, and I can\u2019t rip my wary gaze from a knowing, haughty one, anyway.</p><p>\u2018Oh, I think you can,\u2019 she replies, flicking the butt of her cigarette into the gutter. \u2018Let\u2019s take a drive, shall we?\u2019 Her arm extends towards the BMW and I look to find a driver holding the back door open.</p><p>\u2018Who\u2019s this?\u2019 Gregory finally speaks up, moving in closer to me.</p><p>\u2018Just a friend,\u2019 Sophia answers for me, alleviating the pressure of dreaming up a convincing answer before Gregory probes further. Except I\u2019m not sure her explanation of who she is will wash.</p><p>\u2018Livy?\u2019 Gregory nudges me in the shoulder, forcing me to confront him. His brow furrows in question.</p><p>\u2018A friend,\u2019 I mumble feebly, my mind racing in search of my next move. I\u2019m coming up with nothing. She referred to me as sweet girl. Miller\u2019s been speaking with her, and he\u2019s been speaking with her about me?</p><p>\u2018I haven\u2019t got all day.\u2019 Sophia breaks into my thoughts with her impatience.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve got nothing to say to you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But I have plenty to tell you \u2013 at least, if you care anything for Miller at all . . .\u2019 She trails off provocatively, and my legs shock me by automatically carrying me towards the car, the enticement of her words and potential information pulling me in.</p><p>\u2018Livy!\u2019 Gregory calls, but I don\u2019t turn back. I don\u2019t need to see his face and I don\u2019t need him deterring me from doing something that could be incredibly stupid. \u2018Olivia, what are you doing?\u2019</p><p>I look behind me and see Sophia\u2019s driver intercept Gregory, stopping him from coming after me.</p><p>Gregory frowns at him. \u2018Who the hell are you? Get out of my way.\u2019</p><p>The driver\u2019s hand lifts and settles on Gregory\u2019s shoulder. \u2018Be wise, boy.\u2019 His tone is oozing threat, and Gregory peers past him, still frowning, confusion rife on his handsome face.</p><p>\u2018Olivia!\u2019 He starts to struggle with the driver, but he\u2019s a big man. A threatening man. I get in the car.</p><p>The door shuts and a few moments later, the other rear door opens and Sophia sinks into the leather. I must be stark-raving mad. I don\u2019t like this woman, and I know for sure I\u2019m not going to like what she says. But there\u2019s an obscenely unreasonable desire for knowledge rippling through me. If she knows something that can help, I have to find out what it is. More knowledge. Knowledge that\u2019ll likely break my fallen heart, or possibly just break me.</p><p>The car pulls away from the kerb, just as Gregory starts hammering on the window next to me. I hate myself for it, but I ignore him.</p><p>\u2018Boyfriend?\u2019 Sophia asks, smoothing down her coat.</p><p>I\u2019m about to snap a retort, something along the lines of Miller being my boyfriend, but something stops me. Instinct? \u2018He\u2019s my best friend. He\u2019s also g*y.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ah!\u2019 she laughs. \u2018How very idyllic. The g*y best friend.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Where are we going?\u2019 I ask to change the subject. I don\u2019t want her to know anything more about my life.</p><p>\u2018Just a pleasant drive.\u2019</p><p>I scoff. Nothing about being with Sophia is pleasant. \u2018You said you had information. What is it?\u2019 Let\u2019s cut to the chase. I don\u2019t want to be in this car and now I\u2019m determined to remove myself from it fast. Just as soon as this woman divulges exactly why I\u2019m in it.</p><p>\u2018First and foremost, I\u2019d like you to walk away from Miller Hart.\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s a request, but delivered in such a way that there could be no mistaking the threat. My heart, my soul, my hope, it all sinks. But Miller\u2019s words \u2013 everything about damage control and diversion is suddenly all I can hear. No one can know about us, and although it kills me, I know what I must do. \u2018There\u2019s nothing to walk away from. I saw him a few times.\u2019 I feel like I could shut down, give in, and she\u2019s only just getting into her swing. She has lots more to say; I can feel it.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s not available.\u2019</p><p>I frown, focusing on blue eyes that scream victory. This is a woman who always gets her way. \u2018That\u2019s of no interest to me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 She smiles. It makes my skin crawl. \u2018You\u2019re rather close by to his apartment.\u2019</p><p>I nearly falter, but just catch my composure before it rumbles me. \u2018My friend lives nearby.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hmmm.\u2019 She opens up a structured Mulberry handbag and reaches in, pulling out an engraved silver cigarette case. Her condescending hum riles me. I can feel irritation overriding the uneasiness, and I conclude that to be a good thing. Sass, damn it, don\u2019t fail me now! Her long fingers select a cigarette from the neat row held tidily under a silver brace, and she taps it on the lid before slipping it between pouting lips. \u2018Miller Hart hasn\u2019t got time to be wasting on a curious little girl.\u2019</p><p>My neck retracts on my shoulders as she lights up. \u2018Excuse me?\u2019</p><p>Taking a long pull on her cigarette, she regards me thoughtfully and blows out a stream of smoke in my direction. I ignore the cloud of putrid air that engulfs me, keeping my eyes on her. I\u2019m not backing down. My sass appears from nowhere and stands strong by my side.</p><p>\u2018Most women have fun with Miller Hart, sweet girl.\u2019 She emphasises Miller\u2019s term of endearment for me. \u2018And some, like you, stupidly think they\u2019ll get more. You won\u2019t. In fact, I believe he called you \u201cjust a little girl who\u2019s too curious for her own good. I\u2019ve taken her money, had fun with her, nothing more.\u201d\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her claim makes my stomach turn, adding to all of the other unwanted reactions she\u2019s spiking with her cruel words. \u2018I knew what to expect from Miller. I\u2019m not stupid. It was fun while it lasted.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hmmm,\u2019 she hums, regarding me closely, nearly making me look away. But I don\u2019t. I stand firm. \u2018No one knows him like I do. I know him well,\u2019 she claims.</p><p>I want to slap her. \u2018How well?\u2019 I don\u2019t know where that question came from. I don\u2019t want to know.</p><p>\u2018I know his rules. I know his habits. I know his demons. I know everything.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You think he\u2019s yours?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know he\u2019s mine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re in love with him.\u2019</p><p>Her hesitation tells me all I need to know, but I know she\u2019ll confirm it. \u2018I love Miller Hart deeply.\u2019</p><p>The pressure around my neck increases, yet I manage to register the fact that she hasn\u2019t claimed that Miller loves her. That knowledge strengthens my resolve. I\u2019m not just some fling, some \u2018curious girl\u2019. Maybe in the beginning, but our equal fascination changed that very quickly. He can\u2019t stand Sophia. He scrubbed, and I was there to care for him when he was in such a state. I have no fear that he loves this woman. She\u2019s a client. She wants to be more, obviously, but to Miller she\u2019s just another interferer who he\u2019ll likely hurt should he see her again. She wants what she can\u2019t have. To Sophia, Miller Hart is unobtainable, just as he is to every other woman. Except me. I already have him.</p> <p>As the car pulls up to the kerb, she turns in her seat, facing me full-on, lifting her chin to exhale some smoke towards the roof of the car, this time sparing me the disgusting cloud. She shows a small amount of thoughtfulness through her layers of expensive make-up as she runs disapproving eyes up and down my body.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re done.\u2019 She smiles as she signals to the door, a silent order to get out, which I do, eager to escape the chilly presence of this awful woman. I slam the door shut and turn as the window slides down. She\u2019s sitting back in her seat, all casual and pretentious. \u2018Nice talking.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, it wasn\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve established where we stand. Miller can\u2019t be getting caught up with silly little girls. It\u2019ll be his demise.\u2019 The window slides shut and the car pulls swiftly away, leaving me a trembling bunch of nerves on the roadside. I\u2019m struggling to breathe past my fear, and however hard I try to calm myself, tell myself that she\u2019s just trying to put the fear of God in me, I can\u2019t help the tiniest fragment of worry from settling deep. No, it\u2019s not a tiny fragment. It\u2019s a meteor. Huge and damaging. And I\u2019m scared it\u2019s going to destroy us. Demise?</p><p>Reaching up to my neck through my fuzz of uncertainties, I begin a soothing rub over my flesh, but pause the moment it registers that there\u2019s a reason I\u2019m performing this action. I lift my hand and the hairs jump back up, making me swing around in search of my shadow. There are pedestrians everywhere, most moving fast, but no one looking particularly suspicious. My fear snakes up my spine, straightening my back. I\u2019m being watched. I know I\u2019m being watched. I\u2019m frantic as I swing one way, my hair whipping my face, then the other in the hopes of something catching my eye \u2013 anything that will stop me from believing that I\u2019m going stark-raving crazy.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing.</p> <p>But I know there\u2019s something.</p><p>Sophia. But she\u2019s gone. Or is this just the lingering after-effects of her recent presence? It\u2019s possible; the woman has an unwanted lasting air about her.</p><p>I spin, my eyes darting as I try to gauge my surroundings and soon realise that I\u2019ve been dumped a good mile away from Miller\u2019s. Panic runs riot through my veins as I turn, running at full speed towards his apartment block. I don\u2019t look back. I sprint through the streets, dodging people, crossing roads without looking until I see his building in the distance. It doesn\u2019t give me any sense of relief.</p><p>Flying into the foyer, I run straight into a waiting lift. I\u2019m frantic as I smash the button for the tenth floor repeatedly. \u2018Come on!\u2019 I yell, holding back from abandoning it in favour of the stairs. Adrenalin is overwhelming me, and it\u2019d probably carry me up the stairs faster than this lift can, but the doors begin to close and I slump against the back wall, my impatience growing. \u2018Come on, come on, come on!\u2019 I start pacing the small space, like my movement might hurry it up. \u2018Come on!\u2019 My face is pressed up against the doors when they open, and I squeeze through as soon as the gap is large enough for my lithe body.</p><p>My feet barely touch the ground. I rocket through the hallway, my legs moving so fast I can\u2019t feel them, my hair sailing behind me, my heart set to explode out of my chest in fright, fear, anxiety, desperation . . .</p><p>His door\u2019s wide open, and I hear yelling. Loud yelling. It\u2019s Miller. He\u2019s taken leave of his senses. My need to get to him spirals, my legs now numb from being overworked, and I crash through the doorway, my eyes darting until I find his na**d back. He has Gregory up against the wall by his throat.</p><p>\u2018Miller!\u2019 I scream, my knees giving out when I come to an abrupt halt, making grabbing the nearby table essential if I\u2019m to remain on my feet. Tears burst from my eyes, every emotion piercing me collecting together and putting too much pressure on my ability to cope.</p><p>He swings around violently, his eyes wild, his hair wild, his movements wild. He looks like a feral animal \u2013 a dangerous feral animal. He is dangerous. Unforgiving. Notorious.</p> <p>The Special One.</p><p>Gregory is released without delay, and his gasping body slides down the wall lifelessly, his palms clenching his throat on a wince. My desperation won\u2019t allow room for guilt or worry for my friend.</p><p>Miller\u2019s long legs eat up the distance between us in a nano-second, his eyes remaining dark but relief clear in the swimming blues I love so much. \u2018Livy,\u2019 he breathes, his na**d chest heaving relentlessly. I throw myself forward when I\u2019m sure he\u2019s close enough to catch me and land in his waiting arms, my stress reducing by a million levels at simply being in his hold.</p><p>\u2018I was followed,\u2019 I sob.</p><p>\u2018Oh, f**king hell,\u2019 he curses. He sounds in physical pain. \u2018Fuck!\u2019 He lifts me from my feet and holds me tightly. \u2018Sophia?\u2019 The anxiety in his hoarse voice raises those stress levels again. He\u2019s too frantic.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 And I don\u2019t need to ask how he knows it was Sophia. I expect he\u2019s strangled a description out of Gregory. \u2018She dropped me off streets away.\u2019 I shake my head, keeping my face stuck to his neck. It\u2019s silly, but I concentrate on breathing him into me, hoping that surrounding myself with all of my comforts will chase away all of my distress. I\u2019m shaking like a leaf, no matter how secure he holds me, and through my uncontrollable body movement, I can feel his heart punching into my chest. He\u2019s delirious with concern and that only heightens my ever-growing fear.</p><p>\u2018Come here,\u2019 he rasps, like he doesn\u2019t have full control of my motionless form. He carries me further into his apartment, my nails digging into his shoulders. There\u2019s a brief attempt to detach me from his body, but when I silently refuse, increasing my grip, he relents and sits on the couch with me still stuck to him. He fights to manoeuvre me, shifting my legs to one side until I\u2019m cuddled on his lap, my head buried under his chin. \u2018Why did you get in that car, Olivia?\u2019 he asks, no scorn or anger in his tone. \u2018Tell me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I admit. Stupidity. Curiosity. They must be the same thing.</p><p>He sighs, mumbling under his breath. \u2018Don\u2019t go near that woman, do you hear me?\u2019</p><p>I nod my acceptance, wholeheartedly wishing that I never had. Nothing good came of it, except some undesired knowledge and aching questions. \u2018She said you told her I was a bit of fun.\u2019 The words, although free from my mouth, leave a rancid taste behind.</p><p>\u2018You mustn\u2019t see her,\u2019 he grates, wrestling me from his chest. I give in this time, needing to see his face. There are a million emotions etched on every perfect piece of it. \u2018She\u2019s bad news, Olivia. The worst. There\u2019s a reason I told her what I did.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Who is she?\u2019 I whisper, fearing the answer.</p><p>\u2018An interferer.\u2019 His answer is simple and tells me everything I need to know.</p><p>\u2018She loves you deeply,\u2019 I tell him, although I suspect he already knows. He nods, shifting his wayward wave. It draws my eyes to it very briefly, screaming for me to push it back, which I do. Slowly.</p><p>My chin is grasped and pulled to his face until our mouths are a hair\u2019s breadth apart. \u2018You must understand my hatred for her.\u2019</p><p>I nod and his eyes close slowly, he breathes in slowly, and he releases the air slowly. \u2018Thank you,\u2019 he whispers, nuzzling his nose into my cheek. I immerse myself in his evident appreciation, seeing things exactly how they are. Scorned women. Women who have come to depend on the attention that this damaged man gave them. No one said my relationship with Miller would be easy, but no one said it would be near on impossible either.</p><p>I immediately correct myself. One person did.</p><p>\u2018What did you tell her?\u2019 Miller asks.</p><p>\u2018Nothing.\u2019</p><p>He pulls back. \u2018Nothing?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You said the less people know, the better.\u2019</p><p>His face twists in pain and he yanks me to him. \u2018You beautiful, smart girl.\u2019</p><p>Silence falls, and so does the heavy burden of a million worrying issues. They need to be resolved, dealt with, whatever, but right in this moment in time, I can\u2019t bear it. I\u2019m happy hiding from the cruel world we\u2019re trapped in by remaining submerged in the comfort Miller provides \u2013 the comfort I\u2019ve come to depend on.</p><p>\u2018I won\u2019t lose, Olivia,\u2019 he vows. \u2018I promise.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t move from his clutch, instead nodding my acknowledgment while he cuddles me fiercely.</p><p>\u2018Well, well, well.\u2019</p><p>The cocky greeting freezes the blood in my veins, and both Miller and I snap our heads up. I don\u2019t like what I see, and I definitely don\u2019t like the angry lines cutting into his handsome face.</p><p>\u2018There is little point in me furnishing you with a phone, Olivia, if you don\u2019t answer it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018William,\u2019 I breathe, feeling Miller\u2019s body turn to lead beneath me. Oh God, Gregory, William, a ton of shit from Sophia. This situation couldn\u2019t get any worse. I feel anarchy on the brink of explosion, and the instant hostility pouring from Miller at William\u2019s arrival doesn\u2019t lessen my trepidation. This could turn very ugly, very quickly.</p><p>William strides into the room, his phone in hand, flicking a quick unfriendly look to Gregory as he passes. Poor Gregory is still slumped against the wall, his hand still rubbing at his neck. But the appearance of my mum\u2019s ex-pimp has his immediate interest.</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly standing, and Miller straightens to full height, his torso puffing out like a gorilla set to charge. \u2018Anderson,\u2019 he virtually growls, reclaiming me and pulling my back into his bare chest.</p><p>William helps himself to a Scotch, musing for a few moments before selecting a dumpy bottle from the back. \u2018You said you\u2019d call me, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>I ignore his observation and wait with bated breath for Miller to launch into obsessive orbit at the sight of an interferer, someone who is not only interfering with his relationship, but also with his precisely placed liquor bottles. He\u2019s going to flip his lid. \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019 I ask.</p><p>William turns slowly and swirls the dark liquid in the glass before sniffing it and giving a sharp nod of approval. I feel Miller\u2019s hackles rise and I know William feels it, too, even from across the room. But he ignores it. He\u2019s goading him. He knows about Miller\u2019s OCD. \u2018Miller called me,\u2019 William states matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u2018He did?\u2019 I blurt, escaping Miller\u2019s hold and swinging around to face him. He invited William to interfere? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Miller\u2019s nostrils flare and he nails me in place with annoyance. \u2018I thought you\u2019d been abducted.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You thought I\u2019d been kidnapped?\u2019 I press. \u2018By Sophia?\u2019 Why the hell would she do that? And why did he call William? Miller hates him, and I know the feeling is totally mutual.</p><p>His face is poker straight, but those eyes are still exuding pure, raw fear. \u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m robbed of words.</p> <p>And breath.</p><p>Then something hits me like a bullet to my temple. \u2018You told William about my shadow?\u2019 I brace myself for Miller\u2019s answer, even though I know for sure what it\u2019ll be.</p><p>He nods. The urge to reach up and free my neck of the invisible noose is too much, and I find myself feeling around my throat, prompting Miller to move in and take my frantic hands.</p><p>\u2018Olivia?\u2019 William\u2019s silky voice, which is still laced with antagonism, pulls my attention across the room. \u2018When I say I\u2019ll pick you up at a certain time from a certain place, I expect you to be there. When I call, I expect you to answer.\u2019</p><p>It takes every ounce of my remaining patience and strength not to drop my head back in exasperation, but even with the lack of visual disrespect, William still picks up on my impudence. I don\u2019t care, especially not now. \u2018I\u2019m not a f**king child,\u2019 I hiss, my fists balling in Miller\u2019s grasp. I yank myself free and spin away from him. Anxiety is being washed away with the tirade of shitty newsflashes that I\u2019m being assaulted with.</p> <p>\u2018You should have listened,\u2019 Miller says softly from behind me, making me swing back around. I\u2019m getting dizzy from all this shocked spinning.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I yell. I can tell from his steely gaze and the reluctance of his tone that it kills him to admit that.</p><p>His arms are hanging limply by his sides, his wide shoulders slumped, his stance threatening but yielding all at once. I don\u2019t know what to make of this. \u2018If Anderson makes a request, Livy, you should listen.\u2019</p><p>Just when I thought nothing else could stun me, he says that? \u2018He wanted to pick me up. I was with you! And I should listen? Like I should have listened to him when he was telling me continuously to walk away from you?\u2019</p><p>Miller\u2019s eyes turn vicious and flick to William across the room. \u2018Never listen when he tells you that,\u2019 he seethes.</p><p>My head falls back and I look to the heavens for help, wondering who and what I should be listening to. \u2018Why do you think Sophia would kidnap me?\u2019 I can\u2019t believe the questions falling from my mouth. I know I need sass to survive Miller Hart, but not a black belt or . . . I gasp, realisation sucker- punching me. \u2018Self-defence.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018It\u2019s a necessity.\u2019</p><p>\u2018In case one of your jealous whores tries to abduct me?!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Olivia!\u2019 Miller yells, enraged, making my mouth snap shut, startled.</p><p>Gregory is suddenly in my line of sight, and I focus on him for a moment, finding his mouth agape, his eyes full of alarm. \u2018I can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m hearing,\u2019 he splutters. \u2018Are we on the set of The Godfather?\u2019</p><p>I close my eyes and shift to the sofa, letting my backside fall in exhaustion to the squidgy cushion. \u2018But she didn\u2019t hold me against my will.\u2019 I inhale, searching for sensible questions in a mind awash with craziness. \u2018Getting caught up with me will be your demise.\u2019 I look up at him. \u2018That\u2019s what she said.\u2019 And while I previously appreciated the absurdity of the warning, Miller\u2019s straight face and telling eyes now make me appreciate the reality. I sit up and swallow hard, not wanting to ask the question tickling the end of my tongue. \u2018Was she . . . did she . . . is it tr . . .\u2019 I pause and collect the words together in my mind and let them tumble out on an apprehensive whisper. \u2018Is she right?\u2019</p><p>Miller nods, blowing my already crumbling world apart. The fear that was lost to shock and anger resurfaces and immobilises me. My stomach turns. I hear Gregory gasp. I feel Miller stiffen. And I sense William\u2019s . . . sadness.</p><p>Sophia knows the consequences if Miller quits? He\u2019s shackled, and not just by the women relishing in his sick web of hedonism. I feel ill. His demise? Who are these people?</p><p>The sound of a mobile phone pierces the heavy atmosphere and William wastes no time answering it. He looks regretful as he speaks quietly to the caller, and his refined, grey-suited body is shifting uncomfortably on the spot. \u2018Two minutes,\u2019 he says tightly before hanging up and penetrating me with his silver gaze. It\u2019s full of sorrow. My stomach turns. \u2018Take her and go,\u2019 he murmurs as he watches me. \u2018Now.\u2019</p> <p>My brow wrinkles in confusion, and I stand, throwing my eyes to Miller. He\u2019s nodding in understanding. \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 I ask, not knowing how much more I can take.</p><p>Miller approaches me and slides his palm around my neck, resorting to his tactics of calmly massaging my nape. I\u2019d shrug him off, but I can\u2019t possibly move. He turns to William. \u2018Do you have the package?\u2019</p><p>William reaches into his inside pocket and pulls out a brown envelope. He\u2019s thoughtful for a few seconds before he hands it to Miller, who shoves it under his arm and reaches in, pulling out two passports and a pile of paperwork. He uses his mouth to open one of the burgundy books to the photo page and runs his eyes over it. It\u2019s me. I choke on nothing, unable to speak as I watch him check the next, seeing a shot of him this time.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019d better go,\u2019 William presses, glancing down at his watch.</p><p>\u2018Watch her.\u2019 Miller releases me and jogs off towards his bedroom, leaving me to continue choking on my panicked breaths. I\u2019m suffocating, a cruel world closing in on me and sending my life into mayhem.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 I finally ask, my voice matching my body in the shakes department.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re leaving,\u2019 William answers simply and swiftly, now detached, all emotion long gone.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t have a passport.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You do now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s fake? Why would you have a fake passport for me?\u2019 And where would he get one? I almost laugh to myself, but a lack of energy prevents it. This is William Anderson. There\u2019s no limit to his capabilities. I should know that.</p><p>He approaches me carefully, one hand resting in his pocket, the other holding his tumbler of Scotch. \u2018Because, Olivia, from the moment I discovered your involvement with Miller Hart, I knew this would be the end result. I didn\u2019t intervene to be difficult.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What would be the end result? What\u2019s happening?\u2019 Why are people talking in code?</p><p>William seems to consider something for a moment before he looks down at me with sympathy filling his wonderful greys. He knows everything about Miller\u2019s darkness. Restraints and a bad temper aren\u2019t the only reasons William has been so persistent in his endeavours to keep me away from Miller. It\u2019s all so clear. He knows the consequences of our relationship, too. He smiles a little, taking my cheek in his palm and smoothing the pad of his thumb across my cold flesh. \u2018Maybe I should have done this with Gracie,\u2019 he says quietly, almost to himself, reminiscence rife on his distinguished face. \u2018Maybe I should have taken her away from the horrors. Taken her away from this.\u2019</p><p>I stare at a remorseful face, but I don\u2019t ask the obvious question, which would be to ask what this is. \u2018Do you regret it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Every day of my wicked life.\u2019</p><p>Concern makes way for sadness. William Anderson \u2013 the man who loved my mother with a passion \u2013 lives with daily regret. It\u2019s potent and alive. It cripples him. I can think of no words to ease his pain, so I do the only other thing that feels right. I reach up to the powerful beast of a man and cuddle him. It\u2019s a silly attempt to lessen his lifelong pain, but when he laughs a little at my action and accepts my embrace, holding me tightly with his free arm, I think I might have at least made a minute\u2019s difference.</p><p>\u2018Enough now,\u2019 he says, the authority back in its rightful place. I\u2019m detached from him, and as the room comes into view, I spot Miller hovering a few metres away, standing next to Gregory. My best friend looks like he\u2019s in a trance, and Miller looks unusually calm, considering what he has just witnessed. He has on grey sweatpants, a black T-shirt and trainers. It\u2019s an unusual get-up for Miller, but after the massacre of his masks, I guess he has no other option. Then the sports bag suspended from his hand catches my eye, and I allow a moment to process the earlier appearance of passports and William\u2019s words.</p><p>\u2018Go,\u2019 William utters, flicking his head towards the door. \u2018My driver\u2019s parked on the corner. Take the exit from the second floor and use the fire escape.\u2019 Miller doesn\u2019t swing into action, which prompts William to go on. \u2018Hart, we\u2019ve spoken about this.\u2019</p><p>I flick confused eyes to Miller, instantly wary of the ferocity rolling off him in waves. His jaw beneath his stubble turns to rock. \u2018I\u2019ll crucify them all,\u2019 he promises, his voice drenched in violence. It makes me swallow hard.</p><p>\u2018Olivia.\u2019 William says my name on a simple breath. It\u2019s a reminder, and Miller looks down at me, cognisance seeming to wrestle past the anger. \u2018Get her away from this f**king mess until we can figure out what\u2019s going on. Don\u2019t drag her any further into danger, Hart. Damage control.\u2019 William\u2019s phone sounds from his hand and he curses as he answers. \u2018What\u2019s the deal?\u2019 he asks the caller as he looks to Miller. I don\u2019t like the guardedness on his face. \u2018Go,\u2019 he says urgently, remaining on the phone and pacing towards us. Miller seizes me and leads me to the door in the blink of an eye, William following directly behind.</p><p>I\u2019m disorientated. I\u2019m confused. I\u2019m allowing myself to be hauled out of Miller\u2019s apartment with not a clue as to where I\u2019m being taken.</p><p>We\u2019re in the hallway fast, Miller guiding me to the stairwell. \u2018No!\u2019 William shouts, making Miller halt sharply and snap his head back, eyes wide. \u2018They\u2019re coming up the stairs.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 Miller roars, breaking out in a stressed sweat. \u2018Fuck!\u2019</p><p>\u2018They know your weaknesses, boy.\u2019 William\u2019s tone is dark, and so are his eyes.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 I ask, breaking free of Miller\u2019s hold, my eyes batting back and forth between him and William. \u2018Who are they?\u2019 I don\u2019t like the cautious look William throws Miller\u2019s way, not that Miller will notice. He\u2019s beginning to tremble, like he\u2019s seen a ghost, his skin paling before my eyes. \u2018Answer me!\u2019 I scream, making Miller jump and lift his brilliant blues slowly. They are haunted. It robs me of breath.</p><p>\u2018The ones who hold the key to my chains,\u2019 he whispers, sweat trickling down his temples. \u2018The immoral bastards.\u2019</p><p>A sob rips through me like lightning as his confession settles hard and fast. \u2018No!\u2019 My head starts to shake and my heart rate rockets. I don\u2019t want to ask. He looks truly frightened, and I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s because they, whoever they may be, are on their way or because his escape is blocked and he needs to get me out. Intuition tells me it\u2019s the latter, but it\u2019s the former that has my heart squeezing in trepidation. \u2018What do they want?\u2019 I brace myself for his answer, wincing as he fights the symptoms of a meltdown, and when he finally speaks, it\u2019s on a mere whisper.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve handed in my resignation.\u2019 He holds my eyes while I let the enormity of his statement sink in. And then my eyes flood with salty tears.</p><p>\u2018They won\u2019t let us be if we stay?\u2019 I ask, choking all over my question.</p><p>He shakes his head slowly, pain invading his beautifully perfect face. \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, my gorgeous girl.\u2019 The bag drops to the floor and I see defeatism grip him. \u2018They own me. The consequences will be shattering if we stay.\u2019</p><p>My whole body shakes under the sombreness of his shaky promise, my cheeks stinging and sore as I wipe at my face, searching for my strength to replace Miller\u2019s loss of it. I\u2019m in deep \u2013 deeper than I ever imagined. And I plan on drowning with him if necessary. I suck in an unsteady breath and pace over to him, hauling the bag up from the floor and taking his clammy hand. He lets me, but as soon as he figures where we\u2019re headed, he stiffens and I hear the beginning of panicked breathing. He\u2019s putting up some resistance, making it harder for me to pull him to where I need him. But we make it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I press the call button for the lift and silently plead for it to be near the top of the building. I\u2019m looking back to the stairwell exit constantly.</p><p>\u2018Olivia?\u2019</p><p>I glance to my side, seeing Gregory has joined William. He looks lost. Confused. Shocked. I smile at him, trying to ease his worry, but I know I\u2019ve failed. \u2018I\u2019ll call,\u2019 I promise, just as the doors slide open and Miller steps back, taking me with him. \u2018Please tell Nan I\u2019m okay.\u2019</p><p>I throw the bag into the lift and turn, taking Miller\u2019s other hand so we\u2019re joined by both. Then I start to take slow steps back, aware our time is ticking, but more acutely aware that this is not something I can rush. He\u2019s staring past me into the enclosed box, his whole body heaving violently, and it\u2019s in the intensity of this moment that I wonder how I could have been so cruel those times I used this fear against him. I fight off the tears that the guilt spikes and continue with my backward steps until our arms are at full length and the space between our bodies is wide.</p> <p>\u2018Miller,\u2019 I say quietly, desperate for him to focus on me instead of the monster he sees behind me. \u2018Look at me,\u2019 I plead. \u2018Just look at me.\u2019 My voice quivers, no matter how greatly I\u2019m trying to keep it together. Relief swamps me when he takes a tentative step forward, but then he starts shaking his head furiously and takes two steps back. He\u2019s swallowing repeatedly and his hands are becoming increasingly hot. The waves of his lovely hair are becoming heavy under the weight of the sweat pouring from his scalp, his forehead, just about everywhere.</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t,\u2019 he pants, gulping. \u2018I can\u2019t do it.\u2019</p><p>I look across to William and see concern as he constantly checks his phone and looks to the stairwell, and when I look to Gregory, I see something that I\u2019ve never seen from my best friend when Miller is in the picture. Compassion. I bite my lip as the tears begin to fall, choking on a sob when he looks at me and gives me eyes full of encouragement. Then he nods. It\u2019s only just detectable, but I see it and I understand it. I feel hopeless. I need to get Miller out of this building.</p><p>\u2018You go,\u2019 Miller says, pushing me into the elevator. \u2018I\u2019ll be fine, you go.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I yell. \u2018No, you are not giving up!\u2019 I throw myself onto him, snaking my arms around him and silently vowing never to let go. I don\u2019t miss the let-up in tension from his body under my hold.</p> <p>My thing.</p><p>His thing.</p><p>Our thing.</p><p>I squeeze him, my lips on his neck and his face in my hair. Then I let go and pull more forcefully on his hand, begging with my eyes for him to come to me. And he does. He takes one slow step forward. Then another. Then another. Then another. He\u2019s on the threshold. I\u2019m in the lift. He\u2019s trembling, still gulping, and the sweat is relentless.</p><p>And then I hear a loud sound from the stairwell, followed by William\u2019s colourful curse, and I do what instinct tells me and yank Miller into the lift before smashing the button for the second floor and throwing my arms around his gasping body, immersing him in our thing.</p><p>The frantic pace of his heart beating in his chest must be verging on dangerous. I\u2019m looking over his shoulders to the hallway as it slowly disappears with the closing of the doors, and the last thing I see before we\u2019re alone in the terrifying box is William and Gregory stepping into sight, both watching quietly as Miller and I vanish from view. I smile at them through my sadness.</p> <p>It wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if the ferocity of his heartbeat hitting my chest leaves bruises. It\u2019s relentless, no matter how hard I squeeze him. My attempts to calm him are fruitless. All I need to do is concentrate on keeping him upright until we reach the second floor, which right now is easy. He\u2019s rigid as I watch the digital monitor tick down through the floors, each number seeming to take aeons to appear. We\u2019re in slow motion. Everything seems to be in slow motion.</p><p>Everything except Miller\u2019s breathing and heart rate.</p><p>I feel him jerk under my hold, and I attempt to pull away but get nowhere. I can\u2019t let go of him, not for anything, and I\u2019m suddenly panicked by the potential difficulty of getting him out of the lift once it stops. \u2018Miller?\u2019 I whisper, low and calm. It\u2019s a vain attempt to fool him into believing that I\u2019m composed. I\u2019m far from it. He doesn\u2019t respond and I take another glimpse at the floor indicator.</p><p>\u2018Miller, we\u2019re nearly out,\u2019 I say, pushing into him to force him to step away until his back is at the doors. The judder of the lift when it stops makes me jump, and Miller lets out a weak whimper as he pushes against me. \u2018Miller, we\u2019re here.\u2019 I struggle against his fierce resistance, hearing the doors begin to open. It\u2019s only now I consider the possibility of them waiting for us on the other side of the doors, and panic flares, my body stiffening as the doors begin to open. What if they are? What will I do? What will they do? My breathing pattern changes, catching up with Miller\u2019s as I peek over his shoulders, my feet beginning to ache from staying on my tiptoes.</p><p>The doors open fully, revealing nothing but an empty hallway, and I try to listen for any signs of life.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Pushing against Miller\u2019s dead weight, I get nowhere in my urgent need to shift him. How will he be once we\u2019re out of this box? I haven\u2019t got time to coax him out of this lift, let alone the building.</p><p>\u2018Miller, please,\u2019 I beg, swallowing down the lump of desperation in my throat. \u2018The doors are open.\u2019 He remains frozen, stuck to me, and tears of panic begin to overwhelm my eyes. \u2018Miller,\u2019 I whisper, my shaky voice tarnished with defeat. They\u2019ll be on their way back down soon.</p> <p>She\u2019s holding him. A chime sounds and the doors begin to close again. I don\u2019t have time to shout for Miller to get out. He seems to jump to life, the sound of the doors closing undoubtedly the cause, and his body flies back as if someone has launched him from a cannon. I hold my breath as I watch him. He\u2019s drenched, his hair stuck to his head and his eyes wide with fear. And he\u2019s still shaking.</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, I reach down to retrieve the bag and move to the threshold of the lift, all the while keeping my worried eyes on him as he looks around him, familiarising himself with his surroundings. And it\u2019s like the shattered pieces of my world suddenly fuse, bringing hope crashing back into our reality, as the mask falls, wiping away every shred of fear, and Miller Hart is back.</p><p>He flicks empty eyes up and down my body, catching sight of the bag, and it\u2019s gone from my grasp in the blink of an eye. Then my hand is claimed and I\u2019m out of the lift just as quickly. He breaks into a run, forcing my little legs to sprint in order to keep up with him, and he glances back every few seconds to check on me and for anything behind us.</p><p>\u2018You okay?\u2019 he asks, no signs of exertion showing.</p><p>I, however, have misplaced the adrenalin that was fuelling me. Maybe my conscience has registered Miller\u2019s resurrection and wants to relieve me of the pressure to hold things together. I don\u2019t know, but exhaustion is taking hold and my emotions are screaming for release. But not here. I can\u2019t lose it here. I nod, keeping up my pace so I don\u2019t hinder our escape. Showing mild concern on his perfect face, he throws the bag up to his shoulder as we near the fire exit and releases my hand, his body charging at full speed into the door. It crashes open loudly, and the daylight beyond attacks my eyes, making me wince.</p><p>\u2018Take my hand, Olivia,\u2019 he demands urgently.</p><p>I seize it, allowing him to pull me down the fire escape and onto the side street. A car horn blares immediately, and I spot William\u2019s driver holding the back door open. We dodge cars, trucks and taxis, most honking their horn in annoyance, as we weave through the busy London traffic, charging to William\u2019s car.</p><p>\u2018In.\u2019 He gives a curt nod to the driver and takes over his hold of the door as he barks his order at me and throws the bag in. I waste no time, flinging myself onto the back seat, Miller following behind. The driver is up front before I know it and screeching off down the road, his madcap driving skills alarming me. He\u2019s an expert, dipping and weaving through the traffic with ease and coolness.</p><p>And then the enormity of what has just happened hits me like the wickedest of tornados and I cry. I bury my face in my palms and break down, so many thoughts whirling through my poor, overwrought mind \u2013 some reasonable, like I need to call Nan. What about Nan? And some unreasonable thoughts like where did this man learn to drive so capably? And does William need these types of driving skills?</p><p>\u2018My gorgeous girl.\u2019 His strong palm wraps around my nape and tugs me over to him, pulling me onto his lap and securing me in his arms so my soggy cheek is buried in his chest. I cry relentlessly, jerking in his hold, unable and unwilling to even try and avert it any longer. The last half-hour has taken everything out of me. \u2018Don\u2019t cry,\u2019 he whispers. \u2018Please don\u2019t cry.\u2019</p><p>My fists clutch the material of his T-shirt at his pecs until my hands ache and I\u2019ve cried rivers of confused, gut-twisting tears. \u2018Where are we going?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Somewhere,\u2019 he answers, wrestling me from his chest to find my eyes. \u2018Someplace where we can lose ourselves in each other with no interruptions or interference.\u2019</p><p>I can barely see him through the pools of tears blurring my vision, but I can feel him and hear him. It\u2019s good enough. \u2018Nan.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019ll be taken care of. You don\u2019t need to worry yourself with that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018By William?\u2019 I blurt, thinking all kinds of shit will hit the fan if William rocks up to Nan\u2019s. Jesus, she\u2019ll go mental!</p><p>\u2018She\u2019ll be taken care of,\u2019 he repeats, short and sharp.</p><p>\u2018But I\u2019ll miss her.\u2019</p><p>Reaching up, he slides his fingers into my hair, cupping the back of my head. \u2018It\u2019s not for long, I promise. Just long enough to let the dust settle.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How long will that be? And what if they don\u2019t let the dust settle? Will William be involved? Does he know them? Who are they?\u2019 I pause to draw breath, wanting to spit out all of these questions before my tired mind shuts down and I forget them. \u2018They won\u2019t hurt Nan, will they?\u2019 I gasp as something slams into my racing mind. \u2018Gregory!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shhhh,\u2019 he soothes, like I haven\u2019t just abandoned my best friend in Miller\u2019s apartment when God only knows who are on their way up. \u2018He\u2019s with Anderson. Trust me, he\u2019ll be fine. And so will your grandmother.\u2019</p><p>Relief swamps me. I do trust him, but he hasn\u2019t answered any of my questions. \u2018Talk to me,\u2019 I plead, not having to elaborate on that gentle demand. His lovely blue eyes are trying desperately to reassure me, to eliminate my unease. It\u2019s working in a strange sense.</p><p>He nods and pulls me back into his embrace. \u2018Until there is no breath left in my lungs, Olivia Taylor.\u2019</p><p>Heathrow is chaotic. My mind races, my heart pounds, my eyes dart all the way to the departure gate. While I fidgeted through check-in and security, Miller looked completely composed, holding me close, probably in an attempt to conceal my shakes. I haven\u2019t paid much attention to what\u2019s happened since we were dropped off at Terminal 5. I don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going or for how long. I called Nan, armed with a story of a surprise trip from Miller, only to have William answer the call. My heart stopped in my chest, and then restarted when Nan came on the line, cool as a cucumber. I didn\u2019t understand, still don\u2019t, but she told me persistently how much she loved me before making me promise I\u2019d call when we arrived wherever we are going.</p><p>And all of that brings us to now.</p><p>I\u2019m standing at the gate, gazing up at the monitor, open-mouthed. \u2018New York?\u2019 I breathe, resisting the urge to rub at my eyes, just in case I\u2019m seeing things.</p><p>Miller doesn\u2019t humour my awe, instead gently guiding me to the lady who\u2019ll let us pass once she\u2019s checked our passports and boarding passes . . . again. I stiffen. Again. But she smiles and ushers us on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u2018You would make a terrible crook, Olivia,\u2019 Miller says seriously.</p><p>I allow my muscles to relax as he leads me down the tunnel towards the plane. \u2018I don\u2019t want to be a crook.\u2019</p><p>He smiles down at me, his eyes twinkling. All signs of the terrified creature have disappeared, restoring my finicky, refined Miller to his former glory. And he really is glorious. I sigh on a long, sated exhale and rest my head on his arm, looking up to see an overly happy stewardess smiling brightly at us. I could growl in exasperation when she asks for our passports and boarding passes. You would think I\u2019d be used to it after the millions of other times they have been requested since we arrived at Heathrow. But no. I\u2019m beginning to tremble again as she flicks through before glancing at each of us to check we match the photograph. I force a nervous smile, convinced she\u2019s going to scream fake and then call for security. But she doesn\u2019t.</p><p>She checks the boarding passes and smiles as she hands them back to Miller. \u2018First class is this way, sir.\u2019 She gestures to the left. \u2018You\u2019ve just made it on time. The captain has ordered us to secure the doors.\u2019</p> <p>Miller gives a brisk nod, and I turn to see another stewardess pulling the doors shut.</p><p>And every drop of blood drains from my head as I glance down the tunnel, towards the departure gate. It\u2019s an illusion; it has to be. My curiosity gets the better of me and I creep forward as the closing door begins to hamper my view, wanting to get as close as I can, blinking the whole time, convinced I\u2019m seeing things.</p><p>Then I stop.</p><p>I\u2019m rooted to the spot, my mind empty, my blood freezing in my veins.</p><p>And I\u2019m staring at me.</p> <p>It\u2019s definitely me . . . just nineteen years from now. </p>  </body></html>"]
