Hey Babe. Can\u2019t make dinner. Boys n I r going out. Don\u2019t W8 up. X</p><p>Great, just fucking great.</p><p>I toss my phone back into my handbag and I glance around the room, frustrated by Blade\u2019s cancellation. Sadly, this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve been stood up. It\u2019s the third time this month Blade has left me at Salsa\u2019s Mexican restaurant waiting for him because he prefers to \u2018hang with his boys\u2019 over his girlfriend of six years. To make matters worse, the waiter that has been coming over to my table for the past hour asking me if I want to order is the same damn waiter that has attempted to serve me the last two times I\u2019ve been stood up. I peer over to the bar and meet the waiter\u2019s boyish face and blue eyes. He looks back at me sympathetically. Startled, I quickly look down at my menu, letting the long chocolate strands of my hair work as a curtain between us. Only the distinct sound of someone clearing their throat made me peer around my hair.</p> <p>\u201cAre you ready to order?\u201d The young waiter asks, running his fingers through the front of his long, blond fringe.</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d A blush instantly springs to my cheeks and I cringe at the thought of how red they must look. \u201cNo, sorry... my partner isn\u2019t coming.\u201d</p><p>I rise to my feet and straighten my short, black dress. I pull my matching black coat off the back of my chair and shrug it on over my shoulders. I reach across the table for my handbag and walk quickly toward the exit. My cheeks grow warmer and I swear I can feel everyone\u2019s appraising eyes on me.</p><p>Outside the air is surprisingly cold. Strange, considering we\u2019re meant to be well into spring. The cool air makes my nose run immediately and I feel the heat of my blush fade from my cheeks. My high heels tap in an even beat along the concrete as I make my way through the car park. I\u2019ve always found calm weather soothing, but tonight\u2019s cold, still weather isn\u2019t enough to calm the storm raging inside of me.</p><p>My dark shadow reflects in the blue paint of my sedan as I unlock the car and climb in. With a growl, I throw my handbag into the passenger seat. Tears burn at my tear ducts, but I don\u2019t dare let them fall. I\u2019m not going to cry over him anymore. I lean over and dig hastily through the contents of my handbag until I locate my phone. I search for his name in my contacts list and hit dial. It rings out and I\u2019m greeted by his stupid voicemail. \u201cYo, this is Blade. I\u2019m not here right now, obviously. Call me back later.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t leave a voicemail, but I do call again. And again. And again. Each time it reaches his voicemail I grow angrier and angrier, until he finally answers.</p><p>\u201cShh. Shh.\u201d I hear him whisper to someone with a high pitched giggle. The noise makes my stomach drop in to my intestines. \u201cHey babe, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Choosing to ignore the female noise until later, I tell him what\u2019s up. \u201cWhat\u2019s up? I\u2019m sitting in the car park of Salsa\u2019s because you stood me up again!\u201d My voice is loud, but I don\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cCan you stop yelling? It\u2019s really not a big deal. You and I hang out all the time.\u201d</p><p>What kind of response is that? \u201cWait. Because we see each other frequently it gives you the right to stand me up?\u201d</p><p>I can imagine him doing that stupid shrug thing he always does. \u201cSomething like that. I knew you\u2019d understand.\u201d</p> <p>He hangs up, leaving me staring out the front windscreen. Anger boils to extremes in my chest and I can feel my nostrils flare as my chest rises and falls rapidly. With shaky hands, I hit redial.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d A husky, female voice answers, catching me off guard.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d I demand, feeling instantly ill. \u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut Blade on the phone.\u201d I snap.</p><p>In the background I distinctly hear club music and laughter. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s out having a good time while I\u2019m sitting alone in a Goddamn car park.</p><p>\u201cShit. Olivia, it\u2019s not what you think. She took my phone off the bar.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve reached boiling point. I\u2019m done. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m dumb?\u201d I bark into the phone. What kind of question is that? Of course he does.</p> <p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d I can hear the slight slur in his voice. Typical. \u201cI mean sometimes you do things that make me question\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust shut up! I don\u2019t want to talk to you anymore and I don\u2019t want to see you anymore. You can find your stuff boxed and on my driveway!\u201d God knows how many times I\u2019ve said that.</p><p>\u201cOlly, c\u2019mon. Don\u2019t be like that.\u201d He pleads through the phone, calling me by my nickname. \u201cYou\u2019re overreacting.\u201d</p><p>I hang up. How\u2019s that for fucking overreacting. I rest my head on the steering wheel as a few tears drop onto my bare thigh. Blade and I have been dating since we were seventeen. We\u2019re twenty three now. Realistically, we should\u2019ve only dated for two years. That was the first time he cheated on me. Since then I\u2019ve lost count of how many times he has betrayed me. I know. I\u2019m an idiot for taking him back and I should respect myself more blah, blah, blah. Hear me out; being with Blade is all I know. I\u2019ve never been with anyone else. The thought of not having him in my life terrifies me, but I know that if he is in my life he\u2019s going to keep destroying me over and over and I can\u2019t do it anymore. If being with Blade means I\u2019ll sit in restaurants alone for the rest of my life or worrying that I might catch some freaky STD from him...then I want no part of it.</p><p>I storm around my compact apartment with a big box tucked under my arms, collecting Blade\u2019s stuff. He doesn\u2019t live with me, but he sure has a lot of items lingering around my apartment. Each one I pick up makes me feel sicker as reality begins to sink in. When I\u2019m certain I\u2019ve grabbed everything I run downstairs and place the box on the driveway. I\u2019ve never gone as far as to actually remove his things before, but this time I\u2019m fed up. I\u2019ve had enough. I turn around, but a set of headlights pulling in to the driveway makes me turn back to the road. It\u2019s a taxi.</p><p>Great.</p><p>Blade jumps out of the backseat and pulls a handful of cash from the front pocket of his denim jeans. He tosses the money into the driver\u2019s window and jogs over to me.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d He pleads, running his fingers through his dark, blond hair. \u201cDon\u2019t do this. I love you.\u201d</p><p>I turn on my heel, knowing very well that if he flashes me those boyish dimples I\u2019ll cave. His hand wraps around my elbow and energy frissons through me as spins me around with surprising force. Under his grasp my elbow aches.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me.\u201d I snarl under my breath so the neighbors can\u2019t hear.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t release his grip. His eyes glare into mine as he leans close so I can feel and smell his hot, alcohol filled breath on my face. There\u2019s no sympathy on his face only anger. I glance at his small, blue eyes and then down his face to his thin lips. Pink lipstick along his jaw line catches my attention. My gaze follows the sets of lips down his neck, before disappearing underneath the blue collar of his green polo shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou are disgusting.\u201d I spit.</p><p>He squeezes my arm harder and I wince as my muscle forcefully compresses under my flesh. \u201cWhat would you do without me? Where would you be without me?\u201d</p><p>I snatch my arm back. \u201cI don\u2019t need you anymore. I need someone who appreciates me.\u201d</p><p>Blade laughs loudly, tilting his head back and exposing his teeth. Apparently, I said the joke of the year. \u201cYou won\u2019t find anyone that\u2019ll be as interested in you as I am. You\u2019re plain, Olivia, and you\u2019re boring. You\u2019ve got nothing to offer anyone. I\u2019m the best thing that has ever happened to you.\u201d</p><p>Ouch, to think that this bitter person is supposed to be my significant other. A weird tingling sensation builds up in my throat as it usually does before I cry and I press my tongue to the roof of my mouth to help ease the build-up of tears. And it does to a degree.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m such a bad catch then why are you so upset?\u201d I ask, my voice quivering slightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not upset. I\u2019m happy. Break up with me, I don\u2019t care. You\u2019ll come crawling back and when you do I\u2019m going to slam my door in your face.\u201d</p><p>I turn away from him. If I don\u2019t leave now, I\u2019ll cry and I don\u2019t want him to see me cry. I make my way up the small, white stairs and just before I step it into my apartment his voice calls out one last time. \u201cI don\u2019t need you! Maine is crawling with better girls and I picked up two of them tonight!\u201d</p><p>I slam my door and slide down the hard wood. How can someone who used to be so sweet be so damn hurtful? If you asked me a few years ago where I wanted to be in life I would have said \u2018anywhere as long as I have Blade\u2019. If you asked me that same question now, I\u2019d reply \u2018anywhere I don\u2019t see Blade\u2019s stupid face or hear his stupid voice\u2019. My chest heaves painfully as tears escape my eyes. I let them fall in full force because I\u2019ve been holding them back since the restaurant and I can\u2019t anymore. I crawl on my hands and knees from the front door, through the lounge room and into my bedroom. I manage to pull myself onto my bed and I let the cool, satin duvet cover caress my burning cheeks. After a few minutes I realize I\u2019m not crying because I broke up with Blade. I\u2019m crying because I know this isn\u2019t the end of it. He\u2019ll keep coming back. He\u2019ll keep emotionally blackmailing me and putting me down until I crack and accept him back into my life, but that isn\u2019t going to happen this time. I won\u2019t take him back. I\u2019m stronger now and I\u2019ve been preparing for our inevitable breakup for a long time now. Just because I choose to wear more conservative clothing doesn\u2019t make me plain and just because I like to stay home most nights and read and write does not make me boring. I\u2019ll show him that I\u2019m not dependant on him. I\u2019ll show him that I can\u2019t be controlled. I\u2019ll treat him like I\u2019m over him because I\u2019m definitely over being treated like I\u2019m nothing. I am not nothing. I am me and I love being me.</p><p>Screw him.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The next morning, I wake up extra early so I can get a longer session in at the gym before work. My gym is only a few blocks down, but I drive anyway. Why would I want to burn more calories than I need to? It was hard waking up early this morning. I didn\u2019t get a lot of sleep last night. I ended up switching my phone off after eleven p.m. and a million missed calls. I smile. Blade is probably freaking out right now and it serves him right.</p><p>Even after I switched off my phone sleep was scarce. I stayed up all night thinking, trying to pin point the exact moment Blade turned into a douche. I couldn\u2019t and I wonder if he\u2019s been like that since high school and I\u2019ve just been too blind to notice?</p><p>I pull up in front of the gym, lean across and pull my backpack off the passenger seat. Inside it has a towel, a pair of heels, a nice black business dress, some make-up and a hair brush. After my workout I need to shower and get dressed for work. Since the gym has showers, I figured I\u2019d knock two birds with one stone this morning. I adjust my ponytail, pull my tights up a little higher and cover my belly button with my pink tank top. Not that it helps any. It\u2019s so tight it keeps sliding back up and exposing my flat midriff.</p><p>I enter the gym and a sterile smell fills my nostrils. Yesterday, the gym was hosting a boot camp and it smelt strongly of sweat and vomit. Unpleasant is a nice way of putting it.</p><p>I scan the gym trying to decide where I want to start today. Usually, I start with the treadmill or the elliptical, but this morning I\u2019m feeling something a little more... aggressive. I want something I can take my anger out on. I have a lot of hate that I want to belt out of my system before work. My gaze falls onto the boxing ring where two staunch men spar. It\u2019s a start, I guess, but maybe I\u2019ll go with something a little more personal. I look over to the boxing bags and I see...him.</p><p>Whoa.</p><p>A shiver instantly shoots down my spine, igniting something dark and sinister deep down in my core. I helplessly drink in the strangers features, gaping at him like an idiot. Strands from his short, black hair stick to his forehead with sweat and as soon as I notice, he runs his taped fingers through it, sending tiny droplets of sweat in every direction. My mouth goes dry and I want to run my lips over his moist throat. I\u2019m suddenly aware of a strange, searing heat across the back of my neck and an electrical current I\u2019ve never felt before tingles between my thighs as I watch his sweaty chest rise and fall in a deep pant. He glances up at the ceiling and closes his eyes, forcing his Adams apple to protrude outwards, slightly. His broad shoulders and one side of his chest are covered in intricate tattoos. Across his hip is another tattoo\u2014it\u2019s a sentence, but I\u2019m too far away to read it. My gaze falls onto his black drawstring pants that hang off his narrow hips, exposing his delicious \u2018V\u2019 shape. I\u2019ve never seen a man so... so... like him. It\u2019s like he came straight out of a movie or some steamy, erotic women\u2019s magazine\u2014six pack and all.</p><p>He flexes his fingers and bounces lightly on his toes before he balls his hands into fists. His muscles tighten and twitch, work and relax, as he slams his hard fists into the large, blue bag. My entire body tightens and vibrates with pleasure every time his large fists connect. And the way his brows knit together as he swings his large, muscular arms has me squirming where I stand. I look at his face, his eyes are dark and his face serious, like the bag in front of him is someone he hates. Involuntarily, my eyes fall back to his \u2018V\u2019 shape and I ponder what exactly is under the thin fabric. The thought alone is enough for desire to start pooling between my thighs. A few seconds pass and I realize the string on his pants isn\u2019t swinging back and forth anymore\u2014he isn\u2019t moving. Slowly, I drag my eyes up over his slim hips and a narrow waist, a chest doused in a thin layer of clean sweat, well-formed traps and lastly, a pair of dark, brown eyes that are...looking directly at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shit!</p><p>My stomach claws its way up my throat with tremendous speed and I think I\u2019m going to be sick. I feel like I\u2019m standing on water, instead of solid ground and my eyes widen as my pulse instantly skyrockets. I want to run, but I remain frozen\u2014rooted in place. I open my mouth to apologize, but I\u2019m at least thirty feet away from him. I clamp my mouth shut. I\u2019m embarrassed, yet at the same time, I\u2019m aroused\u2014completely undone just because he\u2019s looking at me. His tantalizing, full lips break out into a cocky smile, like he heard everything I thought about him. Under my cheeks, my blood burns. Not with want, but with embarrassment and I hate it. I look down to my white sneakers. Maybe I\u2019ll start with the treadmills today. I force myself one foot in front of the other over to the treadmills that sit side by side. I crank up the speed of the treadmill and I run my ass off. Very quickly my body begins to moan and complain, probably because I forgot to warm up. Beeps sound off on the treadmill next to me.</p><p>\u201cHey, Olly.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s my Dad. I shouldn\u2019t be too surprised to run into him here. It is his gym, after all. I suppress a groan. Dad and I have had a bit of a bumpy road since I moved out. The only time he finds the time to talk to me is when he\u2019s trying to guilt trip me into moving back in. My older brother Chase gets to run around the world unbothered by our parents because he\u2019s serving our country. God forbid I do something for myself.</p><p>I slow my machine down to a brisk pace to match his. I hate my nickname. I\u2019ve been referred to as Olly for as long as I can remember. Dad and Blade are the only ones to get away with it.</p><p>Seeing Dad this morning is a little bit of a shock. He\u2019s been absent from the gym for a few days and his assistant Derrick has been handling things. \u201cDad? I haven\u2019t seen you around the gym in a while. I was getting worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not worried enough to come home and check on me?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes as he lifts off his bowlers cap with one hand and scratches his flat, grey hair with the other. He knew very well that if I so much as point one toe in the direction of the house, I\u2019ll never be allowed to leave.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy visiting your Aunt Kate.\u201d He informs me. \u201cYour cousin Tracey gave birth to a baby boy yesterday. He has my nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor kid,\u201d I joke, unable to contain a snicker.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, you\u2019re hilarious, I get it.\u201d</p><p>I smile at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s been happening with you?\u201d He asks.</p><p>I groan and flick my long ponytail over my other shoulder. \u201cI broke up with Blade last night. He left me at Salsa\u2019s again.\u201d</p> <p>Dad shakes his head. \u201cI told you he was bad news. That kid has no respect. I knew he was an ungrateful prick the moment I laid eyes on him.\u201d He places a soft hand on top of mine. \u201cIt\u2019s his loss, honey. You\u2019re a good girl and if my mate\u2019s sons weren\u2019t already married I\u2019d put in a good word for you.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s the thought that counts.\u201d I look beyond Dad and the stranger is back to punching his bag. His hard pecs contract every time he makes contact and I imagine running my tongue slowly over his erect nipples. What is wrong with me?</p><p>\u201cHey, who\u2019s that guy?\u201d I ask, flicking my head in his direction.</p><p>Dad turns around. \u201cThe guy with the muscles?\u201d He faces me and I nod. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know who he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I supposed to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Seth Marc,\u201d Jesus, even his name makes my insides melt. \u201cHe just moved to Portland from Seattle. He\u2019s a great MMA fighter\u2014or at least he was.\u201d</p><p>I arch an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cThe guy was so close to going pro when he turned twenty one. He competed in an amateur MMA comp, but he dropped out seconds before the championship bout. It had something to do with family drama. His comeback has been all over the internet.\u201d</p> <p>I sigh. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t go on the internet much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, don\u2019t distract the guy. He\u2019s got tough competition in the upcoming tournament that he needs to smash if he wants to get into the pros.\u201d Dad turns off his treadmill. \u201cI gotta go, kid. I\u2019ll talk to ya later.\u201d</p><p>Before he walks completely away, he turns abruptly. \u201cCome over for dinner next Sunday. Your mama is killing me. She wants to see you more often.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>Dad rolls his eyes and leaves me looking at Seth. He\u2019s literally sex in hand wraps and the way he smiled at me is burnt into my brain. Looking at him now with the way his brows are pulled together and his lips pressed into a straight line\u2014I never would have thought he\u2019s capable of smiling. I turn my treadmill off and grab my backpack. I\u2019m done working out for the day\u2014not that it helped any. I\u2019m even more wound up now than I was before I got to the gym and I have a funny feeling that the only thing that\u2019s going to help me is Seth and his tongue. I exhale, pulling my shirt down again. Who am I kidding? I\u2019d never approach a guy like him. There\u2019s too much alpha male going on. He oozes authority and aggression. He\u2019s a lion and I\u2019m a mouse\u2014he\u2019d swallow me whole and not in the good way. I turn toward the female shower room, keeping my head down and straight, until a bouncy brunette enters the gym and demands attention. In her tight tube dress and with heels, no doubt higher than her morals (I\u2019m aware that\u2019s not an accepted form of measurement, but it makes me feel better thinking it), she prances right over to Seth. Of course he is with her. Why wouldn\u2019t he be? Her body is slim and her boobs are big and fake. He does strike me as the kind of guy who enjoys that sort of thing and she is pretty in that fake, comes-off-with-a-wipe kind of way.</p><p>Her back is to me as she wraps her long, skinny arms around his neck, pulling him into her so his head rests on the nape of her shoulder. From under his brow, his eyes flicker onto me and... Damn it! I\u2019m staring at him again, only this time I can\u2019t look away. His dark, mesmerizing gaze has me trapped. They hug for a while and the whole time he watches me with a knowing, yet curious gleam in his eyes. Seth pulls away from her and when his eyes finally release me, I turn on my heel and practically run to the showers.</p><p>The shower room is a little tight and there are only two shower booths. The other four showerheads are out in the open. I\u2019m not shameless enough to shower in front of other people, but the old woman showering freely when I walked in seemed to have no quarrels with me seeing her naked. I, on the other hand, squeezed my eyes shut and I dove for the nearest booth.</p><p>The water is nice on my skin. A little too cold for my liking, but I need it to be. If I was going to make it through the day without touching myself to relieve whatever it is that has me wound tighter than a Goddamn jack-in-the-box, then I need something to cool me down. I\u2019ve never been a sexual person, but right now I\u2019m the horniest I\u2019ve ever been in my life and it\u2019s all because a guy at the gym looked at me.</p><p>How lame.</p><p>I like sex, but Blade has been my only sexual partner and the sex really isn\u2019t anything to brag about. It goes for a few minutes and then that\u2019s it. The only way I\u2019ve been able to achieve orgasm is if I do it myself.</p><p>I dry myself off and slip into some underwear. I pull on some black stockings and then zip myself into my black dress before sliding into a nice pair of cream wedges. After I gather my things, I make my way over to the sinks with the foggy-like mirrors. Even after the cool shower my cheeks are still a little flushed. I rub on my foundation to lessen the pinkish hue and it works to a degree. After applying some subtle eye make-up, I pull my long, damp hair into a makeshift bun. It\u2019s a little messy, but it looks deliberate and I really can\u2019t be bothered fixing it. I pull my cell phone out of my bag and fling my bag over my shoulder. The old woman is still shamelessly showering away when I leave the room and as I stroll down the hallway, I switch my phone on and immediately I\u2019m bombarded with text messages and voicemails from Blade, my mom and my best friend Selena.</p><p>FROM: SELENA 12:00 A.M.</p><p>Why is Blade calling me non-stop?</p><p>Please tell me it\u2019s for real and</p><p>You dumped his arrogant ass?</p><p>FROM: SELENA 12:15 A.M.</p><p>Answer me dammit!</p><p>I don\u2019t know if I should open</p><p>champagne or not. The suspense</p><p>is killing me!!!</p><p>FROM: SELENA 12:30 A.M.</p><p>I opened the champagne anyway.</p><p>I giggle to myself. Selena is always looking for an excuse to drink alcohol. I think she\u2019s already had three birthdays this year because of it. I hit reply.</p><p>TO: SELENA 8:15 A.M.</p><p>Yep, it\u2019s over between us.</p><p>The bastard left\u2014</p><p>\u201cUnf.\u201d I grunt as I walk into a hard body. My phone slips from my hands and hits the floor. Thankfully, the screen remains crack free.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I groan, kneeling down to pick up my phone. I pick it up off the floor and then I freeze. My hand tightens convulsively around the device as I notice the person standing in front of me is wearing a pair of black drawstring pants. Slowly, my eyes travel up his body. No, no, no, no. Please, God let it be anyone but him. My gaze meets his hard, sweaty chest and then flicks up to a pair of dark, chocolate eyes that have little golden rivers of honey that branch throughout them. I swallow hard. He\u2019s inches away from me, standing as still as stone and staring down at me. I feel my knees begin to shake as I peer shyly up at him through my dark lashes. He extends a long, fingered hand to me and I instantly take it.</p><p>\u201cDid I get you wet?\u201d He asks in a voice that is so sinfully deep I immediately get a shiver down my spine. He helps me to my feet, but doesn\u2019t let go of my hand. His skin is hot and my blood simmers as a result. I sink my teeth into my bottom lip as a telltale blush springs to my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I get you wet?\u201d He repeats slower this time, emphasizing each word. \u201cI\u2019m covered in sweat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d I glance down at my dress. There are a few damp patches that are blacker than the rest, but nothing too serious or gross. I don\u2019t even think the word gross can be used in a sentence with this man. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get too much on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d He asks, leaning closer to me.</p><p>\u201cOlivia.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s mouth molds into a breathtaking smile and I\u2019m unsuccessful at tearing my eyes away from his as he draws my hand to his mouth and softly places his lips on my knuckles. I gasp as he tugs on me, pulling me in close. My free hand flies up and rests against his hard chest in attempt to stop myself from fully pressing against him. Pure, white-hot lust tears through my body and spills over every organ and every bone before settling between my thighs. Our bodies are so close and I stare into his dark eyes completely disarmed and confused. Am I dreaming? I can feel his body heat radiating onto me\u2014entering me. I glance past him and the brunette, his girlfriend, is glowering at us. I take a deep controlled breath before pulling my hand back. If my hand had a mind of its own it\u2019d undoubtedly slap me. He seems amused by the way I regard him and bites back a smile.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me,\u201d I say, dropping eye contact. \u201cI\u2019m running late for work.\u201d</p><p>Damn! If only I didn\u2019t have work, I\u2019d stay in the gym all day. I step past him and keep my head down as I pass his girlfriend. Behind me, the angry brunette\u2019s voice is rambling about how disrespectful he is being to her and I think I hear him chuckle. Without a glance over my shoulder, I flee from the gym.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>I sit at work typing names and taking calls. I try hard to focus on the tasks at hand, but I can\u2019t stop thinking about Seth or his body. Or his black hair. Or the way his lips felt on my hand. Or his dark eyes. I squeeze my thighs tighter and suddenly, I have an insatiable craving for chocolate and honey. I shake my head. Underneath my strange and abrupt desire for Seth, the stranger at the gym, there\u2019s a guilty feeling swirling around my stomach like I\u2019ve done something wrong. I broke up with Blade last night so technically I\u2019m a single woman...so why do I feel so dirty?</p><p>I enjoy working as a receptionist, but I\u2019ve been glancing around the same spacious, sterile waiting room for the last two years and I just can\u2019t seem to find enough motivation to quit here. I hope one day I can actually do something different with my life like become an author or direct movies. I\u2019ve always wanted to be able to tell a story in some way. Writing seems more achievable and if I had a choice, I\u2019d be a famous romance author. There\u2019s just something about a healthy love and a happy ending that inspires me. Of course, my mother doesn\u2019t consider writing an actual career, neither does Blade. \u201cWriting is a dead end career. You\u2019ll run out of unrealistic stories eventually. Become a therapist or a psychologist, then you\u2019ll always be busy. People have endless problems that they want to discuss all of the time.\u201d Mom would say. At least she had a point\u2014not that I agree with it. Blade said things like \u201cPeople don\u2019t read anymore,\u201d or \u201cIt sucks.\u201d Since when does reading suck? Who says that? If I ran the world, people who didn\u2019t read would be the first to go. Boom. Put them out of their misery.</p><p>I put a piece of paper through the shredder and my mind falls back onto Seth Marc. I still feel his hands on my skin and his lips on my knuckles. I\u2019ve never been so captivated by the opposite sex before. I\u2019m a little angry that he so openly flirted with me when is girlfriend was in the same building. That is not okay and I hate myself for being weak. I never want to be the girl a guy cheats with because I know what it\u2019s like to be the girl that gets cheated on and it sucks. I can fantasize and perve on him in the gym though, can\u2019t I? I mean, where\u2019s the harm in that? The way he looked at me with that unapologetic stare makes me feel dizzy and I subconsciously squeeze my thighs together. He\u2019s definitely the kind of guy moms warn their daughters about\u2014the kind that breaks hearts and leaves a long line of them behind him. Strangely, he doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of guy you can avoid. I imagine he\u2019d be relentless in pursuing what he wants. Who am I kidding? There\u2019s no way he wants me. I have an over-active imagination... maybe that\u2019s all it is. I tap my pen in an uneven rhythm on the desk. But he did pull me into him... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A woman in front of me clears her throat, demanding my attention, but I continue to look through her, imagining all of the sick, sexy things I\u2019d let Seth do to me.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d She asks. Her tone is thick with snobby attitude.</p><p>Her wrinkled, aged face comes into focus and I\u2019m looking at her cherry colored lips that are pursed into an annoyed line. Her white hair sits on the top of her head, like a poodle. Yep, she reminds me of a poodle. I ready my fingers on the worn out keyboard. \u201cName, please?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMiriam Matthews.\u201d I type as she speaks.</p><p>I tick her name as attended and tell her to have a seat. With a frustrated exhale, she struts away from me. Her dress is a cherry-red, just like her lips and it\u2019s tight, forcing her gigantic, fake boobs as high as they can possibly go. I wonder if she comes here to discuss her inability to let go of her youth. I smile to myself. Trying to read people without even getting to know them is a habit of mine. I frown. I couldn\u2019t get a full reading on Seth. He was difficult and that bugs me. With the old lady, on the other hand, I think I have a pretty good idea of what she\u2019s all about. I peer over my desk at the woman and judging by the way she sits with her legs tightly crossed as she subconsciously taps her beautiful manicured finger on her equally beautiful diamond watch tells me that she\u2019s impatient. That\u2019s not too surprising considering everyone is busy these days. The rock-hard, lifeless pair of fake tits that protruded from her dress brings me back to my inability to let go of youth point. I glance at her hands. There\u2019s a tan line on her ring finger and I\u2019m going to assume she\u2019s a recent widow to her latest of five husbands. I look at my computer screen and click on her file. Close enough. She\u2019s had three name changes the past two years. I click on \u2018John Matthews\u2019 the name that\u2019s linked to her account. A big red \u2018DECEASED\u2019 watermark runs across his file. Sometimes, I\u2019m too good at what I do.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you breaching some kind of doctor-slash-patient confidentiality laws?\u201d I jump and switch the monitor off as Selena slides onto my desk.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d I breathe. \u201cYou scared the hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>Selena laughs and nudges me, drawing a few annoyed scowls from the patients in the waiting room. I press my finger against my lips. \u201cShoosh, this is my work, remember. What are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>She flicks her soft, blonde curls so they drape over her shoulder and leans closer to me. The smell of cigarette on her breath makes me nauseous. Lightly, I shove her backwards. \u201cYour breath smells like smoke. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops,\u201d She reaches for a piece of gum out of a hidden pocket in her bag. \u201cSorry.\u201d She pops the gum into her mouth, scrunches the wrapper and aims for the bin, missing terribly.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I ask again as she applies minimum lip gloss to her plump lips.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d come check on you. You didn\u2019t answer any of my texts.\u201d She slides out of her beige coat and tucks it underneath her. \u201cI was worried. I half expected to find you dead somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d After literally running into Seth at the gym, I completely forgot to text Selena back. \u201cI switched my phone off last night and then this morning I got a little caught up at Dad\u2019s gym.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cBoring. Anyway, you really broke up with Blade?\u201d</p> <p>I nod. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s no getting back with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not this time.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the fact that we\u2019re in a quiet place, Selena squeals like a pre-teen who\u2019s just won backstage tickets to a Justin Bieber concert. From her bag she pulls out a mini box of baby sized wine coolers. The patients cringe at her high voice\u2014but a few enjoyed having a slim blonde dancing to no music and slamming back wine. The door closest to my reception desk opens abruptly and Mason Peterson, my boss, storms from his office. His grey suit clings to his fantastically tight body. He\u2019s in good shape for someone who\u2019s as old as he is\u2014early forties, maybe. He has a nice face, too. His hair is a golden color, like baked bread and his eyes are a striking blue. He moved his business to Portland, Maine from Seattle four years ago due to a rocky divorce. Beside me Selena stops dancing and I drop my eyes to my blank screen, moving my fingers across the keyboard, pretending to type.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here, Olivia?\u201d He asks sternly.</p><p>Mason is an awesome boss. He lets me get away with a lot of stuff most bosses would fire their employees for and occasionally I abuse it.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea who this girl is.\u201d I say. \u201cShe must be a patient here.\u201d</p><p>I pick up the phone. \u201cHello, Guyers and Peterson Psychology this is Olivia.\u201d</p> <p>Mason exhales, placing his hands firmly on his hips. His azure eyes narrow in on me and the disappointment is clear on his face. \u201cOlivia, I\u2019m not an idiot. I know the phone didn\u2019t ring and Selena you\u2019re not allowed to drink in here. How many times do I have to tell you?\u201d</p><p>I press my lips tightly together to prevent myself from laughing. It didn\u2019t help any. The laugh I\u2019m holding back ends up coming out of my nose. Damn, Selena. She knows exactly how to turn me back into my old high-school self.</p><p>\u201cCome on guys. How many warnings do I have to give you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mason.\u201d I apologize, wiping laughter tears from my eyes and smudging my mascara slightly. \u201cI had no idea Selena was coming today. She just showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d He doesn\u2019t believe me.</p><p>\u201cOlivia broke up with Blade last night.\u201d</p><p>Wow, so apparently that\u2019s information the whole world should know. I shoot Selena an angry glare and she shrugs it off. Selena has a habit of running her mouth off to people I don\u2019t want knowing my business. Mason is a good boss, but he\u2019s also persistent. I\u2019ve lost count of how many times he has asked me out to dinner.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time.\u201d Mason sighs. \u201cThat guy was an asshole. How are you holding up?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cSurprisingly well, actually.\u201d I made it out of bed so that\u2019s a start.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He pulls his cell phone from his back pocket and dials a number. \u201cSally? Hi, it\u2019s Mason. Yeah. Can you come in today? Olivia isn\u2019t feeling well. Okay, great. See you soon.\u201d</p><p>I gape at him wide eyed. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you time to relax. You can come back in two days.\u201d</p><p>Selena bounces excitedly, but I cross my arms over my chest. I don\u2019t like people doing favors for me, especially people that will expect things in return. \u201cThat\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s happening, now get out of here before you cost me anymore clients.\u201d</p><p>I reach under my chair, grab my handbag and step away from the desk. I\u2019m not going to complain about a day off. God knows I need one. Selena grabs her coat, hooks her arm around my elbow and pulls me toward the door. I look back at Mason who positions himself behind the desk. He switches on the monitor and John Matthew\u2019s personal file opens right where I left it. Mason shoots me an annoyed glance. I shrug and push through the door before he changes his mind about letting me go.</p><p>Selena and I pull into a small steakhouse. She fought tooth and nail for Mexican, but I think I made it pretty clear that I never want to eat Mexican again. Ever.</p><p>We sit by a window that showcases the not-so-beautiful scenery of the car park and the full highway.</p><p>\u201cI am so sick of living in this place.\u201d Selena groans, taking in the car park.</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again.\u201d</p><p>She pulls a small wine from her bag and hands it to me. To prevent the inevitable speech that comes with denying alcohol from her, I take it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry girls.\u201d A middle-aged waitress says as she approaches us, pulling a pencil from behind her ear. \u201cYou can\u2019t bring your own. You have to buy alcohol here.\u201d</p><p>Selena takes my wine back and shoves it into her bag, all while smiling sweetly at the woman. \u201cThat\u2019s okay, more for me later.\u201d</p><p>I giggle at her as she orders a jug of beer and cheesy fries. I, on the other hand, order a chicken burger and a side of beer battered chips. My stomach grumbles while we wait for our food. I didn\u2019t eat before I left the house this morning\u2014not the smartest thing considering I was going to work out. My mouth waters as I watch waiters and waitresses bring food to other customers. Just to have something in my stomach I sip at my beer. I cringe and make a strange sound in the base of my throat as I swallow the gross liquid. I hate beer and as a result, I suddenly feel nauseous.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Selena begins, ignoring my reaction to the beer. \u201cWhat made you decide you\u2019ve finally had enough of Blade\u2019s shit?\u201d</p><p>Honestly, I have no idea where to begin. \u201cWell, he left me at Salsa\u2019s again to go hang out with \u2018his boys\u2019 and when I called him another girl answered his phone.\u201d Selena rolls her eyes, unsurprised. \u201cI realized it\u2019s probably going to be like that for the rest of my life and that\u2019s the complete opposite of what I want and what I deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight. If I was a guy, I\u2019d treat you right!\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cThanks, Sel.\u201d</p><p>Seconds later, the waitress brings our food and Selena dives greedily into her cheesy fries. For a girl so slender and fit, she sure eats and drinks like shit. I\u2019m quite fit and on most days I eat right, but that still didn\u2019t slim the curves of my body. No matter how hard I try, the hips wanted to stay. Sadly, there\u2019s no exercise to slim your bones.</p><p>Selena perks up, like she just had an awesome idea. \u201cDo you want to go out tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I reply instantly.</p><p>I hate clubs. I hate clubs more than I hate cheaters. Clubs make me anxious. Being grinded on by a bunch of random, sleazy dudes and having them breathe their alcohol/cigarette breath all over you is disgusting.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, O. You never come out with me. You don\u2019t have Blade anymore, live a little.\u201d</p><p>I throw a few chips into my mouth and speak to her through mashed potato. \u201cIt\u2019s not about that. I hate clubs and you know it.\u201d</p><p>She pouts her lips at me and I notice a spattering of salt across them. \u201cDon\u2019t make me go by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelena, you\u2019ve already started drinking and it\u2019s barely eleven a.m. You and I both know you\u2019ll be out cold by four this afternoon\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll make a deal with you.\u201d She pauses, grabs her beer and slams back the rest of it before setting the empty glass back down on the table. \u201cIf I stop drinking now, you\u2019ll come out with me tonight. Think of my liver. If you say no, I\u2019m going to have to pound it with the rest of that jug of beer, but if you say yes I won\u2019t touch another drop until tonight.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I put a piece of lettuce into my mouth. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll come out with you, but I don\u2019t want to go to Heaven\u2019s. Blade always goes there.\u201d</p><p>Heaven\u2019s is our city\u2019s biggest nightclub and I hate it.</p><p>The jingle of the bell attached to the front door rings, pulling me from my train of thought and I glance up as a bunch of rowdy boys step in. Selena straightens her back and twists in her seat so she can check out the group. Selena loves boys almost as much as she loves booze, although they usually came hand in hand.</p><p>\u201cYum, look how tall they all are.\u201d I can practically hear her mouth pooling with drool.</p><p>While she\u2019s not looking I take a cheesy fry from her plate and pop it into my mouth. \u201cYeah.\u201d I agree, not looking in their direction. I\u2019m disappointed. It\u2019s not really a cheesy fry... It\u2019s just a thick cut chip with some weird cheese salt.</p><p>Selena turns back to me. \u201cAre you even looking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>She leans closer. \u201cO, stop being a lesbian and perve at the boys that just walked in. You\u2019re starting to worry me.\u201d</p><p>Quickly, I glance up at them and then back down to my plate just to keep her happy.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t count.\u201d She snaps under her breath. \u201cDo it again. And actually look like you appreciate it this time.\u201d</p><p>I exhale and look at the group of boys who sit a few booths down from us. Two of them had their backs to me so I couldn\u2019t comment on their faces. One is wearing a blue hoodie and he has broad, wide shoulders. The other is a little smaller, wearing a tight black shirt and a red cap. Looking past them I see the two guys facing my direction. They aren\u2019t anything special and one has an annoying moustache.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they hot?\u201d She gasps, kicking my shin a little too hard and making me flinch.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I groan through clenched teeth. When the pain subsides, I continue. \u201cI mean they\u2019re not ugly.\u201d</p><p>Selena laughs a bit too loudly and two pairs of eyes fall onto me. My cheeks instantly turn pink.</p><p>\u201cAre they looking?\u201d She asks, whispering.</p><p>Not wanting to provoke her, I lie. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>I drop my gaze back to my burger and pick it up to take a bite. All the flavors from the chicken and sauce flood into my mouth\u2014tomato, aioli, pickle relish\u2014I almost moan out loud. It\u2019s that amazing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going over there.\u201d She turns to slide out of the booth and I drop my burger onto its plate as I reach for her arm. I manage to snag it, forcing her to stay put.</p><p>I swallow my mouthful of food. \u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot. There are four of them.\u201d</p><p>She winks at me. \u201cThe more the merrier.\u201d</p><p>Selena shrugs out of my grasp and straightens her short grey dress. She fluffs her long hair and turns to me. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes, knowing very well that I\u2019ve already lost. \u201cGo get em\u2019.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There\u2019s no reason for them not to be interested in Selena. She\u2019s perfect. She struts over to them and I pull Atonement by Ian McEwan from my handbag. When Selena \u2018chats\u2019 to boys, it\u2019s never a five minute thing She drags it out as long as she can and thankfully I\u2019ve come prepared. I\u2019m not very far in, but if it\u2019s anything like the movie, I should love it. Giggles pull my gaze back onto the group. They\u2019ve made room for her to sit down with them, she glances at me and I wrinkle my nose up at her. She\u2019s definitely in her element. Her beautiful, pink-lipped smile is in place and to my own shock, she points a slender index finger my way. I shake my head at her while my stomach churns painfully. The guy with his back to me\u2014the one in the hoodie\u2014slings his arm over the back of the chair and sets his dark eyes on me. I gasp inwardly as the blood drains from my face. I stare at the over-confident smile and the familiar pair of chocolate irises.</p><p>Seth-fucking-Marc.</p><p>Chapter Four</p> <p>I open my book and pull it up to cover my burning face. My cheeks are bright red, I can feel it. Seth is intimidating with his wide frame, perfect physique and annoyingly gorgeous face. Please, for the love of God, don\u2019t let him remember me.</p><p>No such luck.</p><p>Two long, calloused fingers curl around the top of my book and pull it from my hands.</p><p>The first thing I notice is a baggy pair of dark navy jeans and a blue hoodie that\u2019s pulled up over his black hair. It\u2019s unzipped, resting against his hard torso and exposing a strip of his bare, delicious midsection. I clear my throat nervously as my eyes lock onto his and I try my absolute hardest to keep my eyes on his and not on the incredibly hard, incredibly tempting strip of flesh.</p><p>\u201cIs there room for one more?\u201d</p> <p>I open my mouth to tell him it\u2019s taken, but he drops into the seat across from me anyway, placing my book on the table. A toothpick hangs from his tantalizing mouth and I\u2019ve never wanted to be an intimate object so badly in my life. Seth pushes Selena\u2019s fries out of the way and I lean slightly to look past him. I meet Selena\u2019s green eyes. She smiles, giving me the thumbs up. I fight the urge to scowl and I turn my attention back to Seth who\u2019s watching me, intently. He has the same gleam in his eyes that undid me in the gym this morning. His index finger taps the table and my warm centre pulsates every time his finger thumps against the wood. He doesn\u2019t say anything, but I can feel his eyes penetrating my clothes and licking me everywhere. I drag in a deep inhale through my nose in an attempt to control myself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Seth, by the way.\u201d He says, pulling the toothpick from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are.\u201d I cringe inwardly. I didn\u2019t mean for my voice to come out so rudely.</p><p>His head angles to the side as if he\u2019s carefully studying me and one corner of his mouth twitches into a smile. \u201cIs this where you work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I, uh, I work as a receptionist for a psychologist.\u201d Under the table, I fiddle with my fingers. I\u2019m so nervous and I have absolutely no idea how to handle this situation. \u201cI\u2019m here for lunch with my friend.\u201d I nod my head towards Selena with his friends in the booth, but he doesn\u2019t turn around to look.</p><p>His leg brushes against mine, sending a tidal wave of electricity through my body and I pull away. If it were anyone else, I\u2019d have left already, but with Seth... I can\u2019t seem to muster up the courage to get away. Pleasure flares in the dark depths of his eyes and I wonder if I\u2019m going about this the wrong way. He seems to be drawn to the way I regard him. Problem is, I don\u2019t know how else to treat him. He\u2019s sexy as hell and on one hand I want nothing more than for him to tear my clothes off, but on the other, I refuse to be that kind of girl and not to mention the fact he has a girlfriend.</p> <p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better, Olivia, I\u2019d say you\u2019re repulsed by me.\u201d</p><p>I feel my lips purse into a thin line and I think carefully about my reply. \u201cI\u2019m not repulsed. I\u2019m just not that kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>Seth pushes the hoodie from his head, exposing his sexy, dark hair and leans forward on the table with his elbows. His hair is short, but messy and my fingers twitch at the urge to run my hands through it.</p><p>\u201cAnd what kind of girl is that?\u201d He asks me in a voice that is so rough it vibrates all my sensitive parts.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cThe kind to flirt with a guy who has a girlfriend...\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, shock doesn\u2019t register on his face. Instead, he smiles a full smile that exposes his perfect, white teeth and I can feel myself scowling. He leans back against the booth and the arms of his hoodie tighten as he folds his thick, strong forearms over each other. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pretty brunette with the big fake boobs...\u201d</p><p>He glances at my chest before looking back at my face, grinning unapologetically. My scowl deepens because he doesn\u2019t seem to care that I saw him do it. \u201cI don\u2019t do girlfriends.\u201d</p> <p>His words deflate a balloon in my chest I didn\u2019t even know existed and I glance out the window toward the car park.</p><p>\u201cI have girls that I sleep with, but that\u2019s the extent of it.\u201d</p><p>I drag my gaze back to Seth\u2019s face, my brows pulled together. \u201cSo you\u2019re single?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI prefer the term free.\u201d</p><p>Free. I like that. As of last night, I\u2019m free too and my God is it refreshing. I stick a chip in my mouth and glance awkwardly around the steakhouse. I feel so out of place having this big, sexy man talking to me.</p><p>\u201cNow that we\u2019ve cleared the girlfriend issue up,\u201d His leg leans against mine and he sticks the toothpick back in his mouth. He flicks it subtly across his moist bottom lip a few times, his tongue barely seen behind his supple lips. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d</p><p>His tone implies so many things, but I have no idea what he actually means. I watch him as he sits before me with his broad shoulders and a snippet of his chest tattoo sticking out from underneath his jacket. His eyes drop from mine and lock intently on my lips. The playful glimmer that had been in them just moments ago disappeared, and they seem to be burning\u2014smoldering darkly at me from across the table. I open my mouth ready to comply with whatever he wants to do, until Selena clears her throat, bringing me back to my senses. Even if he is \u2018free\u2019 I\u2019m still not the kind of girl that has sex with someone I barely know... or at least I don\u2019t think I am. Seth licks his lips in frustration before turning his attention to Selena. I see her chest rise and fall rapidly under his gaze. At least I\u2019m not the only one affected by his presence.</p><p>\u201cO,\u201d She says, turning her eyes on me. \u201cWe have to go.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s agitated. I can tell by the way she rubs her fingers together at her sides and purses her pink lips. I wonder what those boys said to her.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say to him for the second time to day. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>I reach across and grab my book before sliding it back into my handbag. I glance at my plate. I only managed to take one bite out of my burger and I\u2019m still hungry. I shuffle out of the booth, keeping my eyes on the table. When I turn away from the booth I still feel his eyes on me\u2014analyzing me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you around.\u201d He calls to me.</p><p>I glance over my shoulder and give him a slight smile. His words thrill me because it almost sounds like a guarantee. Selena has a firm grip on my forearm as she drags me from the steakhouse. Before we exit she flips off the group of boys and they laugh loudly. When we\u2019re outside and out of earshot I ask her what happened.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gross.\u201d She states simply.</p><p>I don\u2019t press the unlock button on my keys and she stands at the passenger door impatiently waiting for me to unlock it. \u201cWhy are they gross?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey thought I was a prostitute and they wanted to pay for blowjobs in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>The way her eyebrows pull together, forming a small wrinkle on the bridge of her nose makes me erupt with laughter. I prop my back against the car, leaning all of my weight onto it as my stomach begins to burn.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny.\u201d Selena groans.</p><p>Tears squeeze their way out of the corner of my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not laughing because of what they said.\u201d I manage to say in between deep breaths of air. \u201cI\u2019m laughing because you look so disgusted!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am disgusted.\u201d The wind blows a soft, blonde curl into her face and she swipes at it. \u201cCan you unlock the God damn car so we can get out of here?\u201d</p><p>When I press the button, she wastes no time in diving into the car. I inhale a few times before opening the door and sliding in behind the wheel.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit.\u201d Selena swears, dropping her face into her hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, as my chest hiccups with a remaining giggle.</p><p>\u201cI left my handbag inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not going back to get it.\u201d No way.</p><p>Selena turns in her seat so the majority of her body is facing me. Her big, green eyes hold a pleading gleam as she presses her palms together. \u201cPlease, O! Please don\u2019t make me go back in there. I\u2019m embarrassed enough as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m eager to go back in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be. Your guy was a total babe and he was so into you.\u201d</p><p>No, he was into the fact that I have a vagina, not me as a person. I squeeze the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my guy.\u201d Is all I manage to say.</p><p>\u201cJust do it for me and we don\u2019t have to go clubbing tonight. We\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before she finishes her sentence I\u2019m out of the car and marching back to the steakhouse. I\u2019d do anything to get out of clubbing. I open the door and the bell rings. I allow myself one deep, uneven breath before lifting my gaze from the floor. Various sets of eyes flicker to me, but the only pair I see are the brown ones connected to such a handsome face. My mouth instantly goes dry and I hate myself for it. He leans against the back of his friends\u2019 booth with Selena\u2019s handbag tucked nicely under his arm. His hands are stuffed into the front pockets of his jeans and inwardly, I shake my head at myself. I really need to man up. I hate feeling so little and vulnerable in front of him\u2014in front of a stranger. I force myself to walk towards him, holding my hand out for Selena\u2019s bag. He glances at my palm with a smirk\u2014it\u2019s more of a corner lip twitch, but I still want to suck it off his face.</p><p>I clear my throat. \u201cCan I have my friend\u2019s handbag, please?\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, he hands it to me without a word and I take it. Quickly, I turn on my heel and I head for the door, but before I make it, his friend calls out to me.</p><p>\u201cHey, you!\u201d</p><p>I let out a slow exhale and turn, forcing my politest smile. The guy with the lousy moustache smiles at me, exposing his teeth.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her we\u2019ll pay her extra if she comes back in and I\u2019ll throw in double if those full, pink lips of yours are willing to participate.\u201d He smiles at me like I\u2019m on the price is right and I\u2019ve just received an awesome deal. I blink at him, repeatedly. What. A. Douchebag.</p><p>The man in the red cap looks over his shoulder at me and shakes his head, embarrassed by his friend\u2019s behavior. I look at Seth and his amused expression becomes murderous as he turns to his friend.</p><p>\u201cShow some fucking respect.\u201d He demands in a voice that is low and aggressive, startling me.</p><p>Moustache-face slumps a little in his seat and when his hazel eyes fall back onto me, I turn my attention back to Seth.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I can defend myself.\u201d</p><p>I storm from the steakhouse and don\u2019t hear the door close behind me as I step down the small, concrete stairs. Dread slithers through my tummy because I just know he\u2019s behind me.</p><p>\u201cOlivia!\u201d Seth calls, forcing me to slow my pace. I whirl around to face him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about my friends. They tend to get a little... stupid in the presence of beautiful women.\u201d</p><p>My stomach flutters and I drop my sight to the bland concrete for a split second. I never would have expected him to regard me as a \u2018beautiful woman\u2019.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. We can\u2019t control our friend\u2019s stupidity, no matter how much we want to.\u201d I say with a smile. \u201cSee you.\u201d</p><p>Turning away from him is difficult, but I manage just fine. I make sure I keep my gaze low as I climb back into the car and toss Selena\u2019s handbag onto her lap. She watches me as I reverse from the car park and onto the highway. I pretend not to notice her staring at me, but I do and it\u2019s creeping me out.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>I look at her briefly. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, a hottie chases you from the steakhouse and you\u2019re not telling me anything.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell you. He had your handbag and I got it back. He followed me out to the car park to apologize for his friend\u2019s attitudes.\u201d</p><p>She clasps her hand over her chest. \u201cWhat a sweetheart. Are you seeing him?\u201d</p><p>I scoff and maybe push a little too hard on the accelerator. \u201cWhat? No, we met briefly at the gym this morning and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d She squeals. \u201cHe is what made you forget to text me back? Did you, you know?\u201d You know? How old are we, twelve? She erupts into a fit of giggles and I feel my cheeks burning.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not you.\u201d</p><p>Selena doesn\u2019t have the shortest or cleanest sexual relations record book and she knows it. Selena raises her hands, flashing me her palms in defeat. \u201cOkay, okay, but if you do, you better tell me.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>After the steakhouse Selena and I stay at my house for the rest of the day. We didn\u2019t do much. She helped me clean and prepare dinner then we went down to the store to buy snacks for our movie night. When we were back at home I strangely couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Blade. I scroll to his name on my contact list and stare at it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe I should call him...\u201d I tell Selena as she puts the chicken on the portable grill.</p><p>\u201cCall who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlade.\u201d</p> <p>She stops what she\u2019s doing and faces me. Without warning, her hand firmly slaps my cheek, tossing my head to the side. My skin burns and anger prickles across my flesh.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Selena?\u201d</p><p>She pulls my phone from my hands and tosses it into the lounge room. It bounces off a fluffy, blue cushion and then onto my turquoise shaggy rug. \u201cYou cannot call him. He\u2019ll use whatever sneaky shit he can to weasel his way back into your life. He cheated on you\u2014a million times. You deserve someone better than him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I should call him and see if he\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head as she tied her curls into a bun on the top of her head. \u201cHe\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t convince yourself that he\u2019s sitting at home staring at the phone waiting for you to call because he isn\u2019t. He\u2019ll be out somewhere hitting on girls and drinking until he passes out. Fuck that noise.\u201d</p> <p>I turn from her to pour Caesar sauce onto the salad mix. I know I\u2019m not the one who did the wrong thing, but am I supposed to let six years go down the drain like it meant nothing? Is that how it works? Six years of your life is a long time to give to someone. I should at least clear the air between us so it makes me feel better about wasting so much time.</p><p>Selena finishes mixing the chicken with the salad and leaves it to cool.</p><p>\u201cI need to pee.\u201d She announces, leaving the kitchen in pursuit of the toilet.</p><p>As soon as I hear the bathroom door close I run for my phone and step outside. I dial Blade\u2019s number and for the first time ever, he answers immediately.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking a guy named Seth Marc?\u201d There\u2019s no warmth to his voice and it startles me.</p><p>\u201cHello to you too...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you that? And how do you even know who he is? He\u2019s new to town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend saw you with him at the steakhouse and everyone who follows amateur MMA knows who he is. I don\u2019t want you seeing him.\u201d</p><p>The demand in his voice instantly pisses me off. How dare he tell me what to do?</p><p>\u201cI can see whoever I want to see. We aren\u2019t together anymore, remember? I broke up with you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t deny whether or not I\u2019m seeing Seth. Blade thinks I\u2019m boring and plain so I want him to see that other men\u2014sexy men\u2014want me. I want him to see that he messed up.</p><p>\u201cOlly,\u201d Blade breathes into the phone. \u201cThis guy beats people for a living. I don\u2019t want you anywhere near him.\u201d His tone takes a softer edge and it almost gets to me until I hear a girl in the background telling him to get back into the shower. I\u2019m not going to lie, it hurt. Why did I even call him in the first place? I like the air between us just as it is\u2014dirty\u2014like him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll continue to see Seth if I want to.\u201d I\u2019m sure he can hear the tremor in my voice, but I\u2019m thankful he can\u2019t see my hands shaking. \u201cYou don\u2019t own me, no one does!\u201d I hang up as the bathroom door opens.</p> <p>Selena narrows her green eyes at me, folding her arms tightly across her chest. \u201cPlease tell me you did not just call Blade.\u201d</p><p>I push past her. \u201cYep and you\u2019ll be glad to know it\u2019s still over between us.\u201d</p><p>I throw my phone onto the couch and drop into a chair at the kitchen table. The look of the grilled chicken salad makes my mouth water. Regardless of how pissed off I am, a girl\u2019s gotta eat. My stomach growls and I\u2019m past the point of being hungry. I feel kind of nauseous, but everything smells so good. I dig into my salad eating large mouthfuls of chicken and lettuce, swallowing gratefully.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Selena begins, picking at her salad. \u201cAre you going to tell me what happened with Blade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of told him I had a new boyfriend.\u201d I say through a mouthful of food.</p><p>Her eyes widen. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he doesn\u2019t want me to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him I\u2019m dating Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Seth?\u201d</p><p>What? I\u2019m about to throw my fork at her. \u201cThe guy from the steakhouse.\u201d</p><p>She clasps a manicured hand over her mouth and laughs through the gaps between her slender fingers. \u201cJesus, O. Why\u2019d you do that?\u201d</p><p>I almost chuckle. \u201cBecause Blade seems to think I\u2019m plain and no one else would want me. I want him to see that I am desirable to men\u2014especially someone like Seth who, let\u2019s face it, has a face and a body carved by God himself. He can have any girl he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot every girl.\u201d Selena says, trying to make a statement. I angle my head and narrow my eyes at her, challenging her. Even Selena knows all a handsome guy has to do is bat an eyelid at her and she\u2019ll go with it\u2014he doesn\u2019t even have to be handsome half the time.</p><p>She chews on a piece of lettuce, giggling. \u201cI totally lied. I\u2019d let him have me. Hell, if he was the one that asked for a blow job in the bathroom I\u2019d do it and I\u2019d pay him.\u201d</p><p>I spit salad all over the table, unable to contain my laughter. Selena laughs too and soon, the conversation between Blade and I falls from thought. All I want to do is hang out with my best friend.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Spending last night eating snacks and watching Mean Girls was exactly what the doctor ordered. After I dropped Selena at her father\u2019s law firm, I went to the gym. I\u2019m going to have to spend extra time on the treadmills today if I want to burn off all of the sugar and Trans fats I ate last night. It was worth it though.</p><p>I approach the building and as my fingers curl around the long door handle, I realize I\u2019m holding my breath. I let it go slowly and open the door. Do not look at him. Do not look at him. I fail miserably and my eyes betray me, darting straight to where he was standing yesterday of their own accord. I pout when my gaze falls onto an empty space.</p><p>Seth isn\u2019t here.</p><p>Suddenly, my motivation to be at the gym depletes.</p><p>\u201cOlivia!\u201d My dad calls from the window in the middle of the wall at least two stories up. He waves his hand in front of him, gesturing for me to come up the stairs.</p><p>I stroll to Dad\u2019s office, wishing I was back in bed sleeping. I step in and close the door behind me. Dad\u2019s office is his sacred place and I feel uncomfortable being here surrounded by memorabilia of his favorite martial artists and boxers in glass cases on the wall. Mom wouldn\u2019t let him have a \u2018man cave\u2019 at home, so he started one at work. Sometimes I worry he takes things too far.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad.\u201d I say, dropping into a comfy chair opposite his desk.</p><p>He rises from his chair and shrugs on a jacket. \u201cOlly, I need a favor.\u201d</p><p>His words leave an unsettling feeling in my stomach, or maybe it\u2019s the use of my nickname. Yuck. \u201c...okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to keep an eye on the gym for me today. Derrick is away on holiday and I have no one to run this place. I have a few doctors\u2019 appointments for random tests.\u201d He flicks his wrist like it\u2019s no big deal and suddenly I become concerned. \u201cBut I should be back in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, everything is fine. Your mother is just worried about my health.\u201d He rolls his big, puppy dog eyes and I smile.</p><p>\u201cSure, I can do that for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good kid.\u201d He stretches his arms out to me for a hug and I jump into them. His arms wrap around me and I\u2019m engulfed by that typical father smell. I don\u2019t even know how to describe it. Regardless, it\u2019s comforting. \u201cI\u2019d never put this stress on you if your brother was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stress, Dad. It\u2019s only for a day. I think I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>He hands me a long list of all the things I need to do\u2014things that he refuses to hire people to do when he opened this joint up when I was little. Things like; wiping down the equipment, collecting towels, emptying spit buckets, evaluating machines and loads of other bullshit jobs my dad shouldn\u2019t have to do. He adjusts a photo of my brother and me as children before placing a soft kiss on my cheek. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I follow him from the office and as we cross the gym floor to the front door, I see Seth.</p><p>He\u2019s here.</p><p>He unzips his black hoodie and throws it onto a vacant chair. His fingers curl around the hem of his plain, white t-shirt and he pulls it over his head, exposing a delicious, never ending amount of muscle. His lips are pursed into a thin line as he takes to the bag bare handed. The way his fists connect with raw power and anger has me thinking something is wrong with him. He shows his teeth slightly each time his fists slam the bag and his brows are wrinkled, aging him. Pushing him to the back of my mind, I continue to walk Dad to the car and I wave him off before re-entering the gym. My phone vibrates and I pull it from my back pocket.</p><p>FROM: BLADE 8:59 A.M.</p><p>This is the last time I\u2019m warning</p><p>you. Stop seeing that guy.</p><p>Wow. There\u2019s nothing like a text from an ex telling you how to live your life to put you in a bad mood. I feel my face frowning and it hurts. I hate frowning.</p><p>TO: BLADE 9:00 A.M.</p><p>Leave me alone.</p><p>I feel my phone vibrating over and over in my pocket, but I don\u2019t answer it. I have shit to do. It\u2019s only nine a.m. and there are already a few towels littering the equipment. I do a quick circle of the floor, picking up towels and wiping down damp equipment. Soon, I\u2019ll have to spray them so they\u2019re clean and sterile for the next person.</p><p>Joy.</p><p>I purposely left the training rooms and boxing area for last. Secretly, I\u2019m hoping Seth will be finished by the time I have to go to that section. I don\u2019t want to feel...whatever I feel when I\u2019m around him. I\u2019m not that kind of girl, but he makes me wish I was... and I hate it. It makes me feel cheap and... dirty.</p><p>Reluctantly, I enter his area. I do a quick scan and thankfully there are no towels. I turn on my heel, smiling. I think it\u2019s time for a well deserved break in Dad\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Seth\u2019s deep voice calls out to me and I freeze as dread slithers through my stomach.</p><p>I turn to face him and his expression would be completely sexy if the look in his eyes isn\u2019t so unreadable. The white towel he holds in his hand falls to the ground. \u201cYou forgot one.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the towel and then back to Seth\u2019s stern face. I have no idea what he\u2019s doing or what game he\u2019s playing. Slowly, I make my way over to him. His face is unapologetic, as usual. I frown. There\u2019s no lip twitch or warmth to his gaze. He must be really pissed off. Unfortunately for him I don\u2019t feel like doing what he says\u2014not today. I\u2019m pissed off, too. I might have picked up the towel if another male hadn\u2019t already demanded me to do something\u2014or to stop doing something in Blade\u2019s case. I stand before the huge, hunk of muscle and I\u2019m in no way suddenly immune to the authority that\u2019s pouring off of him, but I don\u2019t like the way he spoke to me. I press my index finger against his hard, moist chest, doing my best to ignore the electrical current shooting through the tip of my finger and I produce my best \u2018fuck you\u2019 smile. \u201cPick up your own damn towel.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t walk away, even though I planned to in my head. I can\u2019t and I have no fucking idea why. He\u2019s in my personal space again and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be able to escape this time. Our eyes stay locked, keeping each other in place. His hand finds my hip and my breath catches in my throat as he grips it, pulling me toward him. I\u2019m breathless over his touch and he doesn\u2019t seem the least bit affected by me. It feels like my chest is about to explode as my heart stutters, stops, then picks up again at an erratic pace. I stare at his lips, knowing exactly how they feel against my own skin. His face is still mad, but a hint of pleasure flares in his dark eyes as I go with his hand and step a little closer to his body. The finger I had on his chest flattens so my whole palm presses firmly against his flesh and I can feel his heart beat, pounding as fast as mine is. The silence between us is charged with electricity and a tingling begins at the center of my stomach, radiating south.</p><p>Beside us, a woman clears her throat and I jump, unaware that I\u2019ve completely lost track of where I am. Seth\u2019s jaw tenses perceptibly when he shifts his gaze to her. The girl is blonde and beautiful, definitely supermodel material. Her tight blue dress clings perfectly to her build and accentuates her medium sized fake boobs. Yep. She\u2019s definitely here for him. She bats her long, black eyelashes at him, but even I can see the blue eyes that glower at him from underneath them. I look at Seth, but he doesn\u2019t remove his hand from my hip and now that she\u2019s here I decide it\u2019s making me uncomfortable. I pry his fingers from my hip and he drops his hand back to his side. I turn away from them and try my hardest to appear casual as I stroll out of that section. He speaks in a low tone to the girl and she replies in a voice that is so winey and sugary it makes me nauseous. My casual steps turn fast as I move my legs as fast as they\u2019ll go\u2014without calling it running\u2014all the way to my dad\u2019s office. Once I\u2019m there, I close the door and lean against it. Never in a million years would I have thought Dad\u2019s creepy MMA shrine office would bring me comfort. I feel pressure on my hip, like his hand is still there and it\u2019s radiating pleasure through my entire being. I close my eyes and take a few deep breaths. When I regain my composure, I make my way over to the window. Seth is walking toward the shower room with his clothes in his hand and the girl is leaving the gym with lines of mascara running down her face.</p><p>Poor girl.</p><p>I truly feel sorry for her and the one that came in for him yesterday. I never want to be one of those girls. Does he even make it clear beforehand that he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with them after sex\u2014assuming that they\u2019ve even had sex? I shake my head. Of course he\u2019s had sex with every girl that has come in for him so far. Seth seems like a very sexual person and probably has a sexual appetite that I would never be able to sate. I fall into my dad\u2019s chair and place my feet on his big, oak desk. I ponder what I\u2019m going to do tonight when I leave here. Selena isn\u2019t going to want to sit around watching movies again. Even last night she was finding it difficult to sit in one place. I normally spend my nights waiting for Blade or with Blade. We usually watch movies and cook together. Sometimes, we\u2019d play cards or a board game... I realize I\u2019m stuck in a comfort zone\u2014a routine. The thought of going home to nothing terrifies me. It makes me anxious and so I decide to do something completely uncharacteristic of me. I can\u2019t break my \u2018Blade routine\u2019 at home by myself. I need to go out. I pull my phone out of my pocket and clear all the missed calls from Blade off my notifications bar. Then, I text Selena. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>TO: SELENA TIME: 9:40 A.M.</p><p>Be at mine at 10 tonight.</p><p>We\u2019re going out!!</p> <p>She replies instantly.</p><p>FROM: SELENA TIME: 9:40 A.M.</p><p>Shit yeah! Count me in!</p><p>Love you, O.</p><p>Xo</p> <p>At the gym, I stayed in Dad\u2019s office until he returned. We didn\u2019t have many people come in today so nothing was out of place. Seth left after his shower and I managed to pay a young boy seven dollars to wipe the machines down with an environmentally friendly antiseptic while his mom ran the treadmill.</p><p>\u201cThanks again, Olly.\u201d Dad says as I open the door to leave his office.</p><p>\u201cAnytime, Pops. You know I\u2019m here whenever you need me.\u201d</p><p>I go to exit the door, but his voice stops me. \u201cHave you thought about dinner on Sunday?\u201d</p><p>Crap. It\u2019s awkward when someone takes you up on an empty gesture. I want to go to dinner at my parents house, I do, but I don\u2019t want to deal with them both teaming up on me to move back home just to fill their empty nest.</p><p>\u201cI promise I won\u2019t harass you about moving back in.\u201d He says, stuffing his hand into the pockets of his sweat pants. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for your mother though. You know how she is.\u201d</p> <p>I sigh. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll come to dinner, but tell Mom that she doesn\u2019t have to go all out and a small dinner will be fine. Also, if you could tell her to keep the childhood movies boxed I\u2019ll be more likely to show up.\u201d</p><p>Dad smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do. Love you.\u201d</p><p>He turns to look out the window.</p><p>\u201cLove you, too.\u201d I say as I close the door behind me.</p><p>I hate clubbing. The last time I went clubbing was Selena\u2019s (real) birthday six months ago and because I don\u2019t usually go clubbing my range of sexy, short dresses is limited. I have to choose between a black halter neck and a coral off the shoulder cocktail dress. Personally, I\u2019d rather not wear either.</p><p>I throw both of the dresses on the floor and fall back onto my bed with a loud sigh. The sun went down an hour ago and Selena is meant to be here three hours from now. I wonder if she\u2019ll hate me if I cancel. A knock on my door pulls me from my thoughts. I throw a dressing gown on over my black, lacy underwear and I stroll to the door. When I open it, I see Selena\u2019s make-up free face\u2014that\u2019s a first for her. She doesn\u2019t need make-up, she has one of those naturally beautiful faces. You know, the ones that have thick eyelashes, high cheekbones, plump lips and a flawless complexion to boot.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re early. Very early.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI got too excited about tonight. Stop staring at me. I\u2019m hideous.\u201d</p> <p>I choke on a laugh as she pushes past me. Selena pulls along a small, purple suitcase behind her.</p><p>\u201cDid your dad finally kick your ass to the curb?\u201d I ask, closing the door.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is for tonight.\u201d Selena wheels the suitcase into my bedroom and I follow closely behind her. She takes one look at the dresses on the floor and smiles at me. \u201cThank God you\u2019re not wearing either of those.\u201d</p><p>Feigning insult, I demand. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re from last year. That\u2019s what.\u201d</p><p>She unzips her suitcase and pulls a short and no doubt tight, red dress from it. I see it and the only thing that comes to mind is: WHORE.</p><p>\u201cI am not wearing that.\u201d</p><p>She pouts. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s too outrageous... I want to have fun and talk to boys not wind up in a ditch by the end of the night.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cGod, you sound just like your mother.\u201d I open my mouth to protest, but she raises her hand. \u201cYou need to relax. This is tame compared to what other girls will be wearing, trust me.\u201d</p><p>Selena holds the dress out in front of her and on closer examination I may have over-exaggerated. It isn\u2019t that bad. I mean, the small cut out in between the breasts wasn\u2019t too exposing, I suppose. And I assume Selena isn\u2019t really giving me a choice. I took the dress and drop my dressing gown.</p><p>\u201cLook at you, you hottie!\u201d Selena giggled. \u201cGoing to the gym is really paying off. You\u2019re so fit and you\u2019ve managed to keep those big ole\u2019 boobies of yours perky! Maybe I should start going to the gym.\u201d</p><p>She steps forward, her hands outstretched to touch me and I swat her away, unable to keep a laugh from my lips. \u201cYou\u2019re such a lesbian, stop it.\u201d</p><p>I slide into the dress and have Selena zip it up. When it\u2019s on and I do a little twirl, her mouth drops open and she clasps her hands over her chest.</p><p>\u201cYou look amazing!\u201d She squeals. \u201cI knew this dress would look good on you.\u201d</p><p>I walk over to my mirror and I\u2019m absolutely floored by how good it looks on me. Red is definitely my color.</p><p>\u201cNow sit.\u201d Selena demands and I take few steps back to sit on the edge of my bed. She pulls a large metal box from her suitcase and opens it. I\u2019m amazed by how much make-up she has. She immediately gets to work with her foundations and powders and pink things and black things. I\u2019m sure they have proper names, but they were lost on me. I have no idea.</p><p>When Selena is done creating her masterpiece she steps away from me, giving me full view of myself in the mirror. I don\u2019t recognize myself. My creamy skin is flawless and my green eyes are brought out by a black color Selena refers to as \u2018shimmering onyx\u2019. My lips are glossy and my long, chocolate hair cascades in a straight line down my back.</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Is all I can say.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>I find a pair of white stilettos in my wardrobe and I slip them on. I\u2019m not one to compliment myself, but damn I look sexy. In fact I\u2019m feeling so good about myself I might even entertain the idea of bringing a stranger home with me.</p><p>Or not.</p><p>Most likely not.</p><p>Selena spends almost two hours doing herself up and if I looked like a supermodel when she was done with me, she looked like a super-supermodel. Her dark, violet dress has a strapless, sweetheart cut and it cuts off mid-thigh. Her long, blonde ringlets are straightened against her back and she flicks her hair to either side as she clips in two golden hoops.</p><p>\u201cI scheduled a taxi to come get us at nine p.m.\u201d</p><p>I look at the clock. \u201cThat\u2019s now.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough a honk sounds outside and Selena takes me by the elbow. She eagerly drags me from the house before I get a chance to change my mind about tonight.</p><p>We\u2019re in the taxi and the further I get from home the stronger the unsettling feeling in my stomach grows. Now that I\u2019m out and on my way to a club, I really wish I didn\u2019t text Selena and suggest it.</p><p>We arrive at Lux\u2019s Lounge Bar and the security guard lets us straight in because he and Selena are friends. Of course they are. She\u2019s probably friends with all of the staff inside. I\u2019ve never been to Lux\u2019s before and as we step into the club I\u2019m blown away. It\u2019s not like the other clubs I\u2019ve been to. Upscale is an understatement. People litter the surrounding couches and the floor is illumined by blue L.E.D lights that lead the way to the bar directly in front of us. It\u2019s impossible to miss. It\u2019s huge, white and shiny. Five bartenders man the bar and they\u2019re surrounded by people shouting orders at them. Not once do the smiles leave their faces.</p><p>This place oozes sterile elegance and maybe I\u2019ll enjoy myself after all. Selena entwines her fingers in mine and pulls me along beside her to the bar. We spend a long while there, receiving free drinks from boys who want to dance. Some were hot and some were...not. Either way, we promised them we\u2019ll dance later. I just hope they pass out before then. When I\u2019ve probably had too much to drink, we leave the bar and head to the dance floor. We dance hard and fast, we sway our hips and only dance with each other. I notice that Selena is really trying to show me a good time. Not once has she batted an eyelid at a guy even though loads of them have given her attention. She wants me to see that tonight is about me, her and our friendship. It\u2019s exactly what I need.</p><p>I spoke too soon as hands seize my waist pulling me away from Selena.</p><p>\u201cDance with me.\u201d He mutters into my ear.</p><p>I stare at her wide eyed as the guy grinds me. \u2018Help me\u2019 I mouth to Selena, but she raises her eyebrows and shrugs, signaling for me to turn around. Reluctantly, I turn around and the guy that\u2019s practically groping me isn\u2019t that bad. He has dark, longish hair that curls under his chin and his eyes are a beautiful blue that reflect the glowing floor beneath us. Under his business outfit, I feel his rock hard body. My head swims with alcohol and my usual careful self doesn\u2019t really care. Screw it. I\u2019m going to go along with it. I dance with him, letting his hands roam all over me. It doesn\u2019t provoke a thrilling feeling in my stomach like Seth\u2019s eyes do, but he\u2019s gentleman enough not to dive into my bra or my panties and I appreciate that. The stranger pulls me around so I\u2019m facing the other direction and my ass presses against his...you know. Suddenly I\u2019m uncomfortable and I manage to sober up just a little. This isn\u2019t me. I try to step away from the man, but his hands hold me firmly in place. I eagerly search the crowd for Selena, but I can\u2019t see her. Lights flicker above me, catching my attention. It\u2019s the VIP area. A fair few people are leaning against the railing watching the dancers beneath them. Others are lounging around on couches laughing underneath immaculate chandeliers. I survey them with blurry vision until I catch a familiar pair of eyes, instantly stopping me in my tracks.</p><p>Seth.</p><p>His appearance hits me like a ton of bricks and I sober up even more. Suddenly, I\u2019m embarrassed for grinding with the stranger. The stranger doesn\u2019t notice I no longer want to dance and he pulls me even closer to him. His head angles and his warm tongue travels down the side of my neck before pressing his lips eagerly against my skin. I feel like I\u2019m going to heave. My head spins and my legs wobble. Seth\u2019s eyes remain on me the entire time and his friend, the one that was wearing a red cap at the steakhouse, walks over to chat to him. His gaze is intimidating and once again I can\u2019t look away from him. He looks positively amazing in a long black sleeved shirt that\u2019s folded up to his elbows, exposing his thick forearms. He brings his beer bottle to his lips and takes a sip. I wish I was that beer bottle. A warm hand wraps harshly around my arm, yanking me from the stranger\u2019s grasp and away from Seth\u2019s face. I stumble through the crowd, letting whoever is pulling me drag me away from the dance floor. When we break away from the dancers, I\u2019m amazed I didn\u2019t trip in my ridiculously high heels. The person dragging me turns to face me.</p><p>\u201cBlade?\u201d I ask, confused that he\u2019s here.</p><p>He never comes here. He\u2019s wearing his usual club get up\u2014a weird t-shirt with random naked girls on it and a pair of loose jeans. His lips move quickly, but I can\u2019t hear anything. The music is drowning him out. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He takes me by the arm again and pulls me from the club via a side door. I stumble into an empty alleyway that smells like booze, piss and vomit.</p><p>His eyes narrow in on me, his nostrils flaring. Wow, you\u2019d think I just cheated on him. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing, Olivia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t dancing. He had his mouth all over you!\u201d</p><p>Is it disgusting of me to feel a little happy that Blade\u2019s so pissed off?</p><p>\u201cSo? I can do whatever I want. I\u2019m single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re mine!\u201d</p><p>I step toward him, pointing my finger less than an inch from his nose. He grabs at my hand, pressing it against his chest. His body feels completely different now that I\u2019ve had them on Seth\u2019s large chest. Blade feels like a child under my knuckles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not yours. I\u2019m not something that can be owned.\u201d I try to step away from him, but his free hand takes a hold of my hips and he pulls me into him.</p><p>\u201cBaby, please. I\u2019m sorry... seeing you with that guy hurt me. You\u2019re hurting me.\u201d</p><p>I clench my fists until the skin over my knuckles turns white. How dare he say a thing like that? I shove him hard and he stumbles enough to let me go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hurting you? What about me?\u201d I\u2019m shouting and I don\u2019t even care. Tears pool in my eyes, but I refuse to let them fall. \u201cYou hurt me! That\u2019s why we\u2019re in this mess. You don\u2019t care about me. You\u2019re just comfortable\u2014stuck in a routine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlly, baby...\u201d</p><p>I have to get him to see that I\u2019m not playing this time. I have to hit him where it hurts. \u201cI don\u2019t love you and I haven\u2019t for a long time. It just took me this long to realize it.\u201d</p><p>I go to walk away but he grabs at me again, holding me tightly against him. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you go back in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast I checked this is still a free country.\u201d Seth\u2019s deep voice rings throughout the alleyway. Blade releases me and I stumble backwards as warm, feminine hands wrap around my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Selena whispers, pulling me into her and I nod my head.</p><p>She tugs me back until I\u2019m standing safely beside Seth.</p><p>\u201cI forgot you had a boyfriend.\u201d Blade states, spitting on the floor.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Seth looks down at me, his eyebrow raised. Thank God the alleyway isn\u2019t lit up otherwise everyone will see my undoubtedly scarlet face. I nod my head quickly, pleadingly. The last thing I want is to look stupid in front of Blade. I\u2019ve looked stupid enough because of him.</p><p>\u201cShe does.\u201d Seth\u2019s large, calloused hand wraps around my wrist and he pulls me slightly behind him. I gasp at the contact of our flesh.</p><p>Blade crosses his arms over his chest not looking the slightest bit impressed. \u201cWhere were you when she was practically fucking a guy on the dance floor?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seth shrugs. \u201cAround.\u201d I can almost hear the smile on his lips. \u201cI like to watch.\u201d</p><p>Blade\u2019s icy, blue eyes glower at Seth and then at me. \u201cYou sure know how to pick em\u2019, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>I manage a smile, inching closer to Seth\u2014so close my breast rubs against his arm. \u201cYou\u2019re proof of that.\u201d I reply, remembering to breathe.</p> <p>He steps closer and I stiffen. Seth would absolutely crush Blade and even though he\u2019s a dick, I don\u2019t want him to get hurt. A confident smile spreads over Seth\u2019s lips, daring Blade to try something. Blade has his wits about him tonight because he doesn\u2019t do anything to provoke Seth. Instead, he growls. \u201cDon\u2019t get too comfortable because we\u2019re still together. We\u2019re just having a disagreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Selena interjects. \u201cYou\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>Blade storms away and we watch him until he disappears from the alleyway. Seth drops my wrist and I turn to Selena. She wraps her arms around my shoulders again, pulling me into her. She holds me for a little while. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about him.\u201d</p><p>I withdrew from her and wipe my eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go home?\u201d She asks.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d My night is ruined. There\u2019s no coming back from this and more alcohol will only make it worse.</p><p>\u201cI can take her.\u201d Seth offers.</p><p>I open my mouth to protest, but Selena cuts me off. \u201cHow much have you had to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne beer. I\u2019m fine to drive. \u201c</p><p>I step away from Selena and attempt to turn to Seth\u2014attempt being the keyword. My shoe snags on something and I fall. I squeeze my eyes shut and brace for impact only it never comes. When I realize I haven\u2019t hit the ground I become aware of Seth\u2019s hand wrapped around my waist and the other that has a firm grip on my arm. He\u2019s so close to me and his delicious scent makes my head even woozier. Selena is keeled over and laughing her ass off because I almost fell. Typical.</p><p>\u201c...thanks.\u201d I mumble as he helps me back to standing position. I look everywhere but at his face, which I\u2019m sure is regarding me in amusement.</p> <p>\u201cYou can take her. If she goes with me we\u2019ll probably break both our necks before we get home.\u201d Selena has a residual smile on her face and I widen my eyes at her, trying to hint that I don\u2019t want to be alone with Seth. I can barely keep my shit together in public. If we\u2019re in a car alone, God knows what I\u2019ll do.</p><p>Selena rolls her eyes at me and kisses my cheek. \u201cThanks for coming out with me tonight. I\u2019ll call you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelena, but\u2014I\u2014we\u2014damn it!\u201d She slips back through the club door and I\u2019m stuck outside with Seth.</p><p>After a few seconds, I gain the courage to look at him. He stuffs his hands into the pockets of his jeans as his dark eyes follow my every movement like I\u2019m going to fall again.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he begins. \u201cYour ex-boyfriend is a dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s putting it nicely.\u201d I groan, running my hands over my face. \u201cCan we go? I\u2019m not really in the mood to hang around here.\u201d</p><p>He pulls a set of keys from his back pocket and gestures for me to follow him. Compared to the air in the club, outside is cool and it blows refreshingly across my skin. My feet ache in my shoes as I trail behind Seth down the street and to his car. Who drives to a club anyway? When Seth unlocks and approaches a big, white four-wheeled drive I have to say that I\u2019m surprised. I imagined Seth to drive a motorcycle or a sports car, or something completely dangerous and unnecessary. Instead, he drives a beautiful Range Rover. It\u2019s big, safe and totally not what I expected. He opens the door for me.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>His lips twitch suddenly upward, molding his mouth into a breathtaking, slightly crooked smirk, and I feel my chest constrict as I unsuccessfully try to tear my eyes away from his full lips.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me,\u201d he says when I\u2019m comfortable in my seat. \u201cIt\u2019s what boyfriends do.\u201d His smirk widens into a full blown, cocky smile and he closes the door. My hands automatically fly to my face to cover my embarrassment. I never should have tried to provoke Blade. Now I look like the weirdo who goes around telling people Seth is my boyfriend when realistically we\u2019ve only spoken a handful of times. He opens the driver door and climbs in. I take my hands away from my face, but I don\u2019t dare peek at him as he speeds away from the club.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry...\u201d I apologize after a while. Honesty is the best policy, right? \u201cHe asked me if we were seeing each other and to spite him I didn\u2019t deny it.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. I\u2019m just glad I was there to help you out of that shit storm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame him for being pissed though.\u201d He runs a hand through his hair quickly, glancing at me before turning his attention back to the road. \u201cI would\u2019ve pulled you off that guy myself if your ex hadn\u2019t showed up.\u201d</p><p>I scoff. \u201cYou would have, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight I would have. That guy was a fucking douche bag. You\u2019re too... I don\u2019t know\u2014good to let a guy like that put his hands all over you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m annoyed by his words. I hate when people act like they know me... but, at the same time, I\u2019m awed and I can\u2019t stop the stupid warmth from spreading through my stomach. \u201cGood?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cYeah, I mean that dress is a little on the bad side, but I can tell you\u2019re a good girl at heart.\u201d</p><p>He can tell? So far all I\u2019ve done in his presence is stare at him, touch him and let a guy dance with me in a club. That doesn\u2019t exactly scream \u2018good girl\u2019. I cross my arms and decide not to continue the conversation because for one, I\u2019ll probably say something stupid. Two, I feel like vomiting and three, because any man that makes you want to take your clothes off and allow him to do anything to you within the first few minutes of meeting him is definitely the kind of man you want to stay away from. \u2018BAD NEWS\u2019 doesn\u2019t come any clearer than that. Seth is sexy as sin and that makes me take the \u2018Satan in a Sunday hat\u2019 term more literal.</p><p>The rest of the drive is quiet and I peek at him sideways every now and then. His eyes are always glued to the road and one of his hands grip the steering wheel so tight his knuckles become white. The journey isn\u2019t long and I\u2019m so painfully aware of his presence I barely notice the streets and houses whipping past. Thankfully, the car eventually comes to a swift stop outside my house.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I say without glancing at him. I open the door and slide out of the car. Behind me, I hear his door close too and my stomach clenches. What the hell am I meant to do now? He follows closely behind me as I go up the stairs and unlock my front door. I delay turning around for a few seconds, but when I do I\u2019m face to face with Seth. My belated sensor light flicks on and illumines his features\u2014the black hair, dark eyes with tiny golden rivers and finally a set of luscious lips, and all of them are inches away from me. My body knows it too. Everything inside me is tight and on full alert just waiting for me to give them the signal to let go. I step a little closer to him, encouraging him.</p><p>He\u2019s looking at me, his eyes dancing while his mouth remains curved in a lopsided smirk. I have a sudden, wild urge to reach out and press my fingers to his perfect lips.</p><p>\u201cI meant what I said.\u201d He says. His voice is low and it draws my attention from his lips to his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re too good for guys like him...and me.\u201d</p><p>I frown, defiantly. \u201cWho says I\u2019m good?\u201d</p><p>Seth leans into me and my breath catches in my throat. He\u2019s so close the scent of him tears through me and desire swells between my thighs. The cologne he\u2019s wearing makes me want to close my eyes and inhale as deeply as I can, but I don\u2019t because that would be creepy. I can\u2019t be plain, boring and creepy. His eyes are focused on me as his hand slides firmly around my waist. My pulse hits overdrive and my skin prickles all over. I want to lick his chest and kiss his lips. I want to feel his rough hands all over my body. Oh God. I want it. It\u2019s so wrong\u2014so unlike me\u2014but I can\u2019t stop the pure, animalistic desire in the pit of my stomach.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re good because you flush whenever I get close to you.\u201d He leans in and I can feel his hot breath on my face, causing my pulse to skitter uncontrollably. \u201cYour breathing either speeds up or disappears completely. And\u2014\u201d He slides a firm hand between my legs. I gasp and instinctively squeeze them shut\u2014trapping him. His eyes continue to dance with devilish amusement as they taunt me. \u201cLet\u2019s just say, I can tell by how you react to me.\u201d</p><p>I find myself incapable of speech as I remain frozen, completely entranced by the thick, rough hand trapped between my thighs. My breathing is deep and quick. I can feel the warmth of my blush beginning to spread down my neck and across my chest, and it feels as though my very skin is burning. His hand feels so good where it is and I don\u2019t want to let it go.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I wasn\u2019t good?\u201d I reply, slightly breathless. \u201cWhat would happen tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. If you weren\u2019t good I would\u2019ve had you in the shower room two days ago.\u201d</p><p>Shower room? Did he come down the hallway to specifically find me? Had he honestly expected me to spread my legs for him in the shower room at my father\u2019s gym? He\u2019s confidence levels are annoyingly high. Reluctantly, I open my legs and he takes his hand back, but not before sliding his finger right across the center of my warmth. A half moan, half gasp falls involuntarily from my lips, but I\u2019m too aroused to be embarrassed. He blinks for a second too long and his jaw noticeably tightens. I can see he\u2019s trying to decide what to do right now and I pray that it\u2019s not treat me like I\u2019m good. His hand grabs the front of my dress and tugs me into him. I don\u2019t have time to react appropriately before he grips my hips and presses the lips I\u2019ve so desperately wanted to kiss, to my own. Something snaps inside me, and with a surge of hot arousal, I run my fingers through his hair and kiss him back with wild abandon. His tongue glides across my bottom lip, coaxing me into opening my mouth. I do and he wastes no time in darting his tongue inside. I\u2019m not going to stop here\u2014no way\u2014in my little world, I\u2019m way past the point of redemption. I want him and I want him right now. He tastes delicious and it\u2019s amazing considering he was drinking beer not too long ago. Seth crushes his body against mine and his hands slide up my delicate curves and into my hair, urging me harder against him. My heart is racing and the desire between my legs grows stronger. Blade is in the back of my mind the whole time. I feel guilty, but I\u2019m too aroused to stop. I have to tell myself over and over in my head that I\u2019m not Blade\u2019s. He isn\u2019t my boyfriend. I\u2019m my own person.</p><p>I\u2019m free.</p><p>Seth\u2019s hands leave my hair and wrap around my thighs as he lifts me like I weigh nothing. I surround his hips with my legs and grow a million times more aroused at the thought of his muscles being squeezed between my thighs. He speaks against my lips.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not doing this. Wholesome girls like you have no business being with boys like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d I crush my lips forcefully to his, not hesitating for a moment as I suck his bottom lip into my mouth before plunging my tongue between his lips. I don\u2019t want to be good right now. I want to be bad. He opens my door and I\u2019m glad I left the lights on before I left for the club otherwise I\u2019ll miss the whole show. A small groan releases itself from his throat sending shockwaves of pleasure through my stomach. He lowers me onto the couch and his body, comes with me, pinning me hard against the cushions. I can feel every inch of him and the rough denim of his jeans cause goosebumps to break across every inch of the exposed flesh of my thighs. His obvious arousal presses firmly against my core as his mouth hungrily consumes mine. I moan against his lips as his rough hands reach under the hem of my dress and grasp my bare hip. His hand lingers there for a few seconds before he runs a finger along my stomach and then lower along the edge of my underwear. I shudder, rocking my hips against him. I want him to touch me there and I want him to lick me there. I want him to do anything and everything. His eyes flicker onto mine and fireworks explode inside of me.</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d He breathes, his voice dripping like melted chocolate. \u201cI just want to touch.\u201d</p><p>He grins victoriously as I nod and his finger sides against my inner thigh and slips under the fabric. Strange ripples shoot through my body as he caresses my smooth center. He groans low in his throat, and the sound spurs me onward as I thrust my hips harder against him. Seth shakes his head, dropping it onto my chest. He nips at my neck and slides his finger between my creases. I grip his shoulders and sink my teeth into my bottom lip to block a whimper. His breathing is hard and labored as he lifts his eyes to my face. \u201cI want to do so many things to you, right now, but I can\u2019t.\u201d He pulls his hands from between my legs and exhales \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He catches my bottom lip with his teeth and I groan in protest as he lifts himself off of me. This is not happening. I\u2019m too aroused, too far gone to stop now. Beside, I\u2019m the one who just broke up with her long term boyfriend, aren\u2019t I meant to be the one freaking out and putting a stop to sex with a stranger? I\u2019m the one who\u2019s supposed to get the sudden attack of morality, not him. I pull myself into a sitting position and watch as he makes his way to the door.</p><p>\u201cSeth, where are you going?\u201d I can\u2019t keep the annoyed, disappointed tone from my voice.</p><p>He opens the door and leans his head against the wood. He opens his mouth to say something, but his phone rings, cutting off whatever he was going to say to me. Sadly, I think it has something to do with me being good. God damn it! Immediately, he pulls it from his back pocket and brings it to his ear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello? Yes, I am.\u201d He sighs and I see his jaw clench. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d His brown eyes rake me. \u201cI have to go.\u201d He exhales before leaving and closing the door behind him.</p><p>What. The. Hell.</p><p>With a grunt, I kick my shoes off and drop back into the sofa. Was I really just rejected for sex? Fine, I\u2019m not a whore, but I sure as shit am not a child either. Maybe I should have stayed at the club with the gropey guy. He wasn\u2019t too bad and there\u2019s no way he would\u2019ve left me here sexually frustrated.</p> <p>I drag myself from the couch to the bathroom. A shower would be so fantastic right now. The hot water gushes over me and I just stand there, letting it caress me. My eyes sting as my make-up runs into them. I hate forgetting to use a make-up wipe before a shower, Selena\u2019s stuff burns like acid. My skin still tingles and pulsates with Seth\u2019s touch and I want him to come back. I want him to finish what he started. Under the hot water, I become even more flustered and thinking about what happened in my lounge room minutes ago is driving me crazy. I\u2019ve never wanted sex so badly in my life and I just know Seth is good at it. The way he makes me feel with his hands alone is enough for me to go off.</p><p>I trot from the shower, dejected and tightly coiled with my pink towel wrapped tightly around my body. My room is dark and I don\u2019t bother switching the light on. I fall onto my bed, my hair still damp from the shower and I close my eyes. I want to sleep and forget tonight ever happened. Now that I\u2019ve gathered my thoughts, I feel embarrassed. I should have acted with a bit more class or at least showed some restraint considering I hardly know the guy. But I can\u2019t around him. He\u2019s too magnetic\u2014too sexy and confident and I like it. Behind my eyelids his full lips smile at me while his chocolate eyes watch me. An eternity later, I\u2019m still awake and thinking about him.</p><p>\u201cFucking Seth.\u201d I groan, pressing play on the iPod dock on my bedside table.</p><p>I figure music will help drown out his image. The first song to play is Me &amp; U by Cassie and I quickly slap the \u2018next\u2019 button. The last thing I need is a sexually charged song to keep me awake. Thankfully, Wonderwall by Oasis plays straight after and I\u2019m able to fall asleep to Liam Gallagher\u2019s beautifully unique voice.</p><p>Chapter Six</p> <p>I open my eyes. The alarm clock on my bedside table says it\u2019s nine a.m. I yawn, rub the sleep from my eyes and look again.</p><p>9:00 A.M.</p><p>Fuck!</p><p>I sit bolt upright and the duvet falls away, exposing me to the cool morning air. I hit stop on my iPod, too bleary eyed and disoriented to realize what song is playing. I fly out of bed and move so quickly I swear my feet never touch the ground. Mason is going to be pissed. He gave me two days off and I still can\u2019t get my shit together. Naked, I search my house for my phone. I find it on the kitchen bench and check my notifications. There\u2019s a bunch from Blade, a bunch from Selena and million and one from Mason. Shit. This is bad. I quickly dial him back.</p><p>\u201cGood Morning, Guyer and Peterson psychology, this is Mason.\u201d</p><p>I twist my fingers in my mess of hair. \u201cMason, hi.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I over-slept I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I chew on my nails.</p><p>\u201cI gave you two days, Olivia. You had two days to clear your head and come back to work. I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran into Blade last night and he messed with my head.\u201d I interrupt. It wasn\u2019t entirely a lie. I did run into Blade, but he didn\u2019t mess with my head... not like Seth did anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou two are still over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost definitely...\u201d</p><p>He exhales. \u201cCan you get here in half an hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in twenty.\u201d</p> <p>I hang up and run to my room throwing on underwear, a pair of skinny jeans, a white silk blouse and a light blue cardigan. My hair is a bird\u2019s nest because I slept with it wet and the brush rips through my knots. I pretty much cry as it causes my scalp to burn. I put on base foundation and some eye make-up. In my bag I throw in some tights and a tank top so I can go to the gym after work. Hopefully, Seth spends this morning in the gym and we can avoid an awkward run in later on.</p><p>I run from the house and practically dive into my car. I\u2019m in such a rush I don\u2019t even bother putting a seat belt on and when I arrive at work my cheeks are slightly flushed from having to park ages down the street and sprint the rest of the way.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, you made it.\u201d Mason smiles at me as I step through the front door. He rises from the reception desk and straightens his navy blue suit. \u201cCan I speak with you in my office for a moment?\u201d</p><p>Dread slivers through my stomach. Crap... maybe I am getting fired. I follow him into his room and he closes the door behind me, gesturing to the seat in front of his desk. I sit down and open my mouth to speak, but he raises a finger to silence me. He sits on the edge of his desk in front of me. He\u2019s so close his knee almost touches mine.</p><p>\u201cRelax, I\u2019m not firing you.\u201d I almost sag in relief. \u201cI wanted to see how you\u2019re doing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I reply, smiling widely.</p><p>\u201cDefine fine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know... I\u2019m fine. Happy. Free.\u201d</p><p>His arms cross in front of him. \u201cAre you fine enough to go out to dinner with me?\u201d</p><p>I feel my smile fade. \u201cMason... we\u2019ve spoken about this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but you had a boyfriend then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only broke up with him two days ago.\u201d I point out. Thank God he doesn\u2019t know I almost slept with someone last night. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m still your employee.\u201d</p><p>He leans toward me. \u201cOlly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia.\u201d I warn him maybe a little too harshly. I can\u2019t stand Olly.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Olivia, it\u2019s one dinner. I\u2019m not asking you to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I feel like dating you would be crossing a line. You\u2019re my boss and I don\u2019t want to mix business with pleasure.\u201d I also want to add that he is too old for me, but I decided not to, to spare his feelings.</p><p>His brows knit together and his blue eyes look pleading. \u201cOne dinner. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I say, finalizing our discussion. I push my chair back and stand up. \u201cI\u2019m going to start work now, if I still have a job.\u201d</p><p>He nods, running his hands through his hair and I leave the room. When I step out of his office I can breathe better, but I don\u2019t feel better because I know this will happen again and again until I give in. I hate breaking Mason\u2019s heart, but the thought of dating him really puts me out of my comfort zone regardless of how handsome he is.</p><p>Work is awkward, to say the least. Mason comes out every hour and collects a new patient without batting an eyelid in my direction. If past rejections are anything to go off he\u2019ll be back to talking to me in two days. I sigh and tap my thumb on the keyboard. Work is slow today which is uncharacteristic for a Wednesday and because I have nothing to occupy myself I can\u2019t stop thinking about Seth. Pictures of his lips on mine flash through my mind and I swear I can feel them. A familiar ache pulses between my thighs and I squeeze my knees together, leaning back in my chair. The erotic feelings I have for Seth this morning disappoint me because I\u2019m humiliated and frustrated. I want to hit the treadmill or punch things\u2014anything that will help me wind down.</p><p>In my pocket my phone vibrates and it jolts me out of my less-than-wholesome and less-than-peaceful thoughts. I pull it out and check it. Selena is calling me.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cThere you are! Jesus. I\u2019ve been trying to call you since I got home last night. I was starting to think that maybe you had ended up in a ditch just like you feared. Anyway, speaking of last night, how\u2019d it go?\u201d Her \u2018you have to tell me everything\u2019 tone doesn\u2019t go by unnoticed.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t go. Seth dropped me off and that was it.\u201d I choose to leave out the part about us making out and letting him touch me between the thighs. I\u2019m embarrassed to tell Selena what happened because I know something like that has never happened to her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a liar!\u201d She squeals, cackling like a crazy woman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I swear I didn\u2019t have sex with him.\u201d</p><p>Her laugh stops abruptly. \u201cDo you swear on our friendship?\u201d</p><p>Whatever the hell that means. \u201cYes, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The excitement from her tone disappears. \u201cIs he gay?\u201d Her question draws a snort from me. \u201cBecause you looked sexy in that dress...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not gay, Sel. It might be hard for you to believe, but some people that don\u2019t know each other well don\u2019t have sex at the drop of the hat.\u201d</p><p>She laughs wildly again and I can imagine her doing it\u2014head tilted back, mouth wide, exposing her perfect teeth. \u201cThere were a lot of people talking at the club after you left. Seth seems pretty well known for a guy that just moved here and the consensus is that he has sex at the drop of anything. I was almost certain you\u2019d get some.\u201d</p><p>I frown. If he loves sex so much why couldn\u2019t he have sex with me? Maybe his excuse was a cop-out... maybe I am plain, boring and not appealing to majority of the opposite sex. As quick as the thought entered my head, I squash it down. He was all over me in the beginning. \u201cYeah, well, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cMe either. Hey, you had fun last night, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go out again tonight?\u201d</p><p>I slump into my seat. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Selena. Last night with Blade\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlade\u2019s a wanker. We\u2019ll go somewhere else, somewhere low key. O, c\u2019mon. We didn\u2019t get enough time to hang out last night.\u201d</p><p>I pause for a few seconds, weighing my options. If I do go out who knows what time I\u2019ll get back or if I\u2019ll even get out of bed for work tomorrow morning. If I don\u2019t go out I\u2019ll be stuck at home thinking about Seth and eventually resort to self-pleasure. But if I do...I\u2019ll have enough to keep my mind occupied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling too indecisive right now, call me back later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but you have to promise you\u2019ll think about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d I reply, remembering to cross my toes.</p><p>\u201cAwesome! Love you, bitch.\u201d</p><p>She hangs up and I slide my phone back into my pocket. I\u2019m in such a crappy mood to think about anything right now.</p><p>Today sucks.</p><p>I pull on the big gym door but it doesn\u2019t open. Strange. Dad never closes early\u2014ever. I use the spare key hanging from my car keys. Dad said I can come and use the gym whenever I want even if it\u2019s closed. I guess it\u2019s one of those times. I step inside and lock the door behind me. When I turn around I jump, seeing at least eight pairs of eyes on me. They\u2019re surrounding the boxing ring and my dad is amongst them. My eyes immediately lock with Seth\u2019s. He\u2019s inside the ring, sweating and panting. It\u2019s such an amazing sight and my knees shake a little.</p><p>I want to slap myself.</p><p>I feel my cheeks heat up in embarrassment under his gaze. He rejected me last night. I swallow down the bitter taste.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I announce, making eye contact with Dad. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone was here. I can go...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Olly.\u201d Dad calls, walking over to me. Great, now Seth knows my nickname. \u201cThis is as much your gym as it is mine.\u201d</p><p>I regard him curiously. He\u2019s upbeat which is strange for him and there\u2019s a huge smile spread over his face. He pulls me into a hug and the fatherly smell has been replaced with sweat.</p><p>\u201cYou smell.\u201d I chuckle as he pulls away.</p><p>He ignores me. \u201cHoney, I\u2019ve got some good news\u201d</p><p>I glance at Seth who\u2019s now leaning on his forearms on the top rope watching us\u2014watching me\u2014to be more exact. The other people surrounding the ring are people I\u2019ve never seen before\u2014two of them are wearing headgear and boxing gloves\u2014obviously Seth\u2019s sparring partners. Another is wearing sporty clothes and a white cap that is pulled down on his forehead complimenting his dark complexion. Around his neck is a stop watch and in his hands is a clipboard. The others wore suits. I look at dad and I\u2019m officially confused.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not selling the gym are you?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Dad laughs loudly. \u201cNever in a million years.\u201d</p><p>He tucks me under his arm and guides me over to the people. I fight the urge to dig my feet in. I don\u2019t want to go anywhere near Seth. \u201cSeth has hired me as a tactics advisor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d I ask, turning to face Dad and preventing him for pushing me any closer. I\u2019ve never seen him so happy. His cheeks are practically bursting with happiness.</p><p>\u201cYour father has a keen eye when it comes to MMA.\u201d The guy with the stop watch says. \u201cA tactics advisor will help Seth identify certain moves before a takedown or a submission. The tactics advisor will also identify weak points in a hold or submission so that Seth is able to exploit them.\u201d</p><p>I feel like he has memorized a passage from a textbook and repeated it to me. Yep, still just as boring.</p><p>\u201cDad, you have no training in anything like that.\u201d Concern is thick in my voice. I know he doesn\u2019t need any more stress in his life and I can foresee this getting very stressful for him... or maybe I\u2019m just being bitter because Seth is involved.</p><p>\u201cHow many Mixed Martial Arts DVD\u2019s do I own? How many fights have I recorded and downloaded? All of them. I\u2019ve watched them back to front and I know everything there is to know. This sport is my passion and I\u2019ve always wanted to work on a team behind a fighter and I have the best one right here in my gym.\u201d He gestures to Seth and I roll my eyes. The last thing he needs is his ego boosted higher. \u201cThis is what I\u2019m meant to be doing with my life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd what does Mom have to say about all of this?\u201d</p><p>Dad rubs the back of his neck. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing... I haven\u2019t told her yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will tonight. I\u2019m taking her to that fancy place she likes, uh\u2014\u201d He clicks his fingers trying to remember the name.</p><p>\u201cPhillip\u2019s Gourmet.\u201d I answer for him.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>His big brown eyes stare at me, waiting for me to say something else.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I begin. \u201cIf it makes you happy, then I\u2019m happy.\u201d I kiss his warm cheek and head to the shower room to change into my gym clothes. I\u2019m not going to let Seth\u2019s presence deter me from working out.</p> <p>When I\u2019ve changed into a pair of tights and a tank top, I step out from a little cubicle and Seth with all of his glorious sweatiness is leaning against the wall by the mirrors. His presence forces a mass of butterflies in my stomach, making me feel nauseous. I stop in my tracks and pull my bag a little tighter against me. I let my gaze drag to meet his and I try not to gape at the unadulterated perfection of his appearance. His black hair is messy and wet against his forehead. His skin is coated in a thin layer of sweat and not to mention the muscles that ripple underneath his flawless skin. It\u2019s unfair that someone can be so good-looking and desirable when all I want to do is forget about them. I swallow over and over again, trying to get rid of the sudden dryness in the back of my throat as I watch him carefully.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay with me hiring your dad?\u201d His voice is low and coarse, sending a tidal wave of shivers down my spine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me that now? After you\u2019ve already hired him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea he was your dad until you walked in and called him Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, alright. That\u2019s a bit too much of a coincidence, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t reply to me, only watches and I continue. \u201cFighting is his passion and it makes him happy so... thank you.\u201d</p> <p>He nods. \u201cI was worried you\u2019d think I\u2019m using him to get to you.\u201d</p><p>I laugh once. \u201cNo, it\u2019s pretty clear that you\u2019re not hiring my dad to get into my pants considering I threw my pants at you last night and you refused.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s smiling at me now, but there\u2019s something raw and hungry in his eyes. It\u2019s confusing me and I hate it. I storm past him, but his hand grabs my arm, spinning me back to him. I gasp as my back is pressed against the wall and his face is inches from mine. His full lips are parted, like he\u2019s seconds away from devouring me with them and I hate that I want him to. The look in his eyes darkens and he presses his lips into a thin line. \u201cYou\u2019re mad because I didn\u2019t sleep with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m mad because you humiliated me. I let you touch me...\u201d I cringe. \u201cand then you left.\u201d Hot-faced and reluctant, I slide out from his grasp. \u201cI\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have sex. You can use my dad for your training as long as you keep your hard chest and thick arms... and your...\u201d Keep it together woman! I clear my throat and the corner of his lips twitch. \u201cJust stay away from me.\u201d</p><p>He grabs me again, pulling me back against the wall. His strong arms lean against the concrete either side of my head and his knee nudges between my legs, completely dominating me. \u201cLet me make it up to you. Come to dinner with me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitch and his eyes are suddenly brighter. He enjoys being told no and secretly that thrills me because I enjoy saying it to him. \u201cYou mistake my demand for a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour demand?\u201d I scoff and push against him, but he doesn\u2019t budge.</p> <p>\u201cOlivia.\u201d His rough voice wraps around my name and I imagine him moaning it in my ear. My lips part and I exhale slowly. \u201cCome to dinner with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I meant to sound annoyed, but my voice cracks and he smiles. He\u2019s going to break me. I\u2019m going to cave and he knows it. I\u2019m going to have to nip it in the bud before he wins. From my bag, I pull out my phone and dial Selena\u2019s number. I put it to my ear as Seth watches me curiously.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d She answers.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, keeping my eyes locked with Seth\u2019s. \u201cLet\u2019s go out tonight.\u201d</p><p>She squeals and I take the phone away from my ear until she\u2019s finished. Seth\u2019s eyes narrow in on me and I can see his muscles contract and relax.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there at nine. Love you!\u201d She hangs up.</p><p>I smile mockingly at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m busy tonight.\u201d</p><p>Damn it. Why am I so stubborn? I want to walk away, but his body is preventing me for going anywhere.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing a dangerous game.\u201d He almost growls at me. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop until\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil what?\u201d I interrupt. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me.\u201d I emphasize each word.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Olivia! I\u2019ve wanted you since the moment I caught you staring at me days ago.\u201d His finger traces my jaw and then my bottom lip before he drops it to his side. \u201cYou want to know why I can\u2019t let myself have you? Because during all of our random meetings I discovered you\u2019re the type of girl that can\u2019t separate emotions from sex and that\u2019s all I want from you.\u201d I scowl at his words, but at least he gains brownie points for honesty. \u201cAnd for some strange reason... I don\u2019t want to hurt you. You are good and I don\u2019t want to ruin that for you.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flit to his lips and then back to his eyes. \u201cIf you never planned to have sex with me, why\u2019d you tell me those things and touch me and kiss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause at the time I was trying to prove a point, but it got a little out of hand.\u201d</p><p>I look into his chocolate eyes and he seems sincere, but you can never really tell with these over-confident, playboy types. Unexpectedly, he presses his dry, full lips against mine and my eyes flutter shut on instinct, the butterflies growing increasingly abominable. His dammed lips are causing my knees to weaken and my stubbornness to give way. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t control my body. My hands slide up around his neck and into his hair. I feel his soft, damp hair slip between my fingertips and his tongue is slick with moisture as he flicks it along my bottom lip. A moan escapes my throat as Seth pulls himself back and with a sultry smile he says. \u201cBut now that I know exactly what\u2019s between those thighs, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be able to stop myself from going after you.\u201d He draws himself to his full height and storms away, leaving me panting and staring at the empty space in front of me like an idiot, my lips still heavy with his kiss.</p><p>By the time I find the courage to exit the shower room Seth and his crew have moved to the private training rooms. Thank God. I happily climb onto a treadmill and warm up for a long time. I can still feel his heat on me and I can\u2019t think straight. After I run, I move over to the bench press and dumbbells. Too many times I lost count of my reps because I was too busy thinking about what Seth said. He\u2019s confusing. He wants me, but at the same time he doesn\u2019t because I\u2019m \u2018too good\u2019. And I thought women were confusing. I never want to feel how I felt today ever again. Seth won\u2019t get another chance to humiliate me\u2014even if that wasn\u2019t his intention in the first place. The cocky bastard needs to be told no for a change and I hope I can stick to it.</p><p>I get home late because I decided to take a trip to the grocery store for some more fresh fruit and veg. When I put it all away in the fridge, I go to my room to get ready for tonight. I pick my two dresses up off the floor and decide to wear the coral off the shoulder cocktail dress. It\u2019s safe and if I do my own hair and make-up I won\u2019t have to look like an A-class hooker again. Picking up is definitely not on the agenda for me tonight. The only reason I said yes to Selena was to get Seth off my damn back. I want to go to dinner with him, but I can\u2019t trust if his request is genuine or if it\u2019s all part of some big plan. I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into it.</p><p>Selena shows up at eight-thirty dressed just as glamorously as last night in a salmon pink tube dress and white stilettos. The second she sees my dress she cringes. \u201cReally? The coral dress?\u201d</p><p>I nod and pop the cork out of the champagne. \u201cYep, it\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>Her heels are freakishly high and I\u2019m surprised she hasn\u2019t broken her neck yet. \u201cO, we\u2019re going to a club not taking a child to a pre-school orientation.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes as I pour the champagne into two wine flutes. I don\u2019t know what her problem is. The coral dress is beautiful. It isn\u2019t revealing or tight it\u2019s... boring. Sadly, the realization affects me more than I want it to.</p><p>Selena\u2019s cool hand touches my shoulder and I realize I zoned out. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad. I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d</p><p>I scoff and play it off with a chuckle. \u201cI was thinking about something else and completely zoned out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she says, changing the subject. \u201cMy friend says that Blade is at Heaven\u2019s tonight so we\u2019re going back to Lux\u2019s... if that\u2019s okay with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, but I don\u2019t want to stay out too late. I have work in the morning and I can\u2019t afford to sleep in again.\u201d</p><p>She takes her champagne flute off the bench and inhales a large mouthful. Her pink lipstick stains the glass and it\u2019s going to be a pain in the ass trying to get that off in the morning. Selena\u2019s lipsticks are like permanent markers. \u201cI bet Mason was pissed you were late today.\u201d</p><p>I take a mouthful of the yellow, bubbly liquid and place the flute back on the bench. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t too pissed, but I think that was only because he wanted me to say yes to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked you to dinner again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep and I said no for the billionth time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep saying no? Hell, I\u2019d go if he asked me. He\u2019s a total babe for his age and he has money\u2014oh, and the eyes on him pierce straight into my pus\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I shout, cutting her off. My face scrunches at her foul words. I don\u2019t think I can stomach hearing \u2018Mason\u2019 and \u2018pussy\u2019 in the same sentence. \u201cSel, he\u2019s like forty-something and he\u2019s my boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, if you want him, go for him. I\u2019m not going to stop you and hopefully that will get him off my back.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cMaybe I will.\u201d</p><p>The cab shows up at nine on the dot and Selena drags me from the house before I have a chance to change my mind\u2014again.</p><p>Lux\u2019s Lounge Bar has the same atmosphere as last night. I wonder how many people have work tomorrow and if they come out often. It\u2019s only nine-thirty and I already feel like calling it a night. Selena ushers me toward the bar and immediately two guys buy us a drink. Selena puts on her best \u2018Oh my God, I wasn\u2019t expecting that\u2019 face and I hide behind her while she flirts. I\u2019m so not into boys tonight. The argument with Seth this afternoon has really taken all of my energy out of me and boys are definitely at the very, very back of my mind.</p><p>They seem to be at the front of Selena\u2019s mind tonight, however, and I don\u2019t mind being her wingman as she swoops in to find herself a nice rich guy.</p><p>\u201cI own a law firm.\u201d She says to one guy and he laps it up like a puppy.</p><p>He has dark hair that sits in waves on his forehead and I\u2019m annoyed by how many times he flicks his head to move it around. I can tell from the beginning that this guy doesn\u2019t have money, but I can almost guarantee that he uses his daddy\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cOh, really? I work in pharmaceuticals.\u201d</p><p>Lie. Your dad works in pharmaceuticals. I smile to myself. I\u2019m doing it again\u2014judging people. I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cDrugs, I like it.\u201d Selena giggles and nudges me with her elbow. I have no idea what it means and what I\u2019m supposed to do. Do I have to say something to boost her up or does she want me to leave? Her green eyes flick sideways at me and I shrug. I never claimed to be a good wingman.</p><p>\u201cOlivia is my receptionist.\u201d She hints.</p><p>Oh. Right. I launch myself into their discussion. \u201cSelena works hard, but at the end of the day she loves to play.\u201d I feel seedy just saying that.</p><p>\u201cI like to play, too.\u201d He winks at me, \u2018subconsciously\u2019 taping the glass on his Rolex and I bite my lip, fighting the urge to scoff and drag Selena away from him. \u201cThis might be a little out of line, but are you both interested in a\u2014\u201d</p><p>I turn as quickly as I can and I get the hell out of there. A threesome is DEFINITELY not on the agenda tonight and I know that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s after. He\u2019s been trying to charm us both all night. The last time Blade and I broke up and Selena dragged me clubbing she found a hot guy and it was his \u2018birthday\u2019. He wanted a threesome which Selena was totally down for. \u201cWe\u2019re friends who have known each other forever. It\u2019s not going to be awkward. I see your tits and vag all the time.\u201d She said to me. My response was still: FUCK NO!</p><p>I don\u2019t know why. Selena is gorgeous and clean and everything else, but it\u2019s just not something I\u2019m into\u2014at all. The thought alone makes me queasy. I walk over to the bar and put my empty glass down. My eyes feel heavy and I want to go home. I glance back over my shoulder at Selena and the spoilt shit. They\u2019re making out...hardcore making out.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d The bartender asks, drawing my attention onto her.</p><p>Her dark hair is tied back into a high ponytail at the top of her head and it\u2019s long enough to cascade over her shoulders. Her shirt barely covers her midriff and she has a black dot above her upper lip. I was having a hard time trying to decide if it\u2019s a piercing or a beauty spot. I stare at it and lean in closer. She looks uncomfortable, but she doesn\u2019t drop the smile from her lips. I blink a few times as she wobbles to the side briefly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUh, nothing...\u201d I reply, sitting on a bar stool. \u201cI think I\u2019ve had too much.\u201d</p><p>Funny. I don\u2019t think I had that much to drink. My eyes spin around and around in their sockets and soon I can no longer tell which way is up.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, we\u2019re going\u2014Olivia?\u201d Selena\u2019s hands grab me and I lean into her. Her chest is soft and warm against my cheek.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel so good.\u201d I slur.</p><p>\u201cShit... It\u2019s okay. We\u2019re going to get you home.\u201d</p><p>I hear her argue with the bartender before supporting majority of my weight on her small frame. She farewells the guy she was talking to and soon the night air hits my face. My head clears slightly and after a few minutes the cool leather of a taxi seat holds me as warm hands caress my face. I have no idea what the hell is going on and I\u2019m scared. My chest feels full and I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Selena says a few times over and over until she pulls me from the car. The lines of the world are blurry, but I recognize the lag in a sensor light. I\u2019m home.</p><p>I black out until luke-warm water hits my back. My eyes shoot open, but everything is still unclear.</p> <p>\u201cC\u2019mon, O. Don\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sitting on a plastic chair hunched over in the shower and Selena is on the phone next to me. \u201cPut the manager on the damn phone!\u201d She snaps.</p><p>I help her ease me out of the shower and I lean against the wall as she dries my body with a towel. She\u2019s on hold. She hates being on hold. Selena half pulls, half carries me from the bathroom and drops me onto my bed. Naked, she tucks me under the blankets.</p><p>\u201cJerry, you fuck!\u201d She growls into her phone. \u201cYou need to up the standard of your security checks.\u201d</p><p>I fade out and then back in.</p><p>\u201cMy friend was roofied tonight. I don\u2019t know\u2014somehow. Yes, I\u2019m sure! She\u2019s a fucking mess!\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s still yelling, but I can\u2019t hear her anymore. Slowly, my eyes close and I feel like I\u2019m lying in a hammock that someone has winded up and left to spin with me still inside it. Slowly, I fall to sleep and I\u2019m happy today will be over soon. Eventually, this whole week will be over and I\u2019m glad because it has done nothing but kick me while I\u2019m down... then again, maybe I asked for it. I have a habit of doing dumb things when I shouldn\u2019t. This week is meant to be a grieving period, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m meant to be getting over my boyfriend of six years, but instead, I find myself desperately filling in time and thinking more about Seth than Blade.</p><p>There\u2019s something seriously wrong with me... and I don\u2019t care. I meant it when I told Blade that I haven\u2019t loved him for a long time. If I\u2019m being honest, I\u2019m more upset about the time wasted than the break-up itself. Does that make me a bad person? Is it horrible for me to feel free? Because I do...</p><p>I am free.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>I wake up feeling like shards of glass are poking at the back of my eyeballs. My head pounds relentlessly and my mouth is as dry as a desert.</p><p>Alcohol.</p><p>Clubs.</p><p>Roofies.</p> <p>I groan and silently make a vow never to drink again. I can almost hear my brain scoff at me. I\u2019ve said it too many times for it to be reliable and now my own body doesn\u2019t trust me.</p><p>I roll off my bed and straighten myself. I feel like shit. No, I feel worse than shit...what\u2019s worse than shit? My brain hurts and I can\u2019t be bothered answering my own damn question.</p><p>I pull my dressing gown off the back of the door and slip into it. Drowsily, I make my way to the kitchen. When I step into the lounge room Selena is passed out on my couch wearing a black t-shirt and matching sweat pants\u2014they\u2019re mine. What a surprise.</p><p>I open the cupboard and pull out a saucepan. I take a metal soup spoon from the drawer and I slowly trot over to Selena. I bang on the base of the saucepan, filling the room with glorious, headache inducing noise and she practically jumps out of her skin.</p><p>I tower over her and she blinks a few times to get her bearings. \u201cWhat. The fuck, Olivia!\u201d She shouts, covering her face with a pillow.</p><p>\u201cOh no you don\u2019t.\u201d My voice is hoarse and dry. I grab the pillow and pull it from her. \u201cIf I can\u2019t sleep in then neit\u2014\u201d</p><p>I glance at the clock on my microwave.</p><p>4:00 P.M.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d I gasp.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d She groans, claiming her pillow back and turning away from me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed work! Mason is going to kill me. I\u2019m so fired.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring my banging head and dry mouth, I sprint to my room and throw on some clean underwear. I can\u2019t locate a proper bra so I opt for a sports one. On top of that, I throw a red tank top and a pair of yoga tights. I haven\u2019t done the washing in a few days so I\u2019m out of respectable work clothing. I have to go down there and explain to him what happened.</p><p>\u201cOlivia!\u201d Selena calls out to me from the lounge room, but I ignore it.</p><p>I pull my hair into a ponytail and decide to skip make-up all together. I pull a pair of socks on and run to the front door for a pair of joggers. I am so screwed. I\u2019m going to have to ask him to dinner to get out of this one.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Sporty Spice.\u201d I don\u2019t stop. I slip my feet into my shoes and begin to tie the laces. \u201cI called Mason last night and told him what happened. He knows you\u2019re not coming in today.\u201d</p><p>I stop and look at Selena. She\u2019s smiling lazily at me. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell me sooner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to.\u201d</p><p>I exhale, deeply. \u201cHe knows that I was drugged?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cWell I had to tell him the truth otherwise he\u2019ll think you drank too much and have no sense of responsibility\u2014blah, blah, blah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d I head toward the kitchen. \u201cThanks for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d She pulls the pillow over her head as I scull back a bottle of cold water from the fridge.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re not going back to sleep.\u201d I state, putting the water back in the side door. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the gym.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun with that.\u201d</p><p>Selena never goes to the gym. I don\u2019t think she has the motivation to do anything that doesn\u2019t require alcohol and boys. I pull the pillow off her and throw it to the other side of the room. She doesn\u2019t budge so I pick up my saucepan and spoon and bang away. After a solid minute and a half of annoyingly loud clangs and bangs she climbs to her feet and knocks the saucepan from my hand. \u201cOkay fine! Just let me pee.\u201d</p><p>While she pees, I grab two breakfast bars from the cupboard and throw them into my gym bag. I pack an extra towel in case she wants to shower afterwards, as well.</p><p>When she comes back, she\u2019s wearing a pair of huge sunglasses and the same clothes she slept in. \u201cThis will have to do because I cannot be bothered getting dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>I throw her a hair tie and she pulls her blonde hair into a messy bun on the top of her head and strands of her light hair frame her face. We leave the house and climb into the car. As we drive toward the gym I thank her for last night.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what friends do\u2014look out for each other.\u201d She shrugs.</p><p>\u201cTrue. Sorry I ruined that thing between you and rich boy.\u201d</p><p>She flicks her hand at me. \u201cNah, forget about it. I Googled him when we got home and his dad is the one with the money. Little douchebag coasts off his dad\u2019s reputation.\u201d</p><p>Ha! People in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones.</p><p>\u201cSays little miss I own a law firm.\u201d I shoot back at her.</p><p>Her smile widens and she laughs loudly. \u201cShut up!\u201d</p><p>The gym is buzzing with fitness freaks this afternoon and Selena wants to sit over in the boxing section to get a closer look at all the buff boys slamming each other. Thankfully, Seth isn\u2019t there so I agree to it. She sits on a seat behind a spare bag and watches in enjoyment through her sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cHey, perve,\u201d I laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re here to work out, not ogle.\u201d</p><p>She brings her knees up to her chest and leans back in her chair in a way that\u2019s no doubt horrible for your spine. My back aches just looking at her sitting like that. \u201cIncorrect. You\u2019re here to work out. I\u2019m here for support.\u201d</p><p>The long, glass wall beside us takes up a good portion of this side of the gym. Inside are training rooms for mixed martial arts or yoga or anything else sports/class related. People in suits line the glass wall of the room next to Selena and I. I push myself onto the tips of my toes, curious to peek in. Usually, when the room is taken, the glass turns black preventing anyone from looking in. Today, the people using it didn\u2019t seem to care that the glass was still see-through.</p><p>I pull hand wraps from my bag. I got them when I was sixteen. I used to take boxing classes when I was younger. Selena did too until she dropped out because she thought her biceps were getting bigger. I\u2019ve been meaning to replace these wraps with newer ones, but I like how light these are and they came with a thumb loop and Velcro, making it easier to wrap. Selena helps me slide into a small pair of gloves. They\u2019re tight, but I can feel the support around my wrist. I bend my knees slightly and slam my gloved fists into the bag. I count out even rhythms and numbers in my head. I love boxing. I haven\u2019t done much of it over the past few years, even less now that Seth dominates this area, but it\u2019s a nice release for me. Blade doesn\u2019t like females boxing, apparently, there\u2019s something emasculating and manly about it. Pfft.</p><p>\u201cOlly?\u201d I glance up to see Dad stepping out of the training room. He\u2019s wearing a hooded jacket and a pair of black sweat pants\u2014something I haven\u2019t really seen him wear in a while.</p><p>\u201cGood morning Mr. James.\u201d Selena greets him, sliding her sunglasses onto the top of her head. She\u2019s always referred to my dad as Mr. James even though they\u2019ve known each other since I was in primary school.</p><p>\u201cHey Sel. How are ya? How\u2019s ya dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good and he\u2019s great, thanks for asking.\u201d</p><p>Dad turns his attention back to me. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you box in a while.\u201d</p><p>I glance down at the gloves. \u201cYeah, I felt like it this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, I want to show you something.\u201d He grabs me by the forearm and he pulls me toward the training room.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you just tell me what you want to show me? I have a good imagination.\u201d I say, knowing very well that Dad wants me to see something that has to do with Seth. Selena jumps out of her chair to follow closely behind us. A man with flawless dark skin steps out of the room, preventing us from entering. His eyes are a nice golden color with dark brown specks. They\u2019re comforting. My eyes drop to the stopwatch that hangs around his neck and I realize he was here yesterday, too.</p><p>\u201cUh, Rick. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. He\u2019s in a pretty foul mood this morning.\u201d He says to Dad.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only my daughter, Darryl. He\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Dad steps past Darryl, pulling me into the training room and I gasp out loud as I witness Seth drive his knee into his spar partner\u2019s face. My hands immediately cover my mouth and my pulse kicks up a notch, sending dangerous levels of nausea through my stomach. Seth whips around to face me at the sound of my gasp. His eyes are as dark as volcanic glass and they startle me. I don\u2019t like fighting\u2014play, practice or otherwise and being in the presence of someone who does it for a living makes me uncomfortable. Thankfully, the spar partner has a face guard on and isn\u2019t hurt too badly, but I still can\u2019t bring my hands away from my face. The sparer\u2014or victim, rather\u2014climbs shakily to his feet and saunters to join the rest of them on the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d Selena whispers beside me.</p><p>Seth\u2019s chest rises and falls rapidly. Under the lights, I see the sweat glisten on his body. He\u2019s wearing a pair of shorts with the slits in the side and his hands are wrapped in white. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say it\u2019s soft gauze and surgical tape.</p><p>When I look away from Seth I notice everyone else in the room. There has to be at least twenty people in here. Twelve of them are in suits and lined against the wall taking notes and discussing things under their breath. One is the coach and the others are battered spar partners stretching out their wounds and groaning in the far corner. Had Seth hurt them all?</p><p>Of course he had.</p><p>Beside me, Dad is all giddy and excited, making me feel even more nauseous. I drop my hands to my sides as Dad looks at me. This is what he wanted to show me?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look too well.\u201d Dad says, chuckling at me. He knows exactly how I feel about fighting. Whenever he made me watch his MMA fights I\u2019d sit next to him with my eyes squeezed tightly shut. I don\u2019t know what it is, but every time flesh connects with flesh... I feel sick.</p><p>\u201cIf you think that\u2019s bad, you should have seen her last night.\u201d Selena laughs. I snap my head over my shoulder, shooting daggers in her direction, but she doesn\u2019t seem to get the message. \u201cShe got roofied at Lux\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s brows furrow. \u201cWhat\u2019s roofied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn alcoholic beverage.\u201d I interrupt quickly, cutting Selena off. \u201cA strong one.\u201d</p><p>Dad looks completely lost. \u201cAll that new age stuff is confusing. I remember walking into a bar when I was young and only having three choices. What\u2019s wrong with a good old fashioned Jack Daniels?\u201d He chuckles. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re having fun and you\u2019re careful, I don\u2019t care how many roofies you drink.\u201d</p><p>Selena snorts as she catches a laugh in her throat. I shake my head and she mouths her apology to me before turning and leaving the room. My gaze finds Seth\u2019s face again and his eyes are glued to me. Heat spreads under my skin as I realize his stare is anything but playful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDad, could you give me a minute with Seth?\u201d I ask, quietly.</p><p>I have no idea what I\u2019m doing or what I\u2019m going to say, but I get the feeling if Seth doesn\u2019t talk to me right now he\u2019s going to flip out.</p><p>Dad nods curiously. \u201cOkay...\u201d</p> <p>When my dad leaves, Seth orders his people out and soon it\u2019s just me and him. As the door closes Seth storms over to me, each step he takes becomes more purposeful, more frustrated. I\u2019m painfully aware people are watching through the clear glass and I feel like an animal in a zoo.</p><p>\u201cCan we have more privacy?\u201d I ask him before he reaches me and his large body moves over to the wall to flick the button. The sheet of glass darkens and we can see out at the people in the gym, but no one can see in.</p><p>No one can see us.</p><p>I swallow hard at the realization. He watches me from the wall and I can\u2019t help but to stare back at him. Darryl said Seth is in a bad mood today and he isn\u2019t wrong. My hands are sweating inside my gloves and I can\u2019t wipe it away on my pants.</p><p>\u201cYou look sexy in a pair of gloves.\u201d His voice is unbearably intimate, but his eyes are eerily dark. I don\u2019t reply. I have absolutely no idea what to say to that. His chest is still moving quickly and I\u2019m slightly worried. How hard are they working him?</p> <p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d He asks me.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cDid anything... bad happen to you?\u201d</p><p>Bad? Is he referring to something sexual because I was drugged? I shake my head. \u201cNo, Selena took me straight home and I passed out.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rise and fall slightly in relief. Why does he care?</p><p>\u201cIf you had come to dinner with me it never would\u2019ve happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His thick arms swing slightly as he makes his way over to me. My heart stops cold, and I feel clammy moisture beginning to spread across my palms as I keep my eyes glued to his approaching form. Each purposeful, frustrated step brings him closer to me until we\u2019re pressed flush against each other. I have to force myself to breathe slowly as his rough hands slide into the nape on each side of my neck. He presses his forehead to mine and his head is damp with sweat, but I don\u2019t care. He exhales through his nose, controlling his fast breathing and then lets me go. My head spins a little and I have to change my stance to bring it back into focus.</p><p>\u201cOne of my friends, from the steakhouse, saw Selena dragging you from the club. He said you were in pretty bad shape.\u201d He tugs at the tape, un-wrapping it from his hand. \u201cI was worried.\u201d</p><p>I feel unnerved that his friend saw Selena and I at the club. It seems everyone has an eye on someone in this city. What confuses me the most is the fact that Seth is worried about me. It seems awfully uncharacteristic for a guy that appears to avoid his feelings and only wants sex from me which, by the way, I tried to give him. Am I the only one that can\u2019t make sense of this entire situation? I wonder if the reason he\u2019s been in such a bad mood today is because of me.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask straight out. No bullshit.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a good girl.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. There\u2019s that fucking word again.</p><p>Seth\u2019s voice darkens at my eye rolling. \u201cDo you know what happens to naive, good girls that pass out in clubs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you have the wrong idea about me...maybe I\u2019m not as good as you want me to be.\u201d</p><p>He tosses his wraps the floor, his eyes flaring. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be good. I want you to be bad so I can do all the things I\u2019ve wanted to do to you since I saw you and not feel fucking guilty about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was bad, remember? You still rejected me.\u201d</p><p>He grabs my waist, pulling me into him. I press my gloves against this chest and try to back away, but his grip is tight. My face is calm, but inside my body is going haywire.</p><p>\u201cNo, you were trying to be bad, but you\u2019re not.\u201d His hand travels up my side and caresses my cheek. A glimmer of sorrow fills his eyes and I frown. \u201cI was determined to have you, but then I ran into you at the steakhouse and I couldn\u2019t do it. You were sitting there all nervous and uncomfortable with your cute book and\u2014\u201d He exhales, removing his hand from my cheek and running his hands over his face. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m still not one hundred percent sure you even wanted me that night or if you were trying to get back at your ex.\u201d</p><p>His quiet, vulnerable words stole the air from my lungs. Yes, I was trying to prove a point that night, but not to Blade\u2014to myself. I wanted to see if I was capable of being fun and spontaneous. I almost succeeded until Seth decided to develop morals.</p><p>\u201cI did want you.\u201d My voice is barely audible\u2014almost breathless, but he hears it loud and clear. Seth\u2019s hand caresses my hip bone and I close my eyes. I do want you. The words fall silently to the back of my mind. A warm feeling floods me, almost filling me completely as a need throbs between my legs. I hang my head. What the hell am I doing? I should be shielding myself from this beautiful man because if I let him in, he will hurt me...but why does it feel so good, so comforting? His calloused hand grazes across my neck and then along my jaw. I let out a slow exhale as he tilts my head upward and I open my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy you do this to me?\u201d I demand.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch me and act like you give a shit?\u201d</p><p>He frowns and his tongue abruptly glides across his bottom lip. I realize he has no idea why he\u2019s always on my heel. My gaze flickers over his face, waiting for him to answer me, but he never does.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this a strange turn of events.\u201d My dad\u2019s voice rings through the room and I immediately jump away from Seth. Any feeling of desire dissipates as his sudden entrance shakes some sense back into me. I\u2019m annoyed at myself. Why am I so Goddamn weak? I can feel Seth watching me, feeling no embarrassment that my dad is here.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter with a fighter? Who would have guessed?\u201d Dad\u2019s smiling, of course. A promising fighter is probably the only guy he\u2019ll approve of.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not with him.\u201d I state proudly. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t know how to keep his hands to himself.\u201d</p><p>The same cocky smile I witnessed when I first saw Seth spreads over his lips and I feel my cheeks heat up. \u201cDinner is at seven, I\u2019ll pick you up.\u201d Is his only retort.</p><p>I open my mouth to decline, but Dad chimes in for me. \u201cThat sounds great. Let me know how it goes.\u201d He turns his attention to Seth. \u201cDarryl is kicking my ass. We need to resume training.\u201d</p><p>Seth nods and I floor it from the training room, pissed. When all of his people are back in the room and the door is shut, Selena launches herself at me, gushing like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d She squeals into my shoulder. She pulls back and watches me eagerly. \u201cHe is a fucking animal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d I can\u2019t seem to straighten out the crease in my forehead and Selena notices my frustration.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you mad because I accidently told your dad about the roofie thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s part of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO, I\u2019m sorry, jeez. Relax a little. He\u2019s clueless. He had no idea what I was talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuckily...\u201d If my dad knew what a roofie was he\u2019d drag me back to the house and never let me leave.</p><p>\u201cSeth is so...\u201d Her swift change of subject doesn\u2019t go by unnoticed. \u201cGod, did you see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I saw him Sel, I\u2019m not blind.\u201d</p><p>She glowers at me and crosses her arms over her chest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, did Seth jam a stick up your ass in there because you\u2019re being a total bitch right now.\u201d</p><p>I slam my fists into the bag, not following any rhythm just punching with pure frustration. \u201cSorry,\u201d I mange to breathe after a combo. \u201cIt\u2019s Seth. He gets on my nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s taking me to dinner. I don\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p><p>Selena stares at me wide eyed and mouth agape like I\u2019m the biggest moron she\u2019s ever met.</p><p>\u201cUm, okay...\u201d She slips in between me and the bag, clenching her chest so I don\u2019t punch her in the boob. \u201cAre you dumb? Hello?! That guy is sex on legs. You have to go, if not for yourself then go for me!\u201d</p><p>I swipe the glove over my forehead to clear some sweat, only the material spreads it instead of absorbing it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s like a big Popsicle of sugar and we girls are ants just dying for a taste. One day the popsicle comes down to our ant hill looking all sugary and irresistible and he invites one small ant to come suck on him and get as much sugar as she wants, but the ant declines and we\u2019re looking at her like, what the fuck and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I laugh, cutting off her story. \u201cI think I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. So, what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>I wipe the glove over my forehead again and pant slightly. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to stand the guy up. I know how that feels.\u201d</p><p>She squeals, drawing attention to us. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get some sugar!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve changed my outfit about a million times already and Seth is meant to be here any minute. First, I cycled through four maxi-dresses, but decided they were too safe so I moved onto jeans and sweaters. A few more minutes pass and I have no choice but to wear a pair of skinny jeans with a small pair of black heels. I throw down the lilac sweater and kick it into the cupboard. Purple and any variation of the color didn\u2019t sit well with my white complexion. I pull a black lacy top from the depths of my wardrobe, cursing myself for being slack on the washing. It\u2019s a sleeveless, high cut top, stopping just before my neck. The solid fabric covers my stomach and my breasts. From the breasts up is lace, giving off a sophisticated, but not too good kind of look. I smile to myself and enter the bathroom. I blow dry and straighten my hair with no problems and the second I finish my make up there\u2019s a firm knock at the door that pulls me all the way over to it. I straighten my jeans and flick my hair over my shoulders. Moisture floods the palm of my hands and I feel nauseous. Oh God. What am I doing? I grasp the handle and open the door. Seth leans against the railing, toying with the car keys in his hand. I breathe a subtle sigh of relief when I see that he\u2019s dressed casually in a black sweater that\u2019s rolled up to his elbows. He looks so deliciously handsome and my insides flutter. His eyes rake my skinny jeans and lacy top with approval. A gentle breeze pushes his scent in my direction and it engulfs me. It\u2019s pleasantly alluring\u2014nothing like the body spray Blade used to use. I clear my throat nervously and step out of my house, closing the door behind me.</p><p>\u201cYou look good.\u201d He says, smiling up at me.</p><p>Jesus. We haven\u2019t even left my house yet and I already want to throw myself at him.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t like the dress I wore the other night?\u201d I tease.</p><p>\u201cI see those kinds of dresses all the time.\u201d His hand wraps around mine and the gesture causes my heart to race. \u201cSometimes more is less.\u201d</p><p>He aids me down the stairs and I try to control my pulse under his touch. Seth doesn\u2019t strike me as a hand holder which brings me to my next question, what\u2019s he playing at? He doesn\u2019t do girlfriends and for someone who\u2019s worried I can\u2019t separate my emotions from sex he\u2019s sure doing his best to work his way under my skin. He opens the car door for me, like he had the night at the club and I climb in. Seth shuts the door and jumps in the driver\u2019s seat before pulling away from my apartment.</p><p>The drive to the restaurant is brief and I cringe when we roll into Salsa\u2019s car park. It hurt my facial muscles to keep a polite smile on my face. I never want to eat Mexican again, ever.</p><p>I slide from the car and we walk into the restaurant, hand in hand. We\u2019re immediately seated in a secluded spot by the back corner and hidden away from appraising eyes. It seems a lot of people know who Seth is and the stares unnerve me. I slide my black clutch onto the table next to me as a young girl comes and takes our order. Seth orders a large plate of shredded beef tacos, a salad and a side of Mexican fries for us both. When she leaves, his attention is solely on me and I play with my fork, twisting it with my fingers, pretending I\u2019m not bothered by his enthralling gaze. Seth seems a little anxious, his chest rising and falling a little quickly and every few minutes he rakes his teeth over his bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering why I invited you to dinner.\u201d He says, eventually.</p><p>The waitress comes back and she places two glasses on the table, filling them with water. Seth leans back in his chair, making himself at home and his index finger slowly caresses the lip of the glass. I nod my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>Nervously, I reach for my glass and bring it to my lips. Sadly, the cold water doesn\u2019t do anything to ease the fire burning inside me. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems you\u2019ve had a hard week and I probably made it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d I reply. I really don\u2019t want to sound like a bitch, but for some reason I can\u2019t shake it. Being back in this restaurant makes me anxious. He leans forward in his chair.</p><p>\u201cLook, you can\u2019t keep holding a grudge against me because I didn\u2019t sleep with you and before your girl brain over-thinks what I\u2019m saying\u2014you\u2019re not ugly, you\u2019re not fat and it\u2019s not because you threw yourself at me.\u201d I scowl at him and the corner of his lips twitch before turning serious again. \u201cIf I let you have me I\u2019m almost certain you wouldn\u2019t be able to handle me\u2014you don\u2019t even know me and look how angry I make you. I\u2019m a mess. I\u2019m stubborn, selfish, spoiled and a little too proud. I act like I don\u2019t give a fuck\u2014and most of the time I don\u2019t, but there\u2019s a small portion of me that cares too much and for some reason...you fall into that portion. Don\u2019t ask me why because I have no idea and it has been driving me fucking insane.\u201d He leans back in his chair and produces a toothpick from his pocket. He shoves it into his mouth and works it while he thinks. Before he speaks his brows pull together. \u201cI can\u2019t have good...because I don\u2019t deserve good.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I frown a little, but I never take my eyes off him. So this whole thing is really about him, not me? Why do I fall into that portion? Why does he care about me? From where I\u2019m sitting, he seems so vulnerable and young.</p><p>\u201cI keep touching you because I can\u2019t stop and like I\u2019ve said before, I will hurt you and soon it\u2019s going to be you that has to tell me to back off because my resistance is running out.\u201d His eyes narrow in. \u201cIf you don\u2019t push me away and you decide to let me in... Remember that I don\u2019t do girlfriends and I don\u2019t do feelings. If you get hurt, it\u2019s on you. Not me.\u201d</p><p>The weight of his words rest on my chest and I\u2019m frustrated that he thinks I\u2019d let him in after everything he just said. Maybe I should tell him to back off now...that would save me the trouble of doing it when he decides to let himself go after me.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be one of those girls.\u201d I say quietly. He raises an eyebrow and I continue. \u201cThe girls in the gym that come for you and you send them away... I don\u2019t want to be one of them. You disrespect women.\u201d</p><p>His eyes brighten and a wide smile spreads across his face. He genuinely finds what I said amusing. \u201cNo, I treat them how they want me to treat them. They want to fuck, so I fuck them. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if one of them wants more from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d have to be pretty special to change my stance on relationships.\u201d He throws his toothpick onto the table. \u201cNo one has tried to get to know the real me, but I take full blame for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me about the real you.\u201d</p> <p>He winks at me. \u201cNice try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought me to dinner, but we can\u2019t talk about you?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI brought you to dinner to apologize and to give you a heads up. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>I press the fork into my finger to relieve some of my anger. God! Why is this man so difficult?!</p><p>\u201cWell, message received.\u201d I drop the fork, grab my clutch and rise to my feet, but before I leave I turn to him. \u201cI don\u2019t need a guy like you in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA guy like me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ve already had someone that sleeps with everything that moves and quite frankly, I don\u2019t think I can stomach another. You can take your dinner, your apology and your heads up and you can shove them up your ass because I don\u2019t want you. I don\u2019t want you now and I won\u2019t want you next week. I hate myself for even thinking that I can have a little bit of fun after breaking up with my boyfriend of six years.\u201d</p><p>I storm from the restaurant and through the car park. I\u2019ll walk home. It isn\u2019t that far. My heels clatter against the concrete footpath underneath me. I haven\u2019t cried yet, I\u2019m too angry, but I know I will later and it won\u2019t be because Seth told me he is incapable of relationships or because he likes to fuck random girls. It will be because I\u2019m stupid and weak. I will cry because I let Seth upset me\u2014a stranger who knows nothing about me has upset me and I hate myself for it. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a white car slow to a walking pace.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, get in the car.\u201d He calls.</p><p>His voice sends dread hurling through my stomach. I flip him off and increase my pace.</p><p>The car jerks to a stop and he jumps out. Thick, strong arms seize my waist and he throws me over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Seth. Put me down.\u201d I shout.</p><p>He opens the passenger door and sits me on the seat. He reaches across and pulls the seatbelt over me, clipping it in tightly. The door slams shut and I jump a little. He climbs into his side and says. \u201cI pissed you off, at least let me drive you home.\u201d</p><p>I wind down my window to get fresh air on my face and I don\u2019t look at Seth the entire drive. I open my door and climb out before the car comes to a full stop. Seth calls after me, but I ignore him. I can just make out the sound of his phone ringing and him growing more frustrated with every second that passes. I\u2019m almost at the top of the stairs when he answers his phone.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He snaps. His voice is as cold as ice and I stumble to get my key in the door. \u201cAgain? Are you fucking kidding me? Fine.\u201d</p><p>I step inside and slam the door shut as his car speeds away from my apartment. I throw my clutch across the room, growling in anger. There goes the gym I like to work out at. I\u2019m never going back there again. I can\u2019t possibly stomach seeing him. It\u2019d make me too mad. I sigh. It\u2019s going to kill Dad when he discovers I\u2019m going to a new gym. Maybe I\u2019ll try the new twenty-four hour one that has just opened up on the main street. Screw it. I\u2019ll just jog a block or two instead. I drop onto the couch and shield my face with a pillow. I lay there for a little while thinking about all the things he said to me. I spend a good portion of the night trying to decipher him, but I can\u2019t.</p><p>He\u2019s unreadable.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>It has been a week since the night with Seth at Salsa\u2019s. I haven\u2019t gone to the gym and Dad has been blowing up my phone checking on me at least twice a day. He tells me that Seth has been distant and more aggressive than usual. Of course he blames me, but I take no notice of it and keep playing dumb. I shouldn\u2019t care and I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t. Blade hasn\u2019t contacted me in over a week either and that\u2019s helped me keep my head clear. The only contact that I\u2019ve had from the opposite sex besides work and everyday stuff was the card that Seth had jammed in my door when I was at work two days ago. It said:</p><p>Sorry, call me. \u2013Seth</p><p>And it had his number sprawled neatly along the bottom. I saved his number into my phone, but I\u2019m yet to glance at it. I don\u2019t really want to hear what he\u2019s got to say. I\u2019m not in the mood for his \u2018I care, but I don\u2019t care\u2019 with the \u2018I want you, but I can\u2019t let myself have you\u2019 kind of speeches.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen Selena since she left my house when we got back from the gym last week. She says she\u2019s been so busy with work and her dad is pissed at her because she showed up to work drunk. Typical Selena.</p><p>I wave goodbye to Mason who is now back to talking to me like I didn\u2019t reject him and I leave work. I have to walk a mile down the road to get to my car and by the time I get there, my boobs are sweaty and my legs ache. I\u2019ve been overdoing it when it comes to running this past week. It\u2019s my only release.</p><p>I drive home, shower and put on my pajamas. Nothing sounds better than a hot dinner and TV to me right now. The frozen dinner is covered in a thin layer of freezer ice. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve had a microwavable dinner. When I close the freezer door, a colorful photo catches my attention. My younger face is contorted into a frustrated scowl while Mom\u2019s cherry colored lips are pressed firmly against my cheek. My brother is standing behind us, squishing himself into the photo. His light brown hair is styled upright and his dark green eyes are illumined by the flash. I love this photo. It reminds me of a time when all we had was each other... but then Chase and I grew up and we wanted something for ourselves. I never understood why my parents were so desperate to have me back under their wing and I still don\u2019t, but this photo helps me deal with it. Chase and I are their life.</p><p>I shove the dinner into the microwave and hit two minutes. While I wait, my eyes fall back onto the photo. I should call Mom. I grab my phone and drop into the couch. It\u2019s been a while and I miss her. As it rings, I feel awkward and can\u2019t quite get into a comfortable position. I pull one of the blue, square pillows from my couch and onto my lap.</p><p>\u201cHello, James residence.\u201d Mom answers.</p><p>\u201cHey, mom...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia, honey!\u201d She coos. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I pull on a loose piece of string hanging from one corner of my pillow. \u201cHow\u2019s things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Your dad tells me you haven\u2019t been showing up at the gym... If there\u2019s something wrong, you know you always have a place here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Mom. Rest assured nothing is wrong, I\u2019ve just been busy. Have you heard from Chase?\u201d I ask, changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. He\u2019s in Pakistan on break right now. He should be home in five months before he has to ship out again. Darling, are you coming to dinner on Sunday?\u201d</p><p>I exhale. I forgot about that. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, good. I\u2019m making Shepherd\u2019s pie and roast vegetables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYum.\u201d</p><p>Mom chuckles excitedly through the phone, making me smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go. I\u2019ve got a lot of Gossip Girl to catch up on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay honey. I\u2019ll see you Sunday. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too.\u201d</p><p>I hang up and smile. That phone call should keep her happy for a little while. The microwave beeps and I pull out the chicken fried rice. I tug on the plastic and as soon as it opens a little, steam pours out, burning the tips of my fingers.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d I squeak, snapping my fingers away and stuffing them into my mouth to ease the burn. I leave the dish on the counter to cool and lean over the sink to run my fingertips under the cold water. I\u2019m distracted as my phone rattles around on the bench, emitting an annoying vibrating noise. I lean over to glance at the screen. Selena\u2019s name in big, bold letters flashes on my screen. Should I answer it? I am not going out tonight, no matter how hard she begs.</p><p>\u201cThe answer is no.\u201d I say immediately, answering the phone with my dry hand and putting it against my ear.</p><p>\u201cJesus, O, have a little faith, you don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m calling.\u201d</p><p>The cool water from the tap sooths my fingers as I plunge them further under the running water. \u201cIs it to go clubbing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually.\u201d</p><p>I sag in relief, shutting off the water. \u201cSpill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn a scale of one to ten how much of a lonely hermit are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne. I\u2019m a happy hermit.\u201d I reply, tugging the tea towel off the oven and drying my hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie. You\u2019ve been a sourpuss since your date with Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a date.\u201d I quickly push in. \u201cIt was dinner.\u201d And it\u2019s not like I actually ate.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Look, I need a favor... I lost a bet with a friend and she set me up for a blind date with this guy only I can\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. I\u2019m not doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia, please, I\u2019m begging you. It\u2019s only one dinner.\u201d I don\u2019t reply and she exhales deeply. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you a hundred bucks.\u201d</p><p>The money makes me consider it. \u201cWhere and when?\u201d I ask curiously.</p><p>I can see her jumping up and down right now. \u201cPhillip\u2019s Gourmet, tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>I groan. \u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix-thirty... you\u2019re going to do it?\u201d</p><p>I sigh, tapping my fingers in an even beat on the bench top. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll do it for you and you better pay me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Thank you so much, this is going to totally save my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope he isn\u2019t going to expect anything from me because I don\u2019t plan on staying with him very long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay. He can be a little grabby if he has too much to drink, but he\u2019s harmless so don\u2019t freak out if he tries to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks again, O. Love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelena? Shit!\u201d</p><p>I slide my phone across the bench. Why do I get myself into these things?</p><p>All of the frustrated glares I\u2019m getting from families of four are quickly ruining my night. I agree that the four-person table I\u2019m sitting at by the large window is a little unnecessary, but all the two-seaters are taken. It\u2019s not my fault the waiter sat me here. I would\u2019ve been happy at the bar.</p><p>The other half of this blind date hasn\u2019t showed up yet and he better because if I\u2019m stood up by a guy that I haven\u2019t even met yet I\u2019m going to be pissed.</p><p>A blond man with boot cut jeans and a formal, light grey shirt approaches me. The top two buttons of his shirt are open, exposing a small amount of chest hair. He\u2019s quite handsome and has bright blue eyes. I rake my eyes up his tall body. I\u2019m not that short, but this guy makes me feel like a hobbit. He\u2019s even taller than Seth and I estimate Seth to be at least 6\u201d1.</p><p>\u201cAre you Selena?\u201d</p><p>I smile politely. \u201cNo, Selena couldn\u2019t make it. I\u2019m her friend, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>His mouth spreads into a wide, wolfish grin and it kind of gives me the creeps. I think he wants to devour me... and not in a good way. I feel uncomfortable as he slides into the seat next to me instead of sitting across from me like a normal person would. I try not to assume he means anything by it. This is a date... after all. His gaze is stabbing at my body, like little sharp daggers puncturing every inch of my flesh and I feel... exposed. Awkward. Disgusted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Brent.\u201d He says.</p><p>That sharp, creepy stare of his overtly drifts to my breasts before returning to my face. I become painfully aware of the top I\u2019m wearing. It has a scoop neck that dips low in the front. I cross my arm over my chest and lean on my elbow, pretending I didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cHave you ordered?\u201d He asks.</p><p>\u201cNope, let\u2019s order now.\u201d I quickly snap my fingers at a passing waiter. The sooner this is over, the better. I order a chicken salad and he orders a steak and two beers. When the beers come, it\u2019s clear he ordered both for himself. While we wait he tries to converse with me and I\u2019m very picky with what information I share with him. Some of it I make up. He hasn\u2019t done anything else to put me off, but I don\u2019t like the vibe he\u2019s giving off. I become conscious of my tight, black pencil skirt as his knee grazes mine and I cross my legs over each other to keep them away from him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me saying, you\u2019re very beautiful.\u201d</p><p>My stomach churns, but I force myself to smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m going to kill Selena when I see her next.</p> <p>The next twenty minutes is filled with sleazy comments, lame pick up lines and occasionally his hand brushes across my thigh. When excuses himself to use the bathroom, I pull my phone from my bag. My fingers tap the screen quickly as I compile my text message.</p><p>TO: SETH. TIME: 7:00PM</p><p>I\u2019m going to kill you! This guy</p><p>is a creepo! I can\u2019t wait for</p><p>dinner to finish. I\u2019m coming</p> <p>to kick your ass!</p><p>I get a reply almost immediately.</p><p>FROM: SETH. TIME: 7:01PM</p><p>Where are you?</p><p>My brows knit together and I reply.</p><p>TO: SETH. TIME: 7:01PM</p> <p>Are you high? I\u2019m</p><p>with Brent... YOUR date at</p><p>Phillip\u2019s Gourmet.</p><p>I hit send and read over the text messages. It\u2019s strange, even for her. My stomach sinks into my shoes and my hand flies up to cover my mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d No, no, no, no... Seth is directly under Selena in my contacts list and I must have clicked his name without realizing. I feel like vomiting. A hot, nervous flash tears through my body when my phone vibrates and I see Seth\u2019s name.</p><p>FROM: SETH. TIME: 7:03PM</p><p>I\u2019m on my way.</p><p>Brent slides back into his seat next to me and I shove my phone into my handbag. I don\u2019t have time to reply to Seth. A two-seater is cleared up in front of us and I\u2019m aware that it\u2019s the only available table in the entire restaurant. I look at the waiting line... only large families wait. I silently pray that a couple comes and takes up the table before Seth shows. He\u2019ll probably sit right in front of me and make this as torturous as he can. The waiter brings our food and I occupy myself by eating my salad. While I shovel lettuce and chicken into my mouth, I can\u2019t help but notice Brent\u2019s eyes boring into me. I try to ignore the way he watches me closely as I eat the pieces of delicious grilled chicken or hard croutons. I glance at him and his eyes are following the fork as I bring it to my mouth and he stares at my lips as they close around the food. The chicken, tomato and lettuce form a barricade in my throat, fighting its way down as I force myself to strike up a conversation with Brent. I\u2019ll do anything to get him to stop staring at me. \u201cTell me about yourself.\u201d</p> <p>McCreepo tells me all about his life. He has a little boy named Jonathon and he\u2019s not allowed to see him because his \u2018bitch-whore\u2019 of an ex doesn\u2019t allow it. Other than that, I\u2019m not paying that much attention to what he\u2019s saying... I\u2019m too focused on the front door. Every time someone enters my heart skips a beat. I\u2019m anxious because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen...</p><p>It isn\u2019t until we finish dinner and dessert rolls around that I see Seth\u2019s large frame enter the restaurant. His eyes find me immediately and relief washes over his features. He looks like he\u2019s come from the gym. He\u2019s wearing a white hoodie and black sweat pants. Even dressed down he provokes a naughty filling inside me. I clear my throat. I\u2019m still mad at him.</p><p>Seth eyes Brent and his eyes darken as Brent rubs his hand across my shoulder before resting it on the back of my chair. Brent reeks of booze. He\u2019s slammed down countless beers and he\u2019s hiccupping all over the place. Great. He\u2019s going to try and kiss me. I drop my gaze to the table. Brent\u2019s mumbling about some motocross event and when I look back up Seth is being seated at the table in front of us. His back is to me, but I know he\u2019s listening.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come?\u201d</p><p>I flick my head toward Brent. \u201cHm?</p><p>\u201cTo motocross tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>I flush. This is awkward. \u201cNo... I don\u2019t like motocross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can do something else if you want?\u201d His chair scrapes the floor as he shuffles closer to me. I can\u2019t breathe as he rubs my back and his other hand caresses my knee. He sways slightly in his chair and I\u2019ve had enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go.\u201d I mumble, sliding my chair back.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he exhales following suit and standing up. \u201cAt least let me walk you to your car.\u201d</p><p>Seth angles his head and I can see the whole side of his face. His jaw flexes under his skin and I know he wants me to say no.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. You stay and finish your beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI insist.\u201d</p><p>Brent holds the door open for me and I try hard not to look over my shoulder as we exit the restaurant. The car park is void of any people and the lighting is dim. I\u2019m kicking myself for not getting a park closer to the door. I can hear his feet scuffing annoyingly over a few pebbles and I think I heard him stumble a few times, too. In the distance I can see my car and I almost sprint to it. I hit unlock on my button and grab the handle. Brent grabs my other hand and presses his lips to it.</p><p>\u201cIt was a pleasure meeting you.\u201d His voice is slurred and his eyes are thinned into drunken slits.</p><p>My face hurts from too many fake smiles. \u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>I try to pull my hand back, but he won\u2019t let it go. I take a deep, calm breath. \u201cBrent, let me go.\u201d I say in my calmest voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you. I just want one goodnight kiss.\u201d He pulls me into him and his hands push down to my ass as he squeezes me hard against him. I twist and turn as much as I can to get away from his face. As a result, his mouth finds my earlobe instead and a sickening shudder overcomes me as his tongue traces my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d His breath is warm and sticky on my skin.</p><p>I shove him, but he doesn\u2019t budge. My heart slams against my ribs and painful tendrils of fear burrow through my stomach.</p><p>I try to bring my knees up, but he\u2019s too close and has positioned himself on a weird angle. I have no momentum and no way to kick his junk.</p><p>\u201cBrent!\u201d I whisper urgently at him when I see Seth\u2019s fierce, approaching figure. \u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want one kiss. Just one. I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her go.\u201d Seth didn\u2019t raise his voice, but the coldness in it got Brent\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d He spits. \u201cWe\u2019re busy.\u201d</p><p>His small hands cup my breasts and I let out a strange choking sound from my throat. My stomach churns and twists. I think I\u2019m going to throw up. Seth\u2019s warm hand grabs my arm and I\u2019m yanked out from underneath Brent. He tucks me safely behind him and as I peer around his large frame, Seth slams Brent\u2019s face into the side of my car. I gasp and my hands fly up to cover my mouth as I distinctly hear a cracking sound and I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s my window or Brent\u2019s nose. Brent rolls around on the car park floor clenching his face. I grab onto Seth\u2019s waist and tuck myself behind him. Seth wraps an arm around his back and presses me closer to him. My hands are shaking\u2014I\u2019m shaking. Seth steps toward Brent again, but I squeeze him harder.</p><p>\u201cPlease, stop.\u201d I beg and I\u2019m not even sure why I want Brent to be spared. Then I realize it\u2019s not about Brent. I couldn\u2019t care less about him. It\u2019s about Seth. I don\u2019t want him to do something stupid because of me. Seth wraps an arm around my shoulder and guides me away from my car and away from Brent. Soon, I find myself leaning against his Range Rover. Seth is pacing the concrete in front of me, breathing heavily and running his fingers through his hair. I step forward. \u201cSeth? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>He tilts his head up to the cloudy sky, but his breathing doesn\u2019t slow. I walk closer to him and run my hands over his chest and up the sides of his neck. He tilts his head down to me, but I can\u2019t see his expression, it\u2019s too dark. His breathing slows and he pulls my hands from his neck, allowing his thumb to glide over the top of my hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shaking.\u201d His voice is low and soft.</p><p>\u201cYeah... I... it won\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in shock. We need to call the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t. You hurt him. You\u2019re an MMA fighter, right? You can\u2019t hurt people. You\u2019ll lose everything you\u2019ve worked for.\u201d He shrugs, but I feel him tense. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Selena and she can tell her friend.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cThen at least let me take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick it up tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Seth helps me into the car and we drive away from the restaurant. I keep replaying what almost happened over and over in my head. Did I do something wrong? Did I give off a wrong signal somewhere? A tear rolls down my cheek and I quickly wipe it away. I don\u2019t want to cry in front of Seth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Olivia.\u201d He states, like he read my mind.</p><p>\u201cIt is. Selena told me he can be grabby when he drinks... I still showed up.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, his hands gripping the steering wheel tighter. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I told Selena I would and I thought I\u2019d be able to avoid it.\u201d</p><p>Even I realize how completely idiotic it sounds. Seth and I don\u2019t talk for the rest of the ride and when we pull up outside my house, he helps me from the car. Sometimes, for a guy with attitude issues, he sure was a sweetheart. He walks me up the stairs and I unlock the door. Before I open it, I turn to face him and he looks up at me through his eyelashes from a lower step. From this angle he seems so vulnerable, so innocent.</p><p>\u201cCan you stay with me?\u201d The words are out of my mouth before I have the chance to think about them.</p><p>He noticeably stiffens and his gaze falls from my face to the stairs. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease...I don\u2019t want to be alone. You can leave when I\u2019m asleep, if you want to.\u201d</p><p>He analyzes me for a little while before nodding his head and climbing the rest of the stairs. When we enter my house, Seth kicks off his shoes and I bypass the dimly lit lounge room to my bedroom. I flick the light switch on and look at Seth. He seems uncomfortable and I have no idea how to make it easier for him. I doubt he has ever kept a girl non-sexual company until she falls asleep before and the thought makes me smile a little. I grab a pair of boxers and a tank top from the end of my bed and I change into them in the bathroom. I brush my teeth to get rid of the taste of second hand beer and when I go back into my room I see Seth has taken his hoodie off, but kept his white t-shirt on. He\u2019s still standing in the same spot, awkwardly and I bite back a smile as I switch out the overhead light. I cross the room to put the lamp on and then climb into bed. To my surprise, Seth\u2019s arms gather me close so my face is on his chest and his nose is buried in my hair. He\u2019s so warm, I want to snuggle in closer and wrap my legs around his. It takes all of my strength not to run my free hand that rests on my leg, over his body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Olivia.\u201d He says. His lips moving against the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor not trying harder to clear things up between us after dinner. If I had, maybe this could have been averted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened with Brent isn\u2019t your fault...\u201d I pause to contemplate my next words. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have agreed to go and I definitely shouldn\u2019t have showed up even though I knew he was going to get grabby. All of this screams me, not you.\u201d</p><p>My fingers twitch as I lift my hand from my leg and move it towards his body. I want to rub his chest and feel the warmth of his skin under my hand, but I rest it on his hip instead and Seth tenses underneath me.</p><p>\u201cYou can relax.\u201d I giggle. \u201cI\u2019m not going to throw myself at you, again.\u201d</p><p>On my head I feel his lips smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not you I\u2019m worried about.\u201d</p><p>He pulls me in tighter and I feel safe. I can only hope to repay Seth for tonight, at some point.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for running out on dinner last week.\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t blame you. I can be a bit of a dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t like talking about yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Silence fills the room and normally I\u2019d push for it, but I don\u2019t want to ruin this. My heart beat speeds up in the silence and the adrenaline of tonight begins to wear off. There\u2019s a constriction in my throat and I can\u2019t seem to shake it. Seth drags a deep inhale through his nose.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the most interesting life,\u201d He exhales. \u201cBut there is one thing that completely turned my world upside down... my dad died of cancer two years ago just before my amateur championship bout in the MMAC tournament.\u201d</p><p>I wrap my arm around his waist and my chest compresses. This is what my dad was talking about the first day I saw Seth in the gym. The family drama was his Dad\u2019s death?</p><p>\u201cI stopped doing MMA to look after my mom and my little sister.\u201d</p><p>The thought of Seth having a little sister warms my heart. I can only imagine how protective he is of her.</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019ve decided to try again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s what he would\u2019ve wanted. Everything I know about MMA, I learned from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s very proud of you.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cMaybe... he was a hard guy to please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds familiar.\u201d I chuckle.</p><p>He squeezes my arm between his index finger and thumb causing me to laugh out loud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>We lay together in silence. It isn\u2019t awkward or uncomfortable. It\u2019s nice and I don\u2019t want to fall asleep because I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll never experience it again.</p><p>\u201cI have a qualifying fight in tomorrow night here in Maine. If it goes well and I win, I\u2019ll be contending in the MMAC amateur tournament.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That explains all the men in suits and coaches that have been hanging around Seth in the gym, taking notes.</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>A gust of air fell from my mouth. I\u2019m shocked he\u2019d ask such a thing. Why does he want me there? I can\u2019t watch him fight. I can\u2019t even stomach watching it on T.V. \u201cI can\u2019t. I don\u2019t like fighting...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were boxing a bag at the gym last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different. A bag is an inanimate object. A human is real... they feel everything.\u201d</p><p>He rolls me back a little and leans his face right over mine. Traumatized by Brent or not, my body reacts to him immediately. My breathing becomes shallow and my hands move to play nervously with the string of my shorts.</p><p>\u201cI want you where I can keep an eye on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a big girl. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOlivia, the last two times I\u2019ve seen you, you\u2019ve managed to get yourself into some kind of trouble. First it was the roofie and now tonight... I won\u2019t be able to fight my best unless I know you\u2019re safe.\u201d His index finger glides along my jaw and his eyes turn dark and serious. \u201cAnd that is directly in my line of sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. You fall into the small portion of shit I care about.\u201d</p><p>But why?! I want to demand. There\u2019s so much going on in Seth\u2019s head that I need to understand, but he\u2019s making it difficult for me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re confusing.\u201d</p><p>He sighs and rolls backwards onto the pillow pinning me to his side. \u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to your fight.\u201d And that\u2019s final.</p><p>\u201cYour dad is coming.\u201d</p><p>I groan, closing my eyes briefly. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Seth nods. \u201cAnd I told him you were coming so he\u2019s really excited about the whole daddy-daughter thing.\u201d</p><p>I push myself up on my elbows. \u201cSeth! Why\u2019d you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to have a back-up plan in case you said no.\u201d</p><p>I thrust away from him. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t like to watch people fight. It\u2019s... barbaric and inhumane.\u201d Bruised flesh. Blood. Broken bones. Who enjoys that?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d He counters, pulling me back into him. \u201cI can tell your dad you cancelled. I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t be too upset.\u201d</p> <p>I know he\u2019s playing a game with me. Dad will be devastated if I don\u2019t go. My whole life he has tried to rope me into watching MMA with him and going to little events here and there. I don\u2019t think Seth realizes how high he\u2019s gotten my Dad\u2019s hopes.</p><p>\u201cFine...\u201d I sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll go, but don\u2019t be upset if my eyes are shut the whole time.\u201d</p><p>Seth holds me tightly and kisses my forehead, rendering me breathless. I close my eyes. I don\u2019t know much about Seth Marc, but I do know he isn\u2019t what he seems. I know he puts on a hard front, but if tonight is anything to go off, I\u2019d say he\u2019s not what he wants people to think. There\u2019s a kind of gentleness to him... and I like it. I can\u2019t have good... because I don\u2019t deserve good. I smile to myself as his words play through my mind.</p><p>He deserves good.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>When I leave work the next day, I feel nauseous and worried. In three hours I\u2019ll be attending my very first fight and I\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s going to go. Do it for dad. Do it for Seth. I told myself all day, but it still didn\u2019t help shake my nerves.</p><p>Seth ended up staying the night last night and the look on his face in the morning when he realized we\u2019d snuggled all night was priceless. He left early and then came back with my car. Thankfully, the window wasn\u2019t cracked.</p><p>After that, he left to go to his training session. I learned that he trains twice a day for three hours each time. When he makes it to the professionals he\u2019ll train three times a day to his maximum limit to be able to keep up with everyone else. How horrendous. I offered him a breakfast bar, but he laughed and said he needed something a little more sustaining before rushing out the door.</p><p>I drive home from work, chewing my nails the entire way. When I pull up, Selena is sitting on my front steps. I begged Seth to let me bring Selena tonight. At first he was a little frustrated because he blames her entirely for what happened last night, but he eventually caved. Trepidation fills my stomach when I realize I haven\u2019t told Selena about last night. I need to. She needs to warn her friend that Brent is not the kind of guy she should be hanging out with. I step out of the car and straighten my skirt. Selena\u2019s eyebrows draw together and her lips purse into a pout. Uh-oh. I know that look.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m not late.\u201d I say, climbing the steps. \u201cSo you can wipe that pout off your face.\u201d She doesn\u2019t move as I unlock the door. When it\u2019s open, she follows me inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened last night?\u201d She snaps, slamming my door behind her.</p><p>My chest tightens as a large ball forms in my throat. \u201cI need to talk to you about that.\u201d I manage to say.</p><p>\u201cSeth beat up Brent because he walked you to your car? What the fuck, Olivia?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m taken back by her interesting, yet completely vague take on the story. \u201cOkay, first of all\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy was Seth there in the first place? My friend assures me that Brent is a kind soul who wouldn\u2019t do anything to provoke anyone. Seth is a fucking psycho!\u201d</p><p>I snap. I don\u2019t know what happened, but suddenly my anger flew off the charts.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you! You\u2019re my best friend! You\u2019re supposed to ask for my side of the story, not come around slinging accusations!\u201d I yell and Selena\u2019s face drains of color. She takes a step back and a tear spills down her cheek. \u201cSeth saved me from that grabby piece of shit who was practically mauling me in the car park!\u201d</p><p>Her lips quiver and her green eyes widen.</p><p>\u201cYep, that\u2019s right.\u201d My voice is still loud and angry. \u201cBrent\u2014the not-so-kind soul\u2014got overly wasted at dinner and walked me to my car. Then he thought it appropriate to put his hands and his mouth all over me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia, I\u2019m sorry...\u201d</p><p>I subconsciously count to ten. ...eight...nine...ten. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. You warned me... after bribing me, but still. You can tell your friend that Seth wasn\u2019t the problem.\u201d</p><p>Selena launches at me and pulls me into a hug. I tell her the whole story. I tell her that he was a little too full on at dinner and that I texted Seth instead of her.</p><p>\u201cO... I\u2019m sorry that happened to you. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be so aggressive...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell your friend she shouldn\u2019t be hanging around with him.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cHe kept saying he wasn\u2019t going to hurt me, but you can never be too certain.\u201d</p><p>She pulls a hundred dollars from her back pocket and hands it to me, but I refuse to take it. Something doesn\u2019t sit right. Taking money for what happened... it feels wrong.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll make me feel better if you take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it... I can\u2019t take it off you.\u201d</p><p>We argue about the money until she stuffs it back into her jeans. \u201cWhat do we do? Do we tell the police?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI can\u2019t. Seth hurt him...he\u2019d lose everything.\u201d I swallowed hard. \u201cLast night is over. Let\u2019s never speak of it again and get ready for the fight.\u201d</p><p>Selena rushes from my lounge room and out to her car. She drags in the same suitcase she brought when we went clubbing. \u201cI\u2019ll do your make-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to overdo it tonight so I\u2019ll do my own.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me like I\u2019m crazy. \u201cYou are aware that we\u2019re going to a fight, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be recorded and plastered all over the internet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cSuit yourself, but I\u2019m going to look good.\u201d</p><p>I slide into a pair of black skinny jeans, pull on a white tank top and a cream sweater on top of that. I slither into a pair of small, white heels and as I\u2019m about to put my brush through my hair, there\u2019s a knock at the door. Selena sticks her head into the bathroom. Her hair is tied up in a ball of mess at the top of her head and half of her face is covered in make-up. I shrug my shoulders as I walk past her and I open the door. My eyes meet a familiar stop watch. It\u2019s Seth\u2019s coach\u2014Darryl. He\u2019s wearing a black t-shirt with the word \u2018coach\u2019 sewn into the breast of it and his pants are a strange khaki color.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I ask cautiously.</p><p>\u201cMiss James, here are your tickets for tonight. The venue is on the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe coach does personal errands?\u201d I question him, accepting the tickets.</p><p>He scoffs and his hands find his hips. \u201cYep. He better get a personal assistant when he makes it to pro because I didn\u2019t sign up for this.\u201d There\u2019s a smile on his lips as he speaks. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the fight.\u201d He turns from me and heads down the stairs. On the back of his shirt is Seth\u2019s last name in big white letters and I smile. How did I get so entangled in his world? Just last week I would\u2019ve claimed we\u2019re enemies.</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d Selena shouts from the room. I close the door and go into her. I flash the two tickets and she makes a high-pitched noise from her throat. \u201cI knew being friends with you would pay off one day.\u201d She winks at me and I stick my tongue out at her.</p><p>I place the tickets safely in my bedside table and I go back to the bathroom. I stare at my appearance. My hair is down and hangs by my breasts. It seems so... plain and lifeless. I need volume tonight. I grab my curling iron out of a drawer and I curl my hair. I didn\u2019t do it too crazy, just enough to give it some body and a little twist. I clip the front pieces of my hair back and apply minimal make-up. I step back to admire my work. I look simple. I look good and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going for.</p><p>Selena takes a little longer than I expected to get ready. We\u2019re meant to leave two hours before the fight to avoid the traffic and masses of people. Instead, we leave an hour before the fight. Luckily, there is no weigh in for tonight\u2019s amateur qualifier otherwise we\u2019d definitely miss it. I drive over the speed limit to get to the exhibition center as quickly as possible. Beside me, Selena slams back tiny bottles of wine. She claims to be really nervous, but I see the wide smile on her face and she can hardly keep her legs still. She\u2019s beyond excited and is mistaking the adrenaline coursing through her veins as nervousness. I\u2019m nervous. I feel sick and the steering wheel is damp from the sweat that seeps from my palms. Every inter-section I pass through I contemplate doing a u-turn and heading back home. I drive underneath the exhibition center and find a park just as someone else is backing out. I love when that happens!</p><p>I pull into the parking space and shut the car off. I take a little while to pull the keys out of the ignition.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, fights aren\u2019t that big of a deal. It\u2019s like sex\u2014it\u2019s between two consenting adults. It\u2019s animalistic and it\u2019s fun! Relax a little.\u201d</p><p>Fights aren\u2019t a big deal? Am I the only weirdo that finds it appalling? Selena falls over herself as she drags herself from my car, flashing me her white underwear.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be tipsy already?\u201d I laugh after her. \u201cYou only had two wine coolers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten today.\u201d She straightens her short, white dress and flicks her blonde curls over her shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>I suck in a huge breath of air and let it out. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m fine when we give our tickets to the girls in the short shorts and bikinis and I\u2019m fine when we enter the room Seth will be fighting in. It\u2019s huge\u2014almost like a stadium. When I was last here, it was for a book fair and it was flat and empty, filled with only tables and cheap books. Now, it has a temporary grandstand around the whole room, providing plenty of seating. The thunderous noise of laughter and chatter fills my ears and I can barely hear myself think. I feel the blood drain from my face when my gaze falls onto a roofless cage in the middle of the room\u2014it\u2019s circular and covered in ads and sponsor logos. Selena hooks her elbow through mine and drags me down the aisle to the front of the stand.</p><p>\u201cOlivia!\u201d I barely make out my dad\u2019s voice.</p><p>I turn my attention to the left and see his happy face and wide smile. He waves me over and we squeeze past a few men in suits. I recognize them from the training room at the gym. Behind me, I hear Selena giggle and say hi. As I draw nearer to Dad, he grabs my wrist and tugs me the rest of the way. He can barely contain his excitement. He\u2019s wearing a black T-shirt with \u2018SETH\u2019 written across the front and a pair of denim jeans tucked into a pair of brown work boots.</p><p>\u201cThis is the closest I\u2019ve ever been to an MMA ring.\u201d He shouts in my ear.</p><p>I glance up at the intimidating structure. This is where Seth will fight and I\u2019m right here. I\u2019m close enough to get blood and sweat on me and I don\u2019t like it. Not one bit.</p><p>Dad\u2019s thumb runs over the top of my hand. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? What\u2019d I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here and I know how much of a big deal fighting is for you.\u201d His thin lips curl into a warm smile. \u201cHe must be really special to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, Seth and I aren\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Someone taps my shoulder and I turn to see Darryl, Seth\u2019s coach. There\u2019s a crease carved into his forehead and his full, dark lips are pressed tightly together. \u201cSeth wants to see you.\u201d He calls over the chatter of the spectators. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I open my mouth to ask what for, but I don\u2019t bother. Seth\u2019s decisions don\u2019t usually come with understandable reasons.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d I shout to Dad and Selena.</p><p>She moves into my seat to keep him company as Darryl\u2019s hand wraps around my wrist and he guides me out of the stand, up the aisle and over to four security guards that I didn\u2019t even notice when I walked in.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s with Seth.\u201d Darryl says, flashing his \u2018backstage\u2019 pass. The guards part like the red sea to let us through. He pulls me through two big, white double doors and let\u2019s my arm go.</p><p>\u201cSeth is having a little bit of trouble...\u201d Darryl\u2019s voice bounces off the walls of the wide walkway. It\u2019s a lot quieter in here. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you know, but he suffers from mild anxiety. Normally, I give him a boxing bag and he works through it that way, but lately he seems to prefer another method.\u201d</p><p>Seth has anxiety? I never would have guessed that one. I mean, sometimes I notice he gets a little worked up, but it usually doesn\u2019t last long. Not like the one that I had when Blade first cheated on me. It was horrible. I couldn\u2019t breathe and my stomach rolled and twisted. I felt like vomiting everywhere and worst of all, it felt like it wasn\u2019t going to end and I was going to die.</p><p>The way Darryl looks at me says it all. \u201cMe? I\u2019m the other method?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d</p> <p>My pulse is beating in my ears as we pass lots of smaller closed off doors. Names in permanent marker are written on pieces of paper and stuck to the centre of the wood. Sonne. Jacobs. Russell. Smith. Donskov. Pine. Kennedy and then Marc.</p><p>The handle to Seth\u2019s door fits nicely into the palm of Darryl\u2019s hand as he turns it. The door opens and I step in. My gaze falls onto the ads for protein shakes and other supplements on the back wall. They had names I couldn\u2019t even pronounce. Eventually, I drag my eyes from the wall to Seth and something in my stomach flutters. He\u2019s sitting on the bench, topless and hard. His thigh muscles bulge out of the slits in his black shorts. My throat dries immediately and there\u2019s no moisture in my mouth I can swallow to fix it. There\u2019s no lack of moisture \u2018down there\u2019, however. Two men stand before Seth\u2014one is a chubby man with long white hair tied in a ponytail at the base of his neck and he\u2019s wrapping Seth\u2019s hands. The gauze envelops the palm, supports the wrist and runs between the fingers. The other man, with the spiky black hair and huge blue eyes is observing. Seth\u2019s eyes are hidden by his long lashes. His chest moves hard and deep, like he\u2019s trying to calm himself. His eyelids flick open and his dark, chocolate eyes rake me. I force my stiff legs to step closer. The two men assess the wrap and in low, hushed words they decide it\u2019s sufficient. The white haired man packs up his little toolbox, wishes Seth luck and they stroll from the room. Seth flexes his fingers and clenches them into fists in front of him.</p><p>\u201cLeave us alone.\u201d Seth\u2019s voice is soft, but loud enough for everyone to hear.</p><p>As they leave, my eyes remain on Seth and they have since I stepped into the room. His large frame slides off the table and he shakes his arms and rolls his head to each side. I try not to stare\u2014or drool\u2014at the muscles between his shoulders and his neck.</p><p>\u201cDarryl said you need me...\u201d My voice is quiet and uncertain. This whole situation has definitely put me out of my comfort zone. The crowds and the fighting... it\u2019s just not my kind of place.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d The way his tongue wrap around the words make the hair on the back of my neck stand up. It\u2019s intimate... it\u2019s so intimate and it makes me want to close my eyes. As he steps closer my heart forces its way into my throat and my lungs have diminished in size, making breathing harder. He looks intense and intimidating with his head angled down to me. There are no deep lines or noticeable frustration on his features, but his breathing is uneven.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you were going to come.\u201d</p><p>My clammy fingers find each other and I twist them together in a nervous fiddle. \u201cI said I\u2019d come so here I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarryl told you about me?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s referring to the \u2018mild\u2019 anxiety. Stiffness overcomes the back of my neck as I realize I might be intruding. I manage to nod. Seth closes his eyes and takes my hands in his. My hands feel small compared to his large, calloused ones. He wraps them around his neck and tilts his head up to the ceiling. His skin is warm, causing my blood to boil. His hands find my hips and his breathing slows. What are we doing? What is this exactly? He lowers his head and opens his eyes. They search mine and I know he\u2019s asking himself the same questions. I know I should step away now, but I\u2019m absolutely powerless against him. It\u2019s like as soon as he looks at me, or touches me I become wrapped up in some spell... and strangely, I want to be. \u2018If you get hurt, it\u2019s on you. Not me.\u2019 His words flow through my mind and I pull my hands away. His eyebrows knit together and I step back just as the door opens. Reluctantly, Seth drags his gaze away from me.</p><p>\u201cTime to warm up, pal.\u201d Darryl informs him. He closes the door and we\u2019re left alone again.</p><p>\u201cI should go...\u201d I turn away from him, feeling his eyes on the back of my head.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d He calls to me and I can hear his usual confident tone return.</p><p>I face him. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p> <p>Seth\u2019s lips jerk at the corners before curving into a full blown smile. All traces of the strangely intimate relationship we just shared\u2014gone\u2014replaced by his cocky demeanor. \u201cFor the ride of a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>I scoff at him and open the door.</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d I call over my shoulder.</p><p>I sink lower into my chair using one hand to shield my face and the other is clenching my stomach. In front of me two men are brawling. I hear fists slam into flesh and I hear the fighters gasp as wind is forced from their lungs. The salty smell of sweat and the copper scent of blood engulfs me. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can sit here. This is the third fight I\u2019ve sat through. Selena disappeared from her seat a while go in pursuit of a snack cart\u2014God knows how she can eat right now. My stomach is threatening to throw up the ham and cheese toasty I had for dinner. Adrenaline\u2014as well as fear\u2014tears through my veins every time I hear flesh connect with flesh. Around me, the crowd goes berserk, begging for more. The grandstand shakes beneath my feet and the crowd roars. Out of curiosity, I peek through my fingers. The referee with the full black outfit, thrusts the winner\u2019s hand in the air.</p><p>\u201cThe winner of this bout, ladies and gentlemen, Donnnn Russeeeeelllllll!\u201d</p><p>As the crowd screams, I look at the loser, although victim seems more fitting. He\u2019s out cold. His left eye is swollen shut and blood pours from his brow, irritating his eye further. Even being knocked out the disappointment is clear on his face. His eyes flutter open and he uneasily pulls himself to rest on his knees and the medical staff comes to check on him. A big cotton ball on a stick is pressed against the brow to stem the flow and I cringe as my ribcage squeezes my heart. Seth\u2019s fighting next...what if he ends up the one on the floor? The thought alone is enough to send my already frazzled nerves through the roof. This is bad. Next to me Dad is on his feet cheering and bouncing on his toes. My plastic chair vibrates as he stomps his feet.</p><p>\u201cSeth\u2019s up next.\u201d He beams at me.</p><p>The smile I give him feels fake. I wish I can be as excited as Dad... but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m scared. I watch the winner, Don Russell, give an interview. His bald head suits his strong, angular face and there's a shadow of stubble along his chiseled jaw line. He wipes the back of his hand across the light sheen of sweat that glistens on his forehead. The thick, black lines of his dragon tattoo wrap around his bulging bicep and they contract as he jabs his fists through the air in celebration. He annoys me and I have no idea why. Judging his appearance and the way he holds himself, I\u2019ll assume he\u2019s cocky and proud, but it\u2019s only to mask his own trauma\u2014like Seth. Maybe all fighters have a sad story that compels them to fight. A dark fabric covers my sight. I pull it off and look at Selena who sits in the seat next to me.</p><p>\u201cI got you something.\u201d She stuffs a hot dog into her mouth and a drop of tomato sauce spills over the edge and onto her white dress. She gapes at me wide eyed, like it was my fault. \u201cThis is white!\u201d She huffs. \u201cI\u2019m never going to get this out.\u201d</p><p>She hands me the hotdog and I hold it away for me. The last thing I want is to get it on my clean sweater. From her handbag, she produces another piece of black fabric\u2014and pulls it over her head. It\u2019s a t-shirt, a large one. It covers her entire dress and \u2018SETH\u2019 in big white letters is printed across the center. She takes her hotdog back. \u201cI got you one. They only had large.\u201d</p><p>I open the shirt in front of me and I can\u2019t pretend I don\u2019t love it.</p><p>\u201cPut it on.\u201d Dad says, encouraging me.</p><p>I throw it on over my sweater and the shirt pretty much swallows me. It\u2019s comfortable though and I feel less...erratic in it. A voice sounds through the speaker, making me jump slightly.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, tonight\u2019s final fight is about to commence.\u201d A shiver rolls down my spine. \u201cFighting out of the red corner is 2011 MMAC tournament\u2019s runner up, hailing from Seattle, Washington\u2014Seth Maaaaaaaarc!\u201d</p><p>On cue, the crowd launches themselves to their feet and my ears pound as their screams rip around the arena. I manage to keep myself in my seat, but it doesn\u2019t help with the electrical current flowing through me. My heart is racing, pumping blood way too fast. My head spins a little and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s fear or adrenaline. I can\u2019t see him, but through the speakers, I hear his song playing. I\u2019ve never heard it before... I close my eyes and try to listen to it over the noise.</p><p>I never feared death or dying</p><p>I only fear never trying</p><p>I am whatever I am,</p><p>Only God can judge me, now</p><p>One shot, everything rides on tonight</p><p>Even if I've got three strikes</p><p>I'mma go for it</p><p>This moment, we own it</p><p>And I'm not to be played with</p><p>Because it can get dangerous</p><p>See these people I ride with</p><p>This moment, we own it</p><p>I can feel a small smirk on my lips from his intro song. It\u2019s such a Seth kind of song. I open my eyes as Seth rounds the corner. All the warmth in my body seems to be moving south and I squeeze my thighs together as desire pools. His black hoodie covers the majority of his face, but I can just see his full lips protruding slightly due to his mouth guard. His hoodie lays open on his chest, exposing that delicious midsection and black gloves that don\u2019t cover the ends of his fingers adorn his hands. He flexes his fingers at his side and every time they clench so does my sex. Darryl and three others from Seth\u2019s team follow him right up to the door of the cage, but only Darryl steps inside with Seth. Seth yanks off his hoodie, exposing all of his flexing muscles and I notice the tattoo across his hip says; \u2018If you can make it through the night there\u2019s a brighter day\u2019.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>He hands his hoodie to Darryl. Darryl gets in Seth\u2019s face\u2014motivating him. He slaps Seth on the shoulder a few times before he leaves the ring. Seth bounces on his toes to keep himself warmed up. He ignores all of the shouts and cheers from the spectators and his gaze circles the center before landing on me. I feel heat climb into my cheeks and swell deep in my core. He sees my shirt and the corner of his lips tug upwards in a cocky smirk. He winks at me and all I can do is smile back. Muscle bulges from Seth\u2019s arm as he sticks it in the air. The crowd goes wild. High pitched squeals, manly roars and naughty comments hurl in his direction. He looks back at me and flicks his eyebrows like he just proved something. I roll my eyes. He wants me to see how many people want him. Even the promo girls circling the ring in their bikinis can\u2019t keep their eyes off him. And it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t figure that out for myself. I see the t-shits and the posters these people have brought to support him. They love him. He\u2019s pure male and he dominates the ring with his mere presence. His music cuts off and the announcer\u2019s voice floods the room. I don\u2019t take my eyes of Seth. His over-confident facade melts into a more serious look. His eyes darken and he draws himself to his full height. He\u2019s like a brick wall of sex and muscle.</p><p>\u201cIntroducing the final contestant for tonight, fighting across the cage in the blue corner is first time amateur contestant, fighting from his hometown right here in Portland, Maine\u2014Fredrick Kennneedddyyyyy!\u201d</p><p>On queue the crowd claps and cheers. It\u2019s loud, but not as loud as they were for Seth. I want to sink into my chair, but Selena\u2019s hand wraps around mine. Her knees are bouncing and she chews her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cYou nervous?\u201d I giggle at her.</p><p>\u201cA little bit...\u201d</p><p>Music plays in the background and I immediately recognize it as Raining Blood by Slayer. The song unnerves me, but not as much as Fredrick Kennedy himself. He storms down the aisle on the far side of the room, coming fast like a freight train. He\u2019s topless, wearing a similar pair of pants to Seth. His head is shaven and it glistens under the bright lights. I don\u2019t know how else to possibly describe this guy\u2014he\u2019s hard, probably brought up on the wrong side of the tracks and he has a very determined glint in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOw, don\u2019t squeeze so hard.\u201d Selena complains, pulling her hand from mine.</p><p>Fredrick goes to his corner, ignoring the crowd completely. He wants to win. Seth smiles lazily at him and rolls his shoulders back and forward. While the announcer rattles off all of the sponsors and directors, Seth kicks his feet against the padded pole and paces around. Darryl and the others stand up against the ring, their heads peering just over the top. Fredrick\u2019s team is doing the same. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd the referee in charge of the action,\u201d The announcer says. \u201cHarrison Logan.\u201d</p><p>The referee beckons for the two fighters to enter the center of the ring. My breathing deepens immediately and I\u2019m leaning forward in my chair. Seth and Fredrick stand only inches away from each other. Not once do they break eye contact. A microphone drops down from the roof and the referee speaks into it with his southern drawl.</p><p>\u201cOkay ya\u2019ll, I want a good clean fight. I won\u2019t tolerate anything less. Touch gloves, let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p> <p>The gloves never touch. The crowd falls silent as Seth and Fredrick stare at each other. There\u2019s too much tension and I have no idea where it\u2019s coming from.</p><p>\u201cI said touch gloves.\u201d The referee repeats.</p><p>I hear a unanimous exhale come from the crowd as they touch gloves and go back to their corner. A loud \u2018ding\u2019 noise rings around the arena, penetrating my chest and forcing my heart to stop. I\u2019m petrified. Excited. Sick... I don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t watch, but at the same time I can\u2019t drag my eyes away as Seth and Fredrick circle each other. My hands are up and covering the bottom half of my face as Fredrick dives at Seth\u2019s legs. Seth manages to dodge it and gives the guy time to scamper to his feet. Before Fredrick realizes what\u2019s happening Seth delivers two jabs to his face. Fredrick brings his guard up, blocking the incoming fists. Seth drops lower, slamming his fists hard into the guys\u2019 ribs. The crowd goes crazy. They\u2019re jumping out of their chairs\u2014standing on them\u2014they\u2019re doing whatever they can to get closer to the fight. Even Selena is on her feet, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m the only one that can\u2019t get out of her seat to cheer Seth on.</p><p>Fredrick recovers and dives at Seth again, this time he takes him down. I see him try to wrap himself around Seth, but Seth fights him off and delivers hard elbows to his face. Blood stains Seth\u2019s pointed elbow and I cover my eyes. I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t watch. Beside me, Dad is yelling out technical mumble jumble that Seth can\u2019t hear and Selena is... being Selena. \u201cYeah! Fuck his shit up! Whoooooooo!\u201d She screams.</p><p>My heart is beating so loud I can hear every thump drumming in my head with a deafening rhythm. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening and I\u2019m too scared to take a peek. Dad taps my shoulder and I peer up at him. He points toward the ring and reluctantly I look over. Seth is leaning against the cage, looking directly at me and panting like he\u2019s run a mile. Fredrick is being checked over by the medics. His eyebrow is cut pretty badly and it\u2019s bleeding into his eye.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re deliberating if he can continue the fight.\u201d Dad informs me.</p><p>I drag my gaze back to Seth. He\u2019s covered in blood and sweat. He points at me and then at his eyes and then at his chest. He wants me to watch him... I shake my head. I can\u2019t. It\u2019s too much. He does the gestures again. And again.</p><p>\u201cJust watch, O. No one is going to die.\u201d Selena laughs in my ear.</p><p>I glance around and there are hundreds of eyes on me. Some regard me like a weirdo and God knows I feel like one. I can only imagine how stupid I look. Who comes to watch a fight when they can\u2019t stomach it? Me, that\u2019s who. I let a slow exhale out of my nose and I nod, swallowing the bile that creeps up my throat. I pray that the medics won\u2019t let Fredrick fight, but when they lather more Vaseline across his brow and he climbs to his feet. I know that isn\u2019t going to be the case.</p><p>The fighters take their position on their side of the ring and the bell sounds again. I grasp the edges of my seat and squeeze it tightly. Please let this be over quickly. Seth wastes no time attacking Fredrick and with one hard punch to the jaw, Fredrick\u2019s body goes rigid and he falls backwards. Seth jumps at Fredrick, but the referee cuts him off.</p><p>That\u2019s it.</p> <p>The fight is over.</p><p>\u201cLadies and Gentleman,\u201d The announcer calls excitedly. \u201cThe winner of the final bout tonight is Seth Maaaaaaaarc!\u201d</p><p>The mass of people scream and grab each other. I\u2019m surrounded by singing and laughing and crying. Instead of celebrating, I stare wide-eyed. I witnessed my first knock-out and it\u2019s... sad, but at the same time it\u2019s exhilarating. My entire body is vibrating and I\u2019m panting like I fought the guy myself. I\u2019m so aroused\u2014impossibly aroused. I\u2019ve never felt anything like it and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to me. Dad pulls me to my feet and wraps his arms around me. My spine aches as he squeezes and tips me from side to side. His thin lips place two kisses on my forehead and he lets me go, turning his attention back to Seth. A camera crew runs into the ring and interviews Seth. He\u2019s smiling and laughing. He\u2019s bouncing and talking and every now and then his gaze would drift to me briefly before returning to the interviewer. He shrugs on his hoodie and walks from the ring. As he passes us he flicks his head in the direction of his room and Dad wastes no time in pulling me and Selena from our seats and dragging us all the way to Seth\u2019s room. When we enter, everyone is going nuts, clapping and cheering and dancing\u2014except Seth. He\u2019s sitting on his bench, looking as calm as ever and unwrapping his hands. Someone from Seth\u2019s team immediately engages Selena in a conversation and Dad talks to Darryl. I lean against the wall and watch him gush over the fight. I can\u2019t help but smile as he uses his hands to mimic the fighter\u2019s movements.</p><p>Seth slides off his bench and approaches me. My skin grows hotter the closer he gets to me. His eyes are bright, taking on a more caramel than chocolate color. The corners of his lips curl into a cheeky smirk as he glances down at me.</p><p>\u201cI like your shirt.\u201d He tugs at the front of it and my breath hitches as he pulls me a little closer. \u201cI look good on you.\u201d</p><p>I feel my own smile form. \u201cYou could have.\u201d I say, reminding him of the night he told me no.</p><p>He laughs once and his eyes flare with amusement as I pull my shirt back and step away from him before my dad sees us or I get blood on me.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy the fight?\u201d His tongue runs across his bottom lip to moisten it and I find myself staring at it. He knows it too because now he\u2019s trying not to smile at me.</p> <p>I clear my throat and force my eyes back to his. \u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone can enjoy a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying. I saw how excited you were when I knocked him out.\u201d</p><p>I touch my hand to my cheeks, my face feels like its burning. Had I enjoyed seeing a man being knocked out? No. Had I enjoyed seeing Seth completely dominate him and win? Yes. I enjoyed seeing Seth happy. He leans in close and I can feel his body heat waft onto me. My entire body tightens and stands to attention. \u201cIt\u2019ll be our little secret.\u201d</p><p>His hand wraps around mine and he brings my knuckles to his lips. He kisses each one softly and our eyes remain locked. Jesus. Christ.</p><p>\u201cThat fight was for you, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>For me... What does that mean? Why does he have to be so cryptic? So hot and then cold? I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to say to that... so I nod my head.</p><p>Darryl slings his arm around Seth\u2019s shoulder and I pull my hand back. My fingers tingle at the coolness outside his grasp. \u201cWhat do you think, Seth? Shall we go celebrate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbso-fucking-lutely.\u201d He replies. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d</p><p>I stand there for a few seconds then I realize his question was directed at me. \u201cOh, me? Right. No, sorry. I\u2019ve had enough excitement for one day.\u201d</p><p>Seth frowns. On him, even something so bitter is beautiful.</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d Darryl shrugs. \u201cYour dad is coming.\u201d</p><p>Of course he is. He\u2019d never pass up the opportunity to party with a fighter. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s on his bucket list. Darryl saunters away, leaving me alone with Seth again.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the fight...\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019ll see you around.\u201d</p><p>I step away from him and over to Selena. \u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I go out with them?\u201d She pouts.</p><p>\u201cYou drank before we got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019m sober now. That hot dog helped.\u201d She smiles sideways at the guy she\u2019s talking to and I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s one of Seth\u2019s friends from the steakhouse\u2014the one wearing the red cap. He\u2019s handsome and tall. He has piercing green eyes and nice olive skin. Tattoos cover the exposed flesh around his neck and down his forearms.</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself, but I\u2019m not picking you up at some ungodly hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure she gets home safely.\u201d Seth promises from behind me.</p><p>I turn to him. \u201cThank you.\u201d I call over the ruckus. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at dinner, Dad.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a thumbs up and I turn from the room. In the hallway fighters and their teams are laughing and partying, others sit in their rooms, licking their wounds. There are so many loose girls scattered all over the place and I\u2019m sure the promo girls that just passed me are heading to Seth\u2019s room. I don\u2019t have time to look over my shoulder as I\u2019m startled by a large body that slides in front of me, blocking my way.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d I look up his hard body and onto his face. I recognize him as Don Russell and I can\u2019t help but frown.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice shirt, but I\u2019d look so much better on you.\u201d</p><p>I will never wear a shirt with a name on it again. He hands me another shirt. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Without looking I know it has \u2018Don\u2019 written on it and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m taking it. \u201cNo, thank you. One is enough.\u201d</p><p>His lips contort into a strange smirk and I try to step past him, but he blocks me. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like the kind of girl that Seth Marc usually goes for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t look like someone who has any right sticking their nose into other people\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>He tugs on my shirt, pulling me closer to him. What the hell is up with fighters and pulling people closer to them? Do they all attend some class on invading personal space before they learn any kind of martial arts? After the events with Brent, the thought of a stranger touching me puts me on high alert.</p><p>\u201cTake your hands off me.\u201d My voice comes out in a growl, although I never intended it to.</p><p>\u201cFeisty... I like feisty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>He lets my shirt go and I take a step backward.</p><p>\u201cAre you his?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis?\u201d</p><p>He nods, his eyes are like two big emerald orbs, blaring down his nose at me. Not I\u2019m not... am I?</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Seth\u2019s voice answers the question for me. \u201cShe\u2019s here with a friend. Let her go home, Don.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if she\u2019s not yours...\u201d Don steps closer to me and I manage to dodge past him.</p><p>I glance back at Seth whose hard stare is focused on Don\u2019s face. I push through the throng of people as fast as I can. Once I get through the double doors and past the four security guards, I can breathe a little better, but I can\u2019t shake how strangely hurt I am by what Seth said. I know I\u2019m not his, but he does these things that make me think that maybe he\u2019s changing his mind. I sigh, maybe he\u2019s just playing his little games with me and I\u2019m just delusional. It\u2019s plausible.</p><p>As quickly as I can, I leave the exhibition center and find my car. Getting out is a freaking mission. There are too many cars and the roads are congested. I want to go home and straight to sleep before my brain can torture me with anymore thoughts, but as I drive I can only think of him... and it sucks.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>It\u2019s one a.m. and I\u2019m still awake\u2014still wired from the fight. If I\u2019m telling the truth, that\u2019s not the only reason I\u2019m lying awake. Seth Marc and his flirty, over-confident and heart-breaking attitude is also a factor.</p><p>I throw the blankets off and lean over the edge of my bed. In the dark, my hands rub the carpet as I search for my laptop. I always type in bed, so my laptop lives underneath it. When I locate it, I pull it up and turn it on. I can\u2019t help but to smile when I see my wallpaper. It\u2019s a picture of Blade and I at the zoo. We\u2019re standing side by side and we\u2019re happy. I mean, we don\u2019t look happy because the massive snake we\u2019re holding is trying to wrap itself around our necks, but we were. My chest constricts. We haven\u2019t been broken up for long, but the time we spent together feels like a lifetime ago. My eyes water at the realization that it\u2019s over. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t react earlier. I just felt like it wasn\u2019t real and that we\u2019d be back together by now... but even I\u2019m not that stupid. I open a Word document titled: \u2018Complicated\u2019. It\u2019s a romance short story that I started at the beginning of the year. I\u2019m meant to end it, but I can\u2019t find the words to describe the main character\u2019s happy ending. How do you write about something you don\u2019t really know? I\u2019ve read a lot of romance books and watched a lot of romance movies, but I could never produce anything like that. I feel like whatever I write people are going to see through\u2014assuming I ever show it to anyone.</p><p>My heart leaps into my throat as a firm knock sounds upon my door. I wait cautiously in the light provided only by my laptop. There\u2019s another knock and this time it drags me from my bed. I tip-toe into the lounge room and peer through the sheer curtains to get a better look outside. The sensor light flicks on and I see Selena hunched over at the bottom of the steps. I can barely make out the sound of her humming. I rush to the door and pull it open, only to stare into a pair of brown eyes. Immediately, my heartbeat kicks up a notch. He looks so good in a white button shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows and loose denim jeans. He doesn\u2019t appear to be under the influence\u2014his skin is clean and not clammy and his eyes are round and alert. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI brought Selena home.\u201d He says. \u201cShe\u2019s had a lot to drink.\u201d</p><p>I peer around him and Selena makes her drunken way up the stairs. Her high heels are in her hand and her handbag hangs off her elbow. Her curls are everywhere and her make-up is smudged over her lips and around her eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe always has a lot to drink.\u201d I reply, waiting for Selena to make it to the top. When she does, I take her by the hand and pull her into the house. Her voice is rough and husky. She\u2019s mumbling something, but I can\u2019t understand it.</p><p>The pungent smell of cigarette and alcohol fills my nose and I scrunch my nose up. I take her shoes and her handbag and help her lie down on the couch. Seth kicks off his white sneakers and makes his way through my lounge room. Then, he turns down the short hallway towards my room.</p> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d I call out to him in a hushed tone. \u201cWhere are you going? Seth!\u201d</p><p>Quickly, I pull the blue, fluffy throw rug off the back of the couch and cover the already sleeping Selena. I march into my room and Seth is lying on my bed looking at the wallpaper on my computer.</p><p>\u201cMake yourself at home.\u201d I say, closing the lid and sliding it underneath my bed. In the darkness I search for the switch to my lamp. When I find it, I flick it on and turn back to him.</p><p>He rolls onto his back and puts his hands behind his head, exposing the bottom of his \u2018V\u2019 shape. I stand before him with my hands on my hips and the look he has in his eyes both exhilarates and terrifies me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a cute nighty.\u201d</p> <p>I glance down at my light green and pink babydoll. Thankfully, I wore one that isn\u2019t see-through and it covers my bum. \u201cThanks. How\u2019d you get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe caught a taxi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t touch a drop. I let your dad take my car home. He didn\u2019t drink either, but we made him leave his car at the exhibition center.\u201d</p><p>Seth sits up and shuffles toward me until he\u2019s sitting at the base of my bed, directly in front of me and only inches away.</p><p>\u201cDid you and Selena...?\u201d</p> <p>He looks up at me from under his long, dark eyelashes. \u201cWhat, have sex?\u201d</p><p>He knows that\u2019s what I mean, but he wants me to say it. It doesn\u2019t matter if they did, right? Because Seth and I aren\u2019t anything... I\u2019m not even sure if we\u2019re friends.</p><p>\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Relief fills my chest and I can\u2019t help the smile that tugs at the corners of my lips.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your friend and a little too... much, for me. Besides, she was with Jackson all night.\u201d</p><p>I assume Jackson is the friend she was talking to when I left tonight.</p><p>\u201cBut I did look after her for you.\u201d His fingertips brush over my knee cap and then up my thigh. Beneath his touch, my muscles tremble with need. \u201cJackson wanted to take her home, but I didn\u2019t let him. She was too drunk so I brought her here.\u201d</p><p>His head rests against my stomach and I run my fingers through his hair.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone went home with their whores and all I could think about was you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean it like that and you know it.\u201d</p><p>The rough pads of his finger tips rub my naked legs and I tilt my head back to enjoy it. It\u2019s hard to believe these hands brutally dominated another man earlier tonight. The same hands that strike hard and fast against flesh are now gently caressing my skin. I gasp as he yanks me onto him so my legs fall to each side of his thighs. His length presses hard against his jeans and into my core. My breath quickens, but I try my hardest to conceal it. His lust filled eyes bore into mine and I\u2019m completely undone. If he touches me, he\u2019ll find me soaked and ready, but I don\u2019t want him to touch me there... because he\u2019s right. I can\u2019t separate my emotions from sex and I\u2019ve developed feelings for him. Strange, confusing feelings. A dry lump forms in my throat and I swallow hard as his forehead rests against mine. His lips are agape slightly and his warm breath caresses my face as his hands rub my thighs. A shiver runs down my spine and Seth smiles that confident smile that I like so much.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing, Seth?\u201d I utter.</p><p>\u201cI can think of a lot of answers to that question.\u201d</p><p>I slide off him and sit on the bed. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I want him to say. I don\u2019t expect some huge romantic gesture or for him to declare his feelings for me. I just want honesty. I want respect.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Olivia.\u201d He states, falling backwards against the mattress. I follow his lead and lie next to him. His large hands brush over his face and he exhales. Perhaps, it\u2019s too late in the night for this conversation now, or maybe it was too early in our \u2018relationship\u2019. I have work in the morning and I can\u2019t afford to lose much more sleep. I tug on his arm and lift myself off the bed to shut off the lamp. We crawl to the top of the bed and I climb under the sheets. Seth unbuttons his shirt and slides it off. I hate that the room is dark and I can\u2019t admire him. I hear his denim jeans crumple to the floor and my insides squeal like a horny teenager. In my head, I remind myself over and over that I won\u2019t be having sex with Seth tonight. I\u2019ve already let him under my skin... I can\u2019t give him the rest of me because I\u2019m scared of what he\u2019ll do when he has it. His thick, warm arms wrap around me, pulling me closer to him. My back presses firmly against the front of his body and I\u2019m having trouble keeping my head clear. It feels so good. I imagine him softly stroking my sensitive parts from behind as he breathes in my ear.</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d His voice startles me back to reality.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for helping me tonight with the whole anxiety thing...\u201d I can hear his vulnerability in his voice and I want to turn around and hold him... but I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Does it get worse?\u201d</p><p>The pillow moves as he nods. \u201cMuch worse. What I experience before fights is nothing.\u201d His thumb brushes over my wrist, sending tingles through my hand like I\u2019ve banged my nerve on a hard surface. \u201cSometimes it gets really bad and I can\u2019t breathe, at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t take medication for it?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cHave you tried other things\u2014other than medication like talking to someone? Whether it be a friend or a professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be happy that I\u2019m here talking to you about it. Usually, I punch and fuck the anxiety from my system. You are the only person who I\u2019ve opened up to, even if it is just a crack. We don\u2019t owe each other anything, so why not appreciate it instead of pushing for more. What do you expect from me?\u201d</p><p>His words hit me like a ton of bricks and I feel like crying. I find myself asking the same questions over and over. Why is he here? Why isn\u2019t he out there banging girls and punching things? I pull away from his grasp and sit up. \u201cI don\u2019t expect anything from you, Seth. You\u2019re not mine and you\u2019ve already made it clear that I\u2019m not yours even though this is the second time you\u2019ve slept in my bed. You\u2019re always on me\u2014always doing nice things, but then you destroy it with harsh words. I don\u2019t want this. I don\u2019t want to wait around trying to decipher what game you\u2019re playing with me.\u201d</p><p>Seth grabs at me and I try to slip away, but he leans forward, grabbing my thigh and my arm and pulling me back into him. My chest is flush against his and the scent that emanates from him is intoxicating. He wraps a leg around both of mine, pinning me to his hard body. His lips graze against mine and my breathing slows. \u201cI need you, Olivia.\u201d His hands brush through my hair and then over my shoulder. My skin tingles and I press myself harder against him. \u201cI can\u2019t stand to be away from you. I do nice things and say dumb shit because I\u2019m scared. I thought I was going to hurt you, but tonight when you left and the promo girls that usually keep me company after a fight came into my room, I realized I could never hurt you, not like that.\u201d His lips kiss mine softly. \u201cI want you to be mine, but I\u2019m not ready. I\u2019m still getting used to the idea of spending the night with a girl without sex.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, in spite of the sudden wet tears on my cheek. \u201cYou are a very confusing man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it gets worse.\u201d</p><p>I kiss him\u2014desperately and he\u2019s shocked, I can feel the lack of response in his lips, but it doesn\u2019t take long for his strong arms crush me to him and his tongue runs across my bottom lip. I open my mouth and his full lips consume me. He rolls his large frame in my direction and holds himself above me. His thigh presses against the warmth between my legs and I gasp. He\u2019s so calm and collected, whereas I\u2019m panting and squirming. I\u2019m so wound up, so horny and I just want a release.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t have sex with you.\u201d He mutters against my mouth.</p><p>I run my hands down his sides and into his cotton boxers. I keep my cool and try not to make a big deal of the size of his penis. No wonder girls beg him for more. I\u2019ve only touched one other penis in my life and that was Blade\u2019s. His doesn\u2019t compare to the monster that I hold in my hand right now. I slide my hand up his shaft and his muscles tremble as I graze my fingertip over the tip of his thick erection. Above me, he shudders and it\u2019s so sexy. Having any kind of power over this beast of a man is all the foreplay I need. \u201cYou want to though.\u201d I tease.</p><p>He moves backwards, and my hand falls from his pants. \u201cYou have no fucking idea.\u201d He growls.</p><p>Seth presses his full weight onto me and claims my mouth with his tongue. When he pulls away, I\u2019m breathless and ready for anything.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good girl and I want you to be sure that this is what you want because I\u2019m not guaranteeing anything. Not until I\u2019m ready.\u201d His voice is sinfully dark in my ear and when his hot breath comes into contact with my skin, electric currents ripple through me.</p><p>I run my tongue along his smooth, clean neck and nibble his ear lobe. \u201cThis is what I want...but maybe not right now.\u201d</p><p>What the hell am I even saying? I want it now! I want it bad, but I\u2019m not ready to lose his companionship. What if we do this and he decides not to hang around anymore? I\u2019ve seen the way he treats girls... I don\u2019t want to be one of them. He says he wants to make me his and I want nothing more than to believe him, but I can\u2019t put my trust in him. Not yet.</p><p>Seth rolls off me, pulling me into his side. I like it here. I like being tucked under his arm and comforted by his warmth, but it won\u2019t be like this forever.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Olivia.\u201d He mumbles, squeezing my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>I curl tighter into his side. I hope in the next few weeks I can decide what the hell I\u2019m going to do about him. It\u2019s just a bit off fun. Is it though? I ask myself. I can\u2019t help but to feel like it has gone way past the point of fun. Fun would have been sleeping together the night he brought me home from the club. Spending nights sex free together seems more serious than fun. I expel a quiet exhale from my lips and ask myself the same question I always ask myself in Seth\u2019s presence. What am I doing?</p><p>My eyes flutter open and take a while to adjust to the bright sunlight that seeps through the gap in my curtain. I close my eyes and roll over. I extend my arm to the other side of the bed, but my skin only meets the cool mattress. I sit up and rub sleep from my heavy eyes. On the pillow is a letter with my name on it in pink highlighter. Seth\u2019s handwriting is horrible and he spelt my name wrong the first time and scribbled it out. He got it on his second go, though. On the bedside table is an open empty notebook with a page ripped out.</p><p>I open it and can\u2019t help the goofy smile that spreads over my face. The entire letter is written in pink highlighter. Poor guy, I guess he couldn\u2019t find a pen.</p><p>O,</p><p>Gone to training.</p><p>Text you later.</p><p>Seth :)</p><p>My heart flutters at the nickname \u2018O\u2019. I\u2019m so glad he picked that one over \u2018Olly\u2019. I slide out of the bed and put the note in my bedside drawer. I glance at my clock. It\u2019s only seven a.m. I still have an hour and a half before I need to be at work. I hate working on Saturday\u2019s. Thank God today is my last working day until Tuesday. I pull my silk dressing gown off the hook behind my door and slide into it. In the lounge room, Selena is still asleep on the couch. Her face is screwed up in a sour pout and I laugh as I make my way into the kitchen. One of her eyes open and it\u2019s bloodshot and puffy.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d She moans, trying to sit up. About halfway, she gives up and lies back down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re at my house. Seth brought you back last night.\u201d</p><p>Selena slings an arm over her eyes, shielding out the morning light. Man, I did not envy her right now. \u201cI don\u2019t remember anything after we got to Heaven\u2019s and Jackson ordered a round of shots for everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou party too hard.\u201d I tell her, putting the kettle on. I pull a jar of instant coffee from my cupboard. I always keep some here. Whenever Selena goes on a serious one-night bender she demands coffee the next morning. If she doesn\u2019t have it, she doesn\u2019t function and when she doesn\u2019t function, it\u2019s the end of the world. Everything is a nuisance to her.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d I offer as the kettle bubbles to a boil.</p><p>\u201cGood God, yes.\u201d</p><p>She rolls off the couch and drags her sorry self into the kitchen. She pulls the milk from the fridge and hands it to me. Her hands shake as she makes her way to the bowl on the kitchen bench. It\u2019s where I keep all of my medical stuff like band-aids, Betadine and Advil. Selena pops two pain-killers from their foil and throws them into her mouth. She hunches over the sink and gluttonously gobbles water directly from the faucet. When she straightens herself and turns to me, I can\u2019t help the burst of laughter that comes from my mouth as I stir the milk into her coffee. She looks like shit. Her make-up is splotchy and runny and her eyes are heavy. Her usual tame, blonde curls are wrapped up in a big knotty mess and there\u2019s a large hickey on her neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo... Jackson, huh?\u201d I hint, handing her coffee.</p><p>I turn around and pull a breakfast bar from the cupboard and unwrap it. She greedily drinks back the coffee.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t make this hot enough.\u201d She complains.</p> <p>\u201cDeal.\u201d I shrug at her. I don\u2019t make coffees often. \u201cAnd don\u2019t change the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackson is a sweetheart.\u201d She states, avoiding eye contact.</p><p>I overtly narrow my gaze to the purple love bite on her neck and stare at it until she comments.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say he was a saint.\u201d She chuckles. \u201cHe\u2019s different to the other guys I go for. We\u2019re going out to dinner sometime soon to get to know each other better before we... you know.\u201d</p><p>I almost choke on my granola breakfast bar. \u201cJesus, Selena is taking the time out to get to know a guy before sleeping with him. I never thought I\u2019d see the day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up. We don\u2019t all live on a narrow path, you know. Some of us like to explore the surroundings.\u201d</p><p>I smile at her. Pulling her strings while she has a hangover is a favorite hobby of mine.</p><p>\u201cI have work soon, so I\u2019m going to shower and get ready. Do you need me to drop you home?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll probably chill here until you get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but don\u2019t go through my closet again. I don\u2019t need new clothes. I like the ones I have.\u201d</p><p>I stroll from the kitchen and hit the shower. I spend extra time in there just thinking... about Seth mostly. I want you to be mine and I plan on making you mine, but right now I\u2019m not ready. So he has feelings for me, too? I\u2019d say so. A giddy feeling rises in my chest and I can\u2019t stop smiling. I can see Selena\u2019s blurry head poke through the bathroom door. Somehow, the cool air made its way into the shower, sending a cold shiver down my spine. \u201cOlivia?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome in and close the door.\u201d</p><p>She comes in, closes the door and slides down the wall. Her toes press against the glass of the shower. \u201cHave you and Seth had sex yet?\u201d</p><p>I frown and strain my ears to hear her over the pouring water. \u201cNo.\u201d I answer curiously. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I know you recently broke up with Blade and you\u2019re having fun and all that, but I think Seth is the last person you should be spending time with.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m taken back by her words. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m remembering snippets of last night...\u201d</p><p>He words send tendrils of dread through my chest. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis girl came up to him. She claimed they slept together a few weeks ago\u2014which he didn\u2019t deny\u2014and she was really trying to get back in, but he turned her down cold.\u201d</p> <p>I soap up my pink exfoliation sponge and begin cleaning my breasts and armpits, listening to every word she says.</p><p>\u201cIt was brutal, O. The girl left the club crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Little did she know, I\u2019ve witnessed two girls come for Seth at the gym. I\u2019d left too early to see what happened with the brunette, but the blonde left the gym crying. Seth said he doesn\u2019t want to hurt me like that and I believe him. I don\u2019t trust him, but I believe him. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry, Sel. I know what kind of person Seth is and we have a mutual understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to see him toss you aside like rubbish if you do decide you want to sleep with him, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Selena, but I think I have it covered.\u201d</p><p>She climbs lazily to her feet and exits the bathroom. I finish rubbing the rough sponge over my body, unable to shake her words from my mind. It shouldn\u2019t bother me because I already know what Seth is like, but what if she\u2019s right. What if he doesn\u2019t want me after we have sex? It doesn\u2019t matter, I hold all the power. I refuse to have sex with him until I\u2019m sure it\u2019s exactly what I want\u2014if he is exactly what I want.</p><p>My car makes a strange clunking noise when I turn the key. It\u2019s like the engine wants to turn over, but can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I shout, banging my head against the hard steering wheel. \u201cHow the hell am I supposed to get to work now?\u201d</p><p>A white sedan pulls up in front of my house and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a gift from God or the Devil himself as Blade steps out of the car and adjusts the collar on his green polo shirt. He spots me in my car and smiles, flashing me those boyish dimples. I can\u2019t help but smile back as I exit my car.</p><p>\u201cYou look good.\u201d</p><p>I look down at my deep violet dress. It\u2019s one of my favorites.</p><p>\u201cAre you about to go to work?\u201d</p><p>I slam my car door and lean against it. \u201cI was, but my car won\u2019t turn on.\u201d</p><p>His sneakers scuff the concrete as he walks closer to me. \u201cI can take you, if you want.\u201d</p><p>I chew my bottom lip. I don\u2019t know if riding with Blade is a good idea, but\u2014I glance around me\u2014I don\u2019t think I have a choice right now. I\u2019ve done too much shit to Mason in the last two weeks and I can\u2019t afford to not show up on time. \u201cUm...\u201d I ponder the idea of driving with Blade. \u201cYou\u2019ll take me straight to work, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>I slide my phone into the pocket of my dress and step toward him. \u201cFine, but we have to leave now if I\u2019m going to get there on time.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s like routine. Blade and I get into his car and I even put the handbrake down for him, like I always did. He notices too and smiles at me. It\u2019s such a sweet smile and my heart tightens in my chest. I had no idea how much I missed Blade. His familiar scent fills my nostrils and I inhale. This is a stupid idea. He\u2019s still Blade. I tell myself. He hurt you.</p><p>\u201cYour mom tells me you went to a fight last night.\u201d He says, making small talk. I hate that him and my mom are talking. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty big thing for you. Seth must be a good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d I reply automatically.</p><p>I watch my fingers as I rub them together nervously. Then, Blade\u2019s hand covers mine. \u201cI miss you, Olly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlade...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hear me out. We were together for six years, Olly, six years. That\u2019s a long time.\u201d</p><p>I pull my hands out from under his, but he leaves his in my lap. \u201cAnd you it threw out the window for sex\u2014lots of sex. What you did isn\u2019t something that can be forgotten or forgiven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I fucked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that after the first time... and the second and the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay so I\u2019ve messed up a bunch of times, but believe me when I say that I\u2019ve changed and it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>How many times have I heard that? Countless. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>He takes his hand back and runs it through his blond hair. \u201cHow can I prove it to you? How can I make it up to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no going back, Blade. I gave everything to you and you chose to take it for granted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d Six years\u2014gone, just like that?\u201d</p><p>My chest constricts, pushing a massive lump into my throat. \u201cYes.\u201d I cringe at the finality in my voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to stop, Olly. I need you.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes briefly, trying to slow my rapid beating heart. \u201cI meant it when I said I don\u2019t love you anymore.\u201d I say when I open my eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd I call bullshit. I know you\u2019re just trying to scare me straight and it\u2019s working, but I love you... I won\u2019t ever stop loving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019m with Seth now.\u201d I reply, playing the Seth card again. \u201cHe\u2019s yet to do anything to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d I jerk my gaze toward him. His grave tone makes me nauseous. \u201cI ran into him and Selena at Heaven\u2019s last night. He had his tongue so far down this brunette girl\u2019s throat I\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t gag, and you know how talkative Selena is when she\u2019s drunk. She told me how much she hates me and that you\u2019re not really with Seth.\u201d</p><p>He rattles off all of the shit Selena told him\u2014the roofie, the car park with Brent, Seth and that he hired my dad. I stare at the center console listening to his every word. I\u2019m not shocked that Selena told him, that\u2019s expected. She tends to run her mouth... a lot. I\u2019m a little shocked that Seth would kiss the brunette girl. I frown, unsure if I should believe Blade or not. He isn\u2019t exactly known for his honesty. Selena told me the brunette showed up, but she never mentioned anything about a kiss. She would\u2019ve told me if she saw it... I know she would have. My only option is to confront Seth, but even then, do I have the right to? He stated clearly last night that he isn\u2019t ready for a relationship and that\u2019s fine because I\u2019m not sure if I am, either. He said he wouldn\u2019t hurt me... and I believe him. I think. In front of Blade I try to play it off as no big deal. I don\u2019t want him to see that he\u2019s upset me.</p><p>\u201cYou caught me. So I\u2019m not dating Seth. I made it up to get you off my back until I clear my head and since Seth and I aren\u2019t really together, he can stick his tongue in whoever he wants.\u201d</p><p>Ahead, I see the sign for my work and I unclip my seat belt.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to upset you. I just wanted you to know that he\u2019s just like me... and you deserve better.\u201d</p><p>My frustration peaks. His only mission this morning was to \u2018break\u2019 my heart. \u201cGo spin your bullshit somewhere else, Blade. I\u2019m not dumb. I bet you couldn\u2019t wait to bring me the news that Seth made out with another girl last night. You\u2019re up early, when are you ever up early?\u201d In the last six years, Blade has never got out of bed before nine. It hurts to know that the only motivation he had to get out of bed early was to hurt my feelings.</p><p>I climb out of the car as he calls my name. I slam the door and my short heels clack rapidly against the concrete. When my hand comes into contact with the cool metal door of the office, he drives off. Inside, there are no patients (expected for a Saturday) and Mason\u2019s head peers around his office door. His big, wide smile fades when he sees my expression. I guess I don\u2019t look happy.</p><p>\u201cRough morning?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t make eye contact with him as I power up my computer. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d I reply.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here if you do.\u201d</p><p>He disappears back into his office and I place my head in my hands before raking my fingers through my long, soft hair. What the hell am I going to do? I don\u2019t feel comfortable bringing this up with Seth. I pull my phone out of my pocket and scroll down to Seth\u2019s name. My thumb hovers above the \u2018call\u2019 button, but I can\u2019t bring myself to press it. This entire situation could have been averted if Seth slept with me when I wanted and then left me alone. Instead, we burrowed our way under each other\u2019s skin... and feelings have been developed. Those same feelings are currently hurt because Seth kissed someone else. I shake my head. I don\u2019t know that for a fact. Blade plays dirty and he\u2019s jealous. If I make assumptions and Blade lied, I\u2019ll look like an idiot. My phone vibrates in my hands and Seth\u2019s name comes up on my screen.</p><p>FROM: SETH. TIME: 8:37 A.M.</p><p>Lunch?</p><p>TO: SETH. TIME: 8:38 A.M.</p><p>Can\u2019t. Car won\u2019t start</p><p>And I\u2019m at work.</p><p>FROM: SETH TIME: 8:38 A.M.</p><p>When is your break?</p><p>I\u2019m coming to get you.</p><p>We\u2019re going to lunch.</p><p>I feel like such a sucker when a smile pulls at my lips.</p><p>TO: SETH TIME: 8:39 A.M.</p><p>Break is at 11.</p><p>See you then.</p><p>Before I return my phone to my pocket it vibrates again.</p><p>FROM: SETH TIME: 8:39 A.M</p><p>Can\u2019t wait. :)</p><p>Can\u2019t wait... He can\u2019t wait to see me. I feel all giddy and excited which in turn makes me feel stupid. Seth affects me. In seconds, he can make me angry when I\u2019m happy and happy when I\u2019m angry. I put my phone back into my pocket and drag a breath through my nose. I\u2019ll ask Seth straight up about last night and act like it\u2019s no big deal.</p><p>Waiting for eleven o\u2019clock to roll around was torture, but when it finally came I wish I had more time to think about how I\u2019m going to approach the subject.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in an hour, Mason.\u201d I call from my desk.</p><p>I rise from my chair as Mason strolls from his office wearing a nice, tan suit with a nice yellow tie that rests against his white shirt. His outfit blends nicely with his golden hair and light eyes. In his hand, he fidgets with the office keys.</p><p>\u201cYou going to lunch?\u201d He asks, leaning on my desk. His long index finger strokes the corner of a loose sheet of paper.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, rising to my feet. \u201cI\u2019m actually meeting someone.\u201d The words are awkward on my tongue.</p><p>\u201cSelena? I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t mind if I joined you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not Selena.\u201d I straighten the bottom of my dress. \u201cI\u2019m having lunch with\u2014\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m cut off as the door opens and Seth steps in looking as gorgeous as ever in a black tee that clings to his chest and arms like a second skin. His dark hair is damp and unruly, like he\u2019s just run his fingers through it.</p><p>\u201cSeth.\u201d Mason states, finishing my sentence for me.</p><p>Seth\u2019s jaw tightens. \u201cMason.\u201d</p><p>My gaze shifts from Mason to Seth, from Seth to Mason. This is not happening right now. They do not know each other.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201d Mason clears his throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The air is so tense in here you could cut it with a knife. Seth nods stiffly before turning his dark stare to me. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>I step toward Seth, but Mason\u2019s voice stops me from making it all the way to him.</p><p>\u201cSeth Marc,\u201d He spits Seth\u2019s name like it\u2019s venom on his tongue and it startles me. \u201cThis is the guy you\u2019re seeing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d Seth cuts in for me. All of his features are drawn into tight lines and I see him working his jaw.</p><p>\u201cSeth, don\u2019t.\u201d I mutter, stepping closer to him.</p><p>I let my fingertips soothingly graze his wrist. Mason ignores Seth\u2019s aggressiveness and his blue eyes square in on me.</p><p>\u201cSeth is the reason I moved to Portland.\u201d He tells me.</p><p>My brows knit together as I recall Mason telling me he moved to Portland after the divorce with his wife of twelve years.</p> <p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Olivia.\u201d Seth demands as he takes me by the wrist and turns toward the door.</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d Mason calls after me. I\u2019ve never heard his voice take such a dangerous edge before. It\u2019s chilling, deep and it stops me in my tracks. Seth drops my wrist and snaps back to Mason.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is your problem?\u201d</p><p>Mason stands an inch or two taller than Seth, but I\u2019ve seen Seth in action. Mason wouldn\u2019t stand a chance. \u201cI\u2019m looking out for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Mason\u2019s blue eyes flick onto my terrified face and Seth follows his sight. Seth smiles that over-confident smile before turning back to Mason and I swallow hard.</p> <p>\u201cYou want her?\u201d Seth assumes and when Mason\u2019s hard gaze falters at his assumption, Seth\u2019s smile widens into a wolfish grin and his large frame slips behind me.</p><p>The hard front of his body presses against my back. Seth\u2019s hands slide down my waist to my hips and he grips them tightly, pulling me harder against him. My gaze skims over my desk, across the plain white wall and then onto a small silver clock above Mason\u2019s door. I look everywhere but directly at Mason\u2019s blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you.\u201d Seth begins as his hands slide up to my waist.</p><p>My body jumps to attention as heat begins to pool between my legs. I cringe. Now is not the time to get aroused by his touch. Seth chuckles darkly against my ear when he notices my breathing become shallow. \u201cShe sure is something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth.\u201d I snap in an urgent whisper, but he ignores me and ducks his face into my hair as his hands slide north until his thumb glides over the base of my breast. He inhales and moans, sending hot ripples of desire through me as well as tipping my anger meter to boiling point.</p><p>\u201cTrust me when I say she tastes as good as she smells.\u201d</p><p>Mason storms forward and Seth yanks at me, tucking me safely behind his back.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna\u2019 do, Mas? Fight me?\u201d I can hear the sardonic chuckle in Seth\u2019s voice. \u201cDo it. I dare you.\u201d</p> <p>Seth and Mason are face to face and neither looks like they are going to back down any time soon. My heart thuds uncomfortably in my chest as a smirk tugs at the corner of Mason\u2019s lips and he says, \u201cYou know, one of the perks of being a psychologist is learning how to get inside people\u2019s heads and figuring out what makes them tick.\u201d</p><p>I feel Seth turn to stone.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna\u2019 know what made your father tick? What his biggest disappointment was?\u201d</p><p>My heart stops cold. Was Mason Seth\u2019s dad\u2019s psychologist in Seattle? It sure seems like it. Talking about Seth\u2019s dad is a big no-no for Seth. He\u2019s hardly spoken about him to me and he trusts me. I can only imagine what it\u2019s doing to him to hear Mason mention it.</p><p>\u201cSeth, let\u2019s go.\u201d I say, tugging on his shirt. He takes a step back. Now all I need is three or four more of those and we\u2019re out the door. I continue to tug on him and as I reach for the door. Mason says it\u2014the words I\u2019ve been praying for him to keep to himself.</p><p>\u201cYou. His biggest disappointment was you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Surprisingly, Seth didn\u2019t launch himself at Mason and somehow I made it in between the two men, pressing my hands firmly against Seth\u2019s chest. Under my hands, his muscles were coiled, waiting to spring themselves at Mason... but thankfully, they never do.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not worth throwing away the competition.\u201d Seth snarls. \u201cBut if you do speak to your ex-wife again, tell her I said hi.\u201d</p><p>He turns and storms from the office and I shift my attention to Mason. \u201cHis dad? Really? That\u2019s low, Mason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dating someone like Seth is low.\u201d Mason marches to his office and slams the door. I waste no time in chasing after Seth. He\u2019s outside pacing the sidewalk with his hands in his hair. His face is flushed, almost like it\u2019s too hot to touch. A few people strolling by dodged around him warily, like he\u2019s going to break at any moment.</p><p>\u201cSeth?\u201d My voice comes out quieter than I intend. \u201cWe can have lunch at my house...away from people.\u201d</p><p>He throws me his car keys and I follow him to his car without another word. In the car Seth keeps his eyes out the window.</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d I say, breaking the silence.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t acknowledge me.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like that. Don\u2019t use me against people ever again.\u201d</p><p>Still no response and I don\u2019t mind as long as he knows I\u2019m not okay with what just happened. I peek sideways at Seth. His chest rises and falls quicker than normal and his fists remain clenched. What Mason said has really done a number on him and I\u2019m not sure if I can help this time.</p><p>When we get to my house, there\u2019s a note on the door from Selena saying her dad called her into work and she borrowed some clothes. I reach under the busted potted plant and retrieve the back up key. It\u2019s marked with dirt because I haven\u2019t used it in a long time. I open the door and put the dirty key in my pocket. As I make my way into the kitchen to make sandwiches Seth sits on the couch, leaning his head backwards. His eyes are closed, giving him a vulnerable edge. I kick my shoes off in the middle of the kitchen and make my way over to him. As I linger above him, he snags his bottom lip between his teeth in thought. He\u2019s still mad... and I\u2019m scared that he\u2019ll get in his car and go back there.</p><p>\u201cWhat he said... don\u2019t pay any attention to it.\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right.\u201d Seth replies without opening his eyes. \u201cMy father was disappointed in me.\u201d His eyes open and my heart tightens at their sad gleam. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything right... so I made it my mission to do everything wrong. I\u2019m not a good person, O.\u201d</p><p>I grab his face between my palms, forcing him to look at me. \u201cI think you\u2019re a good person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne girl out of the millions of people I\u2019ve met thinks I\u2019m good.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cThose odds aren\u2019t comforting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut at least it\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>He pulls his face from my hands. \u201cDon\u2019t get the wrong idea about me. Don\u2019t let me charm you into thinking I\u2019m good because I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>I refuse to budge. \u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>He makes a frustrated noise at the base of his throat and sits forward. \u201cI slept with Mason\u2019s wife when I lived in Seattle, years ago. That\u2019s why they got divorced. I went with my dad to one of his sessions and I walked into Mason\u2019s office to see if he was there, but his wife was instead. She provoked me, teased me until I gave in. I fucked his wife on his desk and my dad and Mason walked in.\u201d He shakes his head, disgusted with himself. \u201cI\u2019m not a good person, Olivia. I destroyed a marriage\u2014hundreds of marriages, probably.\u201d</p><p>His story leaves a bitter taste in the back of my throat. I picture everything and in my head I\u2019m jealous that even someone who was meant to be married has had Seth. He doesn\u2019t look at me as he slumps back into the couch. He takes my hands, puts them back on his warm face and closes his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI need you to distract me. Tell me something\u2014anything and then I\u2019ll get out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>Without giving it much thought, I slide over his legs, straddling his thick muscles between my thighs. His eyes shoot open and I caress his smooth face with my thumbs. All of his lines of worry disappear and as I lean forward, pressing my lips to his, I feel his body tighten and he pulls back. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDistracting you.\u201d My hands slide up his face and into his hair. I tug on it, pulling his lips back to mine. He\u2019s trying to fight me, I can feel it. He won\u2019t open his mouth so I take his bottom lip between my teeth and I bite down on it. He gasps and his mouth opens. I stick my tongue in and run my fingers through his hair as I rock my hips slightly. Almost immediately I feel him bursting at the seam of his jeans beneath me.</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d He growls in a low tone as he attempts to lean away from me, but I don\u2019t let him.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d I whisper in his ear.</p><p>He shifts me so I\u2019m looking directly into his eyes. They\u2019re filled with too much emotion\u2014lust. Passion. Hate. Fear.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d I say again, running my hands underneath his shirt and up his chest. His muscles tremble and I grow a little wetter. I\u2019m willing to tend to him and give him what he needs right now. I don\u2019t know what has overcome me. There\u2019s this surge of electricity pulsing through me and I can\u2019t stop. I need it. I need it like I need air.</p><p>\u201cYou want this?\u201d</p><p>I take his hand and push it down the front of my underwear, answering his question. He tilts his head back, releasing a groan from his throat. I shiver as his fingers shift into position and the rough pads of his fingertips twitch against my sensitive flesh. His dark stare is on my face, trying to analyze my thoughts and slowly, I begin rocking my hips against his hand. Seth\u2019s lips crash to mine and I moan as he plunges his tongue into my mouth and manages to stand. I wrap my legs tightly around him as one of his arms crushes me to him while the other still caresses my wet center. When we get into my room and without taking his mouth from mine, he kicks off his shoes and we fall onto the bed. He lies between my legs, stroking me ruthlessly now and I\u2019m panting and moaning as I instinctually flex my hips towards his hand. A painfully-amazing sensation builds up in my core and as it threatens to spill over. He stops.</p><p>\u201cSeth.\u201d I groan, breathlessly. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>His face hovers directly above mine and he\u2019s smiling that God damn smile. He dips a finger inside me and I whimper, and then shudder as he goes back to circling my center. I feel my stomach begin to twist uncomfortably and as I barrel towards my climax, he stops again. I groan and he chuckles, the low sound causing a sudden flash of heat to shoot down my spine. He brings his mouth to mine and catches my bottom lip between his teeth. He bites down and I wince as his fingers push into me, forcing my hips to thrust upwards. Seth releases my lips and before I know it I\u2019m begging him to keep going in a desperate pant and he curls his fingers, pressing them against the roof of me. Suddenly, there\u2019s an overwhelming need to pee and I try to slide backwards\u2014to get away from it. Chuckling oh-so sexily, he rolls most of his weight onto me, pining me down on the bed as the tips of his fingers relentlessly brush against that spot. With whatever voice I can muster up through the breathlessness, I beg for him to stop, but he pulls me into him instead.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fighting it.\u201d He rasps at me. \u201cLet it go.\u201d</p><p>I clench my teeth down on his shirt as an orgasm rips through me. The heat of my climax envelops me, claiming every inch of my body both inside and out. I scream and moan into his shoulder and he doesn\u2019t stop moving his fingers until I\u2019m panting and leaning lazily against him. When the arousal subsides and I look into his eyes, I flush. I\u2019ve never orgasmed in front of anyone before, let alone one of that calibre. He drags his fingers from me and I watch as he trails one along his bottom lip before sucking the tip of his index finger into his mouth. I stare in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d He says, tugging his shirt over his head and throwing it across the room. \u201cI was right about one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do taste as good as you smell.\u201d</p><p>He slides off the bed and unbuttons his jeans. He yanks on his boxers and they group around his feet. Desire pools between my thighs once again when my sight falls onto his large, erect cock. He notices me watching unashamedly and he stands before me a little longer allowing me to admire his insanely beautiful body. \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>He gestures for me to come to him and like a cobra hypnotized by a flute, I crawl toward him. My bare feet hit the carpet and Seth pulls me against him. His hands slide into the nape of my neck and he presses his lips softly to mine. I melt into him, running my hands everywhere and enjoying the heat of his skin underneath them. He pulls away, leaving me breathless and turns me around. His fingers unzip my dress and it falls to my feet. He manages to unclip my bra in record time and tug me back around so we\u2019re face to face. I shiver at the sensation of the open air brushing against my chest, and I feel my nipples tighten immediately as goosebumps break across every inch of my flesh. Seth\u2019s eyes flit down to my breasts, and his lips twitch as he takes in my hardened peaks.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any protection?\u201d He asks, pressing his mouth to my throat. I slip away from him and grab a condom from the top drawer of my bedside table. He takes it from me as his eyes wander down to my chest again. He lays me down on the bed and with both hands he pulls my panties off. My initial reaction is to squeeze my legs together, but he jams his hand between my knees.</p><p>\u201cOpen them.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t open them completely, but enough for him to see exactly what I have. He inhales sharply. \u201cThat has to be the nicest pussy I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I close my legs. My nerves are building higher, leaving a sick feeling in the pit of my tummy. I hear the foil crumble and a few seconds later he\u2019s leaning over me, spreading my thighs with his knee. His length presses against my opening and I shudder as Seth\u2019s hands run over me, pinching and squeezing my flesh. A few minutes in and I\u2019m moaning and rocking my hips against his length. His eyes remain on my face as he reaches down and rubs himself all over me, testing my wetness. A burning sensation radiates at my entrance as he stretches me to my limits. My breath stalls and his mouth claims me as the burn becomes increasingly pleasant. He pushes hard and deep and a spine tingling pleasure rips through me. I moan into his mouth and he nips at my bottom lip before dropping his mouth to my breast, catching my nipple between his teeth.</p><p>\u201cFuck...\u201d He groans, biting down and making me gasp. \u201cYou\u2019re so...\u201d</p><p>He growls, leaving his sentence unfinished. Hearing him talk during sex is the most arousing thing I\u2019ve ever heard. He has one of those voices that make every single hair stand to attention. He thrusts harder and faster and I cry out every time the tip of his cock reaches its maximum point.</p> <p>\u201cThis is just what you wanted, isn't it?\u201d</p><p>I moan and nod as his swollen cock strikes something deep inside of me, causing my stomach to twist in the most delightful of ways. He half-groans, half-laughs at my admission and his thick arms wrap around me. He pulls us up to a sitting position and I\u2019m on top of him as his tongue traces a hot line of saliva along my collar bone. His hips rock forward and backward as his hands cup my ass, forcing me to grind in a fast speed against him. I grip him tighter as he takes my nipple into his mouth again. A need to take control of this big, beautiful man engulfs me and I push him backwards so he\u2019s lying underneath me. The look of pure lust and passion on his face because of me almost sends me over the edge, but I refuse to let go until he says my name. I place my hands firmly on his chest and I lift my hips and then sink back down onto him with a loud cry. It feels so damn good.</p><p>I can see it in Seth\u2019s face. He isn\u2019t going to be able to hold for much longer and my muscles ache from doing the same motions over and over, but it only fuels the orgasm waiting to tear out of me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna come, baby.\u201d He growls as he rolls me off him, quickly, pressing my back firmly against the mattress. His hand slides down my thigh and he hooks it up onto his shoulder. His biceps clench as he holds himself off me and his gaze flicks between my face and my breasts that bounce quickly as my body jerks under the powerful rocking motions of his hips. The orgasm that has patiently waited in the core of my being builds higher and higher and I can no longer contain it. As it edges closer, my body tightens and my muscles begin to tremble.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Olivia,\u201d he groans into my ear and that\u2019s all it takes.</p> <p>My fingers dig into the skin of his shoulders and I arch my back into him, pressing my hard nipples against his chest as powerful surges of satisfaction spill through me. Instantly following my orgasm, Seth finds his own release and he moans as his head drops onto my chest and his hips move in an uneven thrust. When the tremors slow and I can breathe again, he wraps his arms around my shoulders and rolls, pulling me on top of him. We don\u2019t talk for a little while. Instead, we listen to each other\u2019s pant become even and quiet.</p><p>I smile against Seth\u2019s chest. We had sex and it was a million times better than I thought it could ever be. Now I know why girls refuse to leave him alone after it.</p><p>When I\u2019ve gained enough breath to speak, I say. \u201cI have to go back to work in fifteen minutes and my car is broken so you\u2019re the lucky one who gets to drive me back.\u201d</p><p>Seth scoffs and plays with the ends of my hair. \u201cIf it was up to me you\u2019d never go back there.\u201d</p><p>I sit up a little, so I can see his face. He looks at me with serious eyes and tucks his hands behind his head. The muscles in his arms jut outwards and I want to run my tongue over them. I want to memorize every bulge and depression.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good boss, Seth.\u201d</p> <p>He frowns. \u201cOnly because he wants to get in your pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but even if that wasn\u2019t the case I can tell he\u2019s a good person.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs his shoulders. \u201cHow\u2019d you get to work this morning?\u201d His subject change was anything but subtle.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was going to catch a taxi, but Blade took me instead.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s brows furrow deeper at Blade\u2019s name. \u201cYou called him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he showed up unexpectedly.\u201d My mind falls onto all of the things Blade said and I figure now is as good a time as ever to ask him about it. \u201cHe saw you guys at Heaven\u2019s last night... you were making out with the brunette girl from the gym.\u201d</p><p>It takes all of my strength to keep my face neutral and not assuming. I expect a look of shock or at least wide eyes, but all I get is a laugh that rumbles through Seth\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cHe said I was making out with her?\u201d</p> <p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cNo. She threw herself at me and I told her where to go. Then Selena slams me for treating Cassy like shit.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI can\u2019t win.\u201d</p><p>The brunette with the big fake boobs is named Cassy... I hate it, but I believe him when he says he didn\u2019t kiss her first. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if he said he had kissed her first.</p><p>\u201cSelena sure talks a lot when she\u2019s drunk.\u201d He adds.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she told Blade everything... he knows we aren\u2019t together and he wants me back.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s dark eyes burn into mine and he seems almost pissed off. \u201cAnd what did you say?\u201d</p><p>I look around the room and at his naked body like it\u2019s obvious. \u201cWe just had sex, of course my answer was no.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s tense face melts into an over-confident smile and tugs me onto him. \u201cGood, because I think I want seconds.\u201d</p><p>His tongue forces its way between my lips and I massage his with mine before pulling away. \u201cI can\u2019t. I have to go to work.\u201d</p><p>I slide off the bed and put all of my clothes back on before fishing my phone out of my pocket and checking the screen. I have a missed call from work. I put it to my ear and play it.</p><p>\u201cHey, Olivia.\u201d Mason\u2019s depressed voice mumbles. \u201cI closed work early. I\u2019ll see you back next week... sorry, for today. It just caught me off guard. Bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d I huff, lowering it from my ear and slapping my phone against the palm of my hand. \u201cMason closed the office.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but to feel bad. It\u2019s my fault... Seth reaches across the bed and pulls on the hem off my dress, drawing me closer. His mouth curves into a delicious smile and his eyes dance with indecent excitement. \u201cLucky me.\u201d</p><p>Seth and I spent the rest of the day in bed yesterday, but today, I haven\u2019t seen him. He\u2019s texted me a few times asking me to go to his next fight in Concord, New Hampshire, but every time I\u2019ve replied back \u2018no\u2019. I\u2019m still getting over the last one.</p><p>I\u2019ve been keeping myself busy today by cleaning the apartment from top to bottom and now I have to get ready for dinner with Mom and Dad. For my mom\u2019s sake, I wear a pair of jeans and the green, high-necked sweater she bought for me for Christmas last year. I really dislike it. Green is definitely not my color and there are only so many times I can use the \u2018it\u2019s in the wash\u2019 excuse.</p><p>Because it\u2019s Sunday and my car isn\u2019t getting repaired until tomorrow, I have to call a taxi. When I pull my hair into a ponytail, and apply a little lip gloss, the taxi pulls up outside, blasting its horn once.</p><p>The ride to my parent\u2019s house is painfully slow and I wish I had sat in the backseat instead of the front. The driver is old, much too old to be driving a car and he keeps missing the turn offs. When we finally pull up outside my parent\u2019s house, the driver only takes a small portion of the money owed and I thank him because there was no way I was paying him full price.</p><p>I turn to the house. The glowing orange and red sunset gives the beautiful, one storey house a warm feel. A big oak tree stands to the left of the yard, providing a dark shadow over the tire swing my brother and I built as kids. The grass is mowed and maintained to perfection and I wonder if it\u2019s as soft as it was when I was younger. I open the small white gate and step onto the rocky footpath. Pebbles crunch beneath my feet and the smell of Shepherd\u2019s Pie and roast vegetables waft into my nose. I walk along the pathway and onto the wooden porch. As soon as I knock on the door, I hear my mother drop whatever she\u2019s doing in the kitchen and she rushes to the door. She pulls it open and I\u2019m greeted by her smiling face and soft chocolate curls that tuck around her ears.</p><p>\u201cDarling!\u201d She squeals, unlocking the screen and pulling me into a hug. She smells like basil and salt. \u201cYou know you don\u2019t have to knock here. Come right in.\u201d</p><p>She drags me into the house, smiling gleefully at my sweater. The first room I step into is the living room and Dad is sitting in his recliner watching some MMA fight\u2014a re-run, probably.</p><p>\u201cRichard!\u201d Mom snaps, tugging on the hem of her pretty lilac apron. \u201cOlivia is here. Turn that junk off.\u201d</p><p>She marches into the kitchen and I join Dad in the lounge room. He shuts off the T.V and leans forward in his chair as I drop into the couch. \u201cHow are you, kiddo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Did you have fun after the fight on Friday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have if your mother hadn\u2019t forbidden me from drinking.\u201d He rolls his brown eyes and I smile at him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always next time.\u201d I say, leaning back into the couch.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, are you going to Concord with Seth and the team tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick, don\u2019t make the poor girl go if she doesn\u2019t want to go.\u201d Mom shouts from the kitchen. She\u2019s always eavesdropping. \u201cI don\u2019t want her hanging around those fighter types. They\u2019re aggressive and dangerous. We\u2019re meant to be protecting our daughter not thrusting her in harm\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>Dad rolls his eyes and lowers his voice. \u201cShe met Seth yesterday when he came to get his car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like him?\u201d</p><p>His narrow shoulders shrug. \u201cYou know how she is. She has a hard time dealing with people she can\u2019t control.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. Although I love my mother to bits, she\u2019s too controlling, too set in her ways.</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s as against fighting as you are.\u201d He adds, drinking back the last mouthful of his beer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not against it, Dad. I just don\u2019t like watching it... it\u2019s brutal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s life.\u201d He crushes the empty can of beer and lifts himself from his chair. \u201cPeople have been fighting each other since the beginning of time.\u201d He disappears around the corner to the kitchen and I glance at the big wooden clock on the wall above the T.V. I hate how fighting isn\u2019t a big deal to anyone but me. Even Mom stomachs it just to spend time with Dad. I\u2019d love to go to Concord to support Seth, but I just can\u2019t deal with the fighting.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, dinner!\u201d Mom\u2019s voice forces me from the couch to the kitchen. Next to it is the dining room and Dad is sitting at the head of the long, wooden table. He\u2019s sat in that same chair for dinner for as long as I can remember.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to Concord?\u201d I ask him, falling into the seat closest to him.</p><p>\u201cI sure am. They plan to be in New Hampshire for two nights.\u201d</p><p>Mom takes the large Shepherd\u2019s pie from the oven along with the baked vegetables. The potatoes are a golden brown, specked with various herbs and the edges around the pumpkin are darkened to perfection, making my mouth water.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re father shouldn\u2019t be going. Not with his high blood pressure anyway.\u201d</p><p>I look at Dad and his jaw tenses.</p><p>\u201cYou have high blood pressure? Are you okay? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>Dad waves his hand at me like it\u2019s no big deal. \u201cI feel fine. The doctor is just being cautious.\u201d</p><p>Mom puts the food onto pretty, flower patterned serving dishes before setting them at the table before us. I want to ask Dad more about him. I want to know how he\u2019s feeling, or if he needs me to take care of the gym a few days a week. When Mom heads back into the kitchen, Dad leans closer to me.</p><p>\u201cYour mother doesn\u2019t know that you and Seth are dating, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not dating, Dad. We\u2019re friends.\u201d Friends who just so happened to rock each other\u2019s world.</p><p>He rolls his eyes for the second time tonight. \u201cYeah, okay. Just break it to her gently.\u201d</p><p>Mom pulls her apron over her head, adjusts the way her red dress sits and then joins us at the table. Mom tells us all about her day in town while we scoop food onto our plates. I\u2019ve been here twenty minutes and there\u2019s been no mention of moving back in. That\u2019s some kind of record.</p><p>\u201cSo Mom,\u201d I say, pouring gravy on my baked vegetables. \u201cYou met my friend Seth yesterday...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Her green eyes avoid mine and I know that isn\u2019t a good sign. \u201cHave you and Blade spoken since the break up?\u201d</p><p>Even Dad groans at the mention of his name and I don\u2019t appreciate her dodging around Seth to talk about Blade.</p><p>\u201cYes, actually, he drove me to work yesterday.\u201d From the corner of my eye, I see Dad shake his head. \u201cWe\u2019re still not back together.\u201d I state matter of factly.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to get back together?\u201d Mom asks.</p><p>There\u2019s a hopeful gleam in her eye and it completely pisses me off. She knows what Blade has done to me and should have no doubt guessed that he\u2019s done the same thing this time around, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia, you and Blade have been together for a very long time. I\u2019m sure you two can work out whatever is going on between you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time is different.\u201d I shrug, putting a forkful of potato into my mouth.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of Seth?\u201d</p><p>I swallow. \u201cNo, it has nothing to do with Seth. Blade\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs a disrespectful little shit and I\u2019m glad that he\u2019s no longer in our daughter\u2019s life. Now drop it.\u201d Dad squeezes my hand before going back to his meal and I nod thankfully at him.</p><p>Mom\u2019s manicured hands rub at her temples. \u201cMaybe if you lived here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I groan. My fork clings against my plate as it collides with the ceramic material. \u201cI don\u2019t live here and I haven\u2019t for three years now. I don\u2019t plan on moving back in, ever.\u201d</p> <p>She glances at Dad and waits for him to step in and back her up. Usually he does, but last week he promised me he wouldn\u2019t mention anything about me moving back in if I came to dinner.</p><p>\u201cReally Rick? You\u2019re not going to help me? It\u2019s like this... this... Seth, has you both wrapped around his finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is my boss.\u201d Dad mutters indifferently.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. He\u2019s bad news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t done anything.\u201d I object.</p><p>She brushes my comment off. \u201cYou\u2019re blinded by your hormones.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSandra!\u201d Dad snaps. He gets agitated whenever Mom refers to my sex life. \u201cOlivia can date whoever she wants. If she wants to be with Seth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re with Seth?\u201d Great.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d I snap, but he shrugs his shoulders like it\u2019s no big deal. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not with Seth.\u201d</p><p>My phone vibrates in the pocket of my jeans and while my attention is diverted to my phone, Mom leans closer to Dad and cusses him out for not helping her. I ignore their quiet bickering and read a text from Selena.</p><p>FROM: SELENA. TIME: 7:13 P.M.</p><p>We\u2019re coming! :)</p><p>I stare at the screen for a little while, confused at the meaning of her text.</p><p>TO: SELENA. TIME: 7:14 P.M.</p> <p>You sent your text to the</p><p>wrong person, silly.</p><p>I\u2019m at my parents having</p><p>dinner.</p><p>FROM: SELENA - TIME: 7:14 P.M.</p><p>No. We\u2019re coming to get you.</p><p>Seth said you\u2019re down for</p><p>Coming out!</p><p>TO: SELENA. TIME: 7:15 P.M.</p><p>Well, Seth lied. I\u2019m busy.</p><p>FROM: SELENA. TIME: 7:15 P.M.</p><p>Too late. Xox</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Mom asked, peering down her nose at my screen.</p><p>\u201cApparently, I\u2019m going out with Selena and a few friends tonight.\u201d</p><p>I scoop as much potato and pie into my mouth as I can. The only way to get out of here without offending Mom is to eat every crumb of food.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Maybe a night out with friends is exactly what you need to clear your head.\u201d</p><p>I nod, purposely neglecting to mention that Seth is probably going to be there, too. I glance sideways at Dad who smiles at me. He isn\u2019t stupid. He knows Seth will be there and he likes that I\u2019m spending time with him... if only he knew what Seth was doing to his little girl yesterday. I can\u2019t imagine him being \u2018Team Seth\u2019 after that.</p><p>Half an hour later, there\u2019s an enthusiastic knock at the door.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here already?\u201d Mom asks, raising her eyebrows.</p><p>I shrug, playing dumb. I knew they were on their way, but I didn\u2019t want Mom to think I planned it to ruin her dinner. I rise from my chair and open my mouth to thank Mom for dinner, only she rises from her chair too and strolls across the room to grab more plates from the cupboard.</p><p>\u201cMom, what are you doing?\u201d I ask curiously.</p><p>\u201cWe have plenty of food. Your friends can fill their bellies before they immerse themselves in alcohol. Sit.\u201d</p><p>The blood drains from my face and I sit back in my chair as Mom rushes to the door. Loud whoops and cheers ring through the house and soon Mom enters the kitchen with a handful of very rowdy, slightly drunk adults. Seth\u2019s gorgeous face is among them and seeing him again after what happened between us sends my cheeks burning. He looks so good in dark jeans and a blue t-shirt and I drag my sight from the outlines of his hard chest to his dark gaze. It zeros in on me and the corner of his lips twitch.</p><p>Mom is eyeing up Selena\u2019s dress in disapproval, but I liked it\u2014the yellow and white contrasts nicely with her tan skin and soft, blonde curls. Sure, it\u2019s a little on the exposing side, but Mom has to expect that from Selena by now. Mom slides into her chair and Selena drops in next to her. Everyone manages to find a seat around our ten-seater dining table and Seth settles beside me. His leg rests against mine, sending electrical currents through my body and I try to ignore it by focusing on everyone else. I knew Selena and Seth, and I recognized Jackson in his loose jeans and white tee, but I had no idea who the other four men were.</p><p>\u201cThat sweater is... interesting, O.\u201d Selena says, earning a scowl from my mother.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very nice sweater. I bought that for her for Christmas last year.\u201d</p><p>Selena pales in the face. Even she\u2019s scared of my Mom.</p><p>\u201cI meant interestingly gorgeous.\u201d She mumbles, scooping vegetables onto her plate as Mom smiles and nods in agreement.</p><p>Everyone is eating and talking. Seth is deep in conversation over my head with Dad and I continue to eat my potato listening to Selena tell Mom about her day at the firm. I watch as Mom\u2019s eyes narrow in on Seth\u2019s clean, empty plate. He hasn\u2019t touched any of her food and I know she\u2019s going to\u2014</p><p>\u201cNot hungry, Seth?\u201d</p><p>Crap. I can see her judging eyes watching him, just waiting for him to do or say something wrong.</p><p>\u201cNo ma\u2019am.\u201d He replies politely, smiling widely. \u201cI\u2019m on a strict diet.\u201d</p><p>Selena glances sympathetically at me from under her brow. She understands how anal my mom is about food. If you\u2019re in her house you better eat her food, even if you\u2019re full.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal, Mom.\u201d I assure her. \u201cSeth needs to do certain things and eat certain things for the sake of his career. It\u2019s not about your food. Your food is delicious.\u201d</p><p>Everyone mumbles their agreement and Mom\u2019s accusing stare drops as she returns to her conversation with Selena.</p><p>\u201cYour mom is intense.\u201d Seth mutters to me and I nod.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the understatement of the century.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the food is devoured, we all jump to our feet and say our goodbyes. Mom and Dad walk us to the door, shaking hands and giving out hugs. I don\u2019t miss the way Dad stares at Seth with such pride and adoration, and it brings a smile to my face.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, please.\u201d Mom says, kissing my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI always am.\u201d</p><p>She nods curtly to Seth and we step out onto the porch. He laces his fingers with mine and leads me down the pebble path. I glance down at our hands, confused.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>He smiles down at me, his eyes flaring with amusement. \u201cI believe this is called hand holding. People do it when they are fond of another person\u2014or when they want to piss off someone\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>I choke on a laugh. \u201cAnd which one is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a bit of both.\u201d He replies as we make it to the car.</p><p>He stops and glances back to the house. I follow his line of sight and see Mom looking through the curtains at us, watching like a hawk. I shake my head at her, but she doesn\u2019t go away. Rolling my eyes, I look back to Seth. He\u2019s smiling devilishly at me and steps closer, seizing my waist.</p><p>\u201cSeth, don\u2014\u201d But it\u2019s too late. He\u2019s already pressed his tasty, full lips to mine.</p><p>His tongue glides across my lip and I open my mouth, not giving it a second thought. He kisses me hard and passionate before his teeth nip my bottom lip, leaving it tingling as he pulls away. His eyes search mine with a satisfied gleam.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d I groan breathlessly, knowing very well Mom will use that against him later.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mom already thinks I\u2019m bad for you. I might as well go the whole nine yards.\u201d</p><p>I shove him. \u201cYou play dirty.\u201d</p><p>He presses his index finger against my concealed nipple and circles it slowly. I swat his hand away and he chuckles, drawing a smile from me.</p><p>\u201cTell me something I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Before we went out, Selena demanded that I go home and change, which was fine by me. I didn\u2019t want to wear the sweater just as much as she didn\u2019t want to see it. I got dressed and did my hair and make-up in record time\u2014it\u2019s unsettling having so many people I don\u2019t know lounging around my apartment.</p><p>Tonight, I decide to wear a white halter neck with a plunging neckline and a black, waist-high pencil skirt. I looked more like I was going to a work function than a club, but I felt comfortable\u2014I felt sexy and in control.</p><p>Heaven\u2019s is an elegant club. Sure, lots of scum and skanks go there, but you can\u2019t gain entrance unless you look classy and I look classy. There\u2019s a firm knock at my door as I slide into a black pair of heels.</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d I call, expecting Selena\u2019s face but getting Seth\u2019s.</p><p>His eyes sweep shamelessly over my completely exposed legs and he catches the side of his bottom lip between his teeth before they turn up in a glorious, come-hither smirk.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I prompt, clipping in some gold hoops.</p><p>He takes purposefully slow steps toward me, each step seeming measured and deliberate. I hold my breath as he closes the distance between us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m contemplating whether I should let you go to the club and tease me, or if I should take you right now.\u201d</p><p>His fingers brush along my jaw and down my neck before following the fabric of my shirt down to my breasts. Under his touch, my blood boils. In close proximity, his cologne surrounds me and my knees weaken. He notices and chuckles under his breath as his strong hands roam me. He cups my backside and presses me firmly against him as he angles his head, bringing his lips closer to mine. My heart aches as it slams against my ribcage and my insides clench and pulsate. I want his mouth on me and I want it now.</p><p>\u201cWe can stay.\u201d I whisper as our lips graze.</p><p>With a sardonic smirk, he releases me and steps away. I blink a few times, confused. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sexually frustrated feeling you\u2019re experiencing right now is how you\u2019re going to make me feel all night just by wearing that fucking outfit.\u201d</p><p>I watch his wide, shapely back exit my room leaving me staring after him. I run my hands over my face, trying to regain some composure. He knows exactly which buttons to push to get me going and I hate it. I pull my hair from my ponytail and run a comb through it. It lies against my shoulders, framing my face and I flick it around a little bit, giving it more volume. I do a little twirl in front of my mirror and leave my room. The wolf whistles and cheers that erupt upon my entrance into the lounge room tells me I look as good as I thought I did.</p><p>\u201cAre we catching a taxi?\u201d I ask Selena.</p><p>\u201cNah, Seth volunteered to be the designated driver.\u201d</p><p>One by one they leave my apartment and head to the car.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in the partying mood tonight?\u201d I ask Seth, confused because he\u2019s the reason I\u2019m going out.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, I have a fight coming up and I\u2019m not a big drinker, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I would have picked you to be quite the partier.\u201d</p><p>Seth shrugs and wraps an arm around my waist. He pulls me along beside him as we walk down the steps from my apartment. Two of his friends eye us curiously, like they\u2019ve never seen Seth with a girl before and I can\u2019t help but wonder if there\u2019s more going on in our relationship than I first thought. The friends, including Selena, pile into the back of Seth\u2019s car, leaving the front two seats for Seth and I. When the back door shuts, I turn to Seth.</p><p>\u201cBefore we go out tonight, I want to clear up a few things between us.\u201d</p><p>He removes his hand from my waist and leans against the passenger side of his car.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I begin, rubbing my fingers on my forehead and praying I don\u2019t embarrass myself. \u201cSo, we had sex...\u201d</p><p>He smiles a full smile, one that exposes his white teeth and my cheeks heat up. \u201cI\u2019m well aware of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d I continue, ignoring his response. \u201cWe aren\u2019t together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d His voice doesn\u2019t sound certain, but I ignore it.</p><p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s all the touching and waist holding... it\u2019s confusing me. I\u2019m just clarifying our position so no one\u2019s feelings get hurt tonight.\u201d</p><p>He frowns at me and my heart almost shatters in my chest. I\u2019ve said something wrong. \u201cYou\u2019re going to hurt my feelings?\u201d Seth replies with a daring gleam in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your feelings I\u2019m worried about.\u201d I mutter, feeling stupid for just saying it. Seth will undoubtedly have admirers if we go out tonight, more specifically, girl admirers, the kind that\u2019ll do and say anything just to get closer to him.</p><p>He tilts his head to the side, analyzing my face. \u201cYou mistake my intent on our non-existent boyfriend/girlfriend relationship.\u201d He steps closer. \u201cWe might not be using the titles, but I still claim you as mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours?\u201d</p><p>Normally, I hate when people refer to other people as a possession, but when Seth says it there\u2019s something extremely sexy and alluring about it.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d He grips my hips, pulling me into him. \u201cYou are mine and I\u2019ll make sure every single person in the club knows it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you made it very clear to Don that I\u2019m not yours...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because Don and I have a lot of history. If I told him you were mine, he wouldn\u2019t have let you leave.\u201d</p><p>Of course Seth has history with Don. He seems to have history with everybody. \u201cLet me guess, you slept with his girlfriend?\u201d</p> <p>The back window winds down and Jackson sticks his head out. His hair has more products in it than Selena\u2019s and that\u2019s saying something. \u201cHey, lovebirds, when you\u2019re ready we\u2019d like to go to Heaven\u2019s!\u201d</p><p>Whoops and cheers follow his demand and Seth opens the passenger door for me.</p><p>\u201cI never said I was perfect.\u201d He tells me.</p><p>Inside, the car is loud and annoying. I can\u2019t hear myself think and a small pain begins to form behind my eyes. I lean my head back on the headrest and I briefly close my eyes. Seth\u2019s large, warm hand rests on my thigh as he drives us to Heaven\u2019s nightclub.</p><p>We park in Heaven\u2019s car park and walk around to the front. The group we\u2019re with is pumped. They\u2019re talking about drinking and dancing and girls, and all I can think about is crawling back into a nice warm bed, preferably with Seth. The line into the club is long, filled with drunks, skanks and pissed off people who just want a drink. As I go to stand behind a couple practically having sex, Seth grabs my wrist and forces me to keep walking. We pass the long line of people and all of them watch us curiously as we step right up to the front door.</p> <p>The security guard runs his hand over his bald head, smiling widely. \u201cSeth, man\u2019 It\u2019s been a long time! How\u2019ve you been, bro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe usual.\u201d Seth replies, slipping his arm around my waist.</p><p>The guard\u2019s eyes rake me from head to toe. \u201cI see that.\u201d</p><p>I frown. What the hell does that mean? The security guard steps aside, letting all of us into the club and behind us, the crowd goes mental.</p><p>Inside, the club is going off and it\u2019s pretty much packed to the roof. You can\u2019t notice the club\u2019s usually beautiful decor. It\u2019s all blocked and covered by bodies, gyrating to the loud club music. I inch closer to Seth and Selena grabs onto my elbow as he drags us through large throngs of people, right up to the V.I.P room. The two massive security guards standing in front of the door take one look at Seth and step out of the way. They hold the large blue door open and we climb a small set of stairs before being unleashed into another club upstairs. The V.I.P room gives off a Middle Eastern vibe with the red and brown curtains that separate couches and low set coffee tables. It\u2019s so much easier to breathe upstairs compared to the confined space downstairs and there\u2019s only a maximum of twelve people\u2014not including our group. It helps the headache I carry with me to slip away. Jackson, Selena and the rest of the group practically sprint to the bar while Seth and I make ourselves comfortable on a couch.</p><p>\u201cHow do you get all this?\u201d I ask him. \u201cYou\u2019re only an amateur fighter, yet you have a nice car and get treated like royalty.\u201d</p> <p>He leans back in the chair and plays with the ends of my hair, twirling it around his index finger. \u201cI may be competing in an amateur tournament, but I\u2019ve been in the game for a long time. People know me.\u201d</p><p>The group returns with a mass amount of shots and they place them all evenly across the table. Six shots each. All of them were of different colors, ranging from clear to pitch black.</p><p>I turn to Seth. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not going to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Jackson butts in, handing Seth a bottle of water. \u201cWe\u2019re taking the competition out this year.\u201d He glances between Seth and I. \u201cNo risks.\u201d</p><p>Following the others, I tip a clear shot down my throat and immediately it feels like it\u2019s burning a hole. I lower my glass to the table, taking a second for the harsh taste to leave my mouth. I look at everyone else\u2019s glasses and they\u2019ve finished shooting them. They stare at me highly amuse, like I\u2019m incompetent and not worthy to drink with them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how you look at me.\u201d I laugh, wiping the back of my hand across my mouth. \u201cI\u2019m not giving myself alcohol poisoning.\u201d</p><p>Selena winks at me as I drink the second shot. She knows how I am with my alcohol. I don\u2019t drink to get drunk, I drink to get light headed and have a good time. This many shots is not a good time. Jackson and Selena take off somewhere and the rest of the boys head downstairs to pick up girls, leaving Seth and I alone. Despite the dinner I had, the shots are already making my head feel light.</p><p>When I hit my fourth shot sometime later, I decide to stop and I lean into Seth as his lips wrap around the top of his bottle. I stare at them as he swallows a mouthful and I desperately want to taste them myself.</p> <p>\u201cSo, why aren\u2019t you a big drinker? Do you not like the taste or the feeling?\u201d I ask, dragging my gaze from his lips to his eyes.</p><p>He screws the lid on his bottle and places it on the table. \u201cFeeling inquisitive, are you?\u201d</p><p>I nod and he wraps an arm around me. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much I need to understand about you. You constantly surprise me.\u201d</p><p>He traces an \u2018S\u2019 on my lower back over and over as his big, brown eyes watch my face. \u201cHalf of the reason is because I don\u2019t like not being in control and the other half... well...\u201d His brows knit together. \u201cIt\u2019s a long and complicated story.\u201d</p><p>It always is with him. I respect his decision not to tell me even though every fiber in my being is screaming for me to probe deeper. Loud cheers ring throughout the V.I.P room, distracting me. Our small group of friends is leading a bunch of randoms up the stairs and soon the room becomes as packed as downstairs. Selena drops onto the couch next to me as Jackson engages Seth in a conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou still have two shots left.\u201d Selena shouts in my ear before looking at me like she\u2019s just busted me throwing out a gift.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling good. I don\u2019t want to overdo it.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring what I said, she hands me a shot anyway. \u201cWe\u2019ll do one together then.\u201d</p><p>The black liquid burns my nose as I bring it to my lips. Selena winks at me and I tilt my head back, pouring the liquid down the hatch. The liquorice tasting shot goes down surprisingly well and I barely sit the glass down on the table when Selena pulls me to my feet. \u201cLet\u2019s dance.\u201d</p><p>I groan in protest, but I don\u2019t do much to stop her from dragging me to the dance floor. My head is extremely light now and I\u2019m having fun. Selena and I dance together, completely forgetting that we\u2019re here with people.</p><p>I have no idea how long we\u2019ve been dancing, but I\u2019m sweating and the amount of people in the room has lessened. Selena leans into my ear and her blonde hair sticks to my damp cheek. \u201cOne more drink?\u201d</p><p>I shrug my shoulders and nod. One more couldn\u2019t hurt, I suppose. Her elbow hooks around mine and we walk to the bar. I rest my elbows on the varnished surface, supporting some of my weight. If it wasn\u2019t so loud in here I\u2019d hear my legs sigh in relief. I look back at Seth and frown when I see a girl next to him with her pretty, manicured hand on his knee. Like almost every other girl here she has big, fake boobs and long, platinum blonde hair that curls around her breasts. His eyes shift from her to me and I force my best \u2018not jealous\u2019 smile before turning back to the bar. I have to trust him. Selena leans in to order and a drunken idiot rudely steps between us, bumping Selena into the girl next to her. The girl is pissed, although I have no idea why, not a drop lands on her sky-blue tube dress. The girl\u2019s face contorts into a bitchy scowl.</p><p>\"What the fuck!\" She growls at Selena, baring her freakishly white teeth and swaying slightly.</p><p>Selena looks at me over her shoulder, giggling like an idiot and I bite back a smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Selena half laughs, half apologizes. \u201cThis guy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that. You owe me a drink.\u201d</p><p>The two friends behind her groan incoherently in agreement.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t owe you shit.\u201d Selena replies.</p><p>Selena isn\u2019t one to avoid a bar fight (or so she says) so I tug on Selena\u2019s hand. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m getting into a fight in these heels. Scratch that, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m getting into a fight, period. I haven\u2019t had one in my twenty-three years of living and I don\u2019t want to start now. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal, Sel. Just replace her drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The blonde steps forward in an attempt to intimidate Selena. She isn\u2019t that intimidating... I mean, she isn\u2019t much taller than me and her make-up is done horridly, like a clown at a carnival.</p><p>\u201cReplace. My. Fucking. Drink.\u201d</p><p>Selena steps toward the girl and I run around her, bravely throwing myself between them.</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d I say to the girl. \u201cI\u2019ll replace your drink. What were you drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGin and tonic.\u201d</p><p>I tell the bartender and he whips one up. When he hands it to me, I slide it against the varnished wood toward the girl. Her dark eyes survey me and then the drink. After a few seconds, she smiles at me and grasps the glass. I sag in relief. Thank God that\u2019s over. Before I turn to Selena, the blonde clown slides the drink off the bar and it crashes at my feet, wetting my toes. Seth is at my side instantly, his hand planted firmly around my waist. A few people are staring now and anger burns inside me. My gaze rises from my feet to the girl\u2019s annoyingly, smug face. Selena steps around me and shoves the girl hard. \u201cWhat the hell is your problem?\u201d She shouts.</p><p>The random blonde stumbles backward before launching forward at Selena. I don\u2019t know what happened... the next thing I know, my fist flies out from beside me and I punch the girl in the jaw. She goes down hard and I stand over her, dominating her. She looks up at me, clasping her jaw. Her eyes are shiny with tears, making me feel like shit. Oh, fuck. What have I done? I open my mouth to apologize and help her up, but strong arms seize me.</p><p>\u201cTime to go.\u201d Seth laughs under his breath, throwing me over his shoulder.</p><p>I crane my neck to look up and behind me Jackson is carrying Selena whose whooping and yelling at the girl I punched.</p><p>I punched a girl.</p><p>In the face.</p><p>I close my eyes, hoping the bout of nausea that courses through me stops. I have no idea what overcame me. I knew the girl was going to hit Selena and I just reacted. Crap. What the hell was I thinking?</p><p>I don't open my eyes until the night air cools my burning skin. Even though we're outside, Seth doesn\u2019t put me down and I don\u2019t want him to. My insides are too wired, buzzing like a bug zapper with a huge moth lodged in it. My hands shake and I flex them in an attempt to steady them, but it fails. We round the corner of the club and officially enter the car park when Seth sets me down. My shoes find the hard ground and I stumble slightly. The shots have hit me harder than I thought. Seth is smiling his cocky smile at me and I glare back at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t smile like that. I just assaulted someone.\u201d I rake my fingers through my hair. \u201cOh my God... I just assaulted someone. I\u2019m going to go to prison.\u201d</p><p>He laughs loudly and steadies my swaying by placing his hands on my shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to prison. That girl was too drunk to realize what was happening.\u201d</p><p>His warm hand trails down my arm and settles in my trembling hand. He pulls it to his lips, placing soft kisses along my knuckles.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad influence, Seth.\u201d I say, inching closer to him.</p><p>I can make out his irises under the street lamp above us and they\u2019re burning into mine with such intensity. His smile still hasn\u2019t left his face and the way he looks at me thrills me to no end.</p><p>\u201cI did warn you.\u201d He replies, pressing his lips to mine.</p><p>He takes control and I\u2019m helpless against him. His tongue slips inside my mouth as one of his hands glides under the low cut fabric of my shirt, trailing down the center of my back. My breast falls from my shirt and a growl emanates from him, sending a rush of power through me. As my entire body heats up, I press myself harder against him.</p><p>\u201cThat was awesome!\u201d Selena squeals, thrusting her hands in the air.</p><p>Seth withdraws from me, removing his hand from my shirt. He pulls the fabric to cover my breast again as Jackson sets Selena down on the concrete. Seth steps away as Selena launches herself at me. Her long, skinny arms wrap around my neck and she almost cuts off my air supply. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you punched a girl for me.\u201d</p><p>She pulls back slightly and presses her (somehow still overly glossed) lips to my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d I whine. \u201cCan we get out of here?\u201d</p><p>Selena frowns. \u201cWhat about the other guys?\u201d</p><p>Jackson shrugs. \u201cThey\u2019re busy. They\u2019ll find their own way home.\u201d</p><p>We cut through the car park and climb into Seth\u2019s car. Selena and Jackson kiss and moan all the way to my apartment and as soon as we pull up I\u2019m out of the car, up my stairs and in my house just to get away from all of the kissing noises. I fetch a bottle of water from the fridge and head to my room. Seth follows closely behind and shuts my door behind him. I sit the water on the bedside table and kick my shoes off while unclipping my earrings. I can hear Selena and Jackson talking and laughing in the next room. Thank God I don\u2019t have work tomorrow because I can see I\u2019m not going to get much sleep tonight. Seth comes up behind me and I tilt my head forward as he unties the knot holding my shirt up. It falls down, exposing my bare breasts. His fingers hook around the hem of my pencil skirt and he drags the zipper down, letting the fabric slip off my body and pool around my feet. I\u2019m naked now. The only piece of cloth that covers me is my flimsy, black lace underwear. I climb across the bed and get under the covers as Seth switches out the light. I hear him pulling off his own clothes before he climbs into bed. In the darkness, his warm hands run across my flat stomach, making me shudder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been sweating.\u201d I warn him.</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cThat\u2019s okay, the best things in life happen when your sweating.\u201d</p><p>I turn my body toward him, pressing it slightly against his naked chest. My fingers trail up and down his sides, tracing all of his muscular bumps. His hand rests on my hip and I become ravenously hungry for his touch. I kiss him, slowly at first and then I slip my tongue into his mouth. I groan in protest as he pulls away from me. \u201cI want you to come to Concord with me.\u201d</p> <p>I fall back onto my pillow. \u201cSeth, I already said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before you almost knocked out a girl in a club.\u201d</p><p>My fist aches as he speaks. I still can\u2019t believe I did that. That\u2019s not me at all. \u201cJust because I punched someone doesn\u2019t mean I want to be the poster boy for MMA. I should have helped her up... or apologized or something.\u201d</p><p>He laughs once and pulls me closer. \u201cYeah because that would have helped the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you even noticed what was happening with me. The blonde you were sitting with seemed pretty adamant at getting your attention.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugs. \u201cThe blonde was mediocre at best. My attention was on you, all night.\u201d</p><p>I feel heat climb into my cheeks. The thought of someone like Seth wanting me the way he does is exciting.</p><p>\u201cYour dad is coming.\u201d Seth says, changing the subject back to his fight in Concord.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ca\u2014shit.\u201d Dad has high blood pressure. I can\u2019t let him go by himself, what if something happens? \u201cCan you tell Dad he can\u2019t go to Concord with you?\u201d</p><p>Seth pushes himself up on his elbows. \u201cWhat? No, I can\u2019t tell him that. Poor guy will be devastated.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, pulling Seth back down. \u201cHe has high blood pressure and I\u2019m a little worried about him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou could come and keep an eye on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at you manipulating the situation to get what you want.\u201d I exhale. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>Seth crushes me to him, squeezing so hard my ribs begin to ache. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Now that I\u2019ve caved for him, I\u2019m done talking. I want to be physical. I can feel my insides pulsating with need and I curl my fingers under the hem to his shorts. I tug on them slightly, letting him know exactly what I want. Instantly, I feel him go hard and stab into me. Hot desire burns through me, but Seth seems more reserved. He takes my hands from his shorts while groaning. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m taken aback. \u201cYou can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a fight coming up and I don\u2019t usually have sex before a fight. It helps my levels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had sex yesterday. I don\u2019t think one day is going to make a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, yesterday I completely forgot. I was too turned on and you were so sure and...\u201d He exhales. \u201cDarryl would kill me if he found out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have to inform him about your sexual adventures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose to fights, yeah. I don\u2019t agree that sex changes the way I fight, but until I make it to pro, he wants me to be committed to the way he does things. Sadly, it was a hell of a lot easier before I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that sucks.\u201d I pout.</p><p>His hands skim over my breasts, making me shudder before he traps his hands under his pillow. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>Since sex isn\u2019t on the menu, I shift my position and press my back against Seth\u2019s chest. I close my eyes, ignoring the need that pulses between my thighs. It seems I have to wait. If he hadn\u2019t teased me all night with his touching and his kissing I\u2019d be fine right now. My eyelids become heavy and as sleep is about to take me, I distinctly hear moaning. Seth and I rise up at the same time, straining our ears to hear if it\u2019s coming from the lounge room or next door. Through the thin plaster, I hear Jackson groan Selena\u2019s name and her moan in response. OH MY GOD! My poor couch! I don\u2019t think they realize how loud they\u2019re being.</p><p>Thump.</p><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><p>Thump.</p><p>The thumping and the moaning goes on for ages, preventing me from falling asleep. After twenty minutes Seth managed to fall asleep. He seems used to the off-putting noises. Not me. I lie awake until the sun barely seeps around the edges of the curtain. Hours. I\u2019m certain they fucked for hours and now they\u2019re both satisfied and sleeping it off. Meanwhile, I\u2019m still awake, still sexually frustrated and I leave for Concord tonight.</p><p>Great.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>It\u2019s well past eleven p.m. when I wake up. Seth is still sleeping soundly beside me and I don\u2019t move, instead I watch him for a little while. My white sheets are rolled down to his hips, exposing all of his muscles and his tattoos. I\u2019ve never wanted a tattoo. They\u2019ve always seemed so... dirty to me, but they compliment Seth. His face is free of any extreme emotion, he looks so peaceful and I want to touch his beautiful face, but don\u2019t. I\u2019d hate to wake him.</p><p>I can feel my bladder tighten inside me. I really need to pee, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m leaving this room by myself. I don\u2019t want to see Jackson and Selena all tangled together in a big ball of recent sex on my couch. Squeezing my legs together, I reach under my bed and pull out my laptop. I power it on and soon I\u2019m staring at the wallpaper of Blade and I. I really need to change it... and I do. I change it to a picture of a kitten trying to eat a huge ball of wool. It\u2019s cute.</p><p>I switched on my laptop so I can keep writing my short story, but the need to pee is too strong and I can\u2019t think about anything else. I close the lid and slide it back under my bed. I\u2019m going to have to be brave and leave my room. I pull Seth\u2019s shirt over my bare skin and my feet abandon the warm carpet as I step onto the cold wood floor. On my tip toes, I slowly make my way to the toilet. I keep my eyes in front of me at all times, not daring to let them wander toward the lounge room. After I pee, I feel a million pounds lighter and when I enter my room Seth\u2019s adorable sleepy face blinks at me.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what time it is?\u201d He points at my white alarm clock.</p><p>\u201cYeah... we overslept.\u201d</p><p>He runs his large hands over his face and then through his hair. \u201cDarryl is going to kill me. I missed training.\u201d</p><p>I hear a large thud come from the lounge room and then heavy footsteps. Jackson runs into our room, buttoning his jeans. \u201cShit, Seth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Seth groans, swinging his legs off the edge of the bed and grabbing his jeans. He pulls his phone out of the back pocket and curses under his breath. He puts it to his ear.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Darryl\u2014 I know. Yes. Alright.\u201d</p><p>He drops his phone to the floor and falls backward on the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he say?\u201d Jackson asks, raking his fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cManagement is pissed and I have to do double tonight before we leave for Concord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy enough.\u201d Jackson shrugs and I frown.</p><p>Easy enough for who? Seth will be the one doing all the work.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m starving, you guys wanna\u2019 grab some breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, give us a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Jackson leaves the room and closes the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I say, even though going out wasn\u2019t my idea. At all.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d He replies, pulling himself up to a sitting position. His eyes rake me in his t-shirt and he tugs on the base of it, drawing me closer. \u201cYou look good in my shirt.\u201d</p><p>I smile as he spins me, pushing me down on my back. His hands caress my hip and then move up to my breasts, lifting the shirt as he goes. His mouth claims me and his tongue glides against my lips. I open my mouth to him and he touches me and tastes me with his tongue. Soon, his mouth falls from mine as he becomes distracted by the sight of my breasts. He takes my nipple in his mouth and I shudder at the feeling.</p><p>\u201cSeth...\u201d I moan breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>His lips release my nipple to kiss me all over my chest. He makes a light trail down the center of my body, stopping at my belly button. \u201cI can\u2019t, but you can.\u201d</p><p>My hands push through his hair, and I let his soft strands glide between my fingertips. Seth looks up at me, smiling his smile and making my stomach clench. His eyes are still locked with mine as he reaches out with his tongue, running the warm edge of it along my panty line. I shiver and he grins as both his hands caress each side of my thigh before hooking under the hem of the fabric of my underwear and pulling them off me. I tense as his hand slides down my leg, and then curls around my knee. My breath catches in my throat as he lifts my leg, laying it over his shoulder. His chocolate eyes darken and remain on my face.</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d He growls between my thighs.</p><p>A thick finger slides between my moist folds and I moan as quietly as I can. His fingers push into me and curl up, forcing air from my lungs. He lowers his mouth and as soon as his tongue touches my center... I\u2019m lost.</p><p>The waiter brings our breakfast and he looks at us strangely because it\u2019s twelve thirty in the afternoon. Selena and Jackson ordered an eggs Benedict plate each and I ordered muesli, yogurt and mixed berries. Breakfast has always seemed to be a fruity/dairy thing for me. Seth\u2019s huge plate of steak, salad and hard-boiled eggs is set down on the table and I turn my nose up at it. How anyone can eat meat before one p.m. is beyond me.</p><p>\u201cYour skin looks amazing, Olivia. You\u2019re glowing. Are you using those creams I got you?\u201d</p><p>I quickly shovel blueberries and muesli into my mouth to buy myself some time. I haven\u2019t told Selena that Seth and I have had sex. A little blueberry juice drops onto my caramel sweater. Damn it. I glance at Seth who watches me from under his brow, smiling that fucking smile. Of course he\u2019ll gladly take the credit for my glow. I fight back my own nervous smile and swallow my food.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not using those creams. I just feel good.\u201d</p><p>Her green eyes flick between Seth and I and then they widen. Shit. She\u2019s put two and two together and she\u2019s going to kick my ass. Seth isn\u2019t even trying to hide it. He sits before me in the shirt he licked me in and it\u2019s rumpled and he doesn\u2019t care\u2014not in the slightest. I can feel heat climb into my cheeks and I drop my gaze back down to my breakfast. I really don\u2019t want to talk about my sex life over breakfast\u2014or lunch, technically.</p><p>\u201cHey, Olivia.\u201d Blade\u2019s voice makes me turn around in my chair.</p><p>Oh joy.</p><p>I shade my eyes from the sun. \u201cBlade?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m unnerved when my gaze falls onto his chest and I see we\u2019re wearing the same colored sweater. What are the odds?</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you for a minute?\u201d He asks, glancing down at my sweater and smirking.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having breakfast.\u201d Selena protests while pulling on my wrist.</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d He deadpans. \u201cIt\u2019ll only take a second, I promise.\u201d</p><p>I look back at the table. Seth\u2019s eyes are narrowed in on Blade, Selena is glaring at me and Jackson is happily eating his food, ignoring everything that\u2019s going on around him. I slide my chair back and Blade\u2019s arm hooks around mine as he directs me away from the table. When he\u2019s sure we\u2019re out of ear shot, he speaks.</p><p>\u201cI spoke to your dad. Are you really going to Concord?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah, we leave today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlly, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you didn\u2019t track me down to beg me not to leave town with Seth. It\u2019s only two nights.\u201d</p><p>He raises his palms at me in surrender. \u201cI didn\u2019t track you down. I ran into you by chance, I swear. Anyway, that\u2019s not why I want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>I fold my arms over my chest. \u201cThen what do you want?\u201d</p><p>He holds a little red box out in front of him. I stare at it, but I don\u2019t take it from his hands. \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not opening it.\u201d</p><p>He exhales and grabs my hand. He puts the velvet box inside it and steps away from me.</p><p>\u201cOpen it when I\u2019m not around then.\u201d He pulls me into a hug and I stiffen under him. Seth is probably fuming right about now. Without another word Blade walks away from me, crosses the road and climbs into his white car. I drag my gaze from Blade\u2019s car to the table. Every single one of their eyes is on me and the little red box in my hand. My sneakers scuff against the concrete as I slowly make my way back to the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is that?\u201d Selena asks oh-so elegantly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know I haven\u2019t opened it.\u201d I drop into my chair.</p><p>\u201cSo open it.\u201d She demands.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m going to put it in his mailbox later. He wouldn\u2019t take it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I know what it is.\u201d Selena mutters. \u201cManipulative prick.\u201d</p><p>I nod. I do too... it\u2019s a ring. Months ago, I told Blade I thought I\u2019d be engaged or married by now\u2014maybe even pregnant. He laughed at me and told me I was way too young for that. I told Selena about it that very same day.</p><p>I have no idea what to think about the ring. He didn\u2019t specifically say it\u2019s for marriage or whatever. Even if it was, that option is so far removed with him it\u2019s not even funny. I don\u2019t want to date him let alone marry him. I finally look at Seth. He\u2019s leaning to the side in his chair, rubbing a finger along his bottom lip\u2014clearly in thought.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what it is.\u201d I say to Selena. \u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>I shove the box into my handbag and continue to eat my breakfast.</p><p>\u201cBurn that sweater when you get home.\u201d Jackson laughs, shoving toast into his mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He found it very funny, but as far as everyone else is concerned the happy breakfast we had before was gone. We ate in silence, making small talk wherever they deemed necessary.</p><p>Once it\u2019s over, Seth drives us home and I make it just in time for the mechanic. Selena stays to keep me company, but Jackson and Seth have to leave to prepare for Concord tonight. Seth asks Selena if she wants to come to Concord and she completely flips out, screaming yes and kissing Jackson with everything she has.</p><p>While the mechanic works on my car, Selena helps me choose and appropriate outfit for tonight. I pull out a pair of black formal pants and a white silk top, but Selena tosses them to the side.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t play sophisticated and hard to get now that he\u2019s had you. You have to play sexy and unforgettable to keep him.\u201d</p><p>I scoff. \u201cSelena, you are\u2014\u201d</p><p>She raises her hand. \u201cShoosh, you. I know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>Selena pushes me aside and leans into my wardrobe, in seconds she produces a short, black dress. \u201cWhy is this at the back of your closet and not the front?\u201d</p><p>Because Blade bought it for me.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I lie. \u201cBut I\u2019m not wearing it.\u201d</p><p>It really is a gorgeous dress. The lacy fabric splices off the shoulder, styled with short lace sleeves and it\u2019s a slim fit. Blade has an obsession with lace and I have no idea why.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sexy.\u201d States Selena, holding it out in front of her.</p><p>I rake my hands over my face. \u201cFine. Throw it in.\u201d</p><p>She squeals and puts my dress inside my travel bag. Our trip to Concord is only tonight and tomorrow night so there\u2019s no need to pack heavy. I laugh once at the thought of trying to tell that to Selena.</p><p>There\u2019s a knock on my door and I go to meet the mechanic. He hands me an invoice and nods his head before leaving. I look at the yellow slip. It says there was a problem with my alternator, which prevented my car from turning on. Thankfully he fixed it and my car is ready to go. Selena tears from my house with my travel bag in her hands.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go. I need time to go through my closet! I\u2019ll meet you in the car.\u201d</p><p>Before I lock the door behind me, I remember I need to call Mason to let him know I won\u2019t be at work Tuesday or Wednesday. I dial his number and he answers immediately.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMason, hi. It\u2019s Olivia. I\u2019m calling to let you know that I won\u2019t be able to make work on Tuesday or Wednesday...\u201d</p><p>He exhales. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll get someone to cover you. Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah I\u2019m just not going to be in town until late Wednesday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess, you\u2019re going out of town with Seth.\u201d</p><p>I shut my door and lock it behind me. \u201cAnd Selena.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOlivia, did you learn nothing from Saturday? Seth obviously isn\u2019t the kind of guy that can be there for you. What happens when he finds someone else? I don\u2019t want you to go through the same things again. You deserve better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your concern, but I can handle myself. I\u2019ll see you Thursday.\u201d I hang up on him and climb into my car.</p><p>\u201cMan,\u201d I blow air out of my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m so sick of people sticking their nose into my business.\u201d</p><p>I drop my phone into the cup holder next to me and turn the car on. I smile widely when it purrs to life.</p><p>\u201cWell then you\u2019re going to hate what I have to say next.\u201d</p><p>I pull out of my driveway and head in the direction of Selena\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you and Seth start having sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaturday.\u201d I reply straight out, ignoring the way she picks at her nails.</p><p>\u201cAnd when were you going to tell me?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cAt some point. We haven\u2019t had sex since then.\u201d</p><p>She drops her hands into her lap. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he can\u2019t before a fight, apparently.\u201d</p><p>Selena laughs to herself. \u201cThat must suck.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t comment because it does suck. It sucks hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to waiting with Jackson? Weren\u2019t you meant to have dinner first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but the opportunity arose last night and I took it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, thanks for that.\u201d</p><p>Her hands cover the red flush that spreads over her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, O. I didn\u2019t think we were that loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were.\u201d I\u2019m smiling and I can feel a laugh creep up my throat.</p><p>The more I try not to laugh, the faster it rises and I end up laughing loudly almost all the way to Selena\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so hilarious.\u201d She mocks me, flipping me off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t believe you had sex on my couch.\u201d Tears drop from my eyes. \u201cLike, who does that?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I find it so hilarious, but I do. Maybe it\u2019s the fact they were so shameless about it.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She states, crossing her arms. \u201cI live on the edge.\u201d</p><p>I pull up in front of Selena\u2019s big house. Big is an understatement. Her house is gigantic\u2014much too big for only to people to live in. As a teenager, Selena\u2019s house was my haven. I never wanted to leave\u2014it\u2019s also the place I lost my virginity to Blade. A memory I\u2019m more than ready to forget. Selena still lives with her daddy and she loves it. He gives her money, keeps the fridge full and doesn\u2019t care what she does as long as she\u2019s responsible. I remind her often that she needs to start living on her own two feet, but she doesn\u2019t care. She likes where she is.</p><p>When I get out of the car, I text Seth Selena\u2019s home address. I don\u2019t know when he\u2019ll be here, but I know it\u2019s soon and I hope Selena can pack quickly. I follow Selena in through the huge double wooden doors and into the foyer. We quickly make our way up the winding staircase and the third door on the left is her room. She\u2019s changed it around a bit since I was last here. The wooden king size bed is on a small raise to the left of the room, shrouded in sheer curtains of every color. In the center of the room are two white couches that sit upon brown shaggy rugs and in the middle of that is a large glass coffee table. None of the colors in her room match, making everything seem out of place, but at the same time... it looks awesome.</p><p>\u201cRemind me why I don\u2019t live here?\u201d I gasp, pushing past her and into the room.</p><p>She puts on her best \u2018Olivia\u2019 voice. \u201cBecause you\u2019re an adult and you like living on your own two feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound nearly as fun when you say it like that.\u201d I say, dropping into one of the couches and running my hands over its leather surface.</p><p>Selena runs into her walk in wardrobe and returns with a simple pair of tight black jeans and a grey sweater in her hands. \u201cWhat do you think of this?\u201d</p><p>I stare wide-eyed at her. \u201cYou chastised me for wanting to wear silk and you want to wear denim?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze falters and she flops into the other couch with a huff.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask, leaning forward. \u201cIf you want to wear the denim, who am I to stop you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that...\u201d She tugs at the tag at the back of the jeans. \u201cI overheard Jackson telling his friend last night that he thinks I overdo it sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can vouch for that.\u201d I chuckle, wiggling my eyebrows.</p><p>Selena launches her sweater at me and the soft fabric collides with my face before dropping to my lap. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about that! I\u2019m talking about my clothes, my make-up and probably my hair, too.\u201d</p><p>I lean back against the white leather. \u201cAre you sure? Maybe you miss heard him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d She inches forward. \u201cMake me like you\u2014just for the next two days and I\u2019ll show him I can be normal.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Selena Graham wants fashion advice from me? Did hell just freeze over?</p><p>\u201cHonestly, there isn\u2019t much to it. Dress for comfort, not to impress. Wear the skinny jeans, but not this God awful sweater. Color is key.\u201d</p><p>She scowls at me. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this for a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must be special.\u201d</p><p>I see a pink hue spread across her chest and up her neck.</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d She shrugs and climbs to her feet.</p><p>I smile knowingly at her. She has never cared what a boy thought about her before Jackson. I know she cares about him more than she lets on.</p><p>Selena packs a small travel bag with two pairs of jeans, two white spaghetti straps, one beige cardigan and two sweaters. One is a pretty, light-blue and the other is a strange shade of pink. On top of her clothes she throws in a hair straightener and a make-up bag smaller than mine. She really is trying to make a statement.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s wait downstairs.\u201d She says after changing into a black track suit. \u201cIf I stay in this room any longer I\u2019m going to regress.\u201d</p><p>I grab Selena by the wrist and drag her from her room. As our feet touch the marble tiles of the foyer a loud ring echoes through the house. Selena slides her handbag up her arm and stuff her hands into the pockets of her pants. I can tell wearing a track suit out of the house is going to kill her.</p><p>\u201cI feel like an idiot.\u201d She grumbles.</p><p>\u201cRelax, you look fine.\u201d</p><p>I open the door to Jackson and Seth. They\u2019ve changed their clothes, too. Jackson wears a loose pair of drawstring pants and a t-shirt. He looks comfortable, but Seth looked amazing in his black hooded jacket and loose jeans. It isn\u2019t open and exposing his midsection like it had when we ran into each other at the Steakhouse, but it still made my mouth water nonetheless. Jackson eyes Selena curiously. \u201cAre you feeling alright?\u201d</p><p>Seth and I make eye contact and he gives me a tight smile. He\u2019s still upset about this morning. I can see it in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sick.\u201d Selena snaps. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Jackson and I bite our lips against a laugh, even Seth chuckles. He\u2019s met Selena enough times to know exactly what kind of girl she is. She dresses to impress, anything less is beneath her.</p><p>She flicks her long blonde hair over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m wearing a tracksuit, big deal. You\u2019re all staring at me like I\u2019m some kind of freak with two heads.\u201d</p><p>She pushes her way past Seth and Jackson and heads out to the car. Jackson follows closely behind, squeezing her bum and she swats him away before planting a kiss on his cheek. I smile, they make the perfect couple. Seth turns from me, but I grab his arm\u2014I try to grab his arm, but it\u2019s too dam thick to fit in my hand.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little tired from training, other than that, I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>I close Selena\u2019s freakishly huge door behind me and turn back to Seth. \u201cI just thought that maybe you\u2019re angry at me or something\u2014which I totally understand. I know I ruined breakfast because Blade showed up and all of that, but I didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>Seth reaches out for me and he pulls me into him. His mouth descends upon mine and he\u2019s so warm. I just want to curl up against him and sleep. Cool air caresses my lips when he pulls away and I blink at him, completely dazed.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>A lock of my hair blows onto my face and his fingers swipe it away. \u201cBecause I missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou missed me?\u201d I couldn\u2019t keep the skeptical tone from my voice.</p><p>He smiles. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m capable of missing someone, Olivia. I\u2019m not completely shut off from my emotions.\u201d</p><p>His arms still hold me against him and the need to have him as close to me as I can burns deep inside. \u201cI know... I just never expected to hear words like that come from someone like you.\u201d</p><p>His hands slip away from me and his smile melts into a straight, impassive line. \u201cSomeone like me?\u201d</p><p>Oh shit. Wrong choice of words. \u201cYou know what I mean. You\u2019re you and you don\u2019t really miss girls you sleep with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we clarified that you mean more to me than that?\u201d</p><p>Did we? I mean, he said I was his, but that doesn\u2019t really mean anything. He might not care for titles, but I do. Sex with Seth is great\u2014beyond great\u2014it\u2019s absolutely mind blowing, but eventually I\u2019m going to want a deeper relationship. Sure, he told me that his dad died and that he slept with Mason\u2019s wife, but he refuses to say anything about his mom or sister\u2014I don\u2019t even know their names. He doesn\u2019t talk about his time in Seattle or anything. I don\u2019t know a thing about him, yet he knows so much about me. He knows Blade and Selena. He\u2019s met both my parents and he\u2019s been to my house. The odds stack against his words and I have to play it safe because I do care about him. I like him\u2014more than a friend and I need to be careful because it doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019m going to be in his life for too long.</p><p>\u201cI fall into the \u2018shit you care about\u2019 portion, I know, but...\u201d I shake my head. \u201cLook, let\u2019s just go to Concord, have fun and then sort things out when we come back because I can\u2019t keep playing games. It\u2019s about time I sort my life out.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m unnerved as his tense face studies my features. I know I probably ruined his trip, but I said it and now it\u2019s too late to take it back. I just have to keep reminding myself that I\u2019m going to Concord for Dad, to keep an eye on him and his blood pressure levels, not to get myself in deeper with Seth.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d I ask him, changing the subject and acting like the conversation we just had didn\u2019t take place.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s riding with Darryl and the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of the team, what exactly does Jackson do?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seth stuffs his hands into his jacket pockets. \u201cHe\u2019s my best friend. He helps me keep my head on track.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your Selena.\u201d I state, smiling at him.</p><p>He laughs under his breath, returning my smile with one of his own. \u201cNo. Jackson helps me keep my head screwed on and clear, Selena does the complete opposite to you.\u201d</p><p>I laugh because it\u2019s true. Selena lives so carefree and I envy her.</p> <p>I climb into the back seat with Selena. She looks at me and I almost choke on a laugh. There\u2019s a sticky line of lip gloss running from her lips to the top of her cheekbone. I want to ask how it made it that far up her face, but decide against it. I don\u2019t care for the details. I wipe my thumb along my cheek, trying to show her there\u2019s something on her face, but she doesn\u2019t understand what I\u2019m trying to say. After three tries, I give up.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s lip gloss spread across your face.\u201d I half groan, half giggle.</p><p>The same pink flush that spread over her complexion in her bedroom makes a return and she uses the sleeve of her jacket to wipe it off.</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d I tell her when her skin isn\u2019t shiny anymore.</p><p>\u201cHow long are we going to be driving for?\u201d Selena asks Jackson who seems to enjoy being behind the wheel.</p> <p>\u201cJust under two hours, it depends on traffic.\u201d</p><p>Concord, New Hampshire isn\u2019t that far from Portland, Maine, but if someone decides to crash on the highway, God knows how long it\u2019ll take.</p><p>Jackson reaches for the radio and it tunes to a rock station. As soon as the tires hit the highway, Selena\u2019s eyes close and she falls asleep. I rest my head against her shoulder. A nap sounds good and I\u2019m about to fall asleep when the gentle rock music cuts off and distinct phone ringing echoes through the car. I straighten myself, trying to figure out what the hell the noise is and I see \u2018MOM\u2019 written across the small screen in the center of the dashboard. Jackson glances sideways at Seth. Seth\u2019s finger taps his leg as he contemplates answering it. After five or six rings, he leans forward and hits ignore. The music starts up again.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to talk to your mom?\u201d I ask, even though I know it\u2019s best to mind my own business.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story, Olivia.\u201d Jackson answers for him. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to talk to her right now.\u201d</p><p>The way he spits \u2018her\u2019 makes me lean closer. \u201cMaybe she wants to wish him luck.\u201d</p> <p>Seth laughs once and turns his attention out the window. Jackson\u2019s jaw clenches and his knuckles go white as he squeezes the steering wheel. I\u2019ve hit a sore subject.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019ll mind my own business.\u201d I mumble, sitting back against my seat.</p><p>Seth turns off the music and speaks over his shoulder. \u201cMy mother doesn\u2019t want to wish me luck. She\u2019s doesn\u2019t care about anyone but herself. She\u2019ll say whatever she can to get inside my head and I don\u2019t need to deal with her shit right now.\u201d</p><p>He turns the music back on, leaving me staring at the side of his face. He knows I\u2019m watching him, I can tell by the way his jaw muscles flex uncomfortably. Suddenly, I\u2019m frustrated that he seems so bothered by his mom\u2019s phone call. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as simple as \u2018she\u2019s a bitch\u2019. There\u2019s more to it. My need to know attitude eats at me, but I know approaching Seth with any questions about his family sends him into angry mode and I can\u2019t piss him off this close to a fight. I rest my head back against Selena\u2019s shoulder and close my eyes. I want her to wake up so she can clear the awkward, frustrated tension that\u2019s floating around the car.</p><p>We pull up outside a fancy hotel in Concord. Darryl, my father and two others are already here. When they see our car, they come straight over. Dad opens my door before the car comes to a complete stop and pulls me into a hug.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d come.\u201d He laughs and I can\u2019t help but smile up at him. Being in this environment with Seth and the others makes him the happiest I\u2019ve ever seen him. It warms my heart to know he\u2019s getting everything he wants out of life. He releases me as his phone rings.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your mother.\u201d He rolls his eyes. \u201cI better take this.\u201d</p><p>He walks away and I can feel Seth press slightly against my back. My whole body stands to attention.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s so happy.\u201d I sigh.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I turn around and he\u2019s so close to me. I can smell his cologne and feel the warmth that radiates from him. I look up and meet his dark, alluring eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell him I\u2019m here to keep an eye on him. He\u2019ll be happier if he thinks I\u2019m here solely for you.\u201d I tell Seth.</p><p>That\u2019s another thing that kills me. If things don\u2019t work out between Seth and I, if we decide to end the fun and go our separate ways, my dad is going to be heartbroken. Dad looks up to Seth. He represents everything my dad loves.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell him, but you have to do something for me.\u201d He rakes his teeth across his bottom lip and then runs his tongue along it\u2014the same tongue that ran along my flesh this morning. I shiver at the thought and his eyes flare with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d The thought of his answer makes my insides tighten.</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>He smiles at my confused expression and I glance awkwardly around us. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow is as good a time as ever.\u201d</p><p>His hands wrap around my waist, pulling me even closer so our bodies are pressed hard against each other. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s actually giving me a choice. His head angles downward, towards mine and I cautiously wrap my hands around his neck. His skin is warm and he doesn\u2019t flinch at my cool fingertips. Our lips touch and I feel a spark go through my entire body, embarrassingly I gasp and pull back. I stare into Seth\u2019s eyes wondering if he felt it too, but all I see is that same cocky gleam that I adore so much. He brings his mouth to my ear and his warm breath sends heat between my legs. \u201cYou want me so badly.\u201d</p><p>I try to shake my head, but my neck won\u2019t let me. I did want him. I want to do what we did on Saturday and I want to do it now. He knew, too. The longer I look at him the cockier his smile becomes. His firm lips, touch my cheek and he lets me go. When I turn back to my father, he\u2019s talking to another group of guys and I recognize the leader as Don Russell. Don\u2019s eyes are on Seth and I and he\u2019s glaring. I look at Seth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you wanted me to kiss you? So Don could see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been staring at you since we got out of the car.\u201d He takes my hand in his and brings it to his lips. \u201cI\u2019m just making a statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re declaring open season on me.\u201d</p><p>I stand in the corner of Seth\u2019s room while two officials assess his hand wraps. I try to focus on what the two men are saying, but I can\u2019t ignore the way Seth has been staring at me since I entered the room. His eyes are as dark as midnight, flashing dangerously at me from several feet away. They command attention, keeping me trapped in his gaze and it\u2019s distracting. I know my dress is nice, but the way Seth looks at me with heavy, lust-filled eyes makes me feel like I\u2019m standing here naked. He\u2019s not touching me, just watching and I\u2019m already beyond aroused. His chest moves quickly and all I want to do is touch him to help ease his anxiety.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Seth.\u201d The official announces, packing up his mini toolbox. \u201cYou\u2019re all set. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>The two officials stride from the room in their white uniforms.</p><p>\u201cLeave us alone.\u201d Seth orders his team\u2014just like last time.</p><p>When the door closes behind them, I Instinctively move toward him and he mirrors my movements, his motions becoming almost predatory with every step. My insides clench and I brace for impact as his mouth slams onto mine and he lifts me onto the bench. He\u2019s between my legs in the next heartbeat, his tongue desperately tasting me. His clothed hands pull my dress up over my hips, exposing my black, lace panties. Hunger, deep and primitive rushes through me as he tugs his pants down and his long, hard length springs out. It eagerly presses against my inner thigh and I quiver as he pulls my underwear to the side. One hand wraps around my waist, the other clasps underneath my thigh and with one swift thrust he\u2019s deep inside me, filling me completely.</p><p>\u201cOh God!\u201d I moan into his mouth as I stretch to accommodate him.</p><p>My back arches and I plant my hands on the cool bench beside me to gain stability. I feel my walls clench him tightly and he leans into me. His tongue glides across my collar bone and then comes up to dip inside my mouth, eliciting a moan from me.</p><p>\u201cYou look so fucking good.\u201d He breathes, moving his hips harder and faster into me.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t...\u201d I whisper breathlessly, clinging tightly to his sides. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this before a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but you look so sexy.\u201d He gasps loudly and thrusts deeper. \u201cI had to be in you.\u201d</p><p>His hand grips my hip as he anchors me to the bench. His thrusts are quick and hard, and I bite my bottom lip against the cries threatening to spill out of me. My lip aches. I\u2019m biting with enough pressure to draw blood.</p><p>Every muscle in Seth\u2019s body seems clenched in an effort to stay in control and he\u2019s gazing down at me through heavy, lust-laden lids. His jaw is slack with the intensity of his pleasure and I don\u2019t want him to stop. Fuck. I really don\u2019t want him to stop, but he needs all of the testosterone he can get. Reluctantly, I push against his stomach with my fists, slowing his thrusting speed. When he slows, I shift my hips backward so he falls out of me. He groans, resting his forehead against mine.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re continuing this the moment my fight is over.\u201d He pants, forcing his tongue back into my mouth.</p><p>His hands rake through my hair, urging my lips against his and when he pulls away, I say the only thing I can say. \u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>Half-heartedly, Seth steps back giving me room to slide off the bench and adjust my dress while he pulls his shorts up. Everything I felt when he was inside me still flares relentlessly and I can tell, just by looking at his face, that if I don\u2019t get out of here now, we\u2019ll end up all over each other again.</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d I say, walking toward the door.</p><p>When I open it, the team members outside are none the wiser. They have absolutely no idea what happened seconds ago on the other side of that thin, wooden door. Thankfully, Dad prefers to sit in the crowd with me and not in the room with Seth. I keep my head down as I make my way down the concrete walkway. I can hear the crowd now and the thought of being out of this blood and sweat smelling hallway made me feel better... until Don Russell steps out of his room and directly into my path. Instantly, the wetness between my legs dries up and I fight the urge to scowl.</p><p>\u201cReally? Again?\u201d I groan, trying to step around him, but he doesn\u2019t let me.</p><p>I drag my gaze from his lower stomach to his face. Blood splatters his chest and he\u2019s covered in a layer of oily sweat. The eyes of dragon tattoo that curls around his bicep glistens at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m attracted to pretty things.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cYeah, okay pal.\u201d</p><p>I try to step around his large frame again, but his blood covered arm shoots outwards and I back away, careful not to get any on my dress.</p><p>\u201cBack off, Don.\u201d I growl, narrowing my eyes at him.</p><p>His lips curl into a smirk. \u201cI like how you say my name. It\u2019s passionate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mistake my disgust for passion.\u201d</p><p>He leans into me and I swear I can smell the coppery scent of his opponent\u2019s blood on his breath.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the deal with you two, hm? In Portland he claimed you weren\u2019t his, but now he\u2019s singing a different tune.\u201d</p><p>His green eyes shimmer with determination and I shudder. There\u2019s no way I could ever choose this animal over Seth.</p><p>\u201cI am his.\u201d The words that roll of my lips thrill me, but I don\u2019t let it show. \u201cI\u2019m sorry your girlfriend cheated on you with Seth.\u201d He flinches. \u201cYeah, I know all about it and maybe that\u2019s why you\u2019re being so disrespectful to me. Whatever the reason, know this; I\u2019m not like that girl. I\u2019m not interested in you. I will never be interested in you and you are out of your God damn mind if you think I\u2019d ever choose you over Seth.\u201d</p><p>He blinks at me like I\u2019ve said something in another language. A few more seconds and his confused expression melts into a wolfish grin. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. If Seth wins tonight, he\u2019ll be fighting in Boston and if he wins that, he\u2019ll be fighting me in Las Vegas for the amateur championship. I\u2019ve been waiting a long time to punch in his pretty face.\u201d He steps closer and my spine aches as I strain to lean away from him. \u201cAnd when I do, you\u2019ll realize you need a real man, not a boy.\u201d</p><p>My face scrunches and I use two fingers to pat his slick, wet shoulder. \u201cWhatever helps you sleep at night.\u201d</p><p>His thin lips contort into a snarl. I\u2019ve pissed him off\u2014crap. I open my mouth to excuse myself, but Seth\u2019s intro music cuts off my words. I turn to back to see him coming out of his door and I feel Don hovering too close to my backside. As he draws nearer, I expect him to keep walking past\u2014his intro song is playing after all, but his gloved hand shoots out, taking me by the wrist. He pulls me next to him. His grasp is possessive and commanding as he tucks me under his arm, pinning me to his side. Seth smirks at Don, dragging me along beside him. The closer we get to the door, the harder I dig my heels in. I can\u2019t go out there with Seth. Sensing my unease, Seth stops before the double doors and Jackson and Darryl get up in his ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Get out there!\u201d They yell, but he doesn't hear them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pulls his mouth piece out and leans in to my ear. \u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d He shouts over the music and I shake my head.</p><p>With a swift nod, he gives me to Darryl who passes me off to Jackson. I frown, feeling like a damn pass the parcel. The doors open and Seth puts his black guard back into his mouth and bounces on his toes before storming down the aisle to the ring. Jackson ushers me along beside him and I freeze when eyes from the crowd settle on me. They\u2019re still cheering and whooping, so I guess that\u2019s a good sign. I drop my sight to the floor as Jackson walks me along the front of the room behind Seth. When I see an opening near Dad and Selena, I take it. I speed walk all the way to my seat and sit down. My stomach is in knots. Being watched by so many people is unnerving.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering when you were coming back.\u201d Dad chuckles.</p> <p>Selena hands him a twenty dollar bill and I arch an eyebrow at her.</p><p>\u201cHe said you were with Seth, I bet him twenty dollars that you were in the toilet throwing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs her shoulders and I glance around the crowd. There are so many \u2018Team Seth\u2019 signs and other cards with naughty comments on them. One in particular caught my eye. It\u2019s a huge square piece of cardboard painted a fluorescent orange and in big black letters it says: \u2018Pound me, Seth.\u2019</p><p>Selena must have seen it too because her elbows dig into my ribs and she points it out, laughing like a school girl who has read the word \u2018cock\u2019 for the first time. I giggle, not because I find it funny, but because women actually have the guts to put themselves out there like that. When Seth is in the ring and he shrugs out of his hoodie, Dad launches himself to his feet. He fist pumps and stomps his feet. He\u2019s yelling words of encouragement and all I can think of is how to stop him. All that excitement can\u2019t be too good on his heart. I tug on his hand and he sits back down in his seat.</p> <p>\u201cI bet I can watch the fight longer than you can stay in your seat.\u201d I challenge him.</p><p>His brows draw together curiously. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you twenty dollars. You stay in your seat and I\u2019ll watch the fight. The first to rise out of their chair or close their eyes loses.\u201d</p><p>My dad is a very competitive man and I know without a doubt he\u2019ll take the bet.</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>We shake hands and Seth\u2019s music turns off.</p> <p>\u201cAnd nooow, fighting out of the blue corner, hailing from Las Vegas, Nevada, Adam Piiiine!\u201d</p><p>The announcer rattles off names of sponsors and then hands it over to the referee. He calls them to the center of the ring.</p><p>\u201cAs usual, I want a good clean fight and I won\u2019t tolerate anything less. Touch gloves.\u201d</p><p>They touch gloves and the referee sends them to their corners. The referee claps his hands and the two fighters run to the middle of the ring. Adam isn\u2019t afraid to throw the first punch and he comes out swinging. Seth manages to dodge them all and dropping low slamming his fists into Adam\u2019s ribs. I can hear the air expel from his lungs every time Seth\u2019s fists make contact. My chest aches and I try to force as much air into my lungs as I can. Seth bounces on his toes, ducking and dodging. Catching a break, Adam takes a step back to catch his breath. His eyes are wide and every now and then they flick over the crowd. He\u2019s scared and Seth knows it too, I can tell by the way his eyes narrow confidently in on him. Knowing he can\u2019t stand toe to toe with Seth, Adam goes for Seth\u2019s legs. With a loud thud, Seth drops to his knees and sprawls with his legs, countering the take down. Adam falls flat on his stomach, and Seth somehow wraps his arms around his neck and pulls. Immediately, Adam\u2019s face goes red, but he refuses to tap out. The red hue quickly turns blue and my hands fly up to my cheeks. Dad looks at me, but I haven\u2019t lost yet. My hands inch closer to my eyes as Seth squeezes harder. The referee gets in Adam\u2019s face. He\u2019s talking to him and Adam can barely shake his head. My heart slams against my ribs and the urge to vomit rises inside my stomach.</p><p>\u201cJesus...\u201d I huff, raking my fingers through my hair.</p><p>The crowd is chanting now. \u201cTap. Tap. Tap.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s eyes grow heavy and when I\u2019m certain he\u2019s either going to pass out or die, he hastily slaps the floor of the ring. Seth frees the guy from his grasp and jumps to his feet. Darryl, Jackson and two others tear into the ring to congratulate him. He takes the hugs and slaps on the back with modesty and stalks from the ring. His sexy, dark gaze seeks me out and when he spots me, he flicks his head in the direction of his room. Thankfully, Dad is chatting to someone on his left and doesn\u2019t see Seth\u2019s gesture. Selena on the other hand is shaking her head at me with the widest smile I\u2019ve ever seen her do.</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t told me the dirty details.\u201d</p> <p>I slap her leg and she laughs loudly. I don\u2019t want Dad to hear her. He thinks we\u2019re dating which obviously entails sex, but that doesn\u2019t mean he has to hear about it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d I inform her as I push my way onto the aisle and then up into the walkway to Seth\u2019s room. I feel Don\u2019s slimy gaze on me as I pass his room and I keep my eyes ahead of me, focusing only on the door with the \u2018MARC\u2019 sign. My hands are still trembling because of the fight and the door knob shakes in my hand as I turn it. When I step in, a thin sheet of steam envelops me and an electrical current zaps through my entire body when I realize he\u2019s in the shower. I close the door behind me and make my way to the open door of the shower room. My fingertips brush against the moist wood and as I\u2019m about to push the door open, the main door flies open and Seth\u2019s team (including Dad and Selena) pour in. They\u2019re singing and chanting and my arousal diminishes. It seems the sexual urges between Seth and I are going to have to wait. I step away from the door, moving to the far side of the room to stand beside Dad. When Seth emerges from the shower with a white towel hanging low on his hips, he\u2019s wearing the same disappointed expression as me. It\u2019s cute and I smile at him.</p><p>He runs his fingers through his damp hair sending droplets of water in every direction.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all going to Klein\u2019s Bar tonight!\u201d Jackson announces. \u201cGet your dancing shoes on ladies and gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>He pulls Selena into an embrace, claiming her mouth with his. Are they together or do they have a similar arrangement to Seth and I?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to skip this one.\u201d Seth replies, pulling a white t-shirt from his bag and slipping it on over his head. I almost pout when the top half of his body disappears under the fabric. His team (including my dad) protest his decision. If they get any louder I\u2019m convinced my eardrums are going to burst. Dad slings his arm over my shoulders and speaks above the rest. \u201cOlly needs a big strong man to protect her when we go out and God knows I\u2019m too old for that now.\u201d</p><p>I cringe at the use of my nickname and there\u2019s no way my dad is going clubbing. Not in his condition.</p><p>\u201cDad, you\u2019re not going out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell I\u2019m not. Your mom ruined my last outing. I\u2019m going to have fun tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you and I go out instead, Rick? We won\u2019t go drinking or to any strip clubs, but I\u2019m sure we could find something else\u2014like golf.\u201d Seth suggests, pulling his jeans all the way up and buttoning them. He tosses the wet towel aside and air expels from my lips. I\u2019m shocked Seth would even offer to hang out with my dad. Dad loves golf and he loves Seth, I know he\u2019ll have a good time. I glance sideways at Dad and he\u2019s trying not to smile.</p><p>\u201cYou want to play golf? It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve held a club. When was it?\u201d He asks me.</p><p>\u201cChristmas three years ago.\u201d</p><p>The only reason I know that is because I caught Blade having sex with a cart girl that same day. Merry Christmas to me. I squash the thought from my mind. It belongs in the past.</p><p>Everyone is watching my dad and Seth with a big \u2018what the fuck\u2019 expressions. I hope they aren\u2019t going to be pissed off. Seth is the only one that knows my dad has high blood pressure and I know alcohol is going to make it worse. Finally, Dad and Seth agree on golf and leave the room. The team turns their sights to me and I take a slight step back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I\u2019m just as shocked as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, we can party for him.\u201d Jackson states. \u201cWe\u2019ll go back to our rooms, change our clothes and meet in the lobby in an hour.\u201d</p><p>The team spills from the room, chanting and shouting. I follow closely behind them. The last thing I want is to be caught alone with Don again. I just can\u2019t stomach that guy. The fact he has me in his sights as a revenge fuck is disturbing enough. I picture Don\u2019s hands on me and a grimy shiver rolls down my spine. I imagine him to be relentless and brutal with that creepy dragon tattoo smiling at me the whole time. I\u2019d agree to have a threesome with Selena and Jackson before I\u2019d ever consider someone like Don Russell.</p><p>We cram into Darryl\u2019s SVU and he drives us the short distance back to the hotel. There are a few security guards fending off some eager fans and when they see that Seth isn\u2019t with us, they turn around and go away.</p><p>We step into the glamorous lobby. I\u2019d been too tired to appreciate it last night. It\u2019s open, allowing our large group to walk through without bumping into anyone. The deep red carpets and thick red marble columns with gold edging gives it such a sultry, sexy vibe. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d assume I\u2019m in some exotic country. We pile into the elevators and Selena and I are pressed firmly against the far wall.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming out?\u201d She asks me and I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait for Dad and Seth.\u201d</p><p>She nods and I can see she has so many questions for me about Dad and Seth, but doesn\u2019t want to ask in front of everyone\u2014which is a first for her and I appreciate it. As soon as we step out of the elevator and into the hallway the questions flow from her.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you and Seth together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re just having fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe chose to take your dad golfing over partying with his team... that seems pretty serious.\u201d</p><p>Selena pulls the room key from her handbag and unlocks our door.</p><p>\u201cDad has high blood pressure. Seth is spending time with him tonight so he doesn\u2019t drink or get too excited or stressed\u2014I don\u2019t know how it works.\u201d</p><p>I step into the living room of the suite and her brows furrow. \u201cWere you going to tell me if I didn\u2019t ask?\u201d</p><p>The bitterness in her tone didn\u2019t slip by me. She drops her handbag onto the arm of the couch and folds her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I mean, I was going to at some point.\u201d I step toward her. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known your dad since I was a little girl. He\u2019s important to me, too.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right\u2014one hundred percent right. \u201cI\u2019m sorry...it just never came up in conversation and I don\u2019t want him to know I came here for him, not Seth.\u201d</p><p>She drops into the maroon couch. Her long, thin fingers comb through her straightened hair. \u201cYou think I\u2019d tell him?\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows accusingly because I know she\u2019d tell him. Selena repeats everything to everyone. She doesn\u2019t mean any harm by it, but it\u2019s always at the most inappropriate times. Her green eyes roll in their sockets. She knows very well that she has a loose tongue.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do? You can\u2019t follow him around forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can keep an eye on him when he\u2019s around Seth and the boys. The rest of the time Mom will look out for him. I\u2019m sure she has some kind of plan.\u201d</p><p>She plays with the ends of her shiny, blonde hair, like she\u2019s deep in thought.</p><p>\u201cAre you and Jackson together?\u201d I ask, throwing her question back at her.</p><p>Selena shrugs and a smile pulls at her lips. \u201cFor the moment we\u2019re just having fun, but we\u2019ve spoken about it. We want to wait until Seth\u2019s tournament is out of the way and we can spend more time together.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but feel jealous. Selena and Jackson have spent less time together than Seth and I and they\u2019re already contemplating becoming official... what the hell am I doing wrong? Nothing. I assure myself. I\u2019m not even sure I want to be in another relationship. It\u2019s too early, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go to Jackson\u2019s room. I didn\u2019t bring any dresses so this is what I\u2019m going to have to wear to the bar.\u201d She tugs on her white cardigan and cringes. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>She squeezes my arm and leaves the room. I grab my dress by the base and tug it off over my head. After tonight, the only thing that is going to help me sleep is a cold shower.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>It\u2019s very late by the time Dad and Seth come back and I hear them long before they make it to the door. Their voices are low and their laughs melodious. The sound of their deep tones meshing together is music to my ears. I swing my legs over the edge of the couch and drop my book on the coffee table. I glance at the cover, I\u2019m never going to finish Atonement and it\u2019s a shame because it\u2019s really good so far. I rush to the door and manage to get it open before Dad gains access with his key card. They\u2019re both smiling and their eyes are glistening with evidence of their happiness. Seth takes in my black sweat pants and tank top with a subtle pout. He seems disappointed I\u2019m no longer in my dress.</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d I ask Dad as I step aside to let them into the suite.</p><p>They both slip out of their shoes and line them neatly against the wall.</p><p>\u201cWell, Seth won by a long shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your dad gave me a run for my money.\u201d Seth adds, kissing my forehead as he passes me. The action makes me blush. Lately, his actions come across as 'coupley'. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t go out?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, closing the door. \u201cI had no need to.\u201d</p><p>Dad pours himself a glass of water from the bar fridge and clears his throat. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a shower and then I\u2019m going to bed. Thanks again, Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d Seth strolls over to the couches and sits down as Dad waves us both off and disappears into his room.</p><p>I slowly make my way over to the couches and Seth watches me closely. When my eyes meet his, a brilliant, playful smile creeps across his face and when I sit down next to him, he leans closer, his warmth enveloping me.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you like the fight?\u201d He asks me after an elongated silence.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He smiles wider, obviously thrilled by my response. He plants his hand firmly on my upper thigh, igniting the fire I thought I extinguished with the cold shower. He caresses me up and down and we sit in silence, enjoying each other\u2019s company.</p><p>\u201cI thought the guy was going to die.\u201d I add, feeling the need to have a reason for my displeasure.</p><p>Seth laughs loudly and the thought of provoking such a beautiful sound from such a beautiful man intrigues me. I want to do it again and again. He reaches for me, pulling me in closer and I try desperately to keep breathing. \u201cNo one would have let him die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill... it was horrifying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Don want?\u201d He asks, changing the subject abruptly. His smile is still in place, although now it seems forced.</p><p>\u201cRevenge sex, apparently.\u201d</p><p>Seth scoffs, his smile fading and his eyes thinning into slits. \u201cCan you believe the fucking balls on that guy?\u201d</p><p>I cringe. The last thing I want to do is picture Don Russell\u2019s balls. \u201cI could never have sex with him...\u201d I reply, feeling like I should reassure him. \u201cHe\u2019s creepy and his dragon tattoo freaks me out.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m distracted by his gaze. It\u2019s fixated on a small ball of fluff on my pants. He picks at it, trying to pull it off, but his fingers are too thick.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never really cared about my actions... until recently.\u201d He confesses, bringing his attention back to my face. His eyes are cloudy with regret and I\u2019m lost, unsure of what he\u2019s talking about. \u201cMason and now Don. It\u2019s all coming back to bite me in the ass and now that I finally have something I care about... I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to be taken from me. I don\u2019t care what happens to me... but I care what happens to you. I don\u2019t want my past behaviors to reflect negatively upon you. You\u2019re good and I don\u2019t want to taint that.\u201d</p><p>Surely he doesn\u2019t still think I\u2019m good? Especially after all of the naughty stuff we\u2019ve done? I push the thought to the back of my mind. It\u2019s not important right now. I reach out and rub my thumb along the apple of his cheek and then press a tender kiss to his lips. I know for certain now that he has feelings for me and I want to nurture them. I want to make him feel secure and sure that I would never hurt him like that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of shit, O. Who knows what\u2019s going to pop up next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth, I mean it. I don\u2019t care. I know exactly what kind of person you are. I knew the moment I saw you.\u201d</p> <p>His sexiness isn\u2019t exactly subtle. Of course girls want him\u2014hell\u2014boys probably want him, too.</p><p>I slide onto him, grabbing his face between my hands. I don\u2019t know why, but whenever I see him so conflicted. I want to help. I want to make him happy.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve had sex with tons of women, big deal. So you fight people for a living, who cares? It doesn\u2019t mean you don't deserve me. It doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t deserve anything good.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI want to be with you\u2014actually with you, not this friend\u2019s with benefits crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>A sad smile pulls at his lips. \u201cYou can\u2019t lose what you don\u2019t have, right?\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cYes you can. We can\u2019t be like this forever. There are things that I want in life like marriage and children\u2014\u201d Shit. \u201cNot that I\u2019m asking that of you.\u201d I recover quickly. \u201cAnd as much as I enjoy the sex and spending time with you, I can\u2019t wait around for you to decide if you deserve me or not. I need to restart my life...and the sooner the better.\u201d</p><p>He nods slowly, avoiding my eyes. Underneath me, I can feel him tense and become uncomfortable. I exhale and slide off him.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cHow do you ever expect to be happy when you won\u2019t allow yourself to have the things you want?\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what I\u2019m saying... am I trying to pressure him into a relationship I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d He says finally. \u201cI\u2019m scared that once I let you in, you\u2019ll run the other way.\u201d</p><p>I try all I can to keep my expression calm, but I laugh once at his comment. \u201cI think I\u2019ve seen the worst of it by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t. My world is messed up, Olivia. The part of my world that you\u2019re experiencing is the good part. The other part is fucking complicated.\u201d</p><p>I exhale. Ending the conversation here is probably my best option. If I push any further, it\u2019ll do more damage than good.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I say, resigning. \u201cI won\u2019t pressure you.\u201d</p><p>His fingers curl around my hand and he pulls me closer. I\u2019m starting to feel like we\u2019re playing an annoying game of tug of war with each other. He\u2019s so close I can feel his breath on my cheek and his dark eyes seem to bore into me, as if he\u2019s trying to understand something.</p><p>\u201cYou need answers and I\u2019ll give them to you, I promise, but it has to be on my terms and when I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>His words scare me. What exactly goes on his world that is so bad he can\u2019t tell me? I know I should see it as a warning sign, but I\u2019m compelled to know his story. I want to know him because I like him\u2014more than like him\u2014and I want to help. I want him to be happy.</p><p>Seth sets his hands low on my hips and pulls me onto him. Another round of fire pulses through me, melting me. He dips his head, placing kisses on my neck and I let out a small moan as I reach for his hair, letting the strands slip between my fingers.</p><p>\u201cI want you so bad.\u201d He groans.</p><p>Five words are all it takes to completely soak my underwear and I\u2019m good to go. I need him and if I don\u2019t get him I just know I\u2019m going to be sitting in the bathroom under the cold shower all night.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to my room.\u201d I suggest, my voice quiet and husky.</p><p>I slide off of him and tug on his hand. His dark eyes flicker to my father\u2019s bedroom door and then back to my face. \u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t know. We\u2019ll be quiet and you can leave straight after, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s gaze drags back to my father\u2019s door and then back to my face. I tug on his arm a little harder and he rises to his feet. \u201cFine, but if we get busted I\u2019m the victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>He follows closely behind me and into my room. I flick the light switch on, revealing my big, mahogany double bed and dark paneled walls. On the floor is a chocolate brown rug and I think it\u2019s meant to replicate bear fur, but I can\u2019t tell. I spent a good twenty minutes this morning caressing it with my toes. The room gives off a cabin in the mountains kind of feel\u2014it\u2019s romantic, really. All that\u2019s missing is a fireplace and a giant tiger rug\u2014fake tiger, obviously.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the room.\u201d I say, diming the lights and approaching my bed. \u201cIt\u2019s very cozy.\u201d</p><p>I feel him press against my back and I close my eyes. Even so little contact brings me crazy amounts of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not having sex on the bed.\u201d He states, grasping my hips and urging me toward the fluffy rug. I don\u2019t know how I feel about having sex on a rug. A bed has been the only place I\u2019ve had sex... with the exclusion of tonight\u2019s teaser on the bench in Seth\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bad for me.\u201d I chuckle as he kneels down, bringing me with him.</p><p>He grins at me, charmingly and shuffles closer bringing his chest flush against mine. His cocky stare grows dark and seductive as he angles his head and leans nearer. Heat builds inside me, smoldering relentlessly in the pit of my stomach. Only when he presses his lips to mine, it isn\u2019t wild and passionate like it was in the room before the fight. It\u2019s soft... almost loving. Sensations slide smoothly through my body, warming everything and I tense. He pulls back, smiling. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, unable to hide my own smile. His dark, chocolate eyes watch my face as his hands sweep slowly underneath my shirt and across every inch of my stomach. The warmth of his fingertips against my already over-heated skin is a propellant to my actions, and I yank my t-shirt over my head. The rough pads of his hands feel good and I want to feel them all over me. They continue to explore the curve of my waist before moving south over my hips. His thumbs hook under my pants and he drags them down, exposing me completely. The feel of his calloused hands against my body drives me into a near-frenzy, and I can\u2019t fight the moan that escapes me when he presses his full lips to my collar bone. His tongue glides against my flesh and I bite down on my lip to prevent a whimper from escaping. Seth wraps an arm around my waist and he eases me onto my back\u2014the fur rug feels as amazing on my back as it did on my feet. The appreciation of the rug is short lived as Seth freeing the rest of my legs from my pants takes precedence. I watch his face, suddenly nervous as his eyes move gradually up my body. They linger on my breasts, then my lips and finally my eyes. I feel my wetness, leaking warm and slick between my thighs. I\u2019ve never been admired so carefully before. I\u2019ve never started sex off on such a kind, slow note and it saddens me. Why had I continued with Blade for so long? His touch has never been caring, not like Seth\u2019s is right now. Seth shrugs out of his black hoodie and pulls his own shirt off, showing off his beautiful body. I ogle him shamelessly as I allow my vision to trace the chiseled lines of his torso. His hand caresses my ankles then along the straight edge of my shin bone, across the rises and dips of my knee, up the front of my thighs\u2014causing me to shiver\u2014until they finally settle on my hip. He lies next to me, pulling on me and forcing my front against his. I swallow thickly as his fingertips draw small circles on my bare hip.</p><p>\u201cI do care about you.\u201d He whispers, brushing his nose against mine. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think for a second that I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I kiss him back sweetly, savoring every feeling he\u2019s stirring inside me.</p><p>\u201cI know I talk a lot of shit... but I\u2019m serious.\u201d His warm thumb glides over my cheek and then across my bottom lip. \u201cAnd since we can\u2019t be loud for your dad\u2019s sake, let me be gentle. Let me show you how much I care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut tonight you were so determined... so rough.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI know. I saw you in that fucking dress and I couldn\u2019t help myself. I don't want you to see me like that all the time... I don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m using you.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle and clear my throat nervously. \u201cI know you\u2019re not using me. We\u2019ve done things a few times now... and you\u2019re still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a record, by the way.\u201d</p><p>I nudge him playfully and he simpers. \u201cI\u2019m trying change, O. I want to be there for you like you are for me even though I close you out.\u201d</p><p>His eyes catch mine and the over-confident gleam isn\u2019t there. Instead, there\u2019s a kind of uncertainty to his look, like he\u2019s uncomfortable... or nervous.</p><p>\u201cTouch me.\u201d The words tumble from my mouth in a rushed whisper, exciting me in every sense of the term.</p><p>Seth\u2019s eyes flare with pleasure as his hands leaves my face and trail down the side of my body, making me shiver as his fingertips brush over my hip. His brown eyes are glistening and when I look into them, it\u2019s like I\u2019m staring into his soul.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want me to touch you?\u201d He murmurs, gliding a finger up the middle of my stomach and between my breasts.</p><p>\u201cEverywhere.\u201d</p><p>Seth hooks his jean clad leg over me, straddling my hips. His hands caress my sides and then travel north to massage my breasts. His eyes remain on my face as he leans down and takes an already hard nipple between his lips. I whimper, arching my back slightly and pressing further into his mouth. My body trembles with pleasure as Seth\u2019s tongue draws warm and wet circles around my swollen buds. His trail of soft kisses moves over my collar bone and onto the base of my neck while his hands run up the sides of my body, making me twitch a little underneath him. He\u2019s being so sensual, so slow and it\u2019s torture\u2014sweet, sexy torture. My skin tingles when he pulls away and climbs to his feet. He looks down at me and unbuttons his jeans. They fall to the ground and he steps out of them before kicking them to the side. Seth stands there a little while longer, allowing me to appreciate everything about him and the very sight of him and all his hard glory causes the space between my legs to grow hot with moisture. There\u2019s a small smile on his lips as he lowers himself onto me again, pressing his thick thigh muscle between my legs. I squirm against him, trying hard to keep my composure. He holds himself above me, keeping his eyes locked on mine and I can hear my heart pounding in my ears as my breathing turns shallow and quick. Seth, however, is the perfect picture of calm. The only giveaway being his hard length that rests upon my leg.</p><p>I gasp at the sensation as he sucks my nipple between his lips again, running his warm tongue over it. When he releases it, he moves upwards to my mouth and he kisses me until I\u2019m gasping for air. I shift my hips under him, and he smiles down at me. I can\u2019t wait any longer and a quiet laugh falls from his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re impatient.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nod in agreement, opening my thighs as he positions himself between them. His hand comes between us and he uses it to guide himself directly to his goal. He pushes in slowly and an electric current shoots through me. He thrusts a little harder at my gasp causing my fingers dig into his shoulder blades. He pulls back and enters painfully slow again. I press my forehead against his shoulder and muffle my moans against his skin. A fiery burst of need explodes inside my stomach and I bite back a cry, locking my ankles around his waist. The deep moan that rips from Seth is the most erotic thing I\u2019ve ever heard and his movements intensify as he moves deeper inside of me. He groans his pleasure into the nape of my neck as his hand slides between us again, this time his thumb circles my soft clit. I close my eyes and grind my hips into him.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d he half pants, half moans in my ear.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I reply, almost breathlessly.</p> <p>His breath hitches at my confession and claims my mouth with his. His slower thrusts become frantic and needy. After a few moments, he pulls his lips from mine to let me breathe and quickly pushes his head down to tease my nipples with his tongue. I bite back a smile. He\u2019s definitely a boob man. His finger circles me faster as he thrusts deeper. I feel my release getting closer and closer, and I can barely keep my hips from squirming.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d I gasp, running my fingers through his hair. \u201cFuck... oh God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d He rasps.</p><p>My pants and gasps threaten to turn into loud cries and moans, but as my climax spills over, Seth slams his mouth onto mine, kissing me deeply and absorbing all of my noises. I bite down on his bottom lip and he releases a powerful growl from his chest and I knew he, too, has been sent over the edge. Every cell in my body is alive with my passing pleasure, and I rock once more against him as he drops his head into my shoulder.</p><p>After a few seconds, he stiffens and quickly slides out of me. I\u2019m startled and I grab at his arm, but it slides right off. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>His fingers run through his hair. \u201cI was so caught up... I completely forgot protection.\u201d His brown eyes are wide and the after-sex gleam is nowhere to be seen. \u201cThis has never happened to me before... I never forget. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d I say, sitting up. \u201cI\u2019m on the pill and I know you get checked for STD\u2019s all the time because of your work.\u201d</p><p>He frowns at himself. \u201cThose things always fail\u2014the pill, I mean.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cThey\u2019ve worked for the last six years of my life. I\u2019m not going to start worrying now and neither should you.\u201d</p><p>Still trembling from my orgasm, I climb to my feet and go to the shower room. Thankfully, all three rooms have an ensuite. Dad\u2019s room has a spa bath and a shower while mine and Selena\u2019s only have a shower and a toilet. It\u2019s still beautiful and modern with deep mahogany benches and chocolate tiles, not to mention the state of the art glass walled shower, but a bath would\u2019ve been nice.</p><p>I flick on the light and step in. As I make my way over to the shower, I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror and it stops me in my tracks. I\u2019ve never looked so...satisfied before. Thin strands of my long chocolate hair are floating around my head and my cheeks are rosy, like they\u2019ve been pinched. I smile at my too-bright eyes and run my hand over my face. I could get used to this.</p> <p>I step toward the shower and put it on as hot as I can tolerate, letting the thin blades of fire beat across my back. When I get out of the shower I want to be so tired I just crash out. The bathroom door opens and I can only just make out Seth\u2019s large silhouette through the steamed glass. When the shower door opens, cool air rushes in making my nipples harden to maximum point. I quiver and pull him in, quickly. As soon as the door closes I manage to warm up again. Seth reaches around me for the exfoliation sponge and pours a strange pink soap that smells like cucumber and watermelon onto of it. His large hands massage the sponge until it foams and then he turns me away from him. I gasp when I feel his wet, naked body press up against my back. He lathers the sponge and his fingers trail along my shoulders as he brushes my hair over one side. I still feel his fingertips on my bare skin as they fall away and are replaced by the rough pad and warm bubbles. The sponge glides over the base of my neck before gliding in circular motions over my shoulders and between my shoulder blades. I close my eyes as he slides it down the middle of my back, stopping just before my behind begins.</p><p>Seth drags the sponge in rhythmic strokes back to the nape of my neck and runs it down the length of my arms. Soon, I feel the sponge drop to the floor of the shower and I open my eyes as his soapy hands slide around my waist. They easily drift across my stomach and then up underneath my breasts. I happily close my eyes again and rest my head against his chest. I\u2019ve never been washed by someone else before and the thought of someone like Seth doing it arouses me. I can feel my entire upper body soaped and thoroughly cleaned. He pulls me back a little bit and the water washes the soap from my body. He steps forward again and his hands slide lower, brushing my inner thigh. Instinctively, my eyes fly open and I\u2019m met with my own reflection in the large bathroom mirror. Seth has wiped the steam off the glass and I hadn\u2019t even noticed. My hair clings to my skin, draping to the left of my shoulder. I feel extra heat climb into my cheeks under his gaze and I don\u2019t think he notices. I\u2019m already a light shade of pink due to the heat of the water. Moisture glistens on my skin as more tendrils of water roll over my shoulder and down my chest. Seth stands under the shower, letting the hot streams hit the back of his neck and roll down either side. His chocolate eyes are on my face while his hands roam freely over my slick skin.</p><p>\u201cYou are beautiful.\u201d He whispers in my ear, sending a shiver down my spine.</p><p>I can\u2019t help the smile that spreads across my lips. \u201cYou\u2019re being silly.\u201d I titter, placing my hands on his as they massage my stomach and my hips. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen plenty of naked women...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like you.\u201d He lowers his mouth to my neck and kisses my warm flesh. \u201cNever like you.\u201d</p><p>My bottom lip drops a little at his words, leaving my mouth slightly agape. If I had any reservation about getting into a relationship with Seth before, it\u2019s completely gone now. I want\u2014no\u2014I need him in my life. In the short time of knowing him, he has flipped my world around, more than once. He can make me angry, sad and confused all in the same minute, but he can also makes me the happiest I\u2019ve ever been. Being around Seth is exciting and dangerous and I like it... I like him. Our reflection becomes unclear as the glass fogs up again and he shuts off the shower. Goosebumps erupt over my skin when I push open the door and stand on the soft, brown mat. Steam floats from our hot skin as Seth grabs two towels and hands one to me. We dry ourselves in silence, but every now and then he\u2019ll smile a lazy, adorable smile at me, making me laugh.</p><p>When we\u2019re back in the bedroom, we find our clothes and put them on. Now, the big double bed is extra alluring to me. My eyelids are heavy and all I want is sleep.</p><p>\u201cLet me tuck you in before I go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want to tuck me in?\u201d I ask incredulously.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I take care of what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I am yours.\u201d I mumble, pulling back the sheets and climbing in.</p><p>Seth approaches my side of the bed, smiling a proud smile. \u201cYou are mine.\u201d</p><p>He pulls the heavy blankets over me and leans down to kiss me softly on the lips. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I nod my head and stifle a yawn. \u201cSee you.\u201d</p><p>Before he has even left the room, my eyes close. Trying to open them again causes unnecessary aches so I don\u2019t bother. My heart swells. Tonight wasn\u2019t about sex. He was so tender and attentive... he wanted me to see how much he cares for me. I\u2019m not sure how long after he left that I fell asleep, but I do know that when sleep took me, I had a wide smile on my face.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Driving back into Portland depresses me. I had such a good time in Concord with Seth and his team. It wasn\u2019t much. Most of the time Seth and everyone else were in the gym training for ridiculous amounts of time, leaving Selena and I to walk around. We had fun though and it was definitely a much need break, but now that we\u2019re home, I have to deal with everything else\u2014like Blade and Mason.</p><p>The little red velvet box that Blade gave me is still sitting on my bedside table. I haven\u2019t opened it, but I will today when I\u2019m alone and I\u2019ll return it to him this afternoon. I want Seth, not Blade. I can\u2019t have Blade interfering and messing with my head. He gave me a ring with no explanation. That\u2019s hardly romantic. Seth hasn\u2019t given me anything and yet he\u2019s managed to make me feel like I\u2019m special to him.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to take the ring back to Blade today?\u201d Selena asks, pulling me from my thoughts.</p><p>Seth\u2019s hand clenches the steering wheel briefly and he keeps his chocolate eyes on the road, but I know he\u2019s listening. I told Selena this morning that I\u2019d be taking the ring back to Blade. If she had questions, why didn\u2019t she ask me then? I hate talking about Blade in front of Seth. It\u2019s awkward. I glance over my shoulder, Selena is chewing on her pink, sparkly nail and Jackson is sleeping soundly with his head in her jean-clad lap. I bring my gaze back to the road ahead of me, not paying attention to any of the buildings whipping past.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll go and see him today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d go with you, but Dad called and he wants me in the office today.\u201d</p><p>I wave her off. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I should probably do it on my own anyway.\u201d</p><p>Seth leans his elbow on the rest between our seats and asks. \u201cIs he a violent person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Selena and I reply in unison.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not violent,\u201d Selena feels the need to say, \u201cbut he\u2019s persistent and slimy. He always has shit up his sleeve. I\u2019ve lost how count at how many times those two have broken up and miraculously ended up back together.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m scowling at her through the mirror in my sun visor, but she isn\u2019t looking at me. Her attention is on her fucking pink nails. \u201cHe must have a magical dick because there\u2019s no way I\u2019d keep dating someone who cheated on me every week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright Selena.\u201d I snap, crossing my arms over my chest. \u201cWe get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take you.\u201d Seth offers, running a thumb along my thigh, comfortingly.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, it\u2019ll just make things worse. He doesn\u2019t cooperate well under pressure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you.\u201d Seth says and I realize his offer wasn\u2019t actually an offer, but a demand.</p><p>I open my mouth to protest, but his words cut me off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay in the car with Jackson. At least you\u2019ll have someone there if he decides to pull anything.\u201d</p><p>His commanding eyes lock onto mine briefly before they turn back to the road. I won\u2019t fight him. If he wants to take me to Blade\u2019s house, then fine.</p><p>I see Selena\u2019s gigantic, sandstone-looking house in the distance as we drive up her street. Right on queue Jackson the sleeping beauty yawns, awakening from his too long nap.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here already, huh?\u201d Jackson\u2019s voice is husky from sleep.</p><p>I open my mouth to answer, but the distinctly kissing noises and giggles stops me and I roll my eyes. If there is one thing I won\u2019t miss about this trip it\u2019s the long make out sessions between Selena and Jackson. Jesus. It\u2019s never ending! Thankfully, we pull up in front of Selena\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you.\u201d Selena calls to me as she climbs out and Jackson followers her.</p><p>Right in front of the car they practically hump each other goodbye and I groan, throwing my head back against the seat.</p><p>\u201cYou must be real happy to be away from that.\u201d Seth laughs, leaning back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>His hand curls around my wrist and he pulls it to his lips, kissing it softly. His lips are surprisingly warm on my skin and tingles burst in my stomach.</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re done here we\u2019re going to swing by your place, get that ring and take it back to that fucking guy.\u201d</p><p>I angle my body toward him.</p><p>\u201cDo I detect jealousy?\u201d I tease.</p><p>He smiles against the back of my hand. \u201cJealousy? No. Possession? Maybe. If anyone is gonna buy you things in pretty red boxes, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>I pull my hand back. \u201cThanks, but I don\u2019t need to be bought things to be happy. Blade seems to think I do, but that just reflects how little he actually knows about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you need to be happy?\u201d</p><p>I sit for a little while thinking. I\u2019ve never been asked a question like that before. I tuck a lock of my hair behind my ear before I speak. \u201cI want what everyone wants, I guess. Health. Loyal friends. Love. I don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>He smirks at me, his eyes glistening with admiration.</p><p>\u201cIf I had to choose something materialistic, I\u2019d choose a bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bath?\u201d He repeats, almost laughing.</p><p>\u201cYep, a nice hot bubble bath. It\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve had one.\u201d</p><p>He drops my hand and runs his fingers through his hair. \u201cYou\u2019re so cute I can\u2019t even handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cute?\u201d I scoff, almost offended. I\u2019ve never been called cute before. \u201cI\u2019m not cute.\u201d</p><p>He reaches across to pinch at my already pink cheeks and I swat him away.</p><p>\u201cOkay, where to now?\u201d Jackson asks, sliding back into the car and slamming the door behind him. His face comes between our seats and I look at him. When I think about it, Jackson and Selena look very similar. His hair is a little darker, but they both have the same green eyes and facial structure\u2014sharp and angular. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to swing by Olivia\u2019s place and pick something up to drop off to her ex.\u201d Seth tells Jackson like it\u2019s no big deal.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going? You sure that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I state firmly.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Seth answers over me. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very good idea. Her ex is a douchebag.\u201d</p><p>Jackson leans back in the seat and his obvious disapproval hangs in the hair, making me uncomfortable. \u201cAll the more reason not to go.\u201d He replies.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more than welcome to walk home.\u201d Seth says, pulling out onto the road.</p><p>\u201cSeth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jackson interjects. \u201cI\u2019ll tag along, just don\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d</p> <p>I glance sideways at Seth. His face is neutral, void of any specific emotion. He wouldn\u2019t do anything stupid, would he? The last thing I want is to get Blade hurt or Seth in trouble. The closer we got to my house, the more nervous I became. I have no idea what I\u2019m going to say to Blade or if he\u2019ll even be home. I pull my phone from my pocket.</p><p>\u201cI should probably call him.\u201d</p><p>I dial his number and put it to my ear. He answers immediately. \u201cBabe?\u201d</p><p>Seth glances at me slightly and his brows furrow. I think he heard it. Momentarily, I\u2019m unsure what to do? Should I correct him or just ignore it.</p><p>\u201cOlly?\u201d</p><p>Screw it. I\u2019ll correct him next time. \u201cBlade, hey.\u201d</p> <p>He seems upbeat and excited\u2014like he\u2019s expecting good news from me. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s dead quiet in the car and it\u2019s unnerving. \u201cGood, thanks. Are you going to be home today? I need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be home all day. When are you thinking of coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be there in half an hour.\u201d I look at Seth and he nods.</p><p>\u201cGreat! I\u2019ve really missed you, Olly.\u201d</p><p>I almost cringe. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p><p>I hang up and put my phone away. My fingers nervously find each other, tangling in a edgy fidget.</p><p>When we pull up outside my home, I grab my travel bag off the floor and jump from the car. Seth and Jackson wait while I run upstairs to grab the little red box. I don\u2019t bother changing my clothes. I\u2019m too comfortable in my jeans and t-shirt. I step into my bedroom and immediately find the red box on my bedside table. My travel bag lands with a small thud on the carpet beside me and I step over it. I grab the box and feel the nice velvet material on my fingertips before I push it into the palm of my hand. For some reason, my hands are shaking and I feel a little anxious. I\u2019m ninety-nine percent sure I know what\u2019s inside... but I don\u2019t know what kind of emotions are going to be opened along with the box. It creaks as my index finger pushes it open a little. I take two deep breaths\u2014in and out, in and out\u2014and open it the rest of the way. I inhale sharply, totally floored by the pretty, gold ring nestled in the white, silk fabric. It\u2019s truly beautiful and something I definitely would have appreciated when we were together. But now, I don\u2019t want it. It represents all of my mistakes and everything I\u2019m trying to learn and grow from. I close the lid and stuff it into the pocket of my jeans, making it bulge ridiculously. I don\u2019t want to spend too much time up here so I run back out the front door, making sure I lock it behind me. I give Seth Blade\u2019s address when I get back into the car, but other than that no one said anything to me, thank God.</p> <p>When we pull into Blade\u2019s driveway the butterflies in my stomach have magnified tenfold and I almost cry. The thought of seeing Blade\u2019s face when I return this ring is going to suck\u2014especially knowing that he probably spent a lot of money on it.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to come with you?\u201d Seth asks, stroking my wrist with his thumb.</p><p>A small laugh falls from my lips. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that will go down too well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here if you need us.\u201d Jackson says, sticking his head between our seats again. And I smile at him.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I pull the little box from my pocket and open the door. Blade\u2019s place is much like mine. It\u2019s an apartment complex with the front stairs leading straight to his door. I slide out of the car and shut the door behind me. Blade appears at the top of the stairs and there\u2019s no sign of happiness on his face. I knew I should\u2019ve come alone. He stuffs his hands into the front pocket of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me he\u2019s only dropping you off.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head as I approach the steps. \u201cThis won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes glower past me and into Seth\u2019s car. Dread rolls through my stomach when I hear two car doors open and close. I turn to them and watch as they lean against the car just waiting for Blade to do something. Jackson is shaking his head slightly\u2014almost like he\u2019s saying \u2018I told you so\u2019. Seth face is intimidating, even to me. His thick arms are crossed over his chest and his eyes are dark and daring. I try to give him my best \u2018relax\u2019 face and I\u2019m sure he knows what I mean. I turn back to Blade who\u2019s still watching the boys with such disgust and hate.</p><p>\u201cForget they\u2019re even here.\u201d I say, climbing up the stairs.</p><p>He drags his eyes to my face and smiles at me, flashing his dimples. \u201cEasy done. Do you want to come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He almost flinches. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to stay long...\u201d I hold out the little red case. \u201cI can\u2019t accept this.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t take it. \u201cI bought it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but we aren\u2019t together. It\u2019s wrong for me to take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen consider it an \u2018I want you back\u2019 gift.\u201d</p><p>Oh boy. This is not going to be easy. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful\u2014it really is\u2014but I don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlly, baby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you need to stop calling me baby. It\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d</p><p>He raises his voice, becoming increasingly angry and commanding. \u201cLike fuck it is. You were my girlfriend for six years. I\u2019ve earned the right to call you that.\u201d</p><p>I scoff. \u201cYou haven\u2019t earned a damn thing. You were my boyfriend for six years. I was your girlfriend for two. That\u2019s when you started cheating on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo years, Blade.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me, waiting for me to say or do something. Blade\u2019s gaze drags over my head to Seth and then back to me.</p><p>\u201cAnd you think he cares about you?\u201d</p><p>I almost laugh. Seth does care about me. I\u2019ve spent enough time with him to know that he does. \u201cYes,\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d his hand rests on my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him with the girls at Heaven\u2019s. He doesn\u2019t respect women, Olly.\u201d</p><p>Ha! Pot. Kettle. Black. I shrug him off. \u201cYou don\u2019t know a damn thing about him. I get how he comes across, but he\u2019s different with me.\u201d</p><p>Blade works his bottom lip between his teeth, an annoying habit that I\u2019ve had to put up with the last six years. To avoid seeing it, I\u2019d try to avoid arguing with him.</p><p>\u201cHave you fucked him?\u201d He blurts out startling me from past annoyances.</p><p>My voice comes out a lot quieter than I intend. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>Blade pushes past me, almost knocking me down a step. Panic sears in me, this is exactly what I wanted to avoid. My legs shake and threaten to give way as I jump from the steps and chase after Blade. This is too much drama for me to handle. A slight smile pulls at Seth\u2019s lips and his large frame pushes off the car as Blade comes in close.</p><p>\u201cHave you fucked her?\u201d Blade demands, stopping just short of Seth.</p><p>There\u2019s a devious gleam to Seth\u2019s eyes and I realize I\u2019ve seen it before. He has the same look as he did that day at my work.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done more than that.\u201d Seth smirks.</p><p>Jackson pushes his way between the two boys and his hands fly to Blade\u2019s chest, causing his yellow polo shirt to bunch up. He inches him back a bit.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid, guy.\u201d Jackson warns in a low voice.</p><p>Blade shrugs him off and shoves him backwards. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably fucked her too.\u201d</p><p>I cringe. Hearing him talk about me with such a disgusted tone makes my chest constrict. I look at Seth, he glowers at Blade now, his eyes glinting with a dark and lethal gleam. I swallowed harshly, feeling my hands begin to shake with panic.</p><p>\u201cNah, man.\u201d Jackson assures him, casually. \u201cShe\u2019s his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis?\u201d He almost spits the word and he snaps his ice blue eyes to me. \u201cHis?\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I thought I\u2019d be happy rubbing Seth in Blade\u2019s face, but sadly... it makes me feel like shit.</p><p>\u201cBut I saw you all over the internet. You looked so uncomfortable and you were wearing the dress I bought for you. I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything... Selena made me take the dress.\u201d</p><p>I extend the little red box to him again. His gaze drops to it and then back to my face. In my six years of dating Blade, I\u2019ve never seen him so hurt... and it\u2019s too much for me. I need to leave.</p><p>\u201cTake it.\u201d Seth says, leaning back against the car. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>Blade\u2019s long, thin fingers reach out and curl around the box. His cool fingertips linger on mine for a little while longer and I drop my sight to the concrete before pulling my hand away. Blade moves to the side and without looking at him I step toward the car. When I\u2019m right beside Seth, his voice breaks the uncomfortable silence.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I did after the fight?\u201d Seth says to Blade with a sardonic grin.</p><p>Oh shit. My eyes widen and blood drains from my face. \u201cSeth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ruined the dress.\u201d</p><p>He did not just say that. I look at Blade, his face is unreadable, but he embodies anger just by the way his body becomes tensed. I open my mouth to speak\u2014to tell him that Seth is lying, that he didn\u2019t ruin the dress and he\u2019s just trying to get a rise out of him, but Blade\u2019s angry growl forces me to clamp my mouth shut. \u201cYou motherfucker!\u201d</p><p>Before Blade has the chance to approach Seth, Jackson is pushing on him, trying to drive him away. Seth steps forward and I throw myself at him. Underneath my hands his muscles are tense and ready to go.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Jackson shouts while Blade thrashes against him.</p><p>Jackson can easily control Blade. He\u2019s not bigger than Seth, but he is a hell of a lot bigger than Blade. Innocent bystanders walk by quickly, unable to peel their eyes from our predicament. We have to get out of here. Someone is bound to call the cops any second now. I don\u2019t know much about Seth\u2019s tournament, but I do know a fight of any kind won\u2019t sit well with them.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I hiss at Seth, pulling on his arm. He takes no notice of me and so I elbow him in the ribs. Still nothing. I elbow him again\u2014harder this time and he grunts, finally giving me attention. \u201cI said let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Jackson.\u201d Seth calls offhandedly, walking around to his side of the car.</p><p>I waste no time in opening the door and climbing into the car. I need to get out of here. I can\u2019t stomach seeing Blade\u2019s disgusted/depressed expression for a second longer. Jackson straightens his black tee and heads back toward the car. I drop my attention down to my legs not daring to make eye contact with Blade.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Seth apologizes. I look at him and he gives me a guilty, almost sad smile. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have provoked him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it. You're not sorry at all.\u201d</p><p>Like I expected, a cocky smile tugged at his lips and I scowl at him. The back door slams and Jackson sticks his head between our seats for the third time.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe the balls on that guy? Jesus. He was gonna to try and take the both of us.\u201d</p><p>I scoff. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have done anything.\u201d</p><p>Seth quirks an eyebrow at me. Did I say something weird?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re defending him?\u201d Jackson sneers, leaning back against the seat. \u201cUnbelievable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Seth grunts. \u201cMaybe he does have a magic dick.\u201d</p><p>Jackson snickers, but I don\u2019t find it funny at all. Not in the slightest.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a magic dick.\u201d I spit. \u201cYou two are just being immature. Poor guy. I was trying to return his gift and make it as easy for him as I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he make it easy for you when he cheated on you God knows how many times?\u201d Seth\u2019s voice is hard.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing. You don\u2019t owe him anything.\u201d He runs his hand over his face, exhaling heavily. \u201cIf I wasn't in this God damn tournament I\u2019d drop him just for using that aggressive tone with you. He\u2019s a piece of shit. You deserve better than that.\u201d</p><p>Something in me triggers, sending my anger meter sky-rocketing. \u201cYou mean I deserve someone like you? Someone who I know nothing about and has no quarrels with fucking me, but a huge issue with relationships? Yep, I got everything I deserve right there.\u201d</p><p>After a few seconds and a few long, deep breaths I realize I might have been a little harsh. I rub my forehead, regretting everything I said. I feel sorry for Jackson. Serious talks are something that should be kept private, not shared. He must be so uncomfortable right now.</p><p>My hands and legs shake nervously all the way home. Not once do I look in Seth\u2019s direction even when I feel his gaze on my face. When we pull up outside my house, I say a quick goodbye and slide out of the car. I\u2019m barely at my steps when I hear another car door close. Of course he\u2019d follow me when I\u2019m not in the mood for his attitude. I stop walking and turn around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting away with that shitty goodbye.\u201d He calls, stalking over to me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you wan\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hands circle my waist and his mouth compresses against mine, literally taking my breath away. He\u2019s warm\u2014he\u2019s always warm. When he pulls away and lets me go, I almost stumble backwards. The kiss was that intense.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for making things harder for you, but I\u2019m not sorry for putting pressure on that douchebag.\u201d He smiles and you\u2019d swear I didn\u2019t say a word to upset him. \u201cNow I have to go to training, but I\u2019ll be back tonight.\u201d</p><p>Feeling rather defiant, I put my hands on hips. \u201cWhat if I\u2019m doing something?\u201d</p><p>He flicks his brows once, cockily. \u201cYou will be.\u201d</p><p>I arch an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d He adds with a wink. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p> <p>I watch the car from the base of my steps until it disappears from sight. Just like that the frustration I feel toward Seth is gone. All it took was one kiss and I\u2019ve forgiven him. I\u2019m like putty when it comes to him and he knows exactly how to mold me.</p><p>It\u2019s T-minus four hours until I see Seth again and I\u2019ve run out of things to do. I cleaned, had a shower and watched a movie. I peel myself from the couch and enter my room. A nap sounds good. I approach the bed and kick my toe on my travel bag.</p><p>\u201cTo the wash.\u201d I exhale, picking up the bag and dumping its contents on my bed.</p><p>The first thing to fall out is one of Seth\u2019s hoodies. He\u2019d forgotten about it and left it on my floor. I remember stuffing it in my bag just in case Dad saw it. He didn\u2019t and he didn\u2019t suspect anything the next day either. Not that he would mention anything about hearing his daughter have sex... that\u2019d be awkward. I take my phone from my bedside table and dial Seth\u2019s number. No answer. I call my dad next. I should be able to get Seth\u2019s address off of him\u2014assuming he has it. Will Seth mind if I show up at his house to drop off his hoodie? Am I imposing? I can\u2019t imagine I am after everything we went through in Concord. I know I can wait until he gets here, but I don\u2019t want to. I want to see him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Olly?\u201d Dad answers.</p><p>\u201cYeah Dad, it\u2019s me. Hey, do you have Seth\u2019s address?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep, let me get my files.\u201d</p><p>I hear the sound of the filing cabin rattle and bang in the background. \u201cIt\u2019s one-zero-three Promenade Way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Like the Promenade Way up on the hills?\u201d</p><p>Promenade Way is a thirty minute drive and it\u2019s slightly out of town. I\u2019ve been up there twice and if I thought Selena\u2019s house was amazing, it has nothing on the prestigious palaces up there.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one. I gotta go sweety, two men are about to brawl over the rowing machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful. Don\u2019t do anything stupid and get someone to help yo\u2014\u201d</p><p>He hangs up.</p><p>\u201cLove you, too.\u201d I groan throwing my phone onto my bed.</p> <p>I frown. How does Seth live on Promenade Way? I know the amateur tournament is paying him for every win, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough to cover even a quarter of the cost of the houses up there. My curiosity is too strong to not go and take a look for myself so I slip into my pair of tennis shoes and throw a thin, white jacket on over my white tank top. I wouldn\u2019t normally wear a pair of light pink cotton short-shorts out of the house, but the weather is quite warm today and the mere thought of wearing jeans chaffs me.</p><p>I grab Seth\u2019s jacket, head out the door and get in my car. While I drive, I try calling him again.</p><p>Still no answer.</p><p>The closer I get to his house the more I think this is a bad idea. Seth is a very closed off person...he isn\u2019t going to appreciate me showing up like this. But, as much as I want to turn around, I can\u2019t take my foot of the accelerator.</p><p>Soon, I pull up in front of house one-zero-three and my mouth drops open. Surely I have the wrong address. I survey the huge, two-storey house and its beautiful dark chocolate bricks. On the second floor, there\u2019s a small white stone balcony with small white outdoor furniture. The house looks dead quiet and absolutely peaceful. I\u2019ve never seen a house so... breathtaking. It\u2019s like it belongs isolated and surrounded by gorgeous, lush mazes. Forcing my eyes from the house, I grab his jacket, slip out of the car and slide my keys into my pocket. The front lawn is huge and green and I curl my toes in my shoes against the urge to run barefoot over it. There\u2019s no fence blocking outside intruders from coming in\u2014not that this place would have people like that, I suppose. My shoes stick to the pretty chocolate stepping tiles and past the blooming garden. I stop to look at the flowers, there are so many colors and all of them contrast well against the brown bricks.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d A husky, womanly voice asks.</p><p>I jump, clenching the jacket to my chest. When I see a beautiful, mature aged woman sitting in a wide, cane chair I relax a little, but when her espresso dark eyes glower at me, the tense feeling returns.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say as politely as I can. I step closer. \u201cDoes Seth Marc live here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you come for sex?\u201d She takes a drag of her cigarette and my attention is on the red ember that flares brightly as she does so.</p><p>What the hell kind of question is that?</p><p>\u201cNo...I'm just\u2014\u201d I hold up the hoodie slightly, but she cuts me off.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name? Tiffany? No, you look like a Natasha.\u201d</p><p>I know I\u2019m not imaging the slur attached to her words. I shake my head and she rises from her chair. She straightens her beautiful, caramel dress-suit and struts down the steps to tower over me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Olivia.\u201d I state.</p><p>\u201cAnd have you come for sex, Olivia?\u201d</p><p>My lips part as my senses and every inch of my skin flood with nervous heat. \u201cI most certainly have not. If you let me finish what I\u2019m trying to\u2014\u201d</p><p>I hold the hoodie out and she cuts me off again. \u201cSo you haven't had sex with my son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014well, I\u2014we\u2014wait. Did you say son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Seth is my son.\u201d She flicks her cigarette onto the pretty grass and stamps it out with her heel, leaving a black mark in the otherwise perfect lawn. His mother is definitely intimidating and the more I look at her the more of Seth\u2019s features I can see\u2014the chocolate eyes, the height, the beautiful cheek bones. She\u2019s swaying slightly, completely drunk out of her mind and I\u2019m scared.</p><p>\u201cI only came to return his jacket... that\u2019s all.\u201d My voice is quiet.</p><p>\u201cAnd why do you have it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe leant it to me when we were in Concord.\u201d He actually left it on my bedroom floor, but I\u2019m not telling her that. Her face falls.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the girl he\u2019s been spending all his time with?\u201d</p><p>I half shrug, half nod.</p><p>\u201cHe took you to Concord with him?\u201d</p><p>I nod again. Tears well in her eyes and I reach out to touch her\u2014to comfort her.</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d There's no mistaking that voice and I take my hand back before it connects with her shoulder. It\u2019s Seth\u2019s and it sounds spine tinglingly chilling. He comes out of the elegant front door and towers over us from the top of the stairs. His hair is a little flat on one side and his eyes are a heavy. Shit. We woke him up.</p><p>\u201cSeth, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>His Mom snaps her attention to him. \u201cYou took her to Concord, but you couldn\u2019t return my calls?\u201d</p><p>Randomly, she starts to cry that drunken, over the top cry and Seth cringes. Is this why he keeps me so separate from his home life? Because of his mother?</p><p>\u201cYou know why I don\u2019t answer your calls God damn it, now get inside.\u201d There\u2019s no remorse in voice. He doesn\u2019t care that his mother is upset. I see his chest begin to rise and fall rapidly.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She screams and then her tears dry up. Gone and all at the drop of a hat. \u201cI\u2019m having a chat with my new friend here. Come,\u201d She extends her hand to me. \u201cLet\u2019s go inside and have a drink.\u201d</p><p>Seth tenses and I know I\u2019m not welcome here. I politely decline her hand. \u201cNo thank you, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just here to return his jacket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve had enough.\u201d Seth adds on the end.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me what to do? After everything I\u2019ve done for you and your sister?\u201d</p><p>Seth licks his lips agitatedly. He doesn\u2019t seem to like what she\u2019s saying, but he doesn\u2019t want to correct her in front of me. His mom hunches over a little and clenches her mouth. I think she\u2019s going to puke. I step forward and place a hand on her back, her body rocks with heaves underneath me.</p><p>\u201cGo home, Olivia.\u201d He almost growls it at me and I take a step back, fighting against the urge to clench my chest. Touching his mother seems to have offended him. His voice isn\u2019t polite or caring. It\u2019s rough, hard and dangerous.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said go fucking home!\u201d He snaps.</p><p>His voice is sharp and cold, stabbing me in the stomach like a knife. Something prickly twists in my chest and I drop his jacket on the ground and turn away. My feet move as quickly as they can as I storm to my car, hoping to appear more pissed off than heartbroken. I throw myself into the driver\u2019s seat and speed off, leaving the sound of screeching tires behind me. A few feet down the road and my chest heaves as sadness chokes me, but I don\u2019t stop driving... not until I pull into my driveway.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>I don\u2019t know what it is about today, but it sucks. It started off fine, but quickly turned to shit. I yank the pillow off my head and throw it across the room. My hair sticks to my cheeks and I brush it off agitatedly. I\u2019ve been in bed since I came home almost three hours ago and I can\u2019t make sense of what happened this afternoon at Seth\u2019s freakishly beautiful house. I get that I showed up unannounced, but that\u2019s not grounds for being a complete asshole. He sent me away like I was... nothing, like I was trash.</p><p>I stopped crying a while ago, but my eyes are still heavy. He\u2019s made no contact yet. Nothing. Not even a fucking text apology. As that thought finishes, my phone vibrates and Seth\u2019s name flashes across my screen. My stomach drops. I\u2019ve been waiting for him to call me\u2014hoping he would, but now that he has... I\u2019m pissed it took him so long. I hit ignore and pull another pillow over my face. It vibrates again. My fingers dig into the pillow each time my phone makes a noise. A few more times and it stops. It vibrates twice quickly indicating a voicemail and I pick it up and dial my account. The monotonous robotic voice tells me the time and date of the call. I bite my nails nervously and I swear the robot is saying the numbers slowly just to mess with me. Then I hear Seth\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so fucking sorry, O. I didn\u2019t mean to flip out... I just saw you with my mom and I...\u201d he exhales. \u201cI\u2019m freaking out here... I need you.\u201d</p><p>He hangs up and the robot asks me if I want to delete the message. I disconnect with it and drop my phone onto my bed. What am I going to do? I have no idea how to handle this situation... I\u2019ve never had to \u2018fix\u2019 things before. With Blade he would take off and come back later like nothing happened. Is that how it works? I chew my nails until they ache, thinking and driving myself crazy. I\u2019m still so mad... I can\u2019t talk to him right now because I\u2019ll say something stupid.</p><p>Half an hour later and I\u2019m still contemplating my next step, but then my front door shakes under three soft knocks and all thoughts flee from my mind. Shit. It\u2019s probably Seth. Okay, not probably. I\u2019m one hundred percent sure it\u2019s Seth.</p><p>I slide off my bed and make my way through the dark to the front door. I bite the inside of my cheek and I\u2019m surprised I haven\u2019t drawn blood. When I open the door Seth\u2019s gaze drags from the floor to my face. His brows are knitted together above his sad, sorry eyes and he rakes his teeth over his bottom lip before he asks me. \u201cHave you been crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I answer immediately, but even I can see through that.</p><p>My eyes are puffy, I can feel it.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>I flinch. \u201cYou want me to show you the same courtesy that you neglected to show me today?\u201d He doesn\u2019t say or do anything. \u201cNo. Go home.\u201d</p><p>I step back and push the door closed, only when I turn around it bounces right back, colliding with the wall. I face Seth again and my eyes drop to his feet. The top of his shoe is in my apartment and for some reason it irritates me. \u201cI said go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did, but I\u2019m not going anywhere. Not when I know you need me.\u201d He leans against my door frame, respecting my boundaries and not entering my house. \u201cI know I hurt your feelings and I\u2019m so sorry. You just caught me off guard.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s it? I caught him off guard? \u201cYou sent me away like I was some kind of animal.\u201d I hiss. \u201cIt was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisgusting. It was selfish and rude and I know I can\u2019t take it back, but at least let me apologize and make it up to you. I\u2019m here now... please.\u201d</p><p>I catch my lip between my teeth. He wants to make it up to me. I\u2019ve never had anyone want to make it up to me before. I\u2019ve been bought things that I don\u2019t want in an attempt, but I\u2019ve never had anyone want to talk and apologize properly to me.</p><p>\u201cIf I let you in, you have to tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>He nods and I ignore the hesitancy in it.</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>He steps through the door and kicks off his shoes. I walk into the kitchen and pull a cold bottle of water from the fridge. My throat is dry and I think it\u2019s because I\u2019m dehydrated... or it could be because I\u2019m about to have the first make up conversation of my life and I\u2019m nervous. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pull myself onto the bench as he leans against the fridge.</p><p>\u201cSo that was your mom?\u201d I ask, unscrewing the lid to my bottle and taking a long, satisfying drink.</p><p>\u201cIn the flesh.\u201d</p> <p>I can sense that this is an uncomfortable topic for him, but I need to know what is really going on.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the outside, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess she\u2019s something you weren\u2019t ready to share with me...\u201d</p><p>Although I have no idea why.</p> <p>\u201cI never wanted you to meet her.\u201d</p><p>I frown and he speaks quickly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not normal.\u201d</p><p>I scoff. \u201cHave you met my mother?\u201d</p><p>\"Okay, so maybe normal is the wrong word to use. She is a vindictive, selfish drunk and I\u2019m embarrassed you had to see that.\u201d</p><p>I slide off the bench and take a cautious step toward him.</p> <p>\u201cYou can come to me.\u201d He says, his lips twitching briefly. \u201cI\u2019m not going to send you away.\u201d</p><p>I run to his arms and they encircle me, pulling me tight against him. I bury my head closer into his chest and he plants two kisses on the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cMy mother wasn\u2019t always a drunk. She used to be amazing\u2014caring, but then my dad died and she hasn\u2019t been the same since. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve become the parent. I\u2019m forever receiving calls to pick her up from the police station or the hospital and...\u201d He exhales. \u201cI\u2019m just sick of it, you know.\u201d</p><p>I pull back to look up at his face. The thought of his mother really upsets him and I hate that I\u2019ve made him so uncomfortable, but I need to. He needs to see that it\u2019ll take a hell of a lot more to scare me off.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still your mother, Seth.\u201d I mumble.</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I put up with her, but I\u2019ve been too lenient\u2014given too many chances. She doesn\u2019t deserve it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, there\u2019s too much ground to cover. She\u2019s the reason my little sister moved out, the reason why I haven\u2019t been able to completely move on from my father\u2019s death\u2014she reminds me of it every damn day and I\u2019m sick of dealing with her.\u201d His arms let me go and he runs his fingers through his hair. \u201cWhen you left this afternoon I completely flipped out. I felt sick and I couldn\u2019t breathe...I jumped straight in my car to come here, but decided to go to the gym instead. I ran into your dad and he asked me if you found my address okay. Without a word I left the gym and I\u2019ve just been driving around for hours trying to think of ways to make it up to you.\u201d</p> <p>His thumb drops to caress my cheek. \u201cI went to so many shops and looked at so many things I thought you\u2019d love, but halfway through I remembered that you don\u2019t like that. You don\u2019t need to be bought things to be happy.\u201d</p><p>I bury my face into his black jacket and a sense of peace washes over me. I\u2019ve finally found someone who understands me\u2014who listens to me.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he says, running his finger along my cheek, drawing my face out of his jacket. \u201cI did manage come up with two things to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>I watch his face and his dark eyes, flare with pleasure like he knows for a fact it\u2019ll make me happy. \u201cAfter today\u2014and especially what you said in the car\u2014I realized there are too many things in this world that can drive us apart. Right now, we don\u2019t owe each other anything. If we want to go separate ways, we don\u2019t even have to supply the other with an explanation and I don\u2019t like that. I want to owe you things. I want to owe you explanations... I want us to be officially together\u2014titles and all, if you really want.\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops open and all I give him in return is a wide-eyed stare. I\u2019m surprised he\u2019d do that for me. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting that...What happened to your \u2018I don\u2019t do girlfriends\u2019 thing.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitch. \u201cYou happened.\u201d</p><p>Damn it. He\u2019s handsome and romantic. Sometimes, I really can\u2019t fault this guy.</p><p>\u201cYou do realize that means you\u2019re officially off the market.\u201d I say, poking him in the hard stomach. The warm, wide palms of his hands cup my face and my breath hitches.</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019ve been off the market since the moments these cheeks turned the sexiest shade of pink.\u201d</p><p>Heat flares under my skin and I avert my gaze. \u201cAnd when was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I caught you eye-fucking me.\u201d</p><p>I shove him and he lets go of my face. \u201cI did not.\u201d</p><p>He laughs loudly and squeezes me against him. \u201cYou did. Admit it.\u201d</p><p>I did stare a little too long at him, but I certainly did not \u2018eye-fuck\u2019 him.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d He chuckles, kissing my nose. \u201cThere\u2019s one more thing I want to do to make you happy, but we have to get into the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe car?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to bring anything. Let\u2019s just go to the car.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s hands rest on my shoulders and he turns my still confused body to the door. He walks behind me, nudging me closer and closer to the exit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dressed properly.\u201d I say, glancing down at my short shorts and tank top. I shed the thin jacket ages ago. \u201cMy shorts are too short.\u201d</p><p>He drops his hands from my shoulder and I jump when I feel a thick finger glide along the base of my ass cheek.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re perfect.\u201d He growls.</p><p>I feel his breath on my neck and I immediately moisten. I open the front door and before I know it. We\u2019re in his car and driving away from my house.</p><p>I barely notice the buildings and streets we drive past. All of my attention is honed in on my thigh\u2014on the one spot Seth keeps circling with the rough tip of his index finger. It\u2019s painfully arousing and I have to bite back a gasp every time his circle gets glides over my inner thigh. When he removes his hand, my mind clears and I notice the turn off we just took is the exact same one I took earlier this afternoon.</p><p>\u201cSeth...\u201d I say, cautiously. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re heading in the same direction as his house, but he wouldn\u2019t take me there. Would he?</p><p>\u201cIs it not obvious?\u201d He asks, raising his eyebrows at me. \u201cWe\u2019re going to my house.\u201d</p><p>Seth glances sideways at me and thankfully there\u2019s not enough lighting for him to see how my fingers are nervously working the thin fabric of my tank top.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I said this will make you happy and trust me, it will.\u201d</p><p>Although I fail to see how, I nod anyway, putting all of my faith in him.</p><p>The view of the houses at daytime blew my mind because they were so big and breathtaking. Now, they\u2019re beautiful and elegant. There\u2019s something peaceful about the way tea lights glow and illumine the walkways. I want tea lights for my house. When we turn and drive slowly down the slight slope of a driveway, he turns off the car and sits for a little while.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to go in if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d I tell him.</p><p>Seth leaves the car and comes around to open my door. He extends his hand to me and I take it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going in.\u201d He smiles at me.</p><p>I try not to gape at the way he yellow lights glow beautiful along the chocolate walkway or the dark bricks of his house. It makes me crave chocolate cake and vanilla custard. Yum.</p><p>Seth\u2019s fingers entwine with mine and I smile up at him. Seth. My boyfriend. How\u2019d that even happen? How\u2019d I get so lucky? He sticks his key in the front door and it opens without a creak. I stare down the long hallway. It\u2019s empty\u2014not the kind of empty that looks terrible and plain. It's the kind of empty that still manages to take your breath away. Seth\u2019s fingers slip from mine. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t move. \u201cIs your mom home? I don\u2019t want to disturb her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom is hardly home at night. Tonight is no different.\u201d</p><p>His hand slides to the small of my back and he presses on me. \u201cIt\u2019s just us. Go on.\u201d</p><p>I step into the house and slip my sandals off by the door. Seth\u2019s hand claims mine again and he pulls me behind him up the long hallway. A few feet ahead the hallway stops and the living room begins\u2014dark leather couches, red and white rugs, a very large TV and strange sculptures\u2014it's so much to take in. I\u2019ve never seen a house so... thought out. I know the outside is beautiful, but I was expecting the inside to be, well, boyish. You know, clothes and food everywhere, a strange old shoe smell and posters of naked girls. I avoided my brother\u2019s room at all costs for those reasons exactly.</p><p>\u201cWhat, no posters of naked girls?\u201d I tease.</p><p>He laughs without looking at me. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not twelve.\u201d</p><p>He drags me through the monstrous kitchen, filled with hanging pots and pans, steel bench tops with wooden accents and then down another hallway. This one isn\u2019t bare like the first hallway. It has paintings hanging along its white walls.</p><p>\u201cI would have never guessed you like art.\u201d I wonder aloud.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my dads, actually.\u201d</p><p>Oh. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his brown eyes at me. \u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for.\u201d</p><p>Seth escorts me up a staircase into another mini lounge. A one hallway veers off in three different directions and he leads me down the one to the far left. He opens the door at the end.</p><p>\u201cThis is your room?\u201d</p><p>I let my mind wander as I gaze upon the impeccable cleanliness and organization of it. A huge king size bed looks alluring from the far corner of the room. The other side has a coffee table and two black leather couches that sit before an impressive wall mounted TV. A boxing bag hangs from the wooden banister in the middle of the room with a pair of blue boxing gloves slung over the top.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>I shake and nod my head at the same time. \u201cIt\u2019s big... and... beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He smiles cockily and I realize I just walked into one of those \u2018that\u2019s what she said\u2019 jokes. I scowl at him. \u201cDon\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><p>He flashes his large palms at me. \u201cI wasn\u2019t gonna.\u201d He points to his couch. \u201cYou sit right there, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Seth disappears through a door on the other side of the room and I fall into the couch. There\u2019s a nudey mag on the glass tabletop and I chuckle a little. This is definitely Seth\u2019s room. He peers around the door and gestures for me to come to him. Nervous as well as intrigued, I go to the door. He opens it wide as I approach and his hand takes mine. He pulls me into a bathroom and my eyes drag over the glass shower and two beautiful, square bowl sinks. They\u2019re nice, but the huge spa bath in front of me captures my complete attention. The water churns and creates thick bubbles as the water level rises.</p><p>\u201cA bath?\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s fingers grasp the base of my shirt and I lift my arms while he pulls it over my head.</p><p>\u201cJust for you.\u201d</p><p>His thumbs curl underneath the band of my shorts and he pushes them so they drop to the floor, taking my underwear with them. The warm steam that emits from the bath floats over to kiss my skin.</p><p>I turn to Seth. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to run me a bath. I was being silly.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, running the very tips of his fingers along my stomach. \u201cSo a bath wouldn\u2019t make you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would but\u2014ah!\u201d He effortlessly scoops me up into his arms and carries me to the bath. My toes dip into the scorching water first, followed slowly by the rest of my body. When I\u2019m in my body grows accustomed to the temperature.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not joining me?\u201d I ask Seth, pulling bubbles over to me to cover my breasts.</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you to enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d enjoy it a lot more if you were in here with me.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head.</p><p>I try again. \u201cIt would make me happier, if you were in here with me.\u201d</p><p>His teeth sweep over his bottom lip and with a heavy exhale, he shrugs out of his jacket. I watch, getting a little bit too excited when he pulls his shirt over his head, exposing all of his intricate patterned tattoos and deliciously smooth skin. His finger hooks around the button to his jeans and he slides them off. I pull my knees into my chest as he steps in. He hisses at the temperature, but once the water submerges his body he relaxes. There\u2019s a lot of space between us so I slide toward him and he happily pulls me in between his legs. My back rests against his front and I close my eyes as Seth\u2019s warm lips press against the back of my neck, sending a tidal wave of pleasure through me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m enjoying the bath more already.\u201d I groan, feeling him smile against my skin.</p><p>His hands trail downwards, gently grazing my breasts.</p><p>\u201cYour house is very nice.\u201d I state. \u201cI have no idea how you were able to stomach my tiny apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour apartment is cozy. I\u2019ve never had a better night\u2019s sleep than when I\u2019m there with you.\u201d</p><p>His words are sweet, filling me with a strange warmth and making me smile.</p><p>\u201cYou said you want to owe me explanations, right?\u201d I ask, trying to make myself feel better about what I\u2019m going to ask next.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything, only nods.</p><p>\u201cHow are you able to afford such a place?\u201d</p><p>His index finger traces circles along my side, making my nipples harden. \u201cWell, in Seattle my dad was a surgeon and my mom was a lawyer. Together, they made a lot of money and were very smart about their decisions... when my dad died and my mom went off the edge, I was put in charge of finances for the sake of my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you move to Portland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom hit breaking point. She promised me she\u2019d get better, but the only city offering the program I wanted to put her in was here in Maine. She\u2019s yet to attend her first session.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd your sister? Does she live here too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Maddi is in Las Vegas living it up with her rockstar boyfriend.\u201d His tone turns aggressive toward the end. \u201cShe used to, but my mother and her didn\u2019t get along.\u201d</p><p>Underneath me, I feel Seth become a little tense and I think I\u2019ve reached maximum questions point. The last thing I want to do is push when he\u2019s been so willing to answer my questions. I stroke him, letting my nails create a random pattern on his legs. Behind me, low against my back, I become aware of just how much he likes it and I smile. I twist myself in the water until my front his flush up against his. I slide my soapy body up against his firm torso, pressing my lips against his chest and then his neck. He moans when I flick my tongue out to taste his jaw and he snags my lip between his teeth when I kiss him. My hand slides up his thigh, but his hand quickly shoots down, catching my wrist.</p> <p>\u201cI thought you wanted a bath?\u201d He teases me, cocking his head to the side.</p><p>Feeling bold, I say. \u201cCan\u2019t I have both?\u201d</p><p>He brings his mouth closer to mine and my heartbeat kicks up a notch. My insides clench in anticipation, just waiting for Seth to put his hands on me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insatiable.\u201d He chuckles, his lips lightly grazing mine.</p><p>\u201cI am when it comes to you.\u201d</p> <p>His dark eyes flare, pleased with my response and his full lips crash to mine. His fingers move steadily upward to graze the delicate skin of my sides as his moist tongue sweeps across my bottom lip. With a rush of hot arousal, my mouth opens instantly to his, and he wastes no time in darting his tongue inside. My pulse hammers through my veins like it always does when we\u2019re intimate. Seth\u2019s hands explore the curve of my waist before gripping my ass and pulling me higher onto him. The feel of his hard, firm hands against my body drives me crazy, and there\u2019s no way I can stop the whimper that escapes me. The sound of my moan echos against the walls, floating around us and I can feel him hard and ready between my thighs. Knowing he\u2019s there makes me tremble with pleasure and I push my body harder against his as his hand slides down my body, tightening around my hip. A delicious tingling begins to spread across my chest, and I groan with eagerness as my arousal begins to throb ruthlessly between my legs. Seth pulls his mouth away from mine and focuses on my face as he slides a hand between us. I lift my hips while he strokes my center with his erection. I time it perfectly and as it passes directly under me, I drop down and sheathe him all the way to the base.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Seth gasps, grabbing both my hips with devastating pressure. Water splashes and rises all around us as I bounce and grind my hips into his. I keep my eyes on his face, completely mesmerized by his expression\u2014dark, hungry, and wickedly pleased. His attention is on my breasts. They\u2019re full and glistening in the light of the bathroom. He leans forward slightly, pulling my hard nipple into his mouth and my back arches. He abruptly releases my nipple and turns his attention to my face.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out.\u201d He breathes, digging his fingers into my thighs. \u201cI want to have you in my bed.\u201d</p><p>I run my tongue along his bottom lip, rocking against him slowly. I kiss his nose once and slide off of him. Water trickles off of his body and the water level drops as he steps out. I turn the tap off and follow him from the bath. My hair is still dry so my towel drying time is thankfully cut in half. Laughter escapes me as he scoops me up in his arms and carries me back into the room. I look into his face, marveling at the gentle strength in his countenance. He places me on his large bed and I seize his neck with my arms, pulling him down on top of me. His laughter and subsequent growls quicken my heartbeat as we playfully tussle with each other. I run my fingers through his soft hair while his mouth explores my neck and my chest. Wrapping my legs around his waist, I pull him as close to me as I can.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d I moan, thrusting my hips upwards.</p><p>\u201cYou want it?\u201d He breathes into my neck, positioning himself at my entrance.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I hiss.</p><p>He laughs once as he forcefully thrusts into me, sending a hot jolt of pleasure shooting through my body. He doesn\u2019t hesitate between thrusts, and in no time he\u2019s slamming into me\u2014his body colliding with mine at a fast pace.</p><p>\u201cSo good...\u201d He growls, nipping at the flesh on my collarbone.</p><p>A familiar pressure builds up inside me increasing with every thrust, causing me to squirm underneath him. Another swear word falls from his lips and it sinks right down to my stomach, pushing me closer to the edge.</p><p>\u201cSeth! Yes!\" I cry as my release closes in on me, causing my toes to curl.</p><p>He thrusts harder and my climax suddenly rips through me. The unbearable heat of my orgasm pulses mercilessly through my center. At the same time, Seth swears loudly as he thrusts himself inside me once more and I feel his length pulse wildly inside my depths. As soon as the heat releases us, Seth pulls out of me and my entire body feels weak and mushy. He lies beside me and my body instantly relaxes against him. He places his fingers against my chin, turning my head so he can kiss me. I smile as his lips brush mine. He drops his head, holding me to his body and I feel his chest rise and fall with his steady breaths.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d I breathe. \u201cAfter everything we\u2019ve done, do you still think I\u2019m a good girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re a good girl.\u201d He kisses my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m convinced you are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>I feel him shrug. \u201cYou don\u2019t see yourself like I do. You don\u2019t see the way your cheeks turn pink when I say or do inappropriate things. You can\u2019t hear the sweet, innocent tone in your voice when you say things... but I do.\u201d</p><p>My heart swells in my chest. Seth knows me like no one else has. The sweetest thing Blade has ever said to me came on a card written by someone in a factory. How have I missed out on this? How did I stay with Blade with for so long? Seth\u2019s coarse finger draws shapes on my hip pulling me from my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He says.</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor letting me make it up to you. All afternoon I had your hurt expression stuck in my brain and it was fucking destroying me.\u201d</p><p>I smile and close my eyes. Soon, Seth\u2019s hand stops moving and his breathing became heavy. Subsequently, I find my own thoughts drifting while Seth\u2019s strong arms lull me to sleep.</p><p>\u201cO?\u201d</p><p>I hear the sound of my nickname and I open my eyes, but it doesn\u2019t quite register with my brain. I close my eyes again. I\u2019m warm, sleepy and content. I don\u2019t want to be doing anything else. A finger brushes softly over my cheek.</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d I hear again.</p><p>I open my eyes for a second time. It\u2019s dark, but I can just make out Seth\u2019s silhouette above me. His knuckle gently teases my cheek and I pull myself into a seated position. After a few seconds my vision adjusts to the darkness and I notice Seth is fully clothed with his car keys in his hand.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d I ask, my voice husky with sleep.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come with me to pick up my mom.\u201d There\u2019s a lace of frustration to his tone. \u201cI\u2019d never ask, but seeing as we\u2019re a couple now... we should do things together, right? No matter how shit it is?\u201d</p><p>His Mom? Is she okay? I swallow my rising worry and nod. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>I throw back the blankets. And slide out of bed. Seth walks over to the wall and flicks the light on and I squint under the sudden harshness.</p><p>\u201cI laid your clothes over the back of the couch.\u201d He smiles at me as I stand naked.</p><p>I slide my clothes on piece by piece and run my fingers through my hair, barely managing to pull out all of the knots. \u201cWhere\u2019s your mom?\u201d</p><p>He taps his fingers against his jeans. \u201cShe\u2019s at the police station.\u201d</p><p>I stiffen. \u201cAt the police station? What do we do? Do you need to call a lawyer or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is normal. I know the deputy at the station. I\u2019ll pick her up and bring her home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>He gives me a tight smile. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this isn\u2019t new?\u201d I exhale, relaxing slightly.</p><p>\u201cSadly, no. This will be the fourth time since moving to Portland that I\u2019ve had to pick her up from a police station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the deputy just calls you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>I recall Seth taking phone calls before... once on the night he refused to have sex with me and once on the night we went out for dinner. He had to leave in a hurry. I feel sorry for him. He shouldn\u2019t have to drop everything going on in his life to pick up his drunken mother. It\u2019s not right.</p><p>I follow closely behind him as we walk through the large house and out the front door. Seth doesn\u2019t speak the whole way to the police station. When I look at him, his jaw is always tense, always working against itself.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you put up with it?\u201d I question him.</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s my mother...\u201d he runs his fingers through his hair. \u201cI feel like I owe it to her, I guess. I wasn\u2019t the greatest kid.\u201d</p><p>His words upset me. He\u2019s still the son, not the parent. His mother should be taking care of the finances and the house. Not Seth.</p><p>We roll up in front of the Police Station and we climb out. It isn\u2019t a headquarters or anything, just a small station. Seth\u2019s fingers entwine with mine as he pulls me along beside him. Inside, the station smells of beer and hospital cleaner. A few tired people litter the waiting room and they eye us as we walk right up to the service desk.</p><p>\u201cHey Seth,\u201d The officer extends his hand to Seth and he takes it. \u201cYour mom is more upset than usual.\u201d</p><p>Seth chuckles nervously. \u201cI better get her home then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. She\u2019s been asleep for the last hour.\u201d</p><p>The officer steps out from behind the desk and gestures for Seth to follow him. He turns to me. \u201cWait here, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>Seth and the officer disappear around the corner, leaving me alone. I\u2019m uncomfortable. I\u2019ve never been inside a police station before and hopefully I never have to again. I don\u2019t like feeling like I\u2019ve done something wrong. I even get nervous when I walk past a police officer in the mall or in the street. I\u2019m lame, I know.</p><p>Seth reappears cradling his sleeping mother. She\u2019s not wearing the same outfit I saw her in this afternoon. She has traded the dress suit for a pair of black slacks, a pretty purple silk top and a pair of killer violet heels. Her long, black hair cascades over Seth\u2019s arm and hangs loosely in the air. Seth walks past me, flicking his head toward the exit sign. I follow closely behind and I open the back door for him so he can lay his mother down on the back seat.</p><p>It took us a little while to get back to Seth\u2019s house. He was going under the speed limit to avoid waking his mother. It didn\u2019t matter. Once we pull into the driveway and the car turns off, his mom speaks.</p><p>\u201cSethy?\u201d She whispers. \u201cDid you have to pick me up again?\u201d</p><p>My heart melts at her nickname for him. It\u2019s adorable and I imagine she\u2019s been calling him that since the day he was born. I look at Seth. His face is stormy and frustrated.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He replies. His tone is cold and lacking any empathy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she sobs. \u201cI was on my way to the program. I swear I was going to go this time.\u201d</p><p>Seth climbs out of the car without replying. He opens the back door and extends his hand to his mom. I open my own door and slide out. When I walk over to the other side, his mother is already halfway out of the car.</p><p>She smiles drunkenly at me. \u201cNatasha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia.\u201d Seth corrects her, becoming increasingly frustrated.</p><p>\u201cSeth, it\u2019s okay.\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cOlivia.\u201d She slurs. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>His mom looks up at him as she slides the rest of her body out of the car. Seth wraps an arm around her waist supporting her weight like she\u2019s no heavier than a child. She turns back to me. \u201cI\u2019m Vanessa.\u201d She gestures to her face and body. \u201cI\u2019m not usually like this.\u201d</p><p>Seth's expression darkens and he shakes his head. He\u2019s an expert at holding his tongue. He is yet to say something to upset her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d He says, pulling her toward the house. When we go inside, I linger along behind them, all the way up the stairs and to his mom\u2019s room. I don\u2019t go inside. I\u2019ve invaded enough personal space for tonight. I lean against the wall by the door frame, my gaze focusing on a painting of a cute bamboo tree.</p><p>\u201cSethy?\u201d I hear her call to him. \u201cI was planning on making myself better tonight...\u201d</p><p>His voice comes in low. \u201cAnd what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I got to the doors and I couldn\u2019t go in... I panicked. I didn\u2019t want to admit that I\u2019ve been such a failure.\u201d</p><p>I strain my ear for his response, but it doesn\u2019t come.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go tomorrow... I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, good night.\u201d</p><p>Seth steps out of the room and closes the door behind him. I give him no indication that I heard everything. I don\u2019t want him to be embarrassed. I wrap my hands around his arm and snuggle in close as we walk towards his room. When we\u2019re inside and tucked back into bed, he pulls me into his bare chest.</p><p>\u201cI hope that was okay for you.\u201d He mutters in my ear.</p><p>After all of that, how can he possibly be worrying about me? \u201cIt was. I\u2019m glad she is home and safe.\u201d</p><p>His hands squeeze me as he settles his head closer to my neck. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s deep voice wakes me up again. \u201cOlivia.\u201d He almost sings it in a happy tune. \u201cYou have work.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My eyes shoot open and I sit up, letting half of the blanket fall to the floor. How\u2019d I forget that I have work this morning? \u201cWhat\u2019s the time?\u201d</p><p>I leap out of bed and my toes dig into the lush carpet as I run to the bathroom. I really need to pee. When I wash my hands and step back into the room, Seth is lying on back on his bed in a pair of his fighting shorts\u2014the ones with the slits up the side\u2014and a white t-shirt.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s still early. I was thinking we could have breakfast, go to the gym and then take you to work.\u201d</p> <p>Wow. He has it all planned out. \u201cDo I have time for all that?\u201d I ask, searching one of his walls for a clock. I find nothing.</p><p>He sits up. \u201cIt\u2019s only five. You have four hours until work and I\u2019m already late for training now let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I follow him downstairs and the smell of meat and eggs are overwhelming\u2014nauseatingly overwhelming. Sure enough, there are two big steaks bleeding all over each other in the frying pan and a fresh bowl of scrambled eggs sitting in the middle of the breakfast bar beside a pitcher of orange juice and a stack of buttered toast.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d He asks proudly, taking charge of the stove and shuffling the steaks around. Of course he\u2019s excited about cooking me breakfast, making me feel even more like a douche bag.</p><p>\u201cSteak? I thought fighter\u2019s drink all of those random shakes.\u201d</p> <p>He laughs. \u201cWe do that too.\u201d</p><p>His spatula slides underneath the thick slab of meat and the juice and blood run off it as he lays it on a plate and slides it across the bench. Oh, God. It stops right in front of me and I almost gag.</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d I groan pushing the plate away. \u201cDo you have fruit or yogurt? Anything other than meat and eggs?\u201d I feel rude. He obviously got up early to do this for me.</p><p>His brown eyes widen and he\u2019s looking at me like I\u2019m crazy. \u201cYou don\u2019t like steak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, just not early in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d He announces opening the fridge. \u201cYou\u2019re in luck because I have loads of fresh fruit and yogurt.\u201d</p> <p>He places apples, oranges, a container of blueberries and some strawberries on the counter. He reaches back into the fridge and pulls out a tub of Greek yogurt. I watch him effortlessly maneuver his way around the kitchen as he pulls the bowl from a cupboard and brings it over to me. I scoop yogurt and blueberries into my bowl while Seth eats his steak.</p><p>\u201cWill your mom be joining us for breakfast?\u201d I ask when I\u2019m halfway through my food.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cShe won\u2019t be up until this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>He stuffs the last piece of steak in his mouth and takes his plate, dropping it in the sink. He washes his mouth and I slide my bowl over to him.</p><p>I put on my tennis shoes and join Seth in the car.</p><p>\u201cCan you swing by my place so I can grab a change of clothing for work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan do, baby.\u201d He laughs, pulling out of the driveway.</p><p>He\u2019s very chipper this morning, very upbeat. After last night I assumed he\u2019d be down in the dumps today. \u201cYou\u2019re happy,\u201d I state. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no reasons to be unhappy today. Normally, when I pick my mother up from the police station I go to the gym as soon as it opens and smash the bag for a while. This morning, however, I woke up to your pretty face and I remembered that you are my girlfriend.\u201d He smiles sideways at me and reaches across to squeeze my thigh. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a good day.\u201d</p><p>Heat spreads throughout my chest and into my cheeks at the thought of him waking up so happy, and for no other reason other than I\u2019m his girlfriend. It\u2019s sweet. It\u2019s sickeningly sweet and I love it. It makes me feel special and who doesn\u2019t like feeling special?</p><p>We didn\u2019t spend too long at my house. Seth waited in the car while I ran inside and grabbed a sweater, a pair of black slacks and some short black heels. I made sure I grabbed my make-up bag and hair brush, too. I also managed to stuff some tights and a t-shirt into my backpack so I can work out. When we get to the gym, Seth\u2019s coach Darryl is all over him, chastising him for being late and unprofessional. Jackson is also here, leaning against the wall shaking his head at us in disapproval. I split off, leaving Seth to deal with his pissed off team and head to the shower room. I change into my clothes and come back out. Seth is in the boxing ring with his sparring partner. I avert my gaze as Seth\u2019s fist is about to connect with the other guy\u2019s face. I don\u2019t see it, but I hear the guy hit the floor and I cringe, picturing everything in my head.</p><p>\u201cOlly!\u201d Dad calls from his window. I look up and see him hanging halfway out his window to talk to me. The thought of him falling makes me nervous.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll come down.\u201d</p><p>I scuff my shoes along the mat while I wait for him. He rounds the corner looking all cheery and alert. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve come to the gym.\u201d He says, pulling me into a hug.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been busy. But I\u2019m here today.\u201d</p><p>Dad slings a heavy arm over my shoulder, walking me toward the ring. I glance sideways at him and see one French fry poking out of his pocket. I pull it out and glare at him. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be eating healthy. You know, for the sake of your heart.\u201d</p><p>He flicks the fry from my hand and changes the subject. \u201cYour mom and I came to your place last night, but you weren\u2019t home.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks heat up and I feel uncomfortable telling him I was at Seth\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Rick.\u201d Seth pants, smiling confidently down at us from the ring. \u201cShe was with me.\u201d</p><p>Shouldn\u2019t Darryl be here making sure Seth is paying attention to training, instead of intruding on my conversations? I look around the gym. Darryl is talking into his phone, his face serious and focused on a spot on the mat. Jackson is leaning on Darryl, trying to get in on the conversation. I turn my attention back to Seth and Dad.</p><p>\u201cWell, do you want to tell him?\u201d Seth asks. \u201cOr should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we\u2019re together, officially.\u201d</p><p>I smile, coyly. \u201cOh, right. Yeah. Dad we\u2019re dating now, so...\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s thin lips curl up into a wide smile and in turn it makes me smile. He seems so young, so happy. \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d Dad laughs, slapping me on the shoulder. \u201cMaybe someday soon I\u2019ll have Seth Marc as my son in law.\u201d</p><p>Seth and I chuckle nervously\u2014I even think we both flushed. Neither one of us are thinking that far ahead. I turn from them both and head to the treadmill. If I stay and chat, I\u2019ll never get any exercise time in and God knows my Dad can chat forever if he really wants to. I stretch a little, start up the treadmill and jog at a brisk pace. Every now and then I\u2019ll look over at Seth training with his team. When he spars, my Dad is in the ring with him. His eyes wide like a kid in a candy store as he chats to Seth. The spar partner lies on the floor before Seth\u2019s feet and Seth gives him his arm. I watch curiously as my dad inaudibly tells Seth what to do. The spar partner wraps his legs around Seth\u2019s arm and pulls tightly. I wince, picturing the strain on the elbow. My dad crouches on the floor, talking\u2014always talking. Seth nods in agreement and lifts the spar partner off the floor before slamming him back down. The guy lets go off Seth\u2019s arm and Dad pats his back, happy with the result. Darryl and Jackson are setting up mats in the training room. I stop my treadmill. I want to see what they\u2019re doing. I only ever see Seth boxing or sparring. I never see him actually work out. I peer around the door and I\u2019m surprised when I see only a few chin-up bars in the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat, no tractor tires?\u201d I ask Jackson.</p><p>Jackson shakes his head and straightens a might on the floor. \u201cNot this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth works on a body weight program.\u201d Darryl chimes in. \u201cMeaning he doesn\u2019t lift excess weight, only his own.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s still a lot of weight. \u201cSo what exactly does he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery day, Seth does five sets of as many push-ups as he can, repping out until he reaches muscular failure. He will recover for 60 seconds and then begin his next set of push ups.\u201d He points to the chin up bar. \u201cThree days a week he does five sets of max rep chin-ups and some body weight squats. Running, skipping and other exercises are worked in there, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no weights, no bells or machines? That\u2019s a little simple for a fighter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I have no idea. I\u2019m just going off what I\u2019ve seen from my dad\u2019s DVDs.</p><p>\u201cSeth likes a more... \u2018Rocky\u2019 type of work out and despite its simplicity; it\u2019s a remarkably balanced program. If he makes pro then we might look at introducing machines.\u201d</p><p>Darryl has it all figured out and I\u2019m impressed. \u201cChin-ups aren\u2019t that hard though.\u201d I state. \u201cI can do at least seven.\u201d</p><p>Both Darryl and Jackson crack up like I\u2019ve said the funniest joke in the world. It\u2019s not a polite chuckle, it\u2019s a hard out head back, and teeth showing kind of laugh. I\u2019m quite proud of my ability to do seven chin-ups. It used to be five.</p><p>\u201cSeven?\u201d Darryl squeezes my bicep between his thumb and index. \u201cThat\u2019s three more than what I assumed you could do.\u201d</p><p>I feign insult and fold my arms across my chest. \u201cAnd how many can you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hell of a lot more than seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d I say. Darryl</p><p>doesn\u2019t look like much. Sure he\u2019s lean and probably muscular under the shirt, but he doesn\u2019t look like he has that much strength behind him.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d He hands Jackson his clipboard and stopwatch. \u201cYou and me. We\u2019ll take a bar each and the first one to stop loses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold up,\u201d He extends his hand to me. \u201cLet\u2019s make it interesting. If I win, you\u2019ll stop making Seth show up late to training. If you win\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll wear a dress to the next fight.\u201d The words flew out of my mouth before I had a chance to think.</p><p>His dark lips smirk at me. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>We shake hands and approach the bars. Jackson joins us, counting us in. When the word \u2018go\u2019 falls from his lips, Darryl and I start with the chin-ups. Almost immediately my arms start burning and my muscles tremble. My lungs burn with lack of oxygen because I\u2019m holding my breath every time I pull myself up. I can hear Darryl breathing rhythmically and I realize this is a no brainer. He\u2019s going to beat me. I lower myself and use all my strength to slowly pull myself up. Jackson is laughing, having the time of his life watching us. Beside me, Darryl is pulling himself up and down quickly, like it\u2019s the easiest things he has ever done. My arms are going to let go. I can feel it. Screw it. I let the bar fall from my hands and I land with two feet on the floor. My muscles spasm under my skin and I lie down flat on my back on the cool mats. Darryl leans over me, hardly out of breath.</p><p>\u201cI did eight.\u201d I groan proudly.</p><p>He extends his hand to me and I take it. My arms feel like jelly. They feel as though they are going to separate from my body and float away any second now.</p><p>\u201cWell done,\u201d He smiles. \u201cNow stop making my boy late.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cYou and I both know nobody can make Seth do anything he doesn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s laughter catches my attention as he and Seth enter the room.</p><p>\u201cDarryl and Olivia just went head to head in a chin-up contest.\u201d Jackson announces, pulling his green shirt over his head and exposing a lot more muscle than I assumed he had. \u201cOlivia lost, obviously.\u201d He chuckles and I scowl at him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really lose.\u201d I state. \u201cI can do eight chin-ups now instead of seven.\u201d</p><p>Laughter erupts from everyone and I huff. I guess seven isn\u2019t brag worthy after all.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Darryl publicizes. \u201cI received a call from the MMAC earlier and they\u2019ve announced your match up with Joshua Donskov in seven days. You know the rules. No sex. No bad fats and no sugars. The fight is in Boston. Win that and you\u2019ll fight Don Russell for the pro contract in Las Vegas a week later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you knock Josh Donskov on his ass.\u201d Dad cheers and dread fills my stomach.</p><p>My dad can\u2019t go to Boston because I can\u2019t go to Boston to keep an eye on him. Mason will fire me if I ask for anymore time off. I\u2019ve asked for too much already. Jackson, Dad and Darryl enter a discussion about Josh Donskov and his \u2018brawler\u2019 technique. I pull Seth over to the side.</p><p>\u201cDad can\u2019t go to Boston...\u201d I whisper to him.</p><p>His warm hands rub my arms and my shoulders, massaging me. \u201cBetween the two of us we should be able to look after him.\u201d</p><p>I almost wince. He assumes I\u2019ll be going to Boston with him. \u201cSeth, I\u2019m not going with you to Boston...\u201d</p><p>His dark brows knit together. \u201cYou\u2019ve been to two of my fights. Surely, it\u2019s easier for you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about the fighting. It\u2019s about my work. I have a job and I\u2019ve taken too much time off already. I rely on my job to pay for rent, food and a million other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll cover all those things for a little while. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not a big deal? It\u2019s a very big deal. I\u2019m an adult which mean I am responsible for certain things. \u201cMason will probably fire me if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let him fire you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him fire me?\u201d I don\u2019t sound angry which is how I feel. \u201cLet him fire me? Are you insane? I need my job.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seth\u2019s eyes darken and his lips morph into a straight, impassive line.

Your blood pressure is high and you need to start taking it seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlly\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeth, tell him he can\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t look at him, but I can feel his heated stare on my face.

Let me know when you\u2019re finished here.\u201d I mutter, marching after my father.</p><p>Dad\u2019s pissed and in his office. I know because the blind is down. Whenever the blind is blocking the window, he doesn\u2019t want to see anyone which is fine by me.</p> <p>My fingers tangle in my hair and I hiss every time my scalp burns because of it. I thought the shower would help me, but I\u2019m still pissed. So let him fire you. Pfft. It\u2019s like my job isn\u2019t a big deal for him. Fine, I might not make as much money as him, but that doesn\u2019t mean my job isn\u2019t important. I squeeze soap onto a washcloth and hastily rub under my arms and over my breasts. The smell of grapefruit and pomegranate soothes me a little, taking away some of my agitation. Dad is going to be pissed at me for a while, but I know Mom will have my back, for once.</p><p>There\u2019s a knock on my door and I shake my head. This is the ladies shower room. Luckily the gym is closed and I\u2019m the only one in here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m showering.\u201d My door rattles and then unlocks. Seth steps in with his frustrated expression. \u201cPlease, come in anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think those words would make me go the other way?\u201d</p><p>I shrug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve pissed you off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAm I that obvious?\u201d</p><p>He drops his shorts and kicks them to the side. \u201cDon\u2019t be like that.\u201d</p><p>I hand him my cloth and he squeezes soap onto it. He makes trails of sweet smelling bubbles all over his skin as he washes it. I stand under the hot stream, letting the water run all of the soap from my body.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to force you to come to my fights now that you\u2019re my girlfriend.\u201d He isn\u2019t even looking at me. His eyes are on the sponge as it circles his stomach.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to quit my job and become some sad, dependent female that you carry around with you everywhere.\u201d</p><p>His gaze snaps to my face. \u201cIs that how you really feel?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNot usually, but this morning I\u2019m starting to wonder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about dependence. It\u2019s about support. You ease me and I want you to be there when I win.\u201d</p> <p>I sigh, stepping out of the flow of water so he can step under to rinse off the bubbles.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be there every time. It\u2019s unrealistic.\u201d</p><p>I try my hardest to keep my eyes on his. It\u2019s painful not looking everywhere else.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be travelling a lot, Olivia and I want you with me\u2014every time.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying to be as kind as I can, but I\u2019m still too angry. \u201cYeah, well, we don\u2019t always what we want.\u201d</p><p>I pull my towel out of my bag and run it over my wet body, drying up all of the droplets. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to back out you know.\u201d I tell him, referring to our relationship.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d He shuts off the shower and I hand him my towel.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re persistent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoiled.\u201d He smiles, correcting me. \u201cI\u2019m used to getting what I want.\u201d</p><p>Seth insisted on walking me to my desk this morning, much to Mason\u2019s dismay. Since then he hasn\u2019t done anything besides bark orders at me. I\u2019ve pissed him off big time and I know exactly why.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d an elderly woman demands. She tucks a short white curl around her ear. The patients have been extra bitchy today. \u201cI\u2019ve been sitting in this waiting room for an hour. My appointment was meant to be forty minutes ago.\u201d She doesn\u2019t say anything offensive or bitchy, but it\u2019s all in her annoying, high-pitched tone. I fight the urge to scowl and I smile warmly at her instead.</p><p>\u201cThank you for being so patient.\u201d Yeah right. \u201cYou're up next. Dr. Peterson won\u2019t be much longer.\u201d</p><p>With an elongated sigh, she turns away from me. Mason exits the therapy room with a patient. The man who goes by the name of Gary Voss, keeps his head down and nervously strolls from the office. The elderly woman jumps to her feet as Mason calls her into the therapy room and he brings Gary Voss\u2019s analysis sheet over to me.</p><p>\u201cFile this.\u201d He slides it onto my desk and leaves. I do as I\u2019m told and without a peek it goes into the file.</p><p>When he\u2019s done with the woman and she leaves, I realize there\u2019s no one else booked in until mid this afternoon. In my pocket my phone vibrates. I take it out and glance at the screen. Seth. I hit ignore. I can\u2019t talk right now. Besides, we didn\u2019t really talk after the shower at the gym and I don\u2019t want to piss Mason off even more. Speaking of Mason, he steps out of his office, his hands stuffed into the pockets of his black slacks.</p><p>\u201cHow was Concord?\u201d He asks friendly enough. His blond brows are furrowed slightly, but I know he\u2019s trying to clear things up between us.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I reply. \u201cSelena and I spent a lot of time together, so it was nice.\u201d</p><p>My phone vibrates again, making a muffled buzzing sound.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re phone is buzzing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at work. It will have to wait.\u201d</p><p>Mason's lips curve into a playful smile. \u201cAre you feeling okay? When have you ever ignored a text or phone call at work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I owe you now. You\u2019ve put up with a lot of my...\u201d Damn. I can\u2019t find the right word.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s time I give a little back and act like a proper employee.\u201d</p><p>He leans on my desk and just like that the animosity between us is gone.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t start doing what I hired you to do on my account.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cI\u2019m not that bad!\u201d</p><p>My phone starts up again, vibrating against my thigh.</p><p>\u201cAnswer it. I\u2019ll ignore it just this once.\u201d</p><p>I smile gratefully at him and pull my phone out of my pocket. It\u2019s Seth again. I tilt my screen toward me slightly, so Mason doesn\u2019t see.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia, Jesus Christ!\u201d His deep, furious voice startles me. Even Mason heard it. His eyebrows raise a little and his jaw tightens. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you been answering your God damned phone?\u201d</p><p>I feel my cheeks heat up and my heart rapidly pumps blood through my veins. What could have him so wound up? He seems desperate and worried. His voice makes my stomach tighten, threatening to push up the blueberries and yogurt that I had for breakfast.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at work, remember. What\u2019s going on? Why are you so mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He takes a deep, calming breath. \u201cYour dad has had a heart attack...\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>My heart stills and my throat constricts. I start sweating\u2014a cold sweat that slides from the nape of my neck right down my back and I swallow thickly as tears well in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d Seth says my name as tears spill over the brim.</p><p>\u201cIs-is he okay?\u201d</p><p>I bite my bottom lip too hard and I immediately taste blood. Mason leans forward, but I can\u2019t see him. All I see is my father\u2019s angry face.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive and he\u2019s in the Portland hospital. I\u2019m here with him and your mom. Do you want me to come get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d I don't want Seth to drive all the way here and then back to the hospital. I hang up and wipe the tears off my cheek.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>Far from it. I shake my head. \u201cI need a ride to the hospital. My dad had a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>Mason jogs to his office and grabs his jacket and keys. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I rise unsteadily from my chair still in total shock. I\u2019m glad my dad is okay, but the thought of being so close to losing him eats at me. Is it because I yelled at him? Mason\u2019s car is parked right out the front of his shop. It\u2019s a nice car, sporty, sleek and red. Inside, the material is leather and comfortable. Thank God I\u2019m wearing a seatbelt though. Every time he turns a corner I grip the seat in fear of sliding off of it. We pull up outside of the hospital and Mason follows me from the car. In any other circumstance I\u2019d be worried about Seth\u2019s reaction to me showing up with Mason, but there are bigger things I have to worry about right now.</p><p>I race right up to the concierge. The woman is alarmed by my frantic behavior and I control my breathing, trying to appear less frazzled.</p><p>\u201cRichard James. What room is he in?\u201d</p><p>I bite my nails while she searches her computer. \u201cFour-three-zero.\u201d</p><p>Mason thanks her and I tear up the corridor. I catch two elevators before I manage to find his room. Seth leans against the wall outside. He\u2019s twirling is phone around his fingers and chewing on a toothpick in thought.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d I call out to him.</p><p>His head snaps up to me and his eyes melt from worry to relief\u2014that is until he looks past me and sees Mason. I wrap my arms around Seth\u2019s neck and pull him into me. His strong arms circle my waist and he plants soft kisses on my neck.</p><p>\u201cI was so worried.\u201d He says. \u201cI thought you were catching the bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMason drove me... it seemed a little more realistic.\u201d I give him my best \u2018be nice\u2019 face and pull away from Seth to enter my dad\u2019s room. Machines beep around him and Mom reads a book on the recliner in the corner.</p><p>\u201cOlly? I thought you had work?\u201d Dad wonders as I approach his bed. His voice is a little tired, but other than that he looks okay. Mom puts her book down and jumps out of her seat to hug me. When she pulls me into her arms, the tears flow down my cheeks and I just can't stop them. They\u2019re tears of joy, tears of sadness. I\u2019m so relieved he\u2019s okay, but I still feel guilty. If I hadn\u2019t argued with him maybe this could\u2019ve been avoided.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I cry.</p><p>He shifts in his bed unable to sit up. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault. I should have listened to the doctor and your mother, and you in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Mom\u2019s hands rub my shoulders as she tries to soothe me. \u201cIt\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault. We got lucky and when we get home it\u2019s nothing but steamed vegetables and grilled foods for you.\u201d</p><p>Dad nods sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Seth.\u201d He says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth?\u201d</p><p>His eyes flick to the bed, nervously. \u201cHe came to my office to give me a \u2018no hard feelings\u2019 talk and I don\u2019t know what happened. My jaw started aching and I thought it was because of the beef jerky I was eating, but then there was this crushing sensation in my chest\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to relive it, honey.\u201d Mom says, leaning over the thing, white rails to kiss him. \u201cIt\u2019s up onwards and upwards from here.\u201d</p><p>Mason knocks on the door, drawing our attention and steps in. \u201cUh, Olivia, I have to go back to the office. You don\u2019t have to come. I\u2019ll take care of everything.\u201d</p><p>Mom smiles widely at him and I eye her suspiciously. If she so much as\u2014 \u201cThat is so nice of you, isn\u2019t it Olivia?\u201d</p><p>Wow. She\u2019s actually playing matchmaker right now.</p><p>\u201cYes it is,\u201d I reply, almost through clenched teeth. \u201cBut I need to work. I\u2019ve taken too much time off I need to pay rent and electricity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you move back in\u2014\u201d I flash my palm at her and cut her words off. I\u2019m so not going there, not right now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cover it.\u201d Seth offers casually, leaning against the door frame. How someone can so casually offer to support someone is beyond me. It\u2019s a big deal.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, I\u2019m not allowing you to come back to work. Now, you still have twelve paid days remaining of your annual leave. I\u2019ll just put it on that.\u201d Mason leans in and presses a kiss to my cheek. My eyes flick nervously from Seth\u2019s face. It wasn\u2019t a sexual gesture, nor do I think he did it on purpose to piss Seth off. He\u2019s just being friendly and supportive, I guess.</p><p>\u201cGive me a call when you\u2019re ready.\u201d He exits out the door, but not without earning a very subtle glare from Seth.</p><p>His chocolate irises fall back onto me and I give him a tight smile and a small shrug of my shoulders. A pretty female nurse sticks her head into the room. Her long, brown hair cascading over her slim shoulders. \u201cVisiting hours are over.\u201d She tells us. \u201cOnly one of you can stay to keep him company.\u201d</p><p>I rub my palms over my dress to remove some of the sweat. Now that the initial shock has worn off, I only feel nauseous.</p><p>\u201cWell, Seth and I will go, but I\u2019ll come back first thing tomorrow morning. If you need anything\u2014anything at all\u2014call me. Immediately.\u201d</p><p>I kiss Mom and Dad, lingering a second longer on Dad\u2019s stubbly cheek.</p><p>\u201cI love you both.\u201d I say as I wrap an arm around Seth\u2019s waist. He slings his arm over my shoulder, pulling me into him. I don\u2019t have to look at Mom to know she doesn\u2019t approve, even after Seth basically saved Dad\u2019s life he still isn\u2019t good enough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A few people scatter the narrow hallway as they say goodbye to their family members. I look up at Seth and his toothpick flicks across the span of his lips as he teases it with his tongue. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>I stop walking and cut in front of him. He pulls the thin, wooden toothpick from his mouth and his eyes focus on my face.</p> <p>\u201cFor going back to the gym to talk to my dad and for saving his life.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s eyebrows crinkle slightly, like he\u2019s uncomfortable. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Why does thanking you make you so uncomfortable?\u201d</p><p>His gaze flits to the floor as he sticks the toothpick back into his mouth. After what felt like an eternity of being silent, he lifts his gaze to me, looking even more uncomfortable than before.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not used to it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not used to being thanked?\u201d I brush my finger along his forearm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m usually the cause of a problem, not the solution.\u201d</p><p>I frown. He doesn\u2019t even realize how much he\u2019s helped me. He\u2019s helped me not fall back into the same routines with Blade. He saved me from Brent and improved my relationship with Dad. Before Seth, my dad was a lot more like my mom\u2014always pushing for me to move back home and because of all of that the next words fell from my lips without thought.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my solution.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitch and he removes his toothpick as the tension in his expression melts away. His arms surround my waist, drawing me closer. To see him relaxed and happy sends a strong, tightening feeling through my chest. All I want is for him to be happy and I\u2019ve never wanted something so badly in my life. Seth pulls me into him, resting his head on mine and his hand trails comfortingly up and down my spine. I\u2019m scared to pull away\u2014I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, but it\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve ever felt before. The feelings I had for Blade pale in comparison to what I\u2019m feeling now. Love? No\u2014yes\u2014I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m confused. Is love meant to be so sickening? I feel sick\u2014I feel like crying. I feel like crushing Seth in my arms and never letting go. I\u2019m almost certain I\u2019d completely dissolve into nothing without him. I want to run away because I\u2019m absolutely petrified. Seth likes me, I know he does, but what if there\u2019s no future here. I\u2019m not a mind reader, but I\u2019m certain this isn\u2019t what he\u2019d expect of me after barely one day of being together. I can\u2019t scare him away...</p><p>I\u2019ve been sitting around dad\u2019s room for the last two hours while he sleeps. Mom has brought her nail kit in for something to do and since she\u2019s done her nails twice already, she decided to attack mine. I can\u2019t complain I suppose, they are in need of some serious grooming. I\u2019ve been biting them too much lately.</p> <p>I miss Seth. After the hospital yesterday Seth and I hung out around his house. His Mom wasn\u2019t home and we didn\u2019t have sex because Darryl put the \u2018no sex until after the fight\u2019 restriction on him. Seth was a little eager to break it and just tell Darryl that he didn\u2019t have sex, but I felt bad and told Seth to wait.</p><p>\u201cSo, your boss is a nice guy.\u201d Mom says casually.</p><p>I almost snort. \u201cYeah, he is.\u201d</p><p>She rakes the nail filer over my skin and I wince as its rough edge scratches my skin. \u201cHe\u2019s handsome, too.\u201d</p><p>I drag in a breath. \u201cYes, he is.\u201d I used to think Mason was so, so, so handsome and I\u2019d even flush a little when I thought about him, but then Seth showed up and in my opinion, no one holds a candle to his looks, not even blue-eyed, blond haired Mason. Mason is bright and innocent\u2014too much of a gentlemen in most instances. Seth is dark and confident. He doesn\u2019t care for being subtle. He doesn\u2019t care how he looks to other people. It thrills him.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever thought about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go there, Sandra.\u201d Dad interjects. His voice is husky from sleep. \u201cIt\u2019s her boss and he\u2019s too old for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAge doesn\u2019t define a man. He\u2019s successful and handsome. You\u2019re young so children shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p> <p>I pull my hand away from her, insulted. \u201cSeth is young, handsome and successful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Seth\u2019s looks won\u2019t last long when he\u2019s constantly getting beaten by men bigger than him. He can only be successful for short periods of time in his line of work and it\u2019s not something you want to raise your children around. I mean, how long have you two been fooling around? It\u2019s just fun, right?\u201d</p><p>Dad hits the button on his bed and slowly raises himself to a sitting position. \u201cWho cares if it\u2019s just fun or not. Seth is a good kid. He saved my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it was more of a \u2018right place at the right time\u2019 kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>Are you kidding me? \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you should be any less grateful.\u201d</p><p>Powerless anger rages through me, making my throat curl tightly around my words. My mom says a lot of pointless, hurtful things\u2014all with good intention (or so she claims) but nothing she has ever said has upset me to the point of becoming extremely angry with her, until now. I glance at Dad, he\u2019s shooting daggers at Mom too and I realize this isn\u2019t the time or place to argue with Mom about Seth. If she wants to be snobby and ungrateful, fine. Let her be, but it won\u2019t change my opinion. Ever. I\u2019ve seen underneath Seth\u2019s hard, cocky shell. I\u2019ve seen his soft side. I\u2019ve seen him vulnerable and hurt. There\u2019s more to him than meets the eye. A hell of a lot more.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Dad, when can you go home?\u201d</p><p>The pink blush in Dad\u2019s cheeks fade and Mom huffs, hating the topic change. \u201cHopefully after lunch, I have to wait two weeks before I can go back to work, but after that it should be okay. They\u2019ve encouraged me to do more cardio and eat better foods as well. Boston is definitely off the cards for me now.\u201d</p><p>I try to give him an encouraging smile, but even I felt its sympathetic curl. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know how much going to Boston meant to you...\u201d</p><p>He flicks his hand like it\u2019s no big deal, but I know otherwise. He was so upset in the gym yesterday when Seth and I said he couldn\u2019t go. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. At least one of us is going.\u201d</p><p>I blink. Oh. He means me. \u201cI\u2019m not going either, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He\u2019s just as confused as Seth was when I told him. \u201cHave you and Seth had a fight?\u201d</p><p>I swear I hear Mom\u2019s breath catch hopefully.</p><p>\u201cNo. I have work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is Seth okay with that?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cHe isn\u2019t too happy about it.\u201d</p><p>Mom jumps at her chance to enter the conversation. \u201cThose fighter types are very hard headed.\u201d Dad rolls his eyes. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t hit you or anything has he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Mom? No, he hasn\u2019t hit me. He\u2019d never do that.\u201d</p><p>She folds her arms tightly across her blue cardigan and I hear her tap her heel against the hard floor. \u201cThey snap easily, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney,\u201d Dad says, pulling my attention from Mom\u2019s face. \u201cYou should go. You only have a short time before he goes to pro. You can skip as many as you want then, but at least be a part of his beginning.\u201d Dad\u2019s brown eyes flick to his hands nervously and then back to my face. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the gym, he\u2019s distracted by you and when you\u2019re not there during training, he becomes preoccupied with his thoughts, stuck in some far off world. As soon as Darryl blows the whistle and training is over he can\u2019t get out the door quick enough.\u201d His words make my insides swell. At least he can see how much Seth cares about me. \u201cHe can\u2019t even go one fight without calling you to the locker room before he goes on. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be able to be away from you.\u201d He turns his attention to Mom. \u201cIf you opened your eyes just a little bit wider, Sandra, you\u2019d see that Seth worships the ground our daughter walks on. He admires her. Initially, I knew he wasn\u2019t the kind of guy I\u2019d want around my daughter, but I can tell through his fighting, his training\u2014everything, that when he cares for something, he\u2019ll give it everything he has. You should be honored that Olivia has someone like him to respect her and to protect her because when we die\u2014and we will die\u2014we should want our daughter to be protected by someone who\u2019d protect her as fiercely as her own parents would... and Seth\u2019s that guy.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never respected my dad more than I do in this moment. I know he likes Seth, but I didn\u2019t know that he\u2019d trust him wholly with his only daughter and that means more to me than words can ever describe. I kiss my Dad on the cheek and tear from the hospital room, leaving Mom\u2019s defeated pout behind me. The clatter of my shoes ring in my ear as I sprint down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cNo running!\u201d A janitor calls from behind me, but I ignore him. If I stop before I get to my car I might unwillingly come to my senses. After I see Seth, I\u2019m going to call Mason and tell him that I want some time off because I want to be with Seth. I want to be there to support him, rain or shine, win or lose. If Mason doesn\u2019t let me...then I\u2019ll quit because life is too short to not have what you want. When you think back on your childhood or your life last week even, you don\u2019t remember the hours you slaved at work or doing things you hate. You remember going outside. You remember being with your friends and loving life. I want to look back on my life and not regret it. If Seth becomes a distant memory I want to be able to honestly say I had the time of my life. Mason can take away my job, but I\u2019ll still be alive. Alive. That\u2019s a pretty big opportunity and I\u2019d hate to waste it.</p><p>I know Seth will be finishing up at the gym any minute now and I want to catch him off guard. When I see Seth\u2019s car in the car park, I pull up next to it and practically jump out the door before I put my car in park. The seatbelt snags me back in my seat and I groan. I probably should take it off. I unclip my seatbelt and manage to exit the car on the second attempt. I push through the glass doors and into the main area. I see Seth sitting against the boxing ring in front of his entire team and everyone\u2019s attention is on me. My entrance wasn\u2019t exactly subtle. Seth is covered in glorious sweat and it glistens all over. He stands abruptly, concern clear on his face and steps forward. I rush toward him, my breath coming out in sharp, short breaths.</p><p>\u201cO, is everything\u2014\u201d</p><p>I jump and slam into him, crushing my mouth to his and ignoring our audience. I wrap my legs around his waist and I squeeze him against me with all that I have. My fingers run into his damp hair and I run my tongue along his plump bottom lip.</p><p>\u201c...maybe we should leave.\u201d Jackson suggest as I pull away.</p><p>Seth\u2019s eyes search mine, trying to decipher what the hell is propelling my actions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to Boston with you.\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He tries to bite back his smile, but it spreads across his face in full force. \u201cAnd Mason?\u201d</p><p>His brown eyes never stray from mine. They\u2019re penetrating me, coaxing me to say exactly what he wants me to say. And I say it. \u201cFuck Mason.\u201d</p><p>His mouth claims mine again and I feel him carrying me away from our silent audience.</p><p>\u201cIf you two aren\u2019t out in four minutes. I\u2019m coming in.\u201d Darryl calls after us.</p><p>Our mouths remained joined up until my back is pressed against cold concrete. I open my eyes and pull away. We\u2019re in the shower room\u2014the men\u2019s shower room. It looks exactly like the woman's shower room...fancy that.</p><p>\u201cTell me again.\u201d Seth groans, kissing my neck and making my head swim.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming to Boston with you.\u201d I say, emphasizing the words. His tongue glides against my skin, igniting the blood beneath it. I\u2019ve missed him so much even though he dropped me home before he went to the gym this morning. I happily run my hands over his slick, wet body\u2014around his neck, over his shoulders and down his arms, eliciting a groan from the base of his throat. He places a soft kiss at the tip of my nose and rests his forehead against mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you change your mind?\u201d I subtly revel in the sensation of his hot breath on my face. I don\u2019t want to tell Seth what my dad said. Dad isn\u2019t one to express his thoughts like that and I want to preserve it in its purest form straight from the source. I feel if I repeat it, it\u2019ll lose its sentiment.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say, a little birdy helped me decide what\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>I slide down his body until my feet are firmly on the ground. \u201cI\u2019m honored that you\u2019re dad thinks so highly of me.\u201d</p><p>Seth knows I was at the hospital with my dad this morning and I guess he put two and two together. I shrug, trying not to laugh. \u201cBeauty and brains, that\u2019s rare. Maybe it was Mom.\u201d</p><p>He laughs once. \u201cNo, your mom thinks I\u2019m the big bad wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo she doesn\u2019t...\u201d Yeah. I\u2019m not convincing anybody. For a housewife, Mom is very pushy.</p><p>\u201cEither way, I\u2019m happy you\u2019ve decided to come with me. Now I can stop driving myself insane with plots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he smiles, dropping his shorts to shower in the wide-open room. Heat mingles with the blood under my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to think of ways to get you to come to Boston. Some were silly, some were strange and some were just downright illegal.\u201d</p><p>His words coax a laugh from me and I watch as he walks over to the far wall and turns on the shower. The water pours over his body and soon steam engulfs the room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not joining me?\u201d He asks with a wicked smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I want to. I want to get naked and feel his hands all over me, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m showering in the open. Not when there\u2019s a room full of boys next to us. I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m fine just watching.\u201d</p><p>I retrieve my phone from my back pocket. Mason is going to hate what I have to say. Seth\u2019s fight is in six days. I dial Mason\u2019s number and he answers immediately.</p><p>\u201cOlivia? Hi. How\u2019s your Dad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s good. They\u2019re letting him go home today.\u201d Darryl sticks his head into the bathroom, relieved to see us on opposite sides. I feel myself blush because Seth is so exposed, but neither of the men seems to care. Darryl hooks a blue towel onto a towel holder and with a swift nod he leaves.</p><p>\u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d Mason asks.</p><p>Seth shuts of the shower and walks over to his towel. I admire his body while he walks. It\u2019s perfection. Every muscle clad limb is perfectly tight, shaped and muscular. He runs the towel over his head, across his chest and down his arms before wrapping the towel around his narrow hips.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s\u2014I\u2019m fine.\u201d I stutter, becoming flustered by Seth. I feel like a moron. He isn\u2019t even touching me and my brain is foggy. Seth notices my hiccup and he smiles his trademark smile at me. \u201cThere\u2019s something I need to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d Mason replies cautiously.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Boston and I need some time off.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cAnd after that, assuming things go according to plan, I need more time off to go to Las Vegas.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cMason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I heard you.\u201d He exhales. \u201cYou\u2019re going to put his career ahead of yours?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really a career, I mean, I\u2019m only a receptionist.\u201d</p><p>Mason\u2019s tone darkens. \u201cOnly a receptionist? What business runs smoothly without a receptionist? As far as I\u2019m concerned you have the most important job at this practice and what about your dad? He\u2019ll need your support.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to divulge everything to Mason. He\u2019s my boss. When an employee asks for time off the only role the employer has it to say yes or no. None of this digging around in personal information crap.</p><p>\u201cMy dad was the one who convinced me to go to Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I say no?\u201d</p><p>There it is. \u201cThen I have no choice but to quit...\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Just like that?\u201d</p><p>I nod, aware he can\u2019t see it. Seth leans against wall beside me, crossing his arms over his chest.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, I was wrong about you. Here I was thinking you were a mature adult, but you\u2019re far from that. You\u2019ll risk your job just to follow your new boyfriend around\u2014it\u2019s actually immature. Are you that afraid he\u2019s going to be unfaithful to you, is that why you go? Because he's an animal and can't keep is dick in his pants for five Goddamn seconds?\u201d Mason's tone is icy and it sends a cold dread through my ear and into the pit of my stomach. Strangely, there\u2019s an urge to cry pushing at the base of my throat, but I press my tongue to the roof of my mouth to stop it. It\u2019s not about Seth. I know he wouldn\u2019t be unfaithful to me. Sure his promiscuous past makes the odds stack up highly against me, but they\u2019re invisible to me. I want to cry because I\u2019ve upset Mason so much. It\u2019s not his fault he\u2019s so mad. I\u2019ve messed him around a lot the past few weeks and he\u2019s been beyond accommodating. That amount of stress would get to anyone.</p><p>\u201cYes or no, Mason. That\u2019s all I want you to say.\u201d</p><p>He takes an eternity to answer me. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s it. My two year long employment is done and I\u2019m officially unemployed... it really doesn\u2019t feel good. I swallow hard. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I hang up and tap the phone in the palm of my hand. \u201cSo that\u2019s that.\u201d I sigh.</p><p>Seth\u2019s arms engulf me, pulling me in close. \u201cWe\u2019ll work something out once the tournament is over in a few weeks. Until then let me take care of you. I\u2019ll cover your rent and electricity\u2014food\u2014whatever you need. It\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d</p><p>That sounds nice, but I can\u2019t do it. The thought of being so dependent and leechy makes me nauseous.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I have a good amount of savings. It should cover me for a month maximum. I can sort something out by then.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles and his chest vibrates under my cheek. \u201cYou are stubborn.\u201d He squeezes me tighter against him. \u201cWhatever you choose to do, I\u2019ve got your back.\u201d I tilt my head and gaze into his brown eyes. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>I hardly see Seth the next six days. He\u2019s so busy with training and preparing for this weekend. Even I\u2019m nervous. We leave today and Seth should be here in twenty minutes to pick me up. Sadly, Selena can\u2019t come this time. Her dad has requested she start doing something with her life and put in extra hours at the firm. She\u2019s all distraught about it, but now she has researched a few courses she can study, she feels a little better, but her dad still suffers her cold shoulder. My phone rings, pulling me from my thoughts. I leap of the couch and run to the kitchen bench where I\u2019m charging my phone. I pull the cable out and answer it.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Selena\u2019s cheery voice squeals. \u201cI\u2019ve done it! I know what I\u2019m going to become!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA police officer!\u201d</p><p>I almost laugh out loud. Selena, a police officer? I don\u2019t think so. She hates cleaning because she always breaks a nail. I\u2019m pretty sure you can\u2019t have long, strange colored nails as a police officer... dress code and all that.</p><p>\u201cA police officer? Really?\u201d</p><p>She sounds almost offended. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to picture you chase bad guys and shoot guns. No offence, but it\u2019s not looking pretty.\u201d</p><p>She snorts. \u201cYeah, well, I\u2019ll show you. Anyway, you\u2019re leaving today and I\u2019m so bummed. I wish I could come... I\u2019m going to miss Jackson.\u201d</p><p>I open the fridge and grab two small bottles of water. \u201cGee, don\u2019t miss me or anything.\u201d</p><p>I cross the kitchen floor and into the lounge room. I place the two bottles of water on top of my little purple suitcase.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ll miss you! That goes without saying. How long will you be away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you twice already. We\u2019re going to stay a few days in Boston and if he wins, the next stop is Las Vegas for a week or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis fights are really close together...doesn\u2019t he need time to recover or whatever?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know a lot about the tournament, but Darryl did tell me that once he goes pro it can be months between fights. Until then, Seth has to avoid getting hit as much as possible. So far, so good. I\u2019m yet to see a fist connect with his face. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it works.\u201d I mutter.</p><p>There\u2019s a soft knock on the door and my nervousness kicks up a notch. \u201cHey, I gotta go now, but call me in a day or two, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, alright. Have fun and don\u2019t do anything I wouldn\u2019t do. Love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you.\u201d I hang up and slip my phone into the front pocket of my lemon colored cardigan. I like this cardigan. It was a gift from my Nan before she passed away. My favorite outfit to wear with it is a pair of white jeans and a white lace top. I race to the door and throw it open. Seth looks as drool-worthy as ever. How he manages to wear a pair of jeans and a plain grey t-shirt and still look amazing is annoyingly beyond me. His hair glistens slightly, like he\u2019s showered recently. His skin looks smooth and soft and I really want to reach out and touch it. He drinks me in with an amused smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like a coconut-lemon bonbon.\u201d He laughs, leaning on the door frame.</p><p>\u201cHa. Ha.\u201d I deadpan.</p><p>He steps forward, his eyes burning confidently into mine\u2014no\u2014lustily. \u201cI love lemon bonbons.\u201d His smile turns cocky. \u201cThey melt in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>I feel a hot red flush creeping up my cheeks and he notices. His eyes sparkle, looking perfectly amused with my reaction and he steps forward, allowing his hands to slide into the nape of my neck. Then, he kisses me, teasing me with his teeth as he nips at my bottom lip. He steps forward, sliding his other hand down my side before cupping my ass and squeezing me against him. I know he\u2019s doing this to work me up, knowing very well that I can\u2019t do a damn thing about it. He pulls away and catches his bottom lip between his teeth. \u201cMm. You taste better than any kind of sweet.\u201d</p><p>I groan. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make this painful for me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He nods his head. \u201cImagine what it\u2019s doing to me.\u201d</p><p>I step away and roll my suitcase to him. I lock my door and follow Seth down the stairs to the car. My suitcase easily slips onto the empty back seat.</p><p>\u201cJackson isn\u2019t coming?\u201d I wonder aloud.</p><p>Seth opens my door and I climb in. \u201cYeah, but he\u2019s riding with Darryl and the others.\u201d</p><p>I smile. Alone time with Seth would be very nice. I\u2019ve barely seen him this week and I\u2019ve missed him like crazy. I\u2019m excited to be leaving Portland and I\u2019m especially excited for Seth\u2019s fight to be over. I crave\u2014no\u2014I need to be close to him, in every sense.</p><p>As we roll onto the highway, a ringtone buzzes throughout the car and my attention falls onto the center console. \u2018Mom\u2019 is calling. Seth swiftly hits ignore.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d I ask. \u201cDid she end up going to the program?\u201d</p><p>I glance sideways at Seth. His hands squeeze the steering wheel briefly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d His voice is almost sad\u2014disappointed. I look at my hands also disappointed.</p><p>\u201cI was certain she would...\u201d</p><p>He smiles a painfully fake smile without looking at me. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m done. When I picked her up from the hospital last night\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, the hospital?\u201d I sound more offended than worried and maybe I am. Why didn\u2019t he call me?</p><p>\u201cYeah, she fell down some stairs at a bar and hit her head. She\u2019s okay; it\u2019s just a little cut.\u201d</p><p>Noticing my apprehension he adds. \u201cI didn\u2019t call you because it was really late and I wasn\u2019t in the mood for someone to feel sorry for me.\u201d</p><p>A little harsh, but understandable...I suppose. \u201cI just hate that you had to do it on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing it on my own for years now. What\u2019s a few more, right?\u201d</p><p>My heart wrenches in my chest. There\u2019s so much responsibility on his shoulders. Balancing finances, his career, strict diet requirements and intense training\u2014how does he even function properly?</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019re done? What does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means I refuse to carry her through life like a child for a second longer. I contacted a rehab in California last night. The company picked her up this morning.\u201d</p><p>I wait a while for his words to sink in. He sent his mother to rehab...on the other side of the country?</p><p>\u201cCalifornia is a long way away, Seth.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI need her as far away from me as possible. Otherwise she\u2019ll beg that I come visit and then she\u2019ll convince me to sign her release. I can\u2019t...not this time.\u201d</p><p>Not this time? He\u2019s sent her to a rehab before? I look at him. His jaw is clenched tightly, his features pulled forward into a frown. I don\u2019t question him anymore. I can see that it\u2019s difficult for him and so I say the only I can say. \u201cYou did the right thing.\u201d</p><p>The crinkle in his brow smoothes out. I said exactly what he wanted to hear. No doubt he\u2019s been playing some kind of emotional tug-of-war with his decision and I\u2019m glad that I could ease it a little.</p><p>Boston is huge compared to Portland. The buildings are taller and newer. I practically squish my face against the cool glass as I try to get a closer look. I\u2019ve never been out of Portland. Why haven\u2019t I travelled? Seeing new places is amazing and it\u2019s fresh. Although people are busily walking the sidewalks to get to appointments and important meetings, I feel like this place is untouched, like I just discovered it. Seth pulls up outside a very ritzy hotel and a man in an adorable black hat opens my door.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, madam.\u201d He greets me, extending a white gloved hand.</p><p>I glance awkwardly at Seth who\u2019s watching me with a pleased expression. I take the man\u2019s hand and he helps me from the car. Seth takes me from the man and tells him about the bags. Happily, the man nods and retrieves the luggage from the car. We enter the building through a gold rotating door and Seth keeps his fingers locked with mine as we approach his team in the lobby. Darryl, Jackson and the other three whose faces I\u2019ve become accustomed to, but have no idea what their names are, are absolutely delighted to see that Seth and I arrive on time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check in.\u201d Seth says, kissing the top of my head.</p><p>I admire the lobby while Darryl explains the plans for tonight and tomorrow. The lobby is vast and well decorated with marble statues and gold trimmings. No rugs adorn the floor and shoe heels clatter against the tiles all around me. There\u2019s a delightful smell, like vanilla and rosemary and the classical music playing softly through hidden speakers makes me feel light and relaxed. This hotel is hands down the nicest place I\u2019ve ever stayed. Oh, and imagine what the bath is going to look like\u2014assuming I have one.</p><p>\u201cWhere are Don and Josh staying?\u201d Jackson asks Darryl, sitting on the top of his own suitcase and brushing his hands over his jeans.</p><p>\u201cJosh and Don are both across town in the Plaza hotel. Their management has assured me we shouldn\u2019t have any run-ins before the fight. It\u2019s a big city. The chances of us running into them tonight are slim.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTonight?\u201d I ask seeing the dream of a long, hot soak slip away.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re all going out tonight.\u201d Jackson replies. \u201cEven Seth.\u201d</p><p>Crap. The thought of hitting the cubs in a foreign city scares the hell out of me. Portland clubs are bad and always packed, meaning Boston is probably twice as bad and twice as packed. The last time I went out I punched a girl in the face and I\u2019m not too keen to go through that again. Not to mention I didn\u2019t pack anything for a night out.</p> <p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be out for long.\u201d Seth says, coming to stand beside me. His arm hooks around my waist, pressing my side against his. \u201cI can\u2019t drink and I need as much sleep as I can get for tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Jackson chuckles. \u201cWe need a designated driver and you can leave once we get to Polaris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time?\u201d Seth asks.</p><p>\u201cWe want to be there at ten or eleven. It doesn\u2019t really matter. The good shows don\u2019t start until midnight.\u201d</p><p>Nightclubs in Boston do shows? I relax a little. Maybe we\u2019re going to theatre or something similar to that. I pray to God that\u2019s the case.</p> <p>That is so not the case. Polaris is a strip club. How the hell did I not see this coming? Seth nudges me further into the club as I awkwardly watch females grind on poles and on men in booths. I mean, it\u2019s definitely the nicest strip club I\u2019ve seen\u2014correction\u2014gentlemen\u2019s club as Darryl says, but that doesn\u2019t make me less uneasy. I finger the button holes on my white silk blouse, nervously as Seth places his hand on my lower back and escorts me over to a huge booth at the other side of the room. As soon as we\u2019re seated, a topless woman with fake boobs walks casually over to us. Her skirt is short and plaid, barely covering her ass cheeks. Her nipples are hard and pointing directly at my face. I wonder if she\u2019s cold. She introduces herself as Vivian and bends over to adjust one of her knee high stockings while her breasts rest on the table. The boys are absolutely lapping it up and when she straightens they throw their drink orders at her.</p><p>\u201cAnything for you, sweetheart?\u201d She asks me. Her voice is high and sugary.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d I reply, unable to look her in the face. I\u2019m so far out of my comfort zone it\u2019s not even funny.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no fun.\u201d She replied, pouting her overly-glossed, cherry red lips at me. She steps closer, and crouches down. Her boobs brush my arm and a pang of nauseous embarrassment rolls through my stomach. \u201cI\u2019ll have to show you a good time another way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d</p><p>Beside me Seth chuckles, making heat seep into my cheeks.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Her warm, soft thumb brushes down my cheek. \u201cWe\u2019ll, you let me know, honey.\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes fall onto Seth. \u201cWhat about you, handsome? Can I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>He speaks to her so casually like she\u2019s not topless and rubbing her tits on my arm. \u201cNo. I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>With a swift nod, Vivian struts over to the bar and I\u2019m suddenly grateful my dad isn\u2019t here. That would have made this the single, most embarrassing moment of my life.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been to a strip club before?\u201d Jackson calls out from across the booth. His hair is slicked into a spiky mess on the top of his head and he\u2019s smiling at me like I\u2019m some strange hermit crab.</p><p>\u201cNo... I\u2019ve never really felt the need to.\u201d</p><p>Seth looks at me, highly amused and he\u2019s smiling that wide smile I like so much. \u201cWhat?\u201d I say. \u201cAm I that weird?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d He hooks his arm around my neck and brings his lips to mine. \u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>Only we understand the double meaning to that word. When Vivian comes back with our drinks, Jackson drags us all from the booth and over to the elegant lounges in front of the wide stage. The floor is illumined with white lights and three girls dance slowly to the music, shaking and swaying everything.</p><p>\u201cWhich one of you is up for a good time?\u201d Vivian giggles, leaning over our table.</p><p>Her eyes definitely flicker between Seth and Jackson. I really don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll handle Seth or Jackson getting a lap dance. I\u2019ll have to tell Selena...girl code and all that and maybe she won\u2019t care. Jackson hands her money and flicks his eyebrows at me. I watch him, confused by his gesture. Again, Seth is laughing beside me as Vivian sets her sights on me. There\u2019s a seductive smile on her red lips and she leans right down to my ear. \u201cJust relax.\u201d She breathes.</p><p>Immediately, I go rigid and stare wide eyed as her bum cheeks grind against my lap. Jackson and everyone else\u2014including Seth\u2014are having the time off their lives watching and laughing at my frightened expression. This is so not happening right now. What do I do? How long does this go for? When will it stop? Questions fill my mind one after the other and I\u2019m too scared to voice them. She presses her back against my chest and rubs her hands around my neck. I swallow hard, keeping my hands balled into fist at my side. I don\u2019t like this. This isn\u2019t fun...not to me. She turns on me, rubbing her hard breasts against my own. I look at Seth, who\u2019s still smiling away.</p><p>\u201cSeth...\u201d I say, giving him my best \u2018get me the fuck out of here\u2019 expression. He nods his head and shuffles toward me, but he\u2019s too late to stop her as she brings her my lips to mine and sucks my bottom lip into her mouth. I gasp. What the fuck? Are strippers even allowed to do that? How much did Jackson give her? Instinctively, I shoot out from underneath her and my hands fly up to cover my mouth. She smiles innocently up at me and Jackson and the rest of the team clench their sides in fits of laughter. I went along with it as much as I could, but a line has been crossed and I want to go home.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well.\u201d A deep, skin-crawling voice chuckles from behind. A heavy hand plants itself on my hip, pulling me backwards slightly. I whip my neck to the side, immediately seeing Don\u2019s bald head and scruffy jaw. \u201cThat was quite the show. I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing another.\u201d</p><p>Seth jumps to his feet and the rest of the team follow him. Vivian smiles sweetly and takes her leave. Seth\u2019s stare flickers from Don\u2019s hand on my hip to his face. Darryl is talking in a low tone to Seth, but he doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s listening to a word he\u2019s saying. He\u2019s seething. I can see his jaw work and clench, his fingers flex at his sides and his chest rises and falls in deep pants. I try to step forward, but Don increases his grip, limiting my movement.</p><p>\u201cDon,\u201d One of his team members warn him. \u201cLet the girl go.\u201d</p><p>Don chuckles and I don\u2019t think he gives a shit about the tournament. He just wants to get back at Seth. Normally, when I run into Don at the fights, he isn\u2019t touching me and I\u2019m able to slip away before he does... but today is different and I\u2019m worried if I move, Seth will do something stupid. His thick finger flicks hair over my shoulder and I flinch away from his touch. \u201cShe\u2019s a little timid, but if you leave her with me for the night I\u2019m sure I can straighten her out for you.\u201d</p><p>Seth starts forward, but Jackson and Darryl stop him. His nostrils are flaring, his eyes wanting blood.</p><p>\u201cYou heard your team.\u201d He growls. \u201cLet her go, this is between you and me.\u201d</p><p>A deep laugh rumbles through Don\u2019s chest, vibrating against my back. \u201cYou brought her into this, not me.\u201d</p><p>I glance around the club, a few people are watching, but they\u2019re intrigued not frightened or worried. They want to see something happen here. I try to step forward again and Don\u2019s hand clamps down. I wince at the pressure and Seth surges forward, dragging a useless Darryl and Jackson behind him. Don shoves me aside and I fall toward the floor. The hip he had a hold on slams into the tiles, sending a sharp pain down my leg. I push myself up on my elbow and watch Seth\u2019s closed fist connect with the side of Don\u2019s face. Strippers begin to squeal and call for security as Don and Seth exchange punches blow for blow, their teams powerless to stop the two beasts. Soon, everyone is in on it\u2014team against team\u2014beating each other senseless. My nerves are electrified and my heart is rapidly pushing blood around my veins. I become dizzy with adrenaline and fear. This is it. Seth is out of the competition and it\u2019s all my fault.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d I call over the grunting and screaming.</p><p>Tears threaten my eyes and I force myself up onto my feet. \u201cSeth!\u201d I call again.</p><p>The security guards are on them like flies, pulling them off each other. Seth\u2019s eyes lock with mine and when I see his face, tears pour over the brim of my eyes. There\u2019s a cut on his eyebrow and it\u2019s leaking blood down his cheek.</p><p>\u201cSeth, Go!\u201d Darryl shouts. \u201cI\u2019ll handle everything here.\u201d</p><p>Seth storms toward me, scooping me up into his arms like he had all of the energy in the world. I wrap my arms around his neck and it\u2019s damp with sweat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I cry into his shoulder.</p><p>He pulls me tighter against him and I squeeze my eyes shut. Soon, the busy noise of the street and the cool night air coax me into opening my eyes. The valet brings Seth\u2019s car around and they stare at us, but aren\u2019t brave enough to ask questions. Seth sits me in the passenger seat and shuts the door with a slam, startling me. He climbs into the driver\u2019s seat and speeds off, not saying anything the whole way back to the hotel. I have no idea what\u2019s going through his head and I want to pry, but respectively remain silent. We pull into the hotel and he jumps from the car and storms around to my side. He pulls the door open and scoops me from the car before carrying me into the lobby. I feel silly because I am more than capable of walking. Other residents try not to stare while some openly gape at us and Seth ignores them all. When we\u2019re safe in our room he finally puts me down.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He demands urgently and I nod my head.</p><p>Seth paces in front of me. He can\u2019t breathe. He doesn\u2019t want me to know it, but I can tell. His chest is moving shallowly and his face is strained, almost desperate. He scoops up an ornament of a Greek God and throws it against the wall in the living room. I jump as the porcelain shatters into hundreds of pieces and he turns back to me, his eyes burning darkly though narrowed slights.</p><p>\u201cGo to bed.\u201d He orders.</p><p>I take a step back. \u201cBut you\u2019re not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck! I said go to bed!\u201d He snaps, running his finger impatiently through his hair.</p><p>His eyes are dark, the darkest I\u2019ve ever seen them and my heart cracks painfully in my chest. He\u2019s mad at me... I slowly turn away from him, heading up the clear, glass stairs to my left. My heels click against them, echoing around the quiet hotel room. When I get into the room, I drop onto the bed, pressing my face into the purple satin pillow. How did tonight get so shitty? I know I should have stayed here in the hotel room. I was going to, but Seth insisted I keep him company. Look how that turned out.</p><p>Somewhere between crying, listening to Seth smash things and yell at people on the phone I feel asleep. When I open my eyes, it's still dark, but the lounge room light is filtering through the cracks. I slide off the bed and wobble unsteadily in my heels. I grasp the door handle and open it slowly. Hopefully Seth has calmed down and wants my company. Like earlier, my heels click and clack down the staircase. I can\u2019t see Seth anywhere and I can\u2019t hear him either. At the bottom of the stairs, there\u2019s a scattered pile of porcelain. I turn up the short hallway and open the cleaning cupboard in search of a dustpan and brush. Glass in your feet is not a good time. I crouch down and sweep as much of the glass into the pan as I can. The floor being a lush, white carpet doesn\u2019t make it any easier.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to clean up after me.\u201d His calm voice startles me, but I don\u2019t turn around to look at him in fear of him sending me away again.</p><p>\u201cI want to.\u201d I reply, running my fingers carefully over the soft carpet.</p><p>I\u2019m sure I got most of the big pieces of glass. I let go of a calm, controlled breath and I have no choice but to turn around. Slowly, I straighten myself and turn around. My gaze falls over Seth\u2019s perfect, topless appearance. His expression is unreadable and he swishes a glass in his hand. The ice clinks against the glass filling the uncomfortable silence. I walk past him and into the oversized kitchen. I pull open the drawer under the sink and tip the shards of porcelain into the bin.</p><p>Seth sits the now empty glass on the breakfast bar in the middle of the kitchen. I look at him and close the drawer. He still has dry blood on his face and I want to tend to him, to fix the wound on his brow. I step forward once, letting him know I want to come to him. He nods his head and I practically run to him. I wrap my arms around his neck, burying my face into his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I say. Oh, God. I think I'm going to cry again.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he takes my arms from his neck, forcing me to look up at his face. \"This isn't your fault. You didn't do anything. This is all me. Only me. Do you understand?\"</p><p>I\u2019m not nodding my head. If I hadn\u2019t freaked out and practically sprinted from the stripper that kissed me, I wouldn\u2019t have given Don a chance to grab me. Seth wraps his fingers around my wrist and I follow him up the stairs to our bedroom, only he doesn\u2019t stop there. He pulls me along behind him all the way to the bathroom.</p><p>He flicks the light on, bringing the dark room to life. Seth\u2019s hands wrap around my waist and he lifts me to sit me on the bathroom counter. I watch his face and he doesn\u2019t talk while his hands rub my ankles and slip my shoes off. He pulls me from the bench and hooks his fingers under the hem of my pants, pushing them to the floor. My heartbeat speeds up, like it always does when he touches me. He turns me around and tugs on my shirt, pulling it up over my head. My bra is the last piece of fabric to fall from my body and when I turn back around to face him, his eyes drink me in, unable to hide the flash of desire in his eyes. Then they narrow in on my abdomen and I notice his body tense and his jaw clench. I glance down. It\u2019s my hip. There\u2019s a dark shadow forming where Don grabbed me and where I fell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as yours.\u201d I mumble weakly.</p><p>He breathes, running a hand over his face. \u201cIs that from his hand?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cA bit, I suppose. Most of it is from when I fell after he pushed me.\u201d</p> <p>His voice raises a few decibels. \u201cHe pushed you?\u201d</p><p>I nod as he rakes his hands through his hair. With a shake of his head grabs me, pulling me right into him. \u201cI\u2019m so fucking sorry, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>He lets me go. I know he doesn\u2019t want to hear that it isn\u2019t his fault. I can see it on his face, he truly believes it is. I step back while he drops his own pants and steps into the shower. He leaves the door open for me to join him and turns the water on. The roar of the shower echoes off of the tiles and the air quickly becomes heavy and hot, filling my lungs with steam. I step in and close the door behind me. Seth\u2019s eyes greedily take in my body, making my breasts feel heavy and swollen. My nipples already ache for his mouth to engulf them and to distract myself I reach for body wash and squirt it into my hands. I turn away from him and work a rich lather over my stomach, rubbing slowly over the bruise on my hip.</p><p>Soon, Seth\u2019s hands are gliding over my skin, too, carefully avoiding my sore hip. He kisses my shoulder and my body begins to hum. Teasingly, his hands skirt around my breast making my nipples harden to maximum point and begin to tingle in painful anticipation. Finally, his hands slide up over my breasts, cupping them with the perfect amount of pressure. I feel like I\u2019m in danger of melting and my breath hitches as his thumbs rub over my peaked nipples. I let my head lean back to relax against his chest.</p> <p>\u201cWill Darryl and your team be okay?\u201d</p><p>His hands knead my breasts. \u201cYeah, they\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>I turn my head. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>He presses his lips to my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m okay now.\u201d</p><p>I turn around, pressing the front of my body against his.</p><p>\u201cI need you\u2014all of you.\u201d I demand, crushing my lips to his.</p> <p>He tastes bitter-sweet, like bourbon and my heart clenches. If he\u2019s had alcohol, he must be in a really bad place. Seth doesn\u2019t hesitate and there\u2019s no teasing in the way his hands rub me all over. He walks me backwards and I gasp as my back presses against the cool tiles. I ignore the way my hip aches as he sandwiches me against the wall with his body. His hand runs down the length of my side and he hitches my leg around his hip. His mouth kisses my neck and his fingers slide firmly between my legs, sending a tidal wave of arousal through me. It\u2019s been so long since we\u2019ve had sex and I want it now\u2014fight or no fight. My body goes into overdrive and my nerves are hyper aware of him. His hot touch is like an electric bolt coursing through my body.</p><p>\u201cSeth.\u201d His name is a breathy sound of anticipation.</p><p>He moans, smoothing a fingertip over my clit. He gives the tiny bundle of nerves a few circles and then dips a finger into my warmth. I gasp loudly, digging my fingertips into his shoulders as he strokes me carefully from the inside. I arch against him, my eyes feeling heavy.</p><p>\u201cSo sexy.\u201d He mutters, catching my lip between his teeth.</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d I gasp, thrusting my hips against him. I\u2019m so wound up, so tightly coiled and I need him to relieve me. Only, he takes his fingers from me. Disappointment fills me and I groan in annoyance.</p><p>\u201cHave I ever told you that you\u2019re impatient?\u201d He chuckles in my ear.</p><p>I smile and nod. \u201cI can\u2019t help myself around you.\u201d</p><p>He reaches his hand down between us, rubbing himself over my entrance and catching me off guard. My hips press closer to him and it\u2019s like I have no control over my body, it does what it wants. He pushes inside me with a sharp intake of air, sending my pulse skittering all over the place. I wrap both my arms around his neck and his hands grab my ass, lifting me onto him and filling me completely. I lock my ankles behind him as I wrap my legs around his waist. The cold sensations of the tiles feel deliciously erotic against the warm sensations inside of me. Seth pulls out until only his head is left inside and then he thrusts all the way in, forcing me to cry out. He thrust shallowly and quickly a few times before pulling almost all of the way again and then thrusts back in with a decadent groan. I squeeze him as tightly as I can as an orgasm coils in my stomach like a cobra. It has been so long since he\u2019s been inside of me and my body is reveling in the sensations.</p> <p>\u201cOh, fuck...\u201d He growls against my flesh. \u201cI\u2019m not going to last long, baby.\u201d</p><p>His voice pushes me closer and closer to the edge. \u201cHarder.\u201d I manage to breathe out. \u201cFaster.\u201d</p><p>He presses me harder against the wall and sets a faster, harder pace. My arms tighten around his neck. I clench my thighs around him, tilting my pelvis. My breasts bounce as he rocks into me. I\u2019m surprised when my orgasm tears out of me unsuspectingly and I can\u2019t keep the cries from tearing out of my mouth along with it. Seth\u2019s biceps clench as he grips my hips and holds me still as he jerks unevenly inside of me, finding his own release. He holds me against the wall for a little while longer, resting his forehead against mine. My hands caress his neck and his shoulders. He closes his eyes, enjoying the attention. I slide off of him just as a knock sounds on the door and Seth shields my body with his. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks burn red. If people are here... then they would\u2019ve heard me.</p><p>\u201cSeth, when you\u2019re ready.\u201d Darryl\u2019s voice rings throughout the bathroom, sounding strained and tired.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be down in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Darryl closes the door and I bury my face in my hands, more embarrassed than I have ever been in my entire life. \u201cI can\u2019t go out there.\u201d</p><p>He pulls my hands away from my face and I drop my gaze to the floor.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy yourself?\u201d</p><p>His hands cup my face, tilting my face towards his. \u201cDid you enjoy yourself?\u201d He asks again, emphasizing the question.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He grins, playfully. \u201cThen that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>I can feel delight radiating from him in waves as my cheeks grow darker.</p><p>We towel off quickly and enter the bedroom to get dressed. Seth throws me a pair of black drawstring pants.</p><p>\u201cI have clothes.\u201d I laugh, clipping a bra into place.</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d He says, pulling his own pair of grey drawstring pants up, concealing his delicious nakedness. \u201cThey\u2019re really comfortable.\u201d</p><p>I throw on a white tank top and slip into Seth\u2019s pants. I have to tie it really tightly so it fits, but he isn\u2019t wrong. The fabric on the inside is beyond soft, almost fluffy.</p><p>\u201cWow, they are comfortable!\u201d</p><p>He smiles and my heart melts. He\u2019s so handsome and it shocks me every time I see his face. How\u2019d I get so lucky? Seth\u2019s pinky finger hooks around mine and he leads me down the stairs. There\u2019s a cleaner, vacuuming the last of the glass at the bottom of the stairs. She gives us a pissed off nod and rolls her vacuum out the door, leaving Seth and I alone with his team.</p><p>\u201cI see you went ahead and redecorated the room.\u201d Darryl states, leaning against the railing at the bottom of the steps.</p><p>\u201cI may have lost control.\u201d Seth replies like it\u2019s no big deal.</p><p>\u201cIn more ways than one, I see.\u201d</p><p>Seth pulls me along behind him over to the long white couches. He draws me into his lap, wrapping both his arms around my waist. If I wasn\u2019t embarrassed enough, I actually feel like vomiting now. Seth plants soft kisses on the back of my shoulder. No doubt he\u2019s trying to ease my nerves. Unfortunately, everyone\u2019s eyes are on us... there is no easing my nerves.</p><p>\u201cFour.\u201d Jackson announces, holding half a bottle of bourbon in the air. Seth drank all that? \u201cThe bourbon makes it a total of four times tonight that you couldn\u2019t control yourself. Four.\u201d Jackson is pissed off. His green eyes are narrowed in on Seth and I don\u2019t like being in between them. I really can\u2019t handle another fight tonight.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Seth?\u201d Darryl demands.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act like fucking saints. I didn\u2019t have to go out tonight, but you dubbed me designated driver, remember?\u201d</p><p>Jackson exhales.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you didn\u2019t pay for that stripper to give Olivia a lap dance Don wouldn\u2019t have gotten all horny and possessive. I don\u2019t regret punching that motherfucker in the face and I\u2019d do it again right now.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Nobody said a word to contest Seth.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d He continues. \u201cHow\u2019d it all go down? Am I out of the tournament or not?\u201d</p><p>I can hear the bitter disappointment in his voice and I drop my gaze to Seth\u2019s hands around my waist.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>My head snaps to Darryl and Seth squeezes me in reaction to his words.</p><p>\u201cDon refuses to claim that it happened even though his team is desperately pushing for him to reconsider, but he won\u2019t budge. He must really hate you.\u201d</p><p>Seth shrugs. \u201cWhat about Polaris? They\u2019ll have video proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may be classy, but it\u2019s still a strip joint run by pimps that\u2019ll keep their mouth shut for money. The tapes are gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d I ask, eagerly. \u201cEverything is over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Darryl\u2019s brown eyes flick to his hands and then back to my face. \u201cI can\u2019t let you come backstage anymore. It\u2019s too risky with Don lurking around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell.\u201d Seth snaps. \u201cI want her in my room.\u201d</p><p>Darryl steps forward, drawing himself to full height. He\u2019s standing his ground and he isn\u2019t going to budge. \u201cWhat happened tonight will not happen again. Do you understand how close you came to losing it all? And over some petty bullshit.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cWhat would your dad say? Hm? That\u2019s why you\u2019re doing this, isn\u2019t it? For your dad?\u201d</p><p>Seth tries to slide me off him, but I hold onto his hands as tightly as I can. I turn my head as much as I can to get a look at his face. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d I tell him. \u201cI can sit in the crowd for the next two matches. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the next two matches, until Don is no longer in the game.\u201d Jackson assures Seth.</p><p>Seth huffs. \u201cFine. Is that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Now let me check that Goddamn eyebrow.\u201d I slide off Seth as Darryl approaches him.</p><p>He gestures for a team member to hand him a little box. Darryl pulls out creams and little pieces of materials and begins working on Seth\u2019s eyebrow. The whole time Darryl is cursing and complaining about its position, I go find Jackson who\u2019s pouring himself a big glass of bourbon in the kitchen. I take a tray of ice cubes from the freezer and hand them to him.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is Darryl so pissed? It\u2019s a small cut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on the brow though.\u201d He takes a large sip of his bourbon, spilling a little on his red shirt. \u201cJosh Donskov will use that against Seth. The brow is a shit place to get cut. Once punch, elbow\u2014shit\u2014even a slap could reopen it. If it bleeds too much and leaks into the eye, they\u2019ll call the fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we stop that from happening?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything except lather it with Vaseline and hope Josh\u2019s fists slide off of it. The rest is up to Seth, he\u2019ll have to guard that eyebrow with his life.\u201d</p><p>Panic rises in the pit of my stomach as I realize the severity of the situation\u2014of the cut. Fuck.</p><p>\u201cWow, you look like you\u2019re going to puke.\u201d He slides his glass over to me and I pick it up, taking a large mouthful. I swallow it, clenching my teeth against the burn. \u201cRelax. He\u2019s a big boy. He knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s comforting... kind of.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I made you uncomfortable with the stripper. I meant it only as harmless fun, I swear.\u201d His green eyes flare apologetically.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I didn\u2019t mean to freak out, but I\u2019ve never been in a strip club before let alone kissed a girl. That\u2019s more Selena\u2019s thing.\u201d</p><p>His bronze eyebrows reach his hairline. Shit. I hope I didn\u2019t just scare him away from her. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I gasp at him, trying to take back what I said and a huge, wide smile creeps across his face. \u201cThat\u2019s good to know. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Jackson looks over my shoulder and I turn around to see Seth\u2019s half naked body leaning against the doorframe. Darryl sticks his head into the kitchen. \u201cC\u2019mon, Jackson. Time for bed, we have a big day tomorrow\u2014you too, Seth. I\u2019d tell you two no sex, but everyone knows you\u2019ve recently disregarded that rule.\u201d</p><p>Darryl narrows his eyes at me before smiling widely. \u201cGoodnight, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>I wave sheepishly at him, flushing to the tenth power. I look at Seth from under my lashes and he\u2019s watching me with a little cocky, unapologetic smile, his eyes glimmering.</p><p>Jackson pats me on the shoulder as he passes me and elbows Seth in the ribs. Seth slaps Jackson on the back of the head and they exchange a manly hug. It\u2019s admiring to watch.</p><p>When everyone is gone, Seth and I head upstairs.</p><p>The cool sheets engulf us, sending goosebumps over my skin. Seth\u2019s arms reach out for me, pulling me in and I happily shuffle closer to him. He places light kiss on my jaw and I feel him undo the strings that are holding up my pants. He pushes down on one side of them and I lift my hips, helping him to slide them down. I kick them off and throw them to the floor. My legs brush against Seth\u2019s and my pulse kicks up when I realize he\u2019s naked. He pulls me on top of him without breaking a sweat and his hands roam over my stomach and hips. I\u2019m too aroused to feel the ache of the bruise. He nudges my shirt higher and I pull it over my head. \u201cYou need sleep.\u201d I whisper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>In the dark, I can just make out his silhouette underneath me, reigniting the desire inside me. Then again, is it ever really gone when he\u2019s around? His fingertips curl around the edge of my bra, and there\u2019s no hint of hesitation as he tugs it swiftly downward, forcing my breasts to spill over the now-useless cups. My skin doesn\u2019t get a chance to register the feeling of being free before they\u2019re suddenly enveloped in by his hot, wet mouth.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d I gasp as my body begins to tremble.</p> <p>His hands grasp my shoulder blades and he yanks me roughly toward him, forcing my tits even closer to his face. My back arches sharply and I moan toward the ceiling as my head falls limply. I can feel his arousal pressing against my ass cheek and I shiver at the thought of it entering me again.</p><p>He bucks his hips, rolling me off of him and him onto me. His mouth nips at my bottom lip, before slipping his tongue in. His hands glide up my sides, grabbing my wrists and pinning them above my head. My breathing gets instantly shallow as his wet tongue traces my jaw and my neck. It runs across my collar bone and I shiver at the line of tingles it leaves in its wake. Right now, I\u2019m in heaven and loving every second of it. Seth makes me feel wanted, beautiful and a million other things. Lust is the obvious call, but it\u2019s so much more than that. It\u2019s love. I know it is. I\u2019ve loved him for a while, I just had no idea how to describe it or if it even was love, but now I know it is. I\u2019m certain. I\u2019m the kind of certain that makes people swear on their children\u2019s lives or bet entire college funds on a hand in poker. I\u2019ve never felt anything so strong and it\u2019s love\u2014actual love. Heart wrenching, stomach churning, toe curling love.</p><p>I\u2019ve been completely consumed by him and I didn\u2019t even know it.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Long frissons of nervous energy tear through me as Seth bounces on his toes in front of me. I\u2019m beyond anxious\u2014unable to experience one specific emotion. It\u2019s all mashed together\u2014excitement. Nervousness. Frustration. Anticipation. His brown eyes fall onto me and I can see the anxiousness in his face. He doesn\u2019t like that I wasn\u2019t in his room before the fight and neither do I. I want to know what he\u2019s thinking. I want to help ease him. The thick layer of Vaseline glistens on his eyebrow and I pray to God that it helps. Seth and I are so caught up in our own little world we don\u2019t even realize his opponent, Joshua Donskov, tearing toward the ring with an angry stomp. He\u2019s a big boy\u2014a very big boy and not just tall, but wide, too. His short, blond curls bounce on the top of his head and I trap my hands between my knees to prevent myself from chewing my nails. Beside me, there\u2019s an empty seat. It\u2019s meant to be Dad\u2019s. What I wouldn\u2019t give to have him and Selena here with me. As I finish the thought, a large frame drops into the seat next to me, but I pay no attention to it. At least, not until Seth\u2019s eyes narrow in on whomever it is. I slowly turn my head and I\u2019m actually not that surprised to see Don\u2019s annoying mug smiling back at Seth. Don appears worse off than Seth does. Don has a split lip and a cut in the middle of his nose that\u2019s held together with butterfly stitches. I look at Darryl and Jackson. They\u2019re rigid and they glance anxiously between the two fighters. Darryl leans over and calls through the wire to Seth.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see you leave Seth\u2019s room. I was worried I\u2019d driven a wedge between you two last night.\u201d</p><p>I swallow my nerves. \u201cYeah, you look real beaten up about it.\u201d</p><p>His thick, jean clad leg leans against my bare skin and I feel like I\u2019ve dipped my feet into a box of baby spiders and now they\u2019re running up my leg. I shiver and lean away from him.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI\u2019m not that bad. I did let your little boyfriend continue in the tournament. You should be on your knees, thanking me.\u201d</p><p>I cringe, but don\u2019t respond to him. I\u2019m not going to fuel the fire between Seth and Don. Seth flexes his fingers, balling them into fists and relaxing them again. I nod my head at him, assuring him not to worry about me. He rolls his shoulders back and focuses on Josh. Josh keeps his eyes fixated on Seth, not taking his eyes of him for a second. The announcer is rattling off a bunch of sponsors but I can\u2019t hear him. I\u2019m too busy focusing on Seth and ignoring Don\u2019s presence.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re here to distract him, it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d I mutter, pulling my dress down to cover my knees. Don rests an arm on the back of my chair, his index finger brushing along my shoulder and I lean forward to get away from him.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d The referee calls.</p><p>Once the match begins, it\u2019s easier to ignore Don and I trap my hands between my knees again, keeping my eyes peeled. I can\u2019t look away, not this time. Seth\u2019s hands are up, covering his face\u2014especially his eyebrow. Josh comes in hard and fast and Seth manages to block most of the punches. The body shots, however, he couldn\u2019t avoid unless he wanted to expose the cut on his eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame about his eyebrow. That\u2019s gotta\u2019 be a little inconvenient, especially when going up against a brawler. With them there\u2019s no real technique, you see. All they do is punch.\u201d</p><p>Seth and Josh bounce around the ring, punching and punching. I flinch in my seat every time Josh lands a hit. He knows Seth has a busted brow and he\u2019s really trying to get him to drop his guard. Seth kicks Josh\u2019s legs out from underneath him and dives onto him. He begins to pound his face into the floor of the ring. Josh\u2019s hands are up and he\u2019s trying to protect his face. In my pocket my phone buzzes and I really don\u2019t want to answer it, not now, but I can\u2019t ignore it. Last time it was serious. I pull it from my pocket and look at the screen\u2014a private number. I bring it to my ear, blocking the other with my index finger. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, is Olivia James there please.\u201d</p><p>My chest tightens. \u201cSpeaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss James... my name is Doctor Monica Falen.\u201d My heart stops. \u201cYou\u2019re father was brought in this evening after suffering a second heart attack... I\u2019m sorry, but there was nothing we could do.\u201d</p><p>It doesn\u2019t register with me. I don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s trying to say. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I ask, hoping I misheard her. Don leans closer to say something to me, but I press my palm to his face to shut him up.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re father has passed on.\u201d</p><p>I stare straight ahead not seeing anything. The crowd is going crazy, but they seem muffled to me.</p><p>\u201cMiss James?\u201d</p><p>I drop my hand into my lap. I think I\u2019m going to be sick. My phone is clenched tightly in my hand as I leap out of my seat and squeeze through the crowd. I need to get out of here. I have no idea where I\u2019m going, but I follow an aisle blindly until I\u2019m stopped by a group of security guards. I show them my pass and they let me through. It\u2019s sinking in now and my heart squeezes in my chest. I quickly dart down the corridor wildly, unsure of where to go. I turn left, then right, then another left. I can hear distant rumble of a bloodthirsty crowd. Their footsteps hammer against the roof above me. I see Seth\u2019s name on a door and I dive through it, closing it behind me with a thud. I don\u2019t want to be in here, but I have nowhere else to go. I stumble to the far wall and push my body against its cold concrete. I slide to the ground, my arms closing tightly against my chest as the first waves of anguish hit me. Choked sobs wrack my chest as tears pour over the brim of my eyes. I don\u2019t even try to hold back my tears while my chest heaves. I cover my mouth with both of my hands and bring my knees up to my chest. I\u2019m in Boston. I need to be in Portland. I\u2019m not even startled as the door flies open, slamming against the concrete. I don\u2019t look as Seth shouts for his team to leave us alone. I feel his damp, warm hands touch my shoulders and I lift my face from my hand to look at his face. His eyebrow is bleeding and there\u2019s a fresh cut on his bottom lip. His lips are moving, but I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s saying.</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d He says again and I can hear his strained, worried voice. \u201cAre you okay? What\u2019s wrong? Did he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cIt\u2019s dad... he\u2019s\u2014\u201d I can\u2019t finish the sentence and bury my head back into the palms of my hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry, O.\u201d He whispers. His soft lips brush the top of my head. I take in a gasp of air as I try to control my sobs. His hands curl around my own, pulling them away from my face. I angle my head. I don\u2019t want him to look at me. I can only imagine how puffy my eyes are or how smudged my make-up must be. The tips of his finger curl underneath my chin, forcing me to look at him. He looks down at me with a sorrowful expression that screams how helpless he feels and he tugs me into him, cradling me in his arms as I cry against his already wet chest. The tip of his thumb strokes my cheek, wiping away my tears.</p><p>\u201cDid you win?\u201d I ask him, sniffling.</p><p>All he does is nod.</p><p>\u201cI-I need to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll take you.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cCan you call Selena and ask her to come and get me?\u201d Seth opens his mouth to protest me, but I cut in. \u201cI want to be with my mom...\u201d</p><p>His brows furrow, but he doesn\u2019t fight me. He knows how Mom feels about him and now is not the time to rub \u2018us\u2019 in her face. Not to mention Seth needs to be in Boston training with his team and preparing for Las Vegas. He doesn\u2019t need this distraction. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll call Selena, but let me take you to the hotel first.\u201d</p><p>He pulls me in tighter as he rises to his feet. I feel heavy, but Seth carries me without a strain. I keep my face buried into his neck to avoid people\u2019s eyes when we\u2019re outside of the room. I can hear people talk and whisper\u2014they\u2019re probably staring too. I cling harder to Seth and his thumb strokes my lower back. I hear Darryl and Jackson ask Seth what\u2019s wrong with me and he only shakes his head. Darryl and Jackson help clear everybody out of our way and it feels like an eternity later that we reach the car. Seth pushes me into the backseat and climbs in after me, pulling me back onto his lap. Tears silently fall from me and I keep my eyes shut as his lips press firmly against my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive you two back to the hotel. Darryl is going to stay and take care of the interviews.\u201d Jackson says as he climbs into the front seat.</p><p>I rock gently as the car drives us out of the center and through the streets of Boston. Seth drops the window a little, letting cool air hit my face. It lifts strands of hair that cling to my cheeks and dries my face.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long we drive for, but it feels like only seconds later I\u2019m being pulled out of the car by Seth. I wonder what the other residents are thinking, seeing Seth carry me into the hotel like this again. I\u2019m almost certain the hotel will ban us soon. Jackson doesn\u2019t follow us up into our room, thank God, and I open my eyes when Seth lies me down on our bed and I hear the shower start up. A few seconds later, Seth leans over me. \u201cWill you let me take care of you before you go?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t wait for an answer. He scoops me up again, bringing me into the bathroom. I hate that he has to see me like this and has to care for me. He pulls the hem of my dress, tugging the fabric up over my head. He folds it and sets it nicely on the sink behind me. I watch him bleary eyed as his fingers curl around the band of my underwear and he slides them down the full length of my legs. I kick them off as they pool around my feet. Seth\u2019s hands caress my ankles and then up the back of my calves, over my knees and up the sides of my thighs. I let out a sob, unable to suppress it and he flinches. I\u2019m upsetting him by being so distraught, but he understands. He\u2019s been through this before. I wonder if he had anyone to caress him when his dad died? His arms surround me and I rest my head against his chest as he unclips my bra and it falls to the floor between us. He holds me for a little while longer, letting me cry on his shoulder. Then, he ushers me toward the shower and I stand directly underneath it, letting the water cascade over my head and down the rest of my body. Seth joins me, neglecting to take off his own pants. He reaches for the body wash and lathers up his hands. I step out of the flow of water, and press the palms of my hand against the cold tiles, giving him better access to my back. He drapes my hair over one of my shoulders and slowly massages soap into my skin. I drop my head and his fingers slide up the back of my neck to my hair line. I close my eyes, trying to block out the pain, but it\u2019s not working. The more I try the deeper it cuts.</p><p>His soapy hands run under my armpits and down my sides. My body shakes a little as I try to suppress the sobs cramping in my throat. Seth steps closer, pressing his front against my back. He stops washing to hold me and I\u2019m glad he\u2019s here with me. It doesn\u2019t do much to ease the pain, but it\u2019s helping me deal with it. It makes me feel like I\u2019m not alone. He twists me around so I face him and his hand slides into the nape of my neck, pulling my head forward so our noses are touching. I open my eyes and his lips twitch sympathetically at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll get better.\u201d He says, \u201cI promise you.\u201d</p><p>He kisses me softly\u2014comfortingly. Right now, I can\u2019t imagine it getting any better. My dad is gone. My brother and I are without a father. My mother is without a husband and what\u2019s going to happen to the gym? A new onslaught of tears stream from my eyes and Seth presses me firmly against him. My mom is all alone right now. Who\u2019s there to comfort her?</p><p>\u201cCan you call Selena, please?\u201d I sob, wiping my eyes because they sting from the running mascara. \u201cI need to go home.\u201d</p><p>He nods his head and I step back under the stream of water, letting it beat down on my back. Seth leaves to make the call and I feel worse without his presence. I have no reason to stop myself from completely breaking down, but thankfully I hit a \u2018numb\u2019 spot and the tears stopped flowing completely, leaving me feeling... empty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seth opens the door to the shower. A towel his wrapped loosely around his hips. \u201cSelena is on her way.\u201d</p><p>I shut the tap off and step out. He grabs a purple towel and wraps it around my shoulders. His arms rub up and down, drying me. \u201cSeth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease... just let me take care of you.\u201d The thin, golden honey rivers in his irises flash desperately and so I lift my arms. He dries my torso quickly and softly before starting on my lower half. I close my eyes and his lips brush over the skin of my hips after he dries it with a towel, making me shiver. He drops the towel and leads me into the bedroom. He flicks the light on and then dims it to its lowest setting. He slips into a pair of black track pants and I notice a set of clothes are laid out on the bed\u2014the pair of drawstring pants I wore last night included.</p> <p>\u201cI want you to be comfortable tonight.\u201d</p><p>He slides a t-shirt bra over my arms and clips it behind my back. He reaches for my underwear and kneels before me, holding them out around my feet. I step into them and he pulls them all the way up, kissing my navel as his face hovers in front of it. I run my fingers through his wet hair to let him know he\u2019s doing well. I don\u2019t want to shut him off completely. I slide into the pants and he ties them tightly, preventing them from falling down. Finally, he pulls a pink t-shirt over my head and smiles at me. I do feel comfortable. I hear a low murmuring of voices down stairs and my comfort slips out the window. I hate crying in front of people and there\u2019s no way I can pretend not to be completely devastated.</p><p>\u201cDarryl and Jackson are here.\u201d He points to his lip. \u201cThey want to check out my cuts. You don\u2019t have to come down. Stay here and I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>I fall onto the bed, hugging a pillow between my legs and my arms. I feel sick and I want my mom. I don\u2019t care how childish it sounds. I want her to hold me, to be brave for me because God knows I\u2019m a fucking mess and it\u2019s only going to get worse. I should have stayed in Portland. Dad wanted me to go to Boston and I didn\u2019t think twice about it. I called him a few times this week and every time he told me he felt fine and he was happy. I don\u2019t know much about heart attacks. Do they all \u2018just happen\u2019 or are there a lot of symptoms you can go off before it hits? There\u2019s so much I should have researched about it... I should have stayed.</p><p>I lie on the bed for a while, thinking about Mom and Chase. Does he even know? Will they give him time to come back for his father\u2019s funeral? I hope so.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d I hear a female voice ask. Not a second later, heels click rapidly up the stairs. Have I been laying here for two hours already? I shoot up in the bed as Selena tears through the door, her eyes glistening with tears. \u201cO?\u201d She whispers.</p><p>Seeing her brings memories of home and I break down all over again. She rushes over to me, drawing me into her arms. I cry into her chest, getting tears all over her satin t-shirt.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d She cries with me. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers brush through my hair as her body shakes with her own tears.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone.\u201d I sob. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you home.\u201d She holds me for a little while longer, until I manage to stem the flow of tears and pull away.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll gather a few things and meet you downstairs.\u201d</p><p>She leaves the room and I wobble to my feet. I feel so weak, like I\u2019ve cried all of the energy from my body. I enter the bathroom and pick up all of my clothes. I stuff them into my suitcase and zip it up as Seth\u2019s frame appears in the door. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>He steps forward and I see his eyebrow is appropriately bandaged and his lip gleams with some kind of clear cream. \u201cCan I walk you out?\u201d</p><p>His question makes me smile, even if it is just a twitch of my lip. \u201cOf course you can.\u201d</p><p>He grabs the handle of my suitcase and pulls it from my hand. I follow closely behind him and squint as we step out of the room and into the brightness of the lounge. I walk down the stairs one by one. There is an awkwardness to the atmosphere and I know Darryl and Jackson are trying hard not to look at me. Are they afraid I\u2019ll freak out and break down?</p><p>\u201cAll set?\u201d Selena asks, as she slips out of Jackson\u2019s embrace. When I step from the stairs and onto the carpet she wraps and arm around my waist.</p><p>Darryl wrings a cap in his hand and steps toward me. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry to hear about your dad...\u201d</p> <p>My throat constricts and I swallow hard. I\u2019m not going to cry, not while someone is giving their condolences. I don\u2019t want to make it anymore uncomfortable for them. \u201cHe was a really great guy and I\u2019m honored I got to meet Rick. The team won\u2019t be the same without him.\u201d</p><p>It hurt to smile, but I managed to force one. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Jackson didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, he grabs my shoulders and pulls me into a hug. When he steps away from me, he gives me a tight smile and turns to Selena. She releases my waist and wraps her arms around him. Seth and I walk to the front door and wait in the hallway while Selena and Jackson kiss, hug, talk and whatever else they\u2019re doing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you, you know.\u201d Seth says, caressing my arm with his index finger.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll call me?\u201d I ask, missing his voice already.</p><p>\u201cEvery day.\u201d He glances awkwardly over to the others.</p><p>Selena and Jackson are locked in some kind of epic battle with their tongues and Darryl has his back to them, looking out the window into the city.</p><p>When Jackson releases her, Selena straightens her purple satin blouse, with the ruffles on the front, and walks toward us. She takes my suitcase from Seth and walks a head of us, giving us as much privacy as she can. His thick fingers entwine with mine and it feels amazing. I don't want to go to the lobby. I don't want to leave him behind.</p><p>The lobby is as busy as ever\u2014how convenient. People\u2014especially women\u2014stare at Seth's naked upper half. Some flush, others look away in fear at the sight of his busted lip and eyebrow. He looks a little rough with his cuts and his tattoos, not to mention his hard muscles, but he\u2019s definitely a softy. The same hands that clench and slam into flesh are the same hands that carried me home, undressed me and massaged soap into my skin. I stop Seth as Selena exits the hotel. I want to talk to him alone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry I ruined your big night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sorry my night was ruined?\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cAlways selfless.\u201d</p><p>I step closer and reach up, pressing a kiss to his lips. He runs his cool fingers underneath my shirt and along my stomach. I\u2019m going to miss his touch so much and his smile. He cups my face, running his thumbs over my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ll be home as soon as this thing is over.\u201d</p><p>I stare into his brown eyes and they glimmer with so much emotion that I can\u2019t pinpoint what exactly. I press my lips to his one more time and attempt to turn away, but he snags my arm and pulls me back into him, making me gasp.</p><p>He exhales heavily and moistens his lips. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say anything, not yet, but in light of what\u2019s happened, I feel like it\u2019s something you should hear right now...\u201d he pauses, staring directly into my eyes and smiles a little. \u201cFuck. I\u2019m such a mess. I\u2019ve never had to do this before.\u201d</p><p>Do what? I lean back a little, eyeing him cautiously. What does he want to say? I\u2019ve read enough romance novels to rightfully assume he\u2019s setting up for an \u2018I love you\u2019 but that\u2019s surely not what he\u2019s going to sa\u2014.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops slightly, my stomach following suit. That\u2019s exactly what he was setting up for. Surely I misheard him... He watches my face, waiting for a reaction\u2014or anything at all. He seems tense, like he\u2019s expecting me to run.</p><p>\u201cYou love me?\u201d I ask slowly, sounding completely dumbstruck.</p><p>\u201cAbso-fucking-lutely.\u201d</p><p>My emotions are already all over the place and I don\u2019t know how to register what he just confessed to me. I try to say something, but only a gust of useless air comes out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Oh God. I can feel a buildup of tears threatening.</p><p>The harder I try not to cry, the more I blink and the more I blink, the more my eyes water. Seth\u2019s eyes widen a fraction before crushing me to his chest.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I expected you to slap me, not cry.\u201d</p><p>I choke out a laugh. \u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry. You caught me off guard...I-I love you, too, so much.\u201d</p><p>He pulls away, catching my face in his hands again. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it back now. I know your emotional and\u2014\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI knew I loved you before tonight\u2014long before tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen were you going to tell me? Never?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cYou\u2019re a very intimidating guy.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and I love the sound. It\u2019s music to my ears and medicine to my heart. For the last time he yanks me into him, pulling my feet off the floor and squeezing firmly. A little too firmly and my ribs ache.</p><p>\u201cWell, now that the hard part is over we can say it all we like.\u201d He breathes into the nape of my neck, sending shivers down my spine. \u201cI love you, God, I love you so much!\u201d</p><p>A few more tears roll down my cheeks. I need to go now. The time has come to separate myself from Seth, but I can\u2019t even though it\u2019s only temporary. I hold on to him with everything that I have. I want to beg him to come with me and I know he would, no questions asked. He\u2019s already proven that he\u2019d give up everything he\u2019s worked so hard to achieve, for me. His breath warms my neck and he presses soft kisses to it as he lowers my feet back to the ground.</p><p>\u201cI should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything, even a hug, call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d travel to Portland and back just to give me a hug?\u201d</p><p>He scoffs at me like it\u2019s obvious. \u201cI\u2019d fly to the moon and back to comfort you when you need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d I chuckle, walking away from him.</p><p>He rests his hands on top of his head, and tufts of dark armpit hair jut outwards. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>I look over my shoulder one last time as I push through the revolving doors. I drink in his features\u2014the delicious oblique\u2019s and narrow hips. The clear cut of his abs, the hard chest and intricate tattoos I still had no clue about, and lastly, his face\u2014his gorgeous face. His full lips are half smiling, half pouting and his eyes are glued to me, watching me walk away.</p><p>I jump straight into Selena\u2019s shiny, silver sports car and she takes us away from the hotel. She doesn\u2019t say much for the first half of the drive. I know she\u2019s hurting too and I don\u2019t push her. Selena adored my father and he adored her\u2014even my mother adored Selena even though Selena swears Mom isn\u2019t a big fan of hers.</p><p>\u201cSo you want me to take you to your parent\u2019s house?\u201d Selena asks me. Her voice quivers and she swallows hard.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s where Mom will be.\u201d I\u2019m dying to get home, but I don\u2019t know how she\u2019ll be when I get there. The death of Seth\u2019s dad sent his Mom off the rails... would that happen to my mom? How would I handle that? The thought makes me cringe. I never really gave Seth props for looking after his mother for so long. It must be painful...seeing someone you love so much not care anymore. I close my eyes. Dear God, please let my mom be okay. Please give her the strength to get through this. I\u2019m not one to pray, I don\u2019t think I ever have been, but I\u2019m desperate. I can\u2019t handle my mom going off the tracks.</p><p>Not tonight.</p><p>I take a few deep breaths when we pull up outside my parent\u2019s home. Looking at it hurts. I glance at Selena and she\u2019s staring at it too. \u201cShould I go in and see Sandra?\u201d</p><p>I nod despite the feelings telling me to give Mom space. \u201cYeah, come in and if she\u2019s too upset you can go.\u201d</p><p>I look at the house again. I can see the glow of the living room light through the cracks in the curtain. She\u2019s definitely home. When we climb out of the car, I catch my bottom lip between my teeth. Already Portland feels like it has changed. Selena and I walk noisily across the pebbles\u2014even a noise as simple as that screams home. I blow air out of my cheeks. I need to pull myself together. On the other side of that wooden door Mom might need me and I need to be strong for her. I knock on the door, giving her a moment to gather her composure\u2014if she needs to. Surprisingly, the door opens quickly and I\u2019m looking at Mom\u2019s smiling face. She wipes her hands on her rose patterned apron.</p><p>\u201cOh honey, you\u2019re home early. Hi, Selena. Please, come in.\u201d She steps to the side, but Selena and I don\u2019t move. I watch her closely. She hardly seems affected by the death of her husband.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>She tucks a stray curl behind her ear. \u201cDon\u2019t stand out there, come inside. I\u2019ve made pie, are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>What the hell is going on? I realize my hands are clenched into balls at my sides. I don\u2019t know whether to be shocked, angry or worried.</p><p>\u201cI should go.\u201d Selena mutters, pinching my arm. \u201cSorry for your loss, Mrs. James.\u201d</p><p>Mom\u2019s smile almost falters, but she manages to nod and thank her. Mom pulls me into the house, closing the door behind me. Smells, different delicious smells engulf me and I inhale. Mom disappears into the kitchen and I stand staring after her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll set the table.\u201d She calls out. \u201cWe can have dinner together.\u201d</p><p>I force my legs toward the kitchen, my gaze falling over the photo frames filled with loving family memories. There\u2019s one photo that catches my attention. It\u2019s my dad outside his gym holding the \u2018SOLD\u2019 sign. His face is so vibrant, so alive. I unclench my hands and shakily reach out for it. Before I can touch it, I pull my hand back as my chest tightens unbearably and I bite my tongue against a sob. I\u2019ll never see his face again. I\u2019ll never hug him or kiss him... he\u2019s actually gone. I yank my shirt up to wipe my eyes. I need to be strong for Mom, something is definitely wrong here. I step into the kitchen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMom...\u201d I\u2019m looking at the kitchen benches filled with golden pastries and pies of all kinds. Mom pulls a roast chicken from the oven, surrounded by crispy roast vegetables. My hand flies up to cover my mouth. She\u2019s out of control. She\u2019s been cooking none stop\u2014all of my dad\u2019s favorite foods.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d She beams at me, but then I see it. Her face is strained, she\u2019s trying really hard not break and I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s doing it for me, herself or Dad. It\u2019s the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever seen and I have no idea what to do.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I say again. I hate that it\u2019s the only thing I manage to squeeze out of my mouth.</p> <p>She looks at me, her bottom lip quivering. She shakes her head and carries the hot tray toward the empty dining table. She manages to burn her finger before she gets there, dropping the roast chicken and vegetables onto the floor. Mom\u2019s hands shoot up to cover her mouth and I reach out for her, but she flinches away, tearing out another piece of my heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d She breathes swallowing her sadness.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me.\u201d I tell her. \u201cPlease, say something.\u201d</p><p>She leans against the bench, pushing two pies onto the floor. They smash on the tiles, sending purple and red colors everywhere, filling the room with a delicious fruit smell. She\u2019s trembling uncontrollably, but she refuses to acknowledge it. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to have apple pie for dinner. I hope that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>She pulls a knife from the top drawer and cuts at the pie.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want pie.\u201d My voice is stern and I don\u2019t want to upset her, but she\u2019s freaking me out.</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>She slams the knife into the sink and I jump slightly. \u201cWhat do you want me to say, Olivia? I\u2019m trying to move on!\u201d</p><p>The hole in my chest deepens. \u201cThis is your idea of moving on? Cooking all of Dad\u2019s favorite foods?\u201d She keeps her eyes on the sink. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to move on, not yet. He died a few hours ago... a few hours, Mom. You need to grieve, you need to feel...\u201d</p><p>She snaps. \u201cYou want me to feel? You want me to break?\u201d Mom grabs the apple pie and throws it to the ground. She stomps on it while grabbing a tray of pumpkin pastries. She throws the ceramic serving dish against the cupboard and it smashes. I flinch, unable to hold back my tears. I watch her completely destroy everything in the kitchen, including herself and I can\u2019t do anything.</p> <p>Food and glass splatter and rebound off my skin while she screams, spitting and crying everywhere. I\u2019ve never seen anything so heartbreaking in my life. She slides down the cupboard, crying so hard her face turns red. Her mouth is open, her eyes closed tightly and lines of spit are falling out. She drags her legs up to her chest and rests her head against them. I step across glass and food just to get to her. I need to hold her, to let her know I\u2019m here for her. I pull her into me and she cries on my shoulder. I\u2019ve never felt so helpless than I do in this moment. I can\u2019t help my mom, I can\u2019t even help myself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I cry, stroking her hair. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>Technically, I lied. I have no idea if we\u2019ll be okay. I have no idea what tomorrow will be like or if this is ever going to get any easier, but I did now that even though this family has lost an important member, we are still a family and that won\u2019t change. The process is going to be long and painful, but I know we\u2019ll get through it. That\u2019s what families do, isn\u2019t it? They help each other through difficult times?</p><p>\u201cI should go to bed.\u201d Mom sobs. \u201cI want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>She pulls away from me and climbs unsteadily to her feet.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a shower?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer me and I follow her to her bedroom, but I don\u2019t get a foot in the door as she closes it in my face. I rest my forehead against the cool wood. This is going to be a lot harder than I thought it\u2019d be...maybe I shouldn\u2019t have come home.</p><p>I turn down the hallway and enter my old room. I flick the light on. It\u2019s exactly as I remember it\u2014the white double bed with pink sheets, the white vanity table and big brown bookshelf. It isn\u2019t much, but it\u2019s familiar. I flick the light off, using the light that filters in from the street to guide me. I pull my phone from my pocket, slide out of my pants and pull my shirt off. The cool, clean sheets welcome me as I slide between them. This may be my room, but it smells strongly of this house, which smells like Mom and Dad\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014I can\u2019t explain the scent. It\u2019s a smell that\u2019s unique to the house. It smells like home. Through blurry eyes I unlock my phone and see that I have a text from Seth.</p> <p>FROM: SETH. TIME: 12:36 A.M</p><p>I miss you...</p><p>I call him. I know he needs sleep and I know I spoke to him a few hours ago, but I need to hear his voice. My heart sends a rapid pulse around my body when I hear his husky voice answer. \u201cO?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I twist lock of my hair around my index finger.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s the question I was kind of hoping to avoid. Then again, if that were true I wouldn\u2019t have called him. I can\u2019t tell him. I can\u2019t talk about it yet. Seeing Mom lose control and break down killed me. When I picture it in my mind, my heart breaks all over again. I inhale shakily, unaware that I\u2019ve started crying. Seth doesn\u2019t say anything else, just listens.</p><p>\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d I ask, my voice shaking. \u201cHow did you handle seeing your Mom so broken?\u201d</p><p>I hear him expel a breath. \u201cI didn\u2019t. I took off, leaving her to deal with all on her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI deal with it now, but in the beginning I couldn\u2019t. It was too hard for me. I guess that\u2019s why I feel responsible for her...\u201d</p><p>I let his words sink in. Seth blames himself for his mother\u2019s alcohol addiction because he wasn\u2019t there to support her when she needed it. Maybe it is a good idea I came home after all. Would she have kept cooking if I hadn\u2019t? The thought terrifies me.</p><p>\u201cHow was your mom when you got home?\u201d He asked me.</p><p>I cringe, picturing her eerily, happy smile. \u201cI can\u2019t even... You wouldn\u2019t believe me if I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>I wrack my brain trying to think of a way to describe what happened. It was madness. Chaotic. Heart breaking. \u201cShe was happy...and I was so mad, but when I came inside\u2014into the kitchen\u2014it was filled with all of Dad\u2019s favorite foods and...then she completely lost control\u201d I swallow a sob. \u201cI-I can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople have different way of coping. If she\u2019s expressing emotion then that\u2019s a good sign.\u201d</p><p>I nod even though he can\u2019t see me.</p><p>\u201cI miss you already. It\u2019s insane.\u201d He says with a little chuckle. His voice is low like he\u2019s embarrassed and my heart swells.</p><p>\u201cI miss you, too. I shouldn\u2019t be keeping you up...\u201d</p><p>I can hear the smile on his lips. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve kept me up at night alone in my bed.\u201d</p><p>His words make my stomach do flips. \u201cAnd here I was thinking I\u2019m the only weirdo that lies awake at night thinking of you.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cDefinitely not.\u201d</p><p>My eyelids become heavy as I snuggle down lower in my bed. \u201cWhen will I see you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight. Tomorrow. I told you, if you need me I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean after you\u2019ve done everything you need to. If it all goes to plan for you, when will I see you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn ten days. I\u2019m in Boston for two more days and then I go to Vegas to fight Don.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d</p><p>He laughs, loudly and I have to pull the phone away from my ear. \u201cNo way. I\u2019m going to break him.\u201d</p><p>I half chuckle, half yawn. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to watch?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know... am I? There\u2019s nothing forcing me to watch this time, but I know it\u2019d mean a lot to Seth\u2014and Dad\u2014if I do.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll watch. I\u2019m not going to enjoy it, but I\u2019ll watch.\u201d</p><p>I hear him smile again. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to play that game anymore, I know you like watching me fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatching you storm around a ring half naked and watching you beat someone with your fists are two completely different things. I like the former not the latter.\u201d</p><p>His sleepy laugh makes me smile.</p><p>\u201cI should go... I don\u2019t know what to expect tomorrow, but it probably has something to do with funeral plans. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too and remember if you need me, for anything at all, call me. I\u2019m only two hours away.\u201d</p><p>I assure him I\u2019ll call if I need him and we say our goodbyes. As soon as I hang up and get comfortable, I fall asleep, dreading tomorrow.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>I slip into the long, black dress Mom bought me for the funeral. It clings tightly to my curves and I feel strange wearing something like this to my own dad\u2019s wedding. It isn\u2019t anything flashy or over the top. It doesn\u2019t expose my cleavage or show too much back, but it\u2019s too clingy, showing the shape of my body and the curve of my backside. Mom wanted Dad to have an elegant, black tie, night time funeral in a beautiful ceremony in the cemetery overlooking the port. Apparently, Mom and Dad used to have picnics up under the small oak tree\u2014which is a big oak tree now. How they could stomach eating in a cemetery is beyond me. I straighten my hair and wear down, so I\u2019m able to use it as a curtain if I need to.</p><p>I clip in two pearl earrings and hear a knock at the door. I step out of my room, but Mom rushes down the hallway before me. Who are we expecting on a day like today?</p><p>I hear his voice\u2014deep and rough. My body isn\u2019t stupid. It stands to attention recognizing the voice immediately. I march down the hallway and see his beautiful frame standing before me in a casual, all black suit. Darryl and Jackson\u2019s faces smile at me from behind Seth. Seth\u2019s eyes rake me, obviously liking my dress and if Seth likes it, then this is definitely not something I should wear to a funeral.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I say, almost out of breath.</p><p>\u201cAsk your Mom.\u201d</p><p>She smiles sweetly at me. \u201cI invited them. I know how important they were to your father. Everyone he loved should be here today.\u201d</p><p>My eyes water and I rush to her, squeezing her against me. The fact that she did something so selfless on a day like today means more to me than anything, and today is going to go so much smoother because of it. I turn to Seth, wiping my eyes careful not to smudge my make-up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cSo I\u2019ll go tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I hold my arms out and he comes to me. I wrap my arms around his waist. I haven\u2019t heard his voice since the night we spoke on the phone. Every time he calls, I miss it and every time I call back, he doesn\u2019t answer. It\u2019s exhausting, but he\u2019s here now and my day just got infinitely better.</p><p>Jackson and Darryl hand Mom and me a bouquet of flowers. The blues, reds, yellows, pinks and oranges all mesh together so beautifully in their green wrapper. Mom drops them into vases and positions them around the house.</p><p>Jackson and Darryl sit on the couch, having a conversation in low tones while I sit on the arm of Dad\u2019s armchair, leaning into Seth. His thumb glides over my thigh in tiny circles and I close my eyes absorbing all of his touch. Another knock on the door forces my eyes open.</p><p>\u201cHow many more people did you call?\u201d I ask Mom as she rushes to the door. When it opens, I can\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cChase!\u201d I squeal, leaping off of the armchair. Mom squeezes him and I wait in line impatiently. It has been too long since I\u2019ve seen my brother, way too long. He looks exactly as I remember, shaven dark hair, big bright green eyes and still so much taller than me.</p><p>He pulls me into him and I almost cry. Seeing him brings back the shock of our father\u2019s death. He\u2019s so happy to see us, but he carries the same sadness in his eyes as Mom and I.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d He groans, squeezing me until I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve run out of breath. Darryl, Seth and Jackson rise to their feet as my brother steps in to greet them. Chase meets people all the time, so chatting and being friendly comes easy to him. Darryl and Jackson go back to sitting and talking on the couch, but my brother hangs around to chat to Seth.</p><p>I step closer to them, trying to eavesdrop in on the conversation. When I get within ear reach my brother excuses himself to go get dressed in his room. I open my mouth to ask Seth what he thought of my brother, but Mom\u2019s entrance into the room with a large serving tray of snacks grabbed my attention.</p><p>\u201cMom, we\u2019re leaving in fifteen minutes. That\u2019s a little excessive.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and it\u2019s a genuine laugh that warms my ears. \u201cThe boys will take care of it, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Jackson and Darryl sit forward, licking their lips at the sliced fruit, potato chips and dip. Having a full house is making Mom happy which makes me happy. She loves being busy and if it makes today easier for her then the more the merrier.</p><p>\u201cWe look upon the final resting place of Richard James.\u201d</p><p>Mom leans against my brother\u2019s shoulder, crying, as they lower my dad into the ground. My eyes are puffy and they sting from all of the make-up I\u2019m wearing. I feel so stupid for wearing make-up. Of course I was going to cry. What the hell was I thinking? Seth holds my hand in his and his thumb brushes across the top soothingly. I look up at him. The surrounding fire torches send flickering lights across his face. It\u2019s pinched into a sad expression and I know my dad\u2019s death affects him more than he likes to lead on. Next to Seth and I, Jackson comforts Selena who chose to show up today in a pair of black slacks, a black tee and a beautiful knee length cardigan. She looks elegant, yet casual and I wish Mom bought me something more comfortable. This dress is so thin I can feel the cool breeze hit my body. I might as well be naked. When I look back at the coffin and realize for the one millionth time that my dad\u2014who I saw a few days ago\u2014is lying in there absent a heartbeat; the tears begin flowing. I lean against Seth\u2019s side as silent tears stream down my face and he slings an arm over my shoulder. Once my father is in he ground, the MC asks us to throw in a handful of dirt and say our goodbyes. One by one we throw in handfuls of dirt and cry and talk to him. I see this kind of stuff on T.V and I always find it awkward when people talk to a coffin or a tombstone. I never really understood the purpose of it, until now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I cry, sprinkling the soil in on the black box. \u201cI\u2019ll come visit you all the time, I promise.\u201d</p><p>I rise to my feet to let the next person say goodbye. I seek Mom out, she\u2019s surrounded by loved ones and family members, thankfully they\u2019ve already expressed their condolences to me and I don\u2019t have any more left to listen to. Finalizing Dad\u2019s death sucks. It\u2019s all one huge, exhausting process that offers no privacy...but it does offer closure and that\u2019s better, I suppose.</p><p>I walk off a little bit to catch my breath and decide where to go from here. I can\u2019t go back to my apartment and leave Mom alone. In a few weeks I\u2019m not going to be able to afford my apartment and what about Dad\u2019s gym? There\u2019s still electricity, water and everything else to be paid on it every few months. I can\u2019t afford it. Mom will be forced to look for a job, but no one will hire her. She hasn\u2019t worked in over thirty years\u2014not exactly an asset. I exhale and sit on the grass, watching the beautiful, night time ceremony in name of my father.</p> <p>\u201cCan I sit?\u201d Blade\u2019s voice startles me. I didn\u2019t even see him approach me.</p><p>Blade showed up at the beginning of the ceremony. It\u2019s only fair, I guess. He did know my dad for a long time.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He sits next to me and the clear smell of vodka filters in through my nostrils. He hands me the bottle he\u2019s holding in his hand and I take it, swallowing a large mouthful. I clench my teeth and make a strange noise at the base of my throat. Blade chuckles. \u201cYou never could handle your alcohol.\u201d</p><p>I laugh once. \u201cThat\u2019s okay, you drank enough for the both of us.\u201d</p> <p>His dimples fade along with his smile and he averts his gaze. \u201cI really fucked up, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Yes, you did. This whole thing with Seth started because I wanted to get back at Blade. Now look, we\u2019re in love, more in love than I have ever been. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d He takes a large swig of his vodka. \u201cI was given so many chances...\u201d Blade shakes his head. \u201cYou held on for as long as you could, I don\u2019t blame you for giving up.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t reply. Deep and meaningful conversations with exes seems to me to be a \u2018not okay when in a new relationship\u2019 kind of thing. However, I still appreciate his realization. Maybe he\u2019ll treat the next girl better.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d There\u2019s bitterness in his tone, but I can\u2019t not answer the question, not when I know the answer.</p><p>\u201cYes, absolutely.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd him? Does he love you back?\u201d</p><p>I bit back a smile. I can\u2019t help it. I smile whenever I talk about Seth or the fact that he loves me. \u201cHe does.\u201d</p><p>He sighs and forces himself to his feet. \u201cThen I\u2019ve definitely lost. Take care of yourself.\u201d He strolls away from me.</p><p>Seth passes by Blade on his way over to me and doesn\u2019t spare a glance in his direction. He\u2019s smiling and I\u2019m relieved he isn\u2019t confused about Blade and I sitting all the way over here all alone together.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to tell you.\u201d He extends his hand to me and I take it as he pulls me to my feet.</p><p>Before he says anything else he shrugs out of his jacket and places it over my shoulders. Always thinking of me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me anxious, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to you mother about it and she\u2019s given me the go ahead, but I want to talk to you about it before I do anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you feel about me purchasing your father\u2019s gym? I\u2019ll keep it exactly the same in every way.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m stunned. \u201cYou want to buy Dad\u2019s gym?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I love the gym. I fell in love with it the moment I saw it.\u201d</p><p>So many thoughts run through my mind, but I keep falling back to one specific thought. I can\u2019t afford to keep it.</p><p>\u201cYou can buy it. It\u2019s yours.\u201d Although I\u2019m sad it won\u2019t be in our family anymore. I\u2019m happy that someone like Seth wants it. He wouldn\u2019t do anything to ruin it.</p><p>His smile widens. \u201cThere\u2019s one more thing. I want you to manage it.\u201d</p><p>I choke. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>He reaches out and grasps my shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019ll be yours. You can control everything that happens to it. I know you love that place...\u201d</p><p>Tears well in my eyes. Damn it. How many times does this man have to surprise me? \u201cYou\u2019d do that for me?\u201d</p><p>Seth steps forward, planting a kiss on my forehead. \u201cI\u2019d do anything for you.\u201d</p><p>I throw my arms around his neck pulling his mouth onto mine. If my family wasn\u2019t here and we weren\u2019t currently standing in a cemetery, I\u2019d take him right here, right now. But sadly, there are times and places for everything. He pulls away, leaving me breathless. \u201cI have to be at the airport at three a.m. to catch my flight, but I\u2019ll be back in eight days and you can thank me then.\u201d Even in the dim light I can see his eyes flare with pleasure.</p><p>I sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll be counting down the days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, way to make me feel crazy.\u201d He says, leaning in and kissing my neck.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ll be counting down the seconds.\u201d His tongue shoots out of his mouth and glides against my skin. I tilt my head to the side, giving him more flesh to lick. When he gets to my ear lobe he takes it in his mouth, eliciting a moan from me. He chuckles deeply as he straightens his stance. \u201cC\u2019mon. Let\u2019s help your Mom home.\u201d</p><p>Mom was a little down when we brought her home, which is to be expected. She went straight to her room, leaving Chase and I with Seth and the boys.</p><p>\u201cEight days.\u201d I clarify with Seth.</p><p>He\u2019s leaning against the car smiling lazily at me.</p><p>\u201cEight days.\u201d</p><p>I hold his hips and reach up to plant a quick kiss on his lips. I don\u2019t want to put on a show in front of my brother. I still don\u2019t know what he thinks of Seth and I\u2019m eager to question him about it when we go inside. I watch Darryl, Jackson and Seth drive away from the house, and when I turn around to talk to Chase he\u2019s no longer directly behind me, but over by the tree. He swings the tire swing back and forth.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re dating Seth? Not Blade.\u201d</p><p>I sit down on the grass. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened there?\u201d</p><p>My brother and I have always been close, but he\u2019s never around long enough to actually know any details about my life and contacting him is near impossible.</p><p>\u201cI moved on.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles, crouching down to stick his ass in the swing. Surprisingly, the old rope supports his weight. \u201cVague. Since when are you vague with me?\u201d</p><p>I exhale and recap the whole situation. Chase scoffs and laughs appropriately. By the time I\u2019m finished, I\u2019ve successfully converted him to team Seth.</p><p>\u201cHe seems like a good guy. I mean, sometimes he looks at you like he wants to consume you, but you are beautiful so I\u2019m not going to hold that against him.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks grow red hot. Seth doesn\u2019t care much for subtlety. Silence falls between us and he rocks in the swing.</p><p>\u201cWhat I wouldn\u2019t give to see Dad\u2019s face again.\u201d He runs his hands over his forehead. \u201cI always thought that it was okay to be away from here for long periods at a time. I assumed when it\u2019s over, I\u2019d come back and things would be like I never left...\u201d</p><p>My chest aches for Chase. I saw Dad not long ago. It\u2019s been too long ago for him.</p><p>\u201cIf I knew he\u2019d die now I would have put off my service just to spend a little more time with him. That\u2019s all Mom and Dad want, you know. They want time, they want love\u2014the kind of love we gave them as kids.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never thought of it that way. When Mom and Dad pestered me about moving back in I was always so abrupt, so rude. All they wanted was time together. If I visited regularly, maybe that would have been enough. I can hear Chase sniffle and I know how much he hates to cry in front of people so I stand up and walk back inside, my chest still heavy with his words.</p><p>In my room, I shed my dress, kick off my shoes and slide into bed. I\u2019m all cried out. I couldn\u2019t cry even if I stubbed my toe on a brick. Today, we buried our father. It was horrible, but it brought closure. Everything else, I\u2019ll sort out tomorrow. Mom, Chase and I need to work on repairing our family. It\u2019ll take a while, but I\u2019m certain we\u2019ll pull through.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>It\u2019s exactly seven days after I last saw Seth. Mom and Chase went to bed half an hour ago. I pull on the desk, rolling myself as close to the computer screen as I can get. I open the web browser and type \u2018Seth vs. Don Las Vegas\u2019 into the search engine. It immediately takes me to the MMAC website and the live stream to the fight. The building they\u2019re fighting in is huge, easily housing tens of thousands of people. The camera scans over the roaring crowd before showing a highlight reel of other fights from earlier tonight. When it\u2019s finished, it shows a recap of the weigh in between Seth and Don. Sponsors line the back wall as do promo girls, wearing red short shorts and bikinis. I listen carefully to the commentators as they recap the guidelines of the tournament.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an eight man fighting format. The last man standing receives one hundred thousand dollars, a contract with the MMAC and the title of Amateur Champion. Championship fight requires a professional weigh in. Neither fighter is able to exceed one hundred and ninety pounds.\u201d</p><p>I tune the commentators out and watch the weigh in. Don goes first. He pulls of his shirt, exposing his creepy dragon tattoo, and hands it to his coach. Don steps onto the scale and he weighs one-ninety exactly. Surprising, considering the size of him. Darryl hold Seth\u2019s t-shirt as he steps onto the scale\u2014one-ninety-one. My pulse increases and I begin chewing my nails. What does it mean? Does it mean he\u2019s disqualified? I see Don smirk and I want smack him through the screen.</p><p>Jackson hands Darryl a towel and the CEO of the MMAC helps Darryl cover Seth\u2019s front as he slides his shorts off. Seth\u2019s eyes lock onto the camera and his lips curl into a cocky smile. Heat tears through my body because I know it\u2019s for me. The towel rides a little low and I can see the \u2018v\u2019 shape of Seth\u2019s oblique\u2019s. I\u2019m smiling as another hot flush rolls through me and I squeeze my legs together. I notice the eyes of the girls behind him linger on his backside and they can\u2019t keep the smiles off their faces either. I scowl at the screen, fighting the urge to growl \u2018my precious\u2019.</p><p>He steps back onto the scale and it doesn\u2019t drop at all. I hear the commentators say Seth has one hour to cut one pound. Is that even possible? He steps back into his shorts and the towel is dropped. The stream flicks to Seth\u2019s second weigh in. The towel comes out and his shorts drop. When he steps back onto the scale, he\u2019s the perfect weight for the fight. Seth and Don stand close to each other, fists up as people take the pictures. When I saw this in the past, Dad always told me it\u2019s just fun and they don\u2019t actually hate each other, but I\u2019m watching Don and Seth and I see the hate. I feel it.</p><p>The picture takes us back to the empty ring and I hear Don\u2019s intro song. It\u2019s a song I\u2019ve never heard before and I\u2019m ninety percent sure it\u2019s in German. The cameras\u2019 follow him from his runway, all the way to the ring. There\u2019s a gleam of cockiness in his eyes. He\u2019s exactly where he wants to be. God knows how long he\u2019s wanted to fight Seth without the restrictions and now he can. Don enters the ring and stands in his corner. He offers no reaction to the crowd and they love it. The commentators talk about Don\u2019s boxing background and his eight to zero fight stats, claiming he\u2019s undefeated. I hate every second the camera lingers on his angry face.</p><p>My mood instantly brightens when I hear Seth\u2019s intro song. A little box comes up on the side of the screen telling me the song is \u2018We own it\u2019 by Wiz Khalifa\u2019. I make a mental note purchase it later. It\u2019s easily my favorite song now. The camera follows Seth closely, even showing snippets of Darryl and Jackson behind him. Their faces are hard\u2014determined.</p><p>Once in the ring, Seth\u2019s music is cut off and I realize I\u2019ve been holding my breath. As the announcer talks, Seth\u2019s hands clench into fists. They unclench and then clench again. He bounces back and forth on the balls of his feet a few times before tilting his head to the ceiling\u2014eyes closed. His chest falls as he blows out a long, slow breath. The referee calls both the boys to the middle of the ring. He demands a good, clean fight and sends them back to their corner. With a clap of his hands, the fight begins.</p><p>Seth lets Don come at him first, no doubt trying to gauge his tempo, favored hand, and which foot he likes to put forward first. Don swings at Seth, but he dodges it by leaning back quickly. As Don pulls his arm back, Seth shoots forward smacking him with an open palm across his left temple. Don shakes his head and the commentators\u2019 love that Seth is playing with his competitor. One of the commentators even calls him \u2018suicidal; for trying to piss off Don Russell. I can see Don\u2019s jaw working furiously as he relentlessly throws punches at Seth. Seth left hand is up, blocking whatever blows Don is throwing, while his right fist jabs outwards, punching him in the stomach. Don swings his leg around to kick Seth\u2019s legs out from under him, but Seth blocks the leg with his own, sending a killer hook straight to Don\u2019s jaw. It connects and snaps Don\u2019s face to the side. I flinch at the power in his punch and I almost leap out of my seat, unable to contain my excitement. Don stumbles backward, dazed and Seth follows the punch with a foot into his ribs. Don recovers quickly and launches at Seth, landing a good, strong blow to the side of his head. My hands fly up to cover my mouth as Don wraps his arms around Seth\u2019s chest and shoulders, driving him backwards and into the cage. Don traps Seth and let\u2019s his fists fly. Repeatedly, they smack Seth in the head again and again. Awful sounds coat me with thick goosebumps. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d I rasp, trying to keep my voice down so I don\u2019t wake Mom. Each time Don\u2019s fists connect I cringe. I can hear the chilling sound of bone cracking against flesh, and the hairs on my head tingle in fear. I see Jackson below Seth, yelling at him and Seth stomps the balls of his feet down onto Don\u2019s foot, forcing him to lose footing. Seth shoves Don back and goes low, wrapping his arms around Don\u2019s legs and taking him down. He wastes no time in diving on Don. His thick thigh muscles straddled Don\u2019s mid section and he starts raining blows to his head and face. Don\u2019s arms come up to shield his face from the pounding, so Seth leans back to slam into Don\u2019s ribs. I can see sweat run down Seth\u2019s back and his chest heaving heavily. Don flicks his hips, throwing Seth off of him just as the commentators swore the referee was going to end the fight. As Don attempts to roll away, Seth catches his arm and wrap his legs around Don, straightening out his arm.</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d A commentator shouts, startling me. \u201cSeth has Don in an arm bar.\u201d Seth pulls down hard and Don\u2019s face strains. He doesn\u2019t want to give up. The referee gets in Don\u2019s face, talking to him. Every few minutes Don shakes his head, refusing to tap out. Seth adjusts his position and pulls even harder. Don can\u2019t keep his eyes open. He\u2019s in too much pain and suddenly I feel sorry for him. There\u2019s a sardonic smile on Seth\u2019s face, he knows he\u2019s got it. All he has to do is apply a little more pressure and Don\u2019s arm will snap, but he wants Don to submit to him. He wants Don to tap out and be humiliated. I close my eyes as the camera zooms in on the awkward shape of Don\u2019s arm. The crowd is going nuts, begging for Seth to snap it. As I open my eyes, I witness Don\u2019s palm slap the floor of the ring and I leap out of my chair. Seth did it! He beat Don. Dancing around my living room after a fight is not something I\u2019ll ever admit to doing, but I do it. I do it out of happiness, out of pride, hell, I even do it out of arousal because I can\u2019t possibly sit down without squirming. New waves of screams tear from the crowd, forcing my attention back to the screen. The teams are in the ring, separating the two fighters. They\u2019re yelling at each other, dying to go another round with each other. Don is pissed, his face hot red. Seth smiles at Don and it pisses him off even more. Security flies into the ring to help Don\u2019s team suppress him. I can\u2019t hear anything over the roar of the crowd or the annoying voices of the commentators and I nervously chew on my nails. Seth watches with his hands on his hips as they drag Don from the ring. When his gone, the referee raises Seth\u2019s hand and the crowd loses their minds. They scream, shout, chant, clap their hands and stomp their feet. Energy flows through me as the CEO of the MMAC steps into the ring. The announcer hands him a microphone and he addresses the crowd. My eyes are on Seth, not paying attention to a single word the CEO is saying. Seth is smiling modestly so I know it has something to do with his impressive skills. The CEO hands Seth a framed contract and they take photos. The commentators go over highlights of the fight and I close the browser and shut off the monitor with a huge smile on my face.</p><p>Seth achieved his dream. He went for it and he succeeded. It leaves me thinking about my dream, the dream of becoming a romance author. The last few months have definitely sidetracked me from what I want to do. At least now I have enough material to write that happy ever after I\u2019ve been stuck on. Maybe managing the gym will give me time to write on the side? If not, I\u2019ll have to make time. You can\u2019t reach your dream unless you try, right?</p> <p>I sit by my dad\u2019s fresh grave, silent tears rolling down my cheeks. The sun is setting over the port and its orange-red hue coats everything in a pretty pink light. I\u2019ve been sitting here for hours, dreading the thought of going back home. Chase left this morning to go back to Pakistan. He promised to get more Skype time, which made his departure more bearable and Mom isn\u2019t going to be home either. She decided to spend a little alone time in a hideaway cabin for two nights. Apparently, she and Dad stayed there all the time. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to handle being in the house by myself. I haven\u2019t been truly alone with my thoughts yet. There was always someone lingering around the place, but for the next two days I\u2019m on my own.</p><p>I climb to my feet and turn from Dad\u2019s tombstone. I want to avoid being in the cemetery alone at night so I walk the mile to my car and drive away. When I get home, there are no cars in the driveway and I pull in, parking right in front of the garage. I inhale deeply, mentally preparing myself and climb out of the car. I walk over to the small, white gate and my fingers linger on the latch. I can\u2019t stay here by myself. Not tonight. The gate squeaks as I let it go and turn back to my car. I\u2019ll stay at my apartment.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to leave me here by myself, are you?\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s voice startles me, and I whirl back to face the house. A movement over by the tree catches my eye and there he is, leaning against the oak tree in the front yard. His hair is in wilder disarray than normal, giving him a devastating sex appeal as it juts out roughly above his forehead. His arms are folded across his chest, and the short sleeves of his black shirt cling tightly to him, accentuating the strong, muscled ridges of his bare forearms. He looks positively delicious and nipples harden against my lace bra as my gaze settles on his mouth. His full lips are curved into a little cocky smile, like he knows I\u2019m craving him. I glance over my shoulders. I can\u2019t see his car anywhere.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI parked around the corner.\u201d</p><p>Forgetting the latch, I jump the gate and run to him. He opens his arms and I fit right in, wrapping my legs around his waist and smashing my lips against his. Seth squeezes me against him with devastating pressure, but I don\u2019t dare complain. I don\u2019t want him to let go, ever. I pull my lips away, panting breathlessly. \u201cI had no idea you were going to be back today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was painful purposefully avoiding your calls, but I wanted to surprise you.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cMission accomplished.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m happy\u2014genuinely happy. If anyone can wash away my anguish and doubts, it\u2019s Seth. It\u2019s always Seth. I slide off of him and tug on his hand. He follows me onto the porch and I pull the key from the back pocket of my jeans. I unlock the door and pull him inside. I flick on the living room lights and lock the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cIs your Mom\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not home.\u201d I cut in rather eagerly. I pull him up the hallway and into my old room. I switch on the light and Seth almost cringes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I don\u2019t know what the hell I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>Seth grips my hips in a firm and unbreakable grasp, catching me off guard. A thrill shoots down my spine at his touch. A second later, he\u2019s pushing me backward onto the bed. I land on my elbows, sliding myself upwards as he climbs on top of me. His body pins mine tightly against the bed. I moan as his full lips crash to mine and his tongue flicks out to glide against my bottom lip. His fingers move steadily underneath my shirt, grazing the delicate skin of my sides. Strangely, his finger glides over a specific spot on my ribs and I flinch. Pulling away from his mouth I giggle and he smiles down at me.</p><p>\u201cTicklish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>He strokes the spot with his finger again and I twist, biting my lip. I manage to stem the flow of laughter long enough for him to give up and plant a kiss on my nose. \u201cI missed you like crazy, you know.\u201d</p><p>I scoff, playfully. \u201cYeah right, I saw all of those pretty promo girls. I bet you had the time of your life.\u201d</p> <p>He rests his chin on my chest and looks up at me through thick dark lashes.</p><p>\u201cIt was hell, actually. Do you wanna know how many girls showed up at my hotel room practically naked?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. Some people have no shame and it makes me angry.</p><p>\u201cWould you care if I told you I turned every single one of them away?\u201d I look into his eyes and the golden swirls in his irises flare. \u201cI was a very good boy\u2014not tempted by anything for one second.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s smiling widely, like he\u2019s super proud of himself. I\u2019m proud of him. He has come a long way from the person he used to be.</p><p>\u201cWell, there was a lack of naked men throwing themselves at me in your absence unfortunately so I\u2019ve got nothing to help boost your confidence\u2014not that you need anyone to boost that already insanely high ego of yours.\u201d</p><p>He laughs the laugh that I love so much and it forces me to join him. \u201cYou\u2019re hilarious. I must be rubbing off on you.\u201d</p><p>The word \u2018rubbing\u2019 ignites something deep down in my stomach and I cup his face in my hands, drawing his mouth toward mine. \u201cSpeaking of rubbing...\u201d I chuckle against his lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m one step ahead of you.\u201d He replies, undoing my jeans button easily. My hips flex against him as his finger slide under my jeans and the fabric of my underwear. I laugh once before his tongue slips into my mouth and I dissolve into him. His teeth catch my bottom lip, roughly and I gasp.</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby.\u201d He whispers.</p><p>I smile. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>SETH.</p><p>I\u2019ve been slamming my fists into this damn bag for the last hour, waiting for Olivia to finish cleaning the gym. There\u2019s no one left, the doors are locked and the blinds drawn, but she insists on having everything in top shape for when it opens in the morning. I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t enjoy watching her walking around the place with a determined little pout on her sexy pink lips because I do. She does a round, picking up a few towels here and there. I\u2019m reminded of the day that I dropped my towel and demanded that she pick it up. It was such a dick move, but I was so pissed off with my mother and believing she\u2019d go to the alcoholics program. I was let down, again.</p><p>Purchasing the gym was a good move on my part. I spend most of my time in here and it gives me a chance to see Olivia all day and although I can\u2019t touch her, she\u2019s always nice to look at. She enters the boxing section of the gym and I call out to her. I let the towel I\u2019m holding in my hand fall from my fingers and her gorgeous, green eyes follow it all the way to the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot one.\u201d I say, unable to hold back my smile.</p><p>She flicks her long, chocolate ponytail over her shoulder and stalks toward me with a sexy little smirk, willing to play along with my game. Her tongue shoots out to moisten her delicious bottom lip and I fight the urge to do it myself. She presses her index finger firmly against my sweaty chest.</p><p>\u201cPick up your own damn towel.\u201d She states, making my cock twitch.</p><p>My gaze drops to her chest. I see her nipples pressing hard against her pink tank top. Her sports bra fails to hide her obvious arousal. I grasp her hip, pulling her closer to me and she happily obliges. I always think about what would\u2019ve happened between us if that blonde woman hadn\u2019t showed up. Would she have let me take her? I like to think so.</p><p>In the beginning, I hated Portland, but the moment I saw Olivia I knew she was going to change me. Seeing her over and over drove me insane and she quickly became an obsession. Forcing myself to keep my hands off her when she was so willing to give herself to me was, hands down, one of the most difficult things I\u2019ve ever done, but it payed off. She is good and I\u2019m... well, I\u2019m a work in progress. She smiles up at me through dark lashes and I run my thumb along her jaw. I want to run my tongue along it and taste her. I want to lay her out on the mat beneath me and make her sigh and scream my name\u2014a sound I\u2019ll never get tired of.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d She asks me, searching my eyes.</p><p>If I press harder against her, she\u2019ll be able to feel me and put two and two together. Instead, I smile. \u201cIt isn\u2019t very PG, I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d</p><p>Olivia drags her teeth over her bottom lip and the palm of her hand flattens against my chest. \u201cThen we should shower and get out of here\u201d</p><p>My skin under her hand tingles when she pulls away and I follow behind her to the shower room. Keeping my eyes ahead of me and not on her tight-clad ass proves to be difficult, until we hit the shower room. So many times I\u2019ve been alone with her in here and not once have I taken her hard against the concrete wall\u2014even though I\u2019ve wanted to, desperately.</p><p>Normally, Olivia showers in a stall, apparently she\u2019s shy. God knows why, she has the most perfect body, from her well-shaped calves to her big, perky breasts with the big, light pink nipples\u2014on second thought, maybe it\u2019s good she showers behind closed doors. I\u2019d hate for anyone else\u2019s eyes to see her like I do.</p><p>When she turns on the shower, steam builds quickly. She kicks off her sneakers and slowly pulls down her tights. I stand still, watching as she reveals her milky skin to me piece by piece and I keep watching until she\u2019s completely naked and standing under the flow of the water. The water rolls down her face and over her plump lips. It travels over the peaks of her breasts and down her flat stomach. I shake my head a little. I can\u2019t help, but to get wrapped up in the small details whenever I\u2019m around her... she just has that effect on me.</p><p>She affects me and I love it. I love her. When someone affects you so much that you can\u2019t sleep at night without them, you can\u2019t think straight whenever they\u2019re in the room and you\u2019d risk it all for them, you go for it. You take no risks. Olivia knows I love her. She knows I\u2019d risk my entire future for her, but she doesn\u2019t know about my plans to make her my wife.</p><p>Olivia Marc.</p><p>It has a nice ring to it? Doesn\u2019t it? </p> </body></html>"]
