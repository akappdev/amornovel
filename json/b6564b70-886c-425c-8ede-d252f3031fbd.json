My condo on the Upper West Side had the level of soundproofing expected in a multimillion-dollar property, but still the sounds of the city filtered in\u2014the rhythmic thumping of tires over the well-worn streets, the protests of weary air brakes, and the nonstop honking of taxi horns.</p><p>As I stepped out of the corner caf\u00e9 onto always-busy Broadway, the rush of the city washed over me. How had I ever lived without the cacophony of Manhattan?</p><p>How had I ever managed living without him?</p> <p>Gideon Cross.</p><p>I cupped his jaw in my hands, felt him nuzzle into my touch. That show of vulnerability and affection cut right through me. Just hours before I\u2019d thought he might never change, that I would have to compromise too much to share my life with him. Now, I stood in the face of his courage and doubted my own.</p><p>Had I demanded more of him than I had of myself ? I was shamed by the possibility that I\u2019d pushed him to evolve while I had remained obstinately the same.</p><p>He stood before me, so tall and strong. In jeans and a T-shirt, with a ball cap pulled low over his brow, he was unrecognizable as the global mogul the world thought it knew but still so innately compelling he affected everyone who walked by. In the corner of my eye, I noted how the people nearby glanced at him, then did a double take.</p><p>Whether Gideon was dressed casually or in the bespoke three-piece suits he favored, the power of his leanly muscular body was unmistakable. The way he held himself, the authority he wielded with faultless control, made it impossible for him to ever fade into the background.</p> <p>New York swallowed everything that came into it, while Gideon had the city on a gilded leash.</p><p>And he was mine. Even with my ring on his finger, I still sometimes struggled to believe it.</p><p>He would never be just a man. He was ferocity sheathed in elegance, perfection veined with flaws. He was the nexus of my world, a nexus of the world.</p><p>Yet he\u2019d just proven that he would bend and yield to the breaking point to be with me. Which left me with a renewed determination to prove I was worth the pain I\u2019d forced him to face.</p><p>Around us, the shop fronts along Broadway were reopening. The flow of traffic on the street began to thicken, black cars and yellow cabs bouncing wildly over the uneven surface. Residents trickled onto the sidewalks, taking their dogs out or heading toward Central Park for an early-morning run, stealing what time they could before the workday kicked in with a vengeance.</p><p>The Benz pulled up to the curb just as we reached it, Ra\u00fal a big shadowy figure at the wheel. Angus slid the Bentley into place behind it. My ride and Gideon\u2019s, going to separate homes. How was that a marriage?</p> <p>Fact was, it was our marriage, though neither of us wanted it that way. I\u2019d had to draw a line when Gideon hired my boss away from the advertising agency I worked for.</p><p>I understood my husband\u2019s desire for me to join Cross Industries, but trying to force my hand by taking action behind my back? ... I couldn\u2019t allow it, not with a man like Gideon. Either we were together\u2014making decisions together\u2014or we were too far apart to make our relationship work.</p><p>Tilting my head back, I looked up into his stunning face. There was remorse there, and relief. And love. So much love.</p><p>It was breathtaking how handsome he was. His eyes were the blue of the Caribbean, his hair a thick and glossy black mane that brushed his collar. An adoring hand had sculpted every plane and angle of his face into a level of flawlessness that mesmerized and made it hard to think rationally. I\u2019d been captivated by the look of him from the moment I first saw him, and I still found my synapses frying at random moments. Gideon just dazzled me.</p><p>But it was the man inside, his relentless energy and power, his sharp intelligence and ruthlessness coupled with a heart that could be so tender ...</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d My fingertips brushed over the dark slash of his brow, tingling as they always did when they touched his skin. \u201cFor calling me. For telling me about your dream. For meeting me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d meet you anywhere.\u201d The words were a vow, spoken fervently and fiercely.</p><p>Everyone had demons. Gideon\u2019s were caged by his iron will when he was awake. When he slept, they tormented him in violent, vicious nightmares that he\u2019d resisted sharing with me. We had so much in common, but the abuse in our childhoods was a shared trauma that both drew us together and pushed us apart. It made me fight harder for Gideon and what we had together. Our abusers had taken too much away from us already.</p> <p>\u201cEva ... You\u2019re the only force on earth that can keep me away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for that, too,\u201d I murmured, my chest tight. Our recent separation had been brutal for both of us. \u201cI know it wasn\u2019t easy for you to give me space, but we needed it. And I know I pushed you hard ....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cToo hard.\u201d</p><p>My mouth curved at the quick bite of ice in his words. Gideon wasn\u2019t a man used to being denied what he wanted. But as much as he\u2019d hated being deprived of access to me, we were together now because that deprivation drove him forward. \u201cI know. And you let me, because you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than love.\u201d His hands banded my wrists, tightening in the authoritative way that made everything inside me surrender.</p><p>I nodded, no longer afraid to admit that we needed each other to a degree some would consider unhealthy. It was who we were, what we had. And it was precious.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll drive to Dr. Petersen\u2019s together.\u201d He said the words with unmistakable command, but his gaze searched mine as if he\u2019d asked a question.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so bossy,\u201d I teased, wanting us to leave each other feeling good. Hopeful. Our weekly therapy appointment with Dr. Lyle Petersen was only hours away, and it couldn\u2019t have been more opportunely scheduled. We\u2019d turned a corner. We could use a little help in figuring what our next steps should be from here.</p><p>His hands circled my waist. \u201cYou love it.\u201d</p><p>I reached for the hem of his shirt, fisting the soft jersey. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d His shuddered breath gusted hot on my neck. Manhattan surrounded us but couldn\u2019t intrude. When we were together, there was nothing else.</p> <p>A low sound of hunger left me. I yearned for and craved him, shivering with delight that he was once again pressed against me. I breathed him in with deep inhalations, my fingers kneading into the rigid muscles of his back. The rush sliding through me was heady. I was addicted to him\u2014heart, soul, and body\u2014and I\u2019d gone days without my fix, leaving me shaky and off-balance, unable to function properly.</p><p>He engulfed me, his body so much bigger and harder. I felt safe in his embrace, cherished and protected. Nothing could touch or hurt me when he was holding me. I wanted him to feel that same sense of security with me. I needed him to know he could drop his guard, take a breath, and I could protect us both.</p><p>I had to be stronger. Smarter. Scarier. We had enemies, and Gideon was dealing with them on his own. It was innate to him to be protective; it was one of his traits I deeply admired. But I had to start showing people that I could be as formidable an adversary as my husband.</p><p>More important, I had to prove it to Gideon.</p><p>Leaning into him, I absorbed his warmth. His love. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at five, ace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a minute later,\u201d he ordered gruffly.</p> <p>I laughed despite myself, infatuated with every rough-edged facet of him. \u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>Pulling back, he gave me a look that made my toes curl. \u201cOr I come get you.\u201d</p><p>I should have tiptoed into my stepfather\u2019s penthouse with my breath held, since the time\u2014a little after six A.M.\u2014meant getting caught sneaking back in was likely. Instead, I strode in with purpose, my thoughts occupied with the changes I needed to make.</p><p>I had time for a shower\u2014barely\u2014but I decided not to take one. It had been so long since Gideon had touched me. Too long since his hands had been on me, his body inside mine. I didn\u2019t want to wash the memory of his touch away. That alone would give me the strength to do what had to be done.</p><p>An end-table lamp clicked on. \u201cEva.\u201d</p><p>I jumped. \u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>Pivoting, I found my mother sitting on one of the living room settees.</p><p>\u201cYou scared the crap out of me!\u201d I accused, rubbing a hand over my racing heart.</p> <p>She stood, her floor-length ivory satin robe shimmering around her toned, lightly tanned legs. I was her only child, but we looked like we could be sisters. Monica Tramell Barker Mitchell Stanton was obsessive about maintaining her looks. She was a career trophy wife; her youthful beauty was her stock-in-trade.</p><p>\u201cBefore you start,\u201d I began, \u201cyes, we have to talk about the wedding. But I really have to get ready for work and pack up my stuff so I can go home tonight\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you having an affair?\u201d</p><p>Her curt question shocked me more than the ambush. \u201cWhat? No!\u201d</p><p>She exhaled, tension visibly leaving her shoulders. \u201cThank God. Will you tell me what the hell is going on? How bad was this argument you had with Gideon?\u201d</p><p>Bad. For a while, I worried that he\u2019d ended us with the decisions he made. \u201cWe\u2019re working things out, Mom. It was just a bump in the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bump that had you avoiding him for days? That\u2019s not the way to deal with your problems, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story\u2014\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms. \u201cI\u2019m not in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am. I have a job to get ready for.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hurt flashed across her face. I felt instantly remorseful.</p><p>Once, I had wanted to grow up to be just like my mother. I spent hours dressing up in her clothes, stumbling around in her heels, smearing my face with her expensive creams and cosmetics. I tried to emulate her breathy voice and sensual mannerisms, certain my mother was the most gorgeous and perfect woman in the world. And her way with men, how they looked at her and catered to her ... well, I\u2019d wanted that magic touch of hers, too.</p><p>In the end, I had matured into her spitting image aside from the style of our hair and the color of my eyes. But that was just on the outside. Who we were as women couldn\u2019t be more different and, sadly, that was something I\u2019d come to take pride in. I\u2019d stopped turning to her for advice, except when it came to clothes and decorating.</p><p>That was going to change. Now.</p> <p>I\u2019d tried a lot of different tactics in navigating my relationship with Gideon, but I hadn\u2019t asked for help from the one person close to me who knew what it was like to be married to prominent and powerful men.</p><p>\u201cI need your advice, Mom.\u201d</p><p>My words hung in the air, and then I watched comprehension widen my mother\u2019s eyes with surprise. A moment later she was sinking back onto the sofa as if her knees had failed her. Her shock was a hard blow, telling me how completely I\u2019d shut her out.</p><p>I was hurting inside when I took a seat on the couch opposite her. I\u2019d learned to be careful about what I shared with my mom, doing my best to withhold information that might start discussions that drove me crazy.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t always been that way. My stepbrother Nathan had taken my warm, easy relationship with my mother away from me, just as he\u2019d taken my innocence. After my mom learned of the abuse, she had changed, becoming overprotective to the point of stalking and smothering me. She was supremely confident about everything in her life, except for me. With me, she was anxious and intrusive, sometimes bordering on hysterical. Over the years, I\u2019d forced myself to skirt around the truth far too often, keeping secrets from everyone I loved just to maintain peace.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to be the kind of wife Gideon needs,\u201d I confessed.</p><p>Her shoulders went back, her entire posture shifting to one of outrage. \u201cIs he having an affair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d A reluctant laugh escaped me. \u201cNo one is having an affair. We wouldn\u2019t do that to each other. We couldn\u2019t. Stop worrying about that.\u201d</p><p>I had to wonder if my mother\u2019s recent infidelity with my father was the true root of her concern. Did it weigh on her mind? Did she question what she had with Stanton? I didn\u2019t know how to feel about that. I loved my dad so much, but I also believed that my stepfather was perfect for my mom in just the way she needed a husband to be.</p><p>\u201cEva\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon and I eloped a few weeks ago.\u201d God, it felt good to put that out there.</p> <p>She blinked at me. Once, twice. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told Dad yet,\u201d I went on. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to call him today.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glistened with welling tears. \u201cWhy? God, Eva ... how did we grow so far apart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d I got up and went to her, taking a seat beside her. I reached for her hands, but she pulled me into a fierce hug instead.</p><p>I breathed in the familiar scent of her and felt the kind of peace only found in a mother\u2019s arms. For a few moments, anyway. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t planned, Mom. We went away for the weekend, and Gideon asked me if I would, and he made the arrangements .... It was spontaneous. Spur of the moment.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back, revealing a tear-streaked face and fire in her eyes. \u201cHe married you without a prenup?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, I had to. Of course my mother would zero in on the financial details. Money had long been the driving force of her life. \u201cThere\u2019s a prenup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva Lauren! Did you have it looked at? Or was that spontaneous, too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI read every word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not an attorney! God, Eva ... I raised you to be smarter than this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA six-year-old could\u2019ve understood the terms,\u201d I shot back, irritated by the real problem in my marriage: Gideon and I had way too many people meddling in our relationship, distracting us so that we didn\u2019t have time to tackle the things that really needed work. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the prenup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve asked Richard to read it. I don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t have. It\u2019s so irresponsible. I just don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw it, Monica.\u201d</p><p>We both turned at the sound of my stepfather\u2019s voice. Stanton entered the room ready for the day, looking sharp in a navy suit and yellow tie. I imagined Gideon would be much like my stepfather at the same age: physically fit, distinguished, as much an alpha male as ever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou did?\u201d I asked, surprised.</p><p>\u201cCross sent it to me a few weeks ago.\u201d Stanton crossed over to my mother, taking her hand in his. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have argued for better terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are always better terms, Richard!\u201d my mom said sharply.</p><p>\u201cThere are rewards for milestones such as anniversaries and the birth of children, and nothing in the way of penalties for Eva, aside from marital counseling. A dissolution would have a more than equitable distribution of assets. I was tempted to ask if Cross had his in-house counsel review it. I imagine they argued strenuously against it.\u201d</p> <p>She settled for a moment, taking that in. Then she pushed to her feet, bristling. \u201cBut you knew they were eloping? You knew, and you didn\u2019t say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d He pulled her into his arms, crooning softly like he would with a child. \u201cI assumed he was looking ahead. You know these things usually take a few months of negotiating. Although, in this case, there was nothing more I could\u2019ve asked for.\u201d</p><p>I stood. I had to hurry if I was going to get to work on time. Today of all days, I didn\u2019t want to be late.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d My mother straightened away from Stanton. \u201cWe\u2019re not done with this discussion. You can\u2019t just drop a bomb like that and leave!\u201d</p><p>Turning to face her, I walked backward. \u201cI\u2019ve seriously got to get ready. Why don\u2019t we get together for lunch and talk more then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut her off. \u201cCorinne Giroux.\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s eyes widened, then narrowed. One name. I didn\u2019t have to say anything else.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s ex was a problem that needed no further explanation.</p><p>It was the rare person who came to Manhattan and didn\u2019t feel an instant familiarity. The skyline of the city had been immortalized in too many movies and television shows to count, spreading the love affair with New York from residents to the world.</p><p>I was no exception.</p> <p>I adored the Art Deco elegance of the Chrysler Building. I could pinpoint my place on the island in relation to the position of the Empire State Building. I was awed by the breathtaking height of the Freedom Tower that now dominated downtown. But the Crossfire Building was in a class by itself. I\u2019d thought so before I had ever fallen in love with the man whose vision had led to its creation.</p><p>As Ra\u00fal pulled the Benz up to the curb, I marveled at the distinctive sapphire blue glass that encased the obelisk shape of the Crossfire. My head tilted back, my gaze sliding up the shimmering height to the point at the top, the light-drenched space that housed Cross Industries. Pedestrians surged around me, the sidewalk teeming with businessmen and -women heading to work with briefcases and totes in one hand and steaming cups of coffee in the other.</p><p>I felt Gideon before I saw him, my entire body humming with awareness as he stepped out of the Bentley, which had pulled up behind the Benz. The air around me charged with electricity, the crackling energy that always heralded the approach of a storm.</p><p>I was among the few who knew it was the restlessness of Gideon\u2019s tormented soul that powered the tempest.</p><p>Turning to him, I smiled. It was no coincidence that we\u2019d arrived at the same time. I knew that before I saw the confirmation in his eyes.</p><p>He wore a charcoal suit with a white shirt and silver twill tie. His dark hair brushed his jaw and collar in a sexy, rakish fall of inky strands. He still looked at me with the hot sexual ferocity that first scorched me, but there was tenderness in the brilliant blue now and an openness that meant more to me than anything else he could ever give me.</p><p>I stepped toward him as he approached. \u201cGood morning, Dark and Dangerous.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved wryly. Amusement warmed his gaze further. \u201cGood morning, wife.\u201d</p> <p>I reached for his hand, felt settled when he met me halfway and gripped mine firmly. \u201cI told my mother this morning ... about us being married.\u201d</p><p>One dark brow arched in surprise, and then his smile curved into one of triumphant pleasure. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Laughing at his unabashed possessiveness, I gave him a soft shove to the shoulder. He moved lightning quick, catching me close and kissing the corner of my smiling mouth.</p><p>His joy was infectious. I felt it bursting inside me, lighting up all the places that had been so dark the past few days. \u201cI\u2019m going to call my dad at my first break. Let him know.\u201d</p><p>He sobered. \u201cWhy now, and not before?\u201d</p><p>He spoke softly, his voice pitched low for privacy. The office-bound crowd continued to flow by, paying very little attention to us. Still, I hesitated to answer, feeling too exposed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then ... the truth came easier than it ever had. I\u2019d been hiding so many things from the people I loved. Little things, big things. Trying to maintain the status quo, while also hoping for and needing change.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He stepped closer, his gaze intense. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll tell me why tonight.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>His hand curved around my nape, the hold possessive and tender at once.

Megumi Kaba waved from behind her reception desk, tapping her headset to let me know she was on a call and couldn\u2019t talk. I waved back and headed toward my own desk with a determined stride. I had a lot to get done, a new start to get rolling.</p> <p>But first things first. I dropped my purse and bag into the bottom drawer, then settled in my chair and surfed to my usual florist\u2019s website. I knew what I wanted. Two dozen white roses in a deep red crystal vase.</p><p>White for purity. For friendship. For eternal love. It was also the flag of surrender. I\u2019d drawn battle lines by forcing a separation between Gideon and me, and in the end, I had won. But I didn\u2019t want to war with my husband.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even try to come up with a clever tie-in note for the flowers, like I\u2019d done in the past. I just wrote from the heart.</p><p>You are miraculous, Mr. Cross.</p><p>I cherish you and love you so much.</p><p>Mrs. Cross</p> <p>The website prompted me to finalize the order. I clicked submit and took a moment to imagine what Gideon would think of my gift. One day, I hoped to watch him receive flowers from me. Did he smile when his secretary, Scott, brought them in? Did he stop whatever meeting he was commanding to read my notes? Or did he wait until one of the rare lulls in his schedule for privacy?</p><p>My mouth curved as I considered the possibilities. I loved giving Gideon gifts.</p><p>And soon I\u2019d have more time to pick them out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quitting?\u201d</p><p>Mark Garrity\u2019s incredulous gaze lifted from my resignation letter and met mine.</p><p>My stomach knotted at the expression on my boss\u2019s face. \u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t give more notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow is your last day?\u201d He leaned back in his chair. His eyes were a warm chocolate shades lighter than his skin, and they registered both surprise and dismay. \u201cWhy, Eva?\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I leaned forward, setting my elbows on my knees. Yet again, I went with the truth. \u201cI know it\u2019s unprofessional to cut out like this, but ... I\u2019ve got to rearrange my priorities and right now .... I just can\u2019t give this my full attention, Mark. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI ...\u201d He blew out his breath and ran a hand over his dark, tight curls. \u201cHell ... What can I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019ll forgive me and won\u2019t hold it against me?\u201d I huffed out a humorless laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s asking a lot, I know.\u201d</p><p>He managed a wry smile. \u201cI hate to lose you, Eva, you know that. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever really expressed how much you\u2019ve contributed. You make me work better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mark. I appreciate that.\u201d God, this was harder than I thought it would be, even knowing it was the best and only decision I could make.</p><p>My gaze went beyond my handsome boss to the view behind him. As a junior account manager, he had a small office and his view was blocked by the building across the street, but it was still as quintessentially New York as Gideon Cross\u2019s sprawling office on the top floor above us.</p><p>In a lot of ways, that division of floors mirrored the way I\u2019d tried to define my relationship with Gideon. I knew who he was. Knew what he was: a man in a class by himself. I loved that about him and didn\u2019t want him to change; I just wanted to climb to his level on my own merits. What I hadn\u2019t considered was that by stubbornly refusing to accept that our marriage changed the plan, I was pulling him down to mine.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t be known for earning my way to the top of my field. For some people, I would always have married into success. And I was just going to have to live with it.</p><p>\u201cSo, where are you going from here?\u201d Mark asked.</p><p>\u201cHonestly ... I\u2019m still figuring that out. I just know I can\u2019t stay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My marriage could only take so much pressure before it broke, and I had allowed it to slide to a dangerous edge, trying to find some distance. Trying to put myself first.</p><p>Gideon Cross was as deep and vast as the ocean, and I had feared drowning in him from the moment I first saw him. I couldn\u2019t be afraid of that anymore. Not after realizing that what I feared more was losing him.</p><p>By trying to stay neutral, I\u2019d been shoved from side to side. And as pissed off as I\u2019d been about that, I hadn\u2019t taken the time to comprehend that if I wanted control, I just had to take it.</p><p>\u201cBecause of the LanCorp account?\u201d Mark asked.</p> <p>\u201cIn part.\u201d I smoothed my pinstriped pencil skirt, mentally brushing away the lingering resentment over Gideon\u2019s hiring of Mark. The catalyst had been LanCorp coming to Waters Field &amp; Leaman with a specific request for Mark\u2014and therefore me\u2014a maneuver Gideon viewed with suspicion. Geoffrey Cross\u2019s Ponzi scheme had decimated the Landon family fortune, and while both Ryan Landon and Gideon had rebuilt what their fathers had lost, Landon still hungered for revenge. \u201cBut mostly for personal reasons.\u201d</p><p>Straightening, he set his elbows on the desk and leaned toward me. \u201cIt\u2019s none of my business and I won\u2019t pry, but you know Steven, Shawna, and I are all here for you, if you need us. We care about you.\u201d</p><p>His earnestness made my eyes sting with tears. His fianc\u00e9, Steven Ellison, and Steven\u2019s sister, Shawna, had become dear to me in the months I\u2019d been in New York, part of the new network of friends I had built in my new life. No matter what, I didn\u2019t want to lose them.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I smiled through my sorrow. \u201cIf I need you, I\u2019ll call, I promise. But it\u2019s all going to work out for the best. For all of us.\u201d</p><p>Mark relaxed and returned my smile. \u201cSteven\u2019s going to flip. Maybe I should make you tell him.\u201d</p> <p>Thinking of the burly, gregarious contractor chased any sadness away. Steven would give me a hard time for bailing out on his partner, but he\u2019d do it with a good heart. \u201cAw, come on,\u201d I teased back. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do that to me, would you? This is hard enough as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not opposed to making it harder.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. Yeah, I was going to miss Mark and my job. A lot.</p><p>When my first break came around, it was still early in Oceanside, California, so I texted my dad instead of calling.</p><p>Let me know when you\u2019re up, k? Need to tell you something. And since I knew that being a cop as well as a father made Victor Reyes a worrier, I added, Nothing bad, just some news.</p><p>I\u2019d barely set my phone down on the break room counter to get a cup of coffee when it started ringing. My dad\u2019s handsome face lit up the screen, his photo showing off the gray eyes I had inherited from him.</p> <p>I was suddenly struck with a case of nerves. When I reached for my phone, my hand was shaking. I loved both of my parents a lot, but I\u2019d always thought that my dad felt things more deeply than my mother. And while my mother never hesitated to point out the ways I could fix my flaws, my dad didn\u2019t seem to realize I had any. Disappointing him ... hurting him ... it was brutal to think of it.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my question, sweetheart. I\u2019m doing the same as usual. How \u2019bout you? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>I moved over to the nearest table and took a chair to help myself calm down. \u201cI told you it wasn\u2019t bad and you still sound worried. Did I wake you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job to worry,\u201d he said, with warm amusement in his deep voice. \u201cAnd I was gearing up for a run before I head in for the day, so no, you didn\u2019t wake me. Tell me what your news is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh ...\u201d Choked by tears, I swallowed hard. \u201cJesus, this is tougher than I thought it would be. I told Gideon it was Mom I was worried about, that you\u2019d be okay with it, and here I am trying to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cGideon and I eloped.\u201d</p> <p>The line went eerily quiet.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d The scratch in his voice killed me.</p><p>\u201cA couple weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you came to see me?\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Ah, God. Totally brutal. Only weeks ago I\u2019d told him about Nathan\u2019s abuse and that nearly broke him. Now this ...</p><p>\u201cDad\u2014You\u2019re freaking me out. We were on this island and it was beautiful, so beautiful. The resort we were staying at does weddings all the time, they make it easy ... like Las Vegas. There\u2019s a full-time officiant and someone who handles the licenses. It was just a perfect moment, you know. The perfect opportunity.\u201d My voice cracked. \u201cDad ... please say something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI ... I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>A hot tear slid down my face. Mom had chosen wealth over love, and Gideon was a prime example of the type of man my mother had picked instead of my dad. I knew that created a bias my father had to overcome, and now we had this hurdle.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still having a wedding,\u201d I told him. \u201cWe want our friends and family with us when we say our vows ....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was expecting, Eva.\u201d He growled. \u201cDamn it. I feel like Cross just stole something from me! I\u2019m supposed to give you away, I was working up to that, and he just runs off and takes you? And you didn\u2019t tell me? You were here, in my house, and you didn\u2019t say anything to me? It hurts, Eva. It hurts.\u201d</p> <p>There was no way to stop the tears after that. They came in a hot flood, blurring my vision and closing my throat.</p><p>I jolted when the door to the break room opened and Will Granger walked in. \u201cShe\u2019s probably in here,\u201d my colleague said. \u201cAnd there she\u2014\u201d</p><p>His voice trailed off when he saw my face, his eyes losing their smile behind his rectangular glasses.</p><p>A darkly clad arm shot in and brushed him aside.</p><p>Gideon. He filled the doorway, his eyes zeroing in on me and chilling to arctic. He was suddenly like an avenging angel, his fine suit making him look both capable and dangerous, his face hardened into a beautiful mask.</p> <p>I blinked, my brain trying to process how and why he was there. Before it did, he was in front of me and my phone was in his hand, his gaze dropping to the screen before he lifted it to his ear.</p><p>\u201cVictor.\u201d My father\u2019s name came out as a warning. \u201cYou seem to have upset Eva, so you\u2019ll be talking to me now.\u201d</p><p>Will backed out and shut the door.</p><p>Despite the cutting edge to Gideon\u2019s words, the fingertips that brushed my cheek were infinitely gentle. His gaze was focused on me, the blue filled with icy fury that nearly made me shiver.</p><p>Holy fuck, was Gideon angry. And so was my dad. I could hear him shouting from where I sat.</p><p>I caught Gideon\u2019s wrist, shaking my head, suddenly panicked that the two men I loved most would end up disliking\u2014maybe even hating\u2014each other.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed and he mouthed, No, it\u2019s not.</p><p>When he spoke to my father again, Gideon\u2019s voice was firm and controlled\u2014and all the more scary because of it. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a right to be angry, and hurt, I\u2019ll give you that. But I won\u2019t have my wife twisted up over this .... No, obviously without children of my own, I can\u2019t imagine.\u201d</p><p>I strained to hear, hoping that reduction in volume meant my dad was calming down instead of getting more worked up.</p><p>Gideon stiffened suddenly, his hand dropping away from me. \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t be happy about it if my sister eloped. That said, she\u2019s not the one I\u2019d take it out on ....\u201d</p><p>I winced. My husband and my father had that in common: They were both incredibly protective of those they loved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m available anytime, Victor. I\u2019ll even come to you, if that\u2019s what you need. When I married your daughter, I accepted full responsibility for both her and her happiness. If there are consequences to be faced, I have no problem facing them.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed as he listened.</p> <p>Then Gideon took the seat opposite me, set the phone on the table, and turned on the speaker.</p><p>My dad\u2019s voice filled the air. \u201cEva?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep, shaky breath and squeezed the hand Gideon held out to me. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m here, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart ...\u201d He took a deep breath, too. \u201cDon\u2019t be upset, okay? I\u2019m just ... I need to let this sink in. I wasn\u2019t expecting this and ... I\u2019ve got to put it together in my head. Can we talk later tonight? When I get off my shift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He paused.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Daddy.\u201d The sound of my tears came through my voice and Gideon slid his chair closer, his thighs bracketing mine. It was amazing how much strength I drew from him, what a relief it was to have him to lean on. It was different from having Cary\u2019s support. My best friend was a sounding board, cheerleader, and ass kicker. Gideon was a shield.</p><p>And I had to be strong enough to admit when I needed one.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, baby,\u201d my dad said, with an aching note of pain and grief that stabbed me in the heart. \u201cI\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2014\u201d What else could I say? I was at a loss for how to fix things. \u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>Gideon killed the call, then took my trembling hands in his. His eyes were locked on me, the ice melting into tenderness. \u201cYou will not be ashamed, Eva. Is that clear?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>He cupped my face, his thumbs brushing away my tears. \u201cI can\u2019t bear to see you cry, angel.\u201d</p><p>I forced back the lingering heartache, shoving it into a corner where I would deal with it later. \u201cWhy are you here? How did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to thank you for the flowers,\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>\u201cOh. Do you like them?\u201d I managed a smile. \u201cI wanted to make you think of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the time. Every minute.\u201d He caught my hips and tugged me closer.</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve just sent a note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d His ghost of a smile made my pulse skip. \u201cBut that wouldn\u2019t cover this.\u201d</p><p>Gideon pulled me into his lap and kissed me senseless.</p> <p>We still heading home tonight? Cary texted as I waited for the elevator to take me back down to the lobby at noon. My mom was already waiting for me there and I was trying to pull my thoughts together. We had a lot of ground to cover.</p><p>God, I was hoping she could help me deal with it all.</p><p>That\u2019s the plan, I replied to my beloved pain-in-the-ass-sometimes roommate, typing as I stepped into the car. I have an appt. after work, though, then dinner with Gideon. Might be late.</p><p>Dinner? U have to catch me up.</p><p>I smiled. Of course.</p><p>Trey called.</p> <p>I exhaled in a rush, as if I\u2019d been holding my breath. I guess in a way I had been.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t blame Cary\u2019s on-again, off-again boyfriend for taking a big step back when he\u2019d learned that Cary\u2019s booty-call girl was pregnant. Trey had already been struggling with Cary\u2019s bisexuality, and now a baby meant there would always be a third person in their relationship.</p><p>There was no question that Cary should have committed to Trey sooner, instead of keeping his options open, but I understood the fear behind Cary\u2019s actions. I knew all too well the thoughts that ran through your mind when you\u2019d survived the things Cary and I had, yet still somehow found yourself faced with an amazing person who loved you.</p><p>When it was too good to be true, how could it possibly be real?</p><p>I sympathized with Trey, too, and if he called it quits, I\u2019d respect that decision. But he was the best thing to happen to Cary in a long time. I was going to be extremely bummed if they didn\u2019t make it. What did he say?</p><p>I\u2019ll tell u when I see u.</p><p>Cary! That\u2019s cruel.</p><p>It took him until I was walking through the lobby turnstiles to reply. Yeah, tell me about it.</p> <p>My heart sank, because there was no way to interpret that as good news. Stepping aside to allow others to pass me, I typed back, I love you madly, Cary Taylor.</p><p>Love u 2, baby girl.</p><p>\u201cEva!\u201d</p><p>My mother crossed the space between us on delicately heeled sandals, a woman impossible to miss even amid the lunchtime crush of people heading in and out of the Crossfire. As petite as she was, Monica Stanton should\u2019ve been lost in the sea of suits, but she drew too much attention for that to ever happen.</p><p>Charisma. Sensuality. Fragility. It was the bombshell combination that made Marilyn Monroe a star, and it exemplified my mother. Dressed in a navy blue sleeveless jumpsuit, Monica Stanton looked younger than her years and more confident than I knew her to be. The Cartier panthers hugging her throat and wrist told the observant she was expensive.</p><p>She came straight to me and wrapped me in a hug that took me by surprise.</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Pulling back, she studied my face.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Yes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I looked at her warily. \u201cHe didn\u2019t take the news well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t.\u201d As she linked her arm with mine, we headed out. \u201cBut he\u2019s dealing with it. He wasn\u2019t quite ready to let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I remind him of you.\u201d To my father, my mom was the one who got away. He still loved her, even after more than two decades apart.</p><p>\u201cNonsense, Eva. There\u2019s a resemblance, but you\u2019re much more interesting.\u201d</p><p>That startled a laugh from me. \u201cGideon says I\u2019m interesting.\u201d</p><p>She smiled brightly, making the man passing her stumble over his own feet. \u201cOf course. He\u2019s a connoisseur of women. As gorgeous as you are, it would take more than beauty to get him to marry you.\u201d</p><p>Slowing to a halt by the revolving doors, I let my mother go out first. A blast of muggy heat hit me when I joined her on the sidewalk, bringing an instant mist of perspiration to my skin. There were times when I doubted I\u2019d ever get used to the humidity, but I considered it one of the costs of living in the city I loved so much. Spring had been beautiful and I knew fall would be, too. The perfect time of year to renew my vows with the man who owned me heart and soul. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was thanking God for air-conditioning when I spotted Stanton\u2019s head of security waiting by a black car at the curb.</p><p>Benjamin Clancy greeted me with an easy, confident nod. His demeanor was so business-as-usual, while I felt such gratitude for him it was hard to restrain myself from grabbing and kissing him.</p><p>Gideon had killed Nathan to protect me. Clancy had made sure Gideon would never pay for it.</p><p>\u201cHey, you,\u201d I said to him, seeing my smile reflected in his mirrored aviator shades.</p> <p>\u201cEva. It\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking the same about you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t smile outwardly; it wasn\u2019t his way. But I could feel it nonetheless.</p><p>My mom slid in first, and then I joined her in the backseat. Before Clancy even rounded the trunk of the car, she was shifting to face me and reaching for my hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about your father. He\u2019s got that quick Latin temper, but it never lasts long. All he really wants is to make sure you\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed her fingers gently. \u201cI know. But I really, really want Dad and Gideon to get along.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re two very headstrong men, honey. They\u2019re going to clash occasionally.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t wrong. I wanted to dream about the two of them hanging out the way guys did, bonding over sports or cars, with all the playful ribbing and backslapping that usually accompanied that sort of thing. But I had to work with reality, whatever that turned out to be.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I conceded. \u201cThey\u2019re both big boys. They\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d Hopefully.</p><p>\u201cOf course they will.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, I glanced out the window. \u201cI think I\u2019ve come up with a solution for Corinne Giroux.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cEva, you have got to put that woman out of your mind. By giving her any thought at all, you\u2019re giving her power she doesn\u2019t deserve.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe allowed her to become a problem by being so secretive.\u201d I looked back at my mother. \u201cThe world has a tremendous appetite for all things Gideon. He\u2019s gorgeous, rich, sexy, and brilliant. People want to know everything about him, but he\u2019s guarded his privacy to such an extreme degree that they know next to nothing. That\u2019s given Corinne this opening to write her biography about her time with Gideon.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a wary look. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>Digging into my bag, I pulled out a small tablet. \u201cWe need more of this.\u201d</p><p>I flipped the screen around, showing her the image of Gideon and me that had been taken just hours before as we\u2019d stood in front of the Crossfire. The manner in which he gripped me by the nape was both tender and possessive, while the way my face tilted up to him revealed my love and adoration. It made my stomach turn to see such a private moment spread out for the world to ogle, but I had to get over it. I had to give them more.</p><p>\u201cGideon and I need to stop hiding,\u201d I explained. \u201cWe need to be seen. We spend too much time shut in. The public wants the billionaire playboy who\u2019s finally becoming Prince Charming. They want fairy tales, Mom, and happy endings. I need to give people the story they want and by doing so, I\u2019m going to make Corinne and her book look pathetic.\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s shoulders went back. \u201cThat\u2019s a horrible idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s terrible, Eva! You don\u2019t trade hard-earned privacy for anything. If you feed that public hunger, it will just get larger. For God\u2019s sake, you don\u2019t want to become a tabloid fixture!\u201d</p> <p>My jaw set. \u201cIt won\u2019t play out that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you risk it?\u201d Her voice rose and became shrill. \u201cBecause of Corinne Giroux? Her book will come and go in the blink of an eye, but you\u2019ll never get rid of the attention once you invite it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get you. There\u2019s no way to be married to Gideon and not get attention! I might as well take control and set the stage myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between being prominent and being a TMZ headline!\u201d</p><p>I growled inwardly. \u201cI think you\u2019re taking the drama to the extreme.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, this is the wrong way to handle the situation. Have you discussed this with Gideon? I can\u2019t see him agreeing to this.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her, truly startled by her response. I\u2019d thought she would be all for it, considering how she felt about marrying well and what that entailed.</p><p>That was when I saw the fear tightening her mouth and shadowing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d I softened my voice, mentally kicking myself for not putting it together sooner. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to worry about Nathan anymore.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She returned my stare. \u201cNo,\u201d she agreed, not the least bit soothed. \u201cBut having everything you\u2019ve done ... everything you\u2019ve said or decided dissected for the entertainment of the world could be its own nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to allow other people in the world to dictate how I and my marriage are perceived!\u201d I was tired of feeling like a ... victim.

He had once told me I would excel at crisis management. He\u2019d suggested I lend my talents to Cross Industries as a fixer.</p><p>Why not start with something more intimate and important instead?</p><p>2</p><p>\u201cMore flowers?\u201d Arash Madani drawled as he strolled into my office through the open glass double doors.</p> <p>My lead attorney walked over to where Eva\u2019s white roses decorated the main seating area. I\u2019d had them placed on the coffee table in my direct line of sight. There, they had been successfully drawing my attention away from the stock tickers streaming on the wall of flat screens behind them.</p><p>The card that accompanied the flowers sat on the smoked glass of my desk and I fingered it, rereading the words for the hundredth time.</p><p>Arash pulled a rose out and lifted it to his nose. \u201cWhat\u2019s the secret to getting sent some of these?\u201d</p><p>I sat back, absently noting that his emerald-hued tie matched the jeweled decanters decorating the bar. Until his arrival, the brightly colored carafes and Eva\u2019s red vase had been the only spots of color in the monochromatic expanse of my office. \u201cThe right woman.\u201d</p><p>He returned the flower to its vase. \u201cGo ahead, Cross, rub it in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to gloat quietly. Do you have something for me?\u201d</p> <p>Approaching my desk, he grinned in a way that told me he loved his job, although I never doubted it. His predatory instincts were nearly as highly developed as my own.</p><p>\u201cThe Morgan deal is coming together nicely.\u201d Adjusting his tailored slacks, he settled into one of the two chairs facing my desk. His style was slightly flashier than mine but couldn\u2019t be faulted. \u201cWe\u2019ve ironed out the bigger points. Still finessing some clauses, but we should be ready to proceed by next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a man of few words.\u201d Casually, he asked, \u201cYou up for getting together this weekend?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cEva may want to go out. If so, I\u2019ll try to talk her out of it.\u201d</p><p>Arash laughed. \u201cI gotta tell you, I expected you to settle down at some point\u2014we all do, eventually\u2014but I thought I\u2019d have some warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I.\u201d Which wasn\u2019t quite the truth. I never expected to share my life with anyone. I\u2019d never denied that my past shadowed my present, but I saw no need to share that history with anyone before Eva. It couldn\u2019t be changed, so why rehash it?</p><p>Standing, I walked to one of the two floor-to-ceiling walls of windows framing my office and took in the urban splendor sprawling beyond the glass.</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t known Eva was out there, had been afraid to even dream of finding the one person in the world who would accept and love every facet of me.</p><p>How was it possible that I\u2019d found her here, in Manhattan, at the very building I\u2019d had built against sound advice and at great risk? Too expensive, they\u2019d said, and unnecessary. But I\u2019d needed the Cross name to be memorable and mentioned in a different way. My father had dragged our name through the mud; I\u2019d lifted it to the heights of the most relevant city in the world.</p><p>\u201cYou showed no sign at all you were leaning that way,\u201d Arash said behind me. \u201cIf I remember correctly, you tagged two women when we blew out Cinco de Mayo, and a few weeks later you\u2019re telling me to draft an insane prenup.\u201d</p><p>I surveyed the city, taking a rare moment to appreciate the hawk\u2019s-eye view afforded me by the height and position of my office in the Crossfire Building. \u201cWhen have you known me to delay sealing a deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to expand your portfolio, another to reboot your life overnight.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cSo what are your plans, then? Breaking in the new beach house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent idea.\u201d Taking my wife back to the Outer Banks was my goal. Having her all to myself had been heaven. I was happiest when I was alone with her. She revitalized me, made me anticipate living in a way I never had before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019d built my empire with the past in mind. Now, thanks to her, I would continue to build it for our future.</p><p>My desk phone flashed. It was Scott, on line one. I pressed the button, and his voice came through the speaker. \u201cCorinne Giroux\u2019s at reception. She says she needs just a few minutes to drop off something for you. Because it\u2019s private, she wants to give it to you personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she does,\u201d Arash chimed in. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s more flowers.\u201d</p><p>I shot him a look. \u201cWrong woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf only my wrong women looked like Corinne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep thinking that while you head up to reception to get whatever it is she has.\u201d</p><p>His brows shot up. \u201cReally? Ouch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants to talk, she can talk to my attorney.\u201d</p><p>He pushed to his feet and headed out. \u201cGot it, boss.\u201d</p> <p>I glanced at the clock. Quarter to five. \u201cI\u2019m sure you heard that, Scott, but to be clear, Madani will handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Cross.\u201d</p><p>Through the glass wall separating my office from the rest of the floor, I watched Arash round the corner on his way to reception, and then I mentally brushed the whole thing aside. Eva would be with me shortly, the very thing I\u2019d been waiting for since the workday started.</p><p>But of course, it couldn\u2019t be that easy.</p><p>A flash of crimson in the corner of my eye just a few moments later had me looking back out at the work floor and seeing Corinne marching toward my office with Arash hot on her heels. Her chin lifted when our eyes met. Her tight smile widened, transforming her from a beautiful woman to a stunning one. I could admire her the way I would admire anything except Eva\u2014objectively, dispassionately.</p><p>Now happily married, I could fully grasp what a horrible mistake it would have been to marry Corinne. It was unfortunate for all of us that she refused to see it.</p> <p>I stood and rounded my desk. The look I swept over both Arash and Scott called them off from any further action. If Corinne wanted to deal with me directly, I\u2019d give her one last opportunity to do the right thing.</p><p>She glided into my office on red stilettos. The strapless dress she wore was the same hue as the shoes and showed off both her long legs and pale skin. She wore her hair down, the black strands sliding around her bare shoulders. She was the polar opposite of my wife and a mirror image of every other woman who\u2019d passed through my life.</p><p>\u201cGideon. Surely you can spare a few minutes for an old friend?\u201d</p><p>Leaning back into my desk, I crossed my arms. \u201cAnd extend the courtesy of not calling security. Make it quick, Corinne.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, but her eyes, the color of aquamarines, were sad.</p><p>She had a small red box tucked under her arm. When she reached me, Corinne offered it to me.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d I asked, without reaching for it.</p><p>\u201cThese are the photos that will appear in the book.\u201d</p> <p>My brow arched. I found myself unfolding and accepting the box, driven by curiosity. It hadn\u2019t been too long ago that we\u2019d been together, but I scarcely remembered the details. What I had were impressions, big moments, and regret. I\u2019d been so young, with a dangerous lack of self-awareness.</p><p>Corinne set her purse on my desk, moving in a way that brushed her arm against mine. Wary, I reached over and hit the button that controlled the opacity of the glass wall.</p><p>If she wanted to put on a show, I\u2019d make sure she didn\u2019t have an audience.</p><p>Taking the lid off the box, I was confronted with a photo of Corinne and me entangled in front of a bonfire. Her head was nestled in the crook of my shoulder, her face tilted up so I could press a kiss to her lips.</p><p>The memory assailed me immediately. We\u2019d taken a day trip to a friend\u2019s house in the Hamptons. The weather had been cool, fall giving way to winter.</p><p>In the picture we looked happy and in love, and in a way, I suppose we were. But I\u2019d refused the invitation to spend the night, despite Corinne\u2019s obvious disappointment. With my nightmares, I couldn\u2019t sleep beside her. And I couldn\u2019t fuck her, though I knew that was what she wanted, because the hotel room I reserved for that purpose was miles away.</p><p>So many hangups. So many lies and evasions.</p><p>I took a deep breath and let the past go. \u201cEva and I were married last month.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened.</p><p>Setting the box down on the desktop, I reached for my smartphone and showed her the picture wallpapering my screen\u2014Eva and I sharing the kiss that sealed our vows.</p><p>Turning her head, Corinne looked away. Then she reached into the box, flipping through the top few photos to pull out one of us at the beach.</p><p>I was standing waist deep in the surf. Corinne was twined around me from the front, her legs wrapped around my waist, her arms draped over my shoulders and her hands in my hair. Her head was tossed back on a laugh, her joy radiating from the image. I gripped her fiercely, my face upturned to watch her. There was gratitude there and wonder. Affection. Desire. Strangers would see it and think it was love. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which was Corinne\u2019s goal. I denied that I ever loved anyone before Eva, which was no less than the truth. Corinne was determined to prove me wrong in the most public way possible.</p><p>Leaning over, she looked at the picture, then at me. Her expectation was tangible, as if some monumental epiphany was supposed to strike me. She toyed with her necklace and I realized it was one I\u2019d given her, a small gold heart on a simple chain.</p><p>For fuck\u2019s sake. I didn\u2019t even remember who took the damn photo or where we were at the time, and it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you expect these photos to prove, Corinne? We dated. We ended. You married, and now I have. There\u2019s nothing left.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why are you getting so upset? You\u2019re not indifferent, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m irritated. These only make me appreciate what I have with Eva more. And knowing that they\u2019ll hurt her sure as hell doesn\u2019t make me feel sentimental about the past. This is our final good-bye, Corinne.\u201d I held her gaze, making sure she saw my resolve. \u201cIf you come back here, security won\u2019t let you through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be back. You\u2019ll have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Scott beeped through and I picked up the phone. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Tramell is here for you.\u201d</p> <p>I leaned over the desk again, tapping the button that opened the doors. A moment later, Eva walked in.</p><p>Would the day ever come when I would see her and not feel the earth shift beneath my feet?</p><p>She came to an abrupt halt, giving me the pleasure of taking in the sight of her. Eva was a natural blonde, with pale streaks framing a delicate face and accentuating stormy gray eyes that I could spend hours looking into\u2014and had. She was petite but dangerously curved, her body deliciously soft to roll around with in bed.</p><p>I might\u2019ve called her angelically beautiful, if not for the lush sensuality that always made me think of and crave wickedly raw sex.</p><p>Without volition, my mind filled with the memory of her scent and the feel of her beneath my hands. The throaty laugh that brought me joy and the fiery quick temper that rocked me on my feet were visceral recollections. Everything in me thrummed to life, a surge of energy and awareness I felt at no other time than when I was with her.</p><p>Corinne spoke first. \u201cHello, Eva.\u201d</p> <p>I bristled. The urge to shield and protect the most valuable thing in my life overrode any other consideration.</p><p>Straightening, I tossed the photo back in the box and went to my wife. Compared to Corinne, she was dressed demurely in a black pinstriped skirt and a sleeveless silk blouse that gleamed like a pearl. The surge of heat I felt was all the proof I needed as to which woman was sexier.</p><p>Eva. Now and forever.</p><p>The pull I felt drew me across the room in long, quick strides.</p><p>Angel.</p><p>I didn\u2019t say the word aloud, didn\u2019t want Corinne to hear it. But I could see that Eva felt it. I reached for her hand, felt a tingle of deep recognition that tightened my grip.</p><p>She shifted to look past me and acknowledge the woman who was no rival. \u201cCorinne.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t turn to look.</p> <p>\u201cI have to run,\u201d Corinne said behind me. \u201cThose copies are for you, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>Unable to take my gaze off Eva, I spoke over my shoulder. \u201cTake them with you. I don\u2019t want them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should finish going through them,\u201d she countered, approaching.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Aggravated, I glanced at Corinne when she stopped next to us. \u201cIf I have any interest in seeing them, I can always flip through your book.\u201d</p><p>Her smile tightened. \u201cGood-bye, Eva. Gideon.\u201d</p><p>As she left, I took another step toward my wife, closing the final bit of distance between us. I caught her other hand, leaning over her to breathe in the scent of her perfume. Calm drifted through me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came.\u201d I whispered the words against her forehead, needing every connection I could manage. \u201cI miss you so much.\u201d</p><p>Closing her eyes, she leaned into me with a sigh.</p><p>Feeling the lingering strain in her, I tightened my grip on her hands. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m good. I just wasn\u2019t expecting to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither was I.\u201d As much as I hated to pull away, I hated the thought of those photos even more.</p><p>Returning to my desk, I put the lid back on the box and tossed the whole thing into the trash.</p><p>\u201cI quit my job,\u201d she said. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s my last day.\u201d</p><p>That decision was one I\u2019d wanted her to come to. I believed it was the best and safest step for her to take. But I knew what a difficult conclusion it must have been for her to make. Eva loved her job and the people she worked with. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Knowing how well she could read me, I kept my tone neutral. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>I studied her. \u201cWhat\u2019s next for you, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a wedding to plan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh.\u201d My mouth curved. After days of fearing she had second thoughts and wanted out of our marriage, it was a relief to hear otherwise. \u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>I beckoned her closer with a crook of my finger.</p><p>\u201cMeet me halfway,\u201d she shot back, with a glint of challenge in her eyes.</p><p>How could I resist? We met in the middle of the room.</p><p>That was why we were going to get past this and every other hurdle we faced: We would always meet each other halfway.</p> <p>She wouldn\u2019t ever be the docile wife my friend Arnoldo Ricci had wished for me. Eva was too independent, too fierce. She had a jealous streak a mile wide. She was demanding and stubborn, and she defied me just to drive me crazy.</p><p>And that friction worked in a way it never could have with any other woman, because Eva was meant for me. I believed that as I believed in nothing else.</p><p>\u201cIs this what you want?\u201d I asked her quietly, searching her face for the answer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re what I want. The rest is just logistics.\u201d</p><p>My mouth was suddenly dry and my heartbeat too quick. When she lifted a hand to brush my hair back I caught her wrist and pressed her palm to my cheek, my eyes closing as I absorbed her touch.</p><p>The past week melted away. The days we\u2019d spent apart, the hours of silence, the crippling fear ... She\u2019d been showing me all day that she was ready to move ahead, that I\u2019d made the right decision to talk to Dr. Petersen. To talk to her.</p> <p>Not only didn\u2019t she turn away, she wanted me more. And she called me miraculous?</p><p>Eva sighed. I felt the last of her tension drift away. We stood there, reconnecting with each other, taking the strength we needed. It shook me to the core to know that I could bring her some measure of peace.</p><p>And what had she brought me?</p><p>Everything.</p><p>The way Angus\u2019s face brightened when Eva exited the Crossfire Building moved me in ways I could never explain. Angus McLeod was quiet by nature and by training. He rarely showed any emotion at all, but he made an exception for Eva.</p><p>Or maybe he couldn\u2019t help himself. God knew I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAngus.\u201d Eva flashed him her bright, open smile. \u201cYou\u2019re looking especially dapper today.\u201d</p><p>I watched as the man I loved like a father touched the brim of his chauffeur\u2019s hat and smiled back with an amusing touch of embarrassment.</p> <p>After my dad\u2019s suicide, my entire life was upended. In the messy years that followed, the one point of stability had been Angus, a man hired to be a driver and bodyguard but who turned out to be a lifeline instead. At a time when I felt isolated and betrayed, when even my own mother refused to believe I\u2019d been repeatedly raped by the therapist who was supposed to help me adjust, Angus had been the one to anchor me. He never doubted me. And when I struck out on my own, he\u2019d come with me.</p><p>As my wife\u2019s sleek, toned legs slid out of view into the backseat of the Bentley, Angus spoke. \u201cLet\u2019s not muck it up this time, lad.\u201d</p><p>My mouth twisted ruefully. \u201cThanks for the vote of confidence.\u201d</p><p>I joined Eva, settling in as Angus rounded the car to reach the driver\u2019s seat. I set my hand on her thigh and waited for her to look at me. \u201cI want to take you to the beach house this weekend.\u201d</p><p>She held her breath a moment, then released it in a rush. \u201cMy mom invited us up to Westport. Stanton\u2019s asked his nephew, Martin, to come, and Martin\u2019s girlfriend, Lacey\u2014she\u2019s Megumi\u2019s roommate, I don\u2019t know if you remember .... Cary will be there, too, of course. Anyway, I said we\u2019d come.\u201d</p><p>Wrestling with disappointment, I considered my options.</p><p>\u201cI want us to do some family things,\u201d she went on. \u201cPlus, my mom wants to talk about this plan I have.\u201d</p><p>I listened as she related her lunchtime conversation with Monica.</p><p>Eva studied my face as she finished. \u201cShe said you wouldn\u2019t like the idea, but you\u2019ve used the paparazzi before, when you dipped me on the sidewalk and kissed me until I couldn\u2019t think straight. You wanted that picture out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but the opportunity presented itself, I didn\u2019t seek it out. Your mother\u2019s right\u2014there is a difference.\u201d</p><p>Her lower lip curved downward, and I revised my strategy. I wanted her involved and actively participating. That meant encouragement and acknowledgment, not roadblocks. \u201cBut you\u2019re also right, angel. If there\u2019s an audience for Corinne\u2019s book, there\u2019s a market void that needs to be filled and we should address that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The smile she beamed at me was its own reward.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking we could ask Cary to take some candid photos of us this weekend,\u201d she said. \u201cSome moments that are more personal and casual than red carpet photo ops.

You can\u2019t ask me to keep my hands off you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twitched. \u201cYou can\u2019t say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say no,\u201d I countered, my heart beginning to pound. My palms grew damp, a low-grade panic beginning to set in. It was irrational, infuriating. \u201cYou want me as much as I want you.\u201d</p><p>She touched my face. \u201cI sometimes think I want you more, and I\u2019m okay with that. But Dr. Petersen\u2019s right. We moved so fast and we\u2019ve been hitting all the speed bumps at a hundred miles per hour. I feel like we have this little window of time when we can slow down. Just for a few weeks, until the wedding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA few weeks? Christ, Eva.\u201d I pulled away, running my hand through my hair. Turning my head, I looked out the window. My mind was racing. What did this mean? Why would she ask?</p><p>How the fuck was I going to talk her out of it?</p><p>I felt her slide closer, then curl up against me.</p><p>Her voice lowered to a whisper. \u201cWeren\u2019t you the one who brought up the benefits of delayed gratification?\u201d</p><p>I shot her a look. \u201cAnd how well did that turn out?\u201d</p><p>That night was one of the bigger mistakes I\u2019d made in our relationship. The evening started out so strong, and then Corinne\u2019s unexpected appearance threw everything off, spurring one of the worst arguments Eva and I ever had\u2014an argument made more volatile by the seething sexual tension I\u2019d deliberately stoked and held off on satisfying.</p><p>\u201cWe were different people then.\u201d Eva drew back, her gray eyes clear as they held mine. \u201cYou\u2019re not the same man who ignored me at that dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ignore you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not the same woman,\u201d she pushed on. \u201cYes, seeing Corinne today made me a little twitchy, but I know she\u2019s not a threat. I know you\u2019re committed .... We\u2019re committed. That\u2019s why we can do this.\u201d</p><p>The spread of my legs widened as I stretched out. \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either. But I think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d Her mouth softened with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s old-fashioned and romantic to wait \u2019til the wedding night. Think how hot the sex will be when we do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva, we don\u2019t need our sex life to be any hotter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need it to be something we do for fun, not because we\u2019re counting on it to hold us together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s both, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d She might as well have asked me not to eat, which I would\u2019ve been more inclined to agree to, given the choice.</p><p>\u201cGideon ... we have something amazing together. It\u2019s worth the effort to make us rock solid in every way.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. It pissed me off that I was feeling anxious. It was a loss of control and I couldn\u2019t have that with her. It wasn\u2019t what she needed.</p><p>Leaning forward, I put my lips to her ear. \u201cAngel, if you\u2019re not missing the feel of my cock inside you, I need to step it up, not hold back.\u201d</p><p>Her shiver made me smile inwardly. Still, she whispered, \u201cPlease try. For me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuck.\u201d I dropped back into my seat.

And it\u2019s such a short time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva, five minutes would be a short amount of time. You\u2019re talking weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby ...\u201d She laughed softly. \u201cYou\u2019re pouting. It\u2019s so adorable.\u201d Leaning forward, she pressed her lips to my cheek. \u201cAnd really flattering. Thank you.\u201d</p> <p>My gaze narrowed. \u201cI\u2019m not agreeing to make this easy for you.\u201d</p><p>She trailed her fingers down my tie. \u201cOf course not. We\u2019ll try to make it fun. A challenge. See who breaks first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d I muttered. \u201cI\u2019ve got no fucking incentive to win this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about me? Wrapped up in a bow\u2014and nothing else\u2014as your birthday present?\u201d</p><p>I scowled. Nothing was capable of making this more palatable. Even the thought of her bursting out of a cake naked couldn\u2019t make this better. \u201cWhat does my birthday have to do with anything?\u201d</p> <p>Eva dazzled me with her smile, which only made me want her more. She was sunlight and warmth at any time, but when she was beneath me, writhing in pleasure and moaning for harder ... deeper ...</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when we\u2019re getting married.\u201d</p><p>It took a second for that to sink into my lust-addled brain. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t either, until today. On my last break, I went online, trying to see if there was anything happening in September or October that I should consider when setting a date. Since we\u2019re getting married on the beach, we don\u2019t want it to be too cold, so we\u2019ve got to get it done this month or next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God for winter,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cFiend. Anyway ... I got a Google alert about you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re still doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and there was a post about us on this fan site. There was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFan site?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. There are whole sites and blogs dedicated to you. What you\u2019re wearing, who you\u2019re dating, events you\u2019re attending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one I went to had all your stats: height, weight, eye color, birth date ... everything. To be honest, it freaked me out a little that some total stranger knew other details about you that I don\u2019t, which is another reason why I think we need to date each other and talk more\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can recite stats while we\u2019re fucking. Problem solved.\u201d</p><p>Her grin was delighted. \u201cYou slay me. Anyway, having the wedding on your birthday is a good idea, don\u2019t you think? You\u2019ll never forget our anniversary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur wedding anniversary is August eleventh,\u201d I reminded her dryly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have two to celebrate.\u201d She ran her hand through my hair, tripping my pulse. \u201cOr better yet, we\u2019ll celebrate straight through from one to the other.\u201d</p><p>August 11 through September 22\u2014a full month and a half. The thought of that was almost enough to make the next few weeks bearable.</p><p>\u201cEva. Gideon.\u201d Dr. Lyle Petersen stood and smiled as we walked into his office. He was a tall man, and his gaze lowered a noticeable distance to take in our linked hands. \u201cYou\u2019re both looking well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel good,\u201d Eva said, sounding strong and sure.</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything, extending my hand to shake his.</p><p>The good doctor knew things about me I\u2019d hoped never to share with anyone. Because of that, I wasn\u2019t entirely comfortable with him, despite the soothing blend of neutral colors and comfortable furniture that made up his office. Dr. Petersen himself was a comfortable man, easy in his own skin. His neatly groomed gray hair did much to soften his appearance but couldn\u2019t distract from how incisive and perceptive he was.</p><p>It was hard to rely on someone who knew so much my vulnerabilities, but I dealt with it as best I could because I had no other choice\u2014Dr. Petersen was a pivotal player in my marriage.</p><p>Eva and I took seats on the sofa, while Dr. Petersen settled into his usual wingback chair. He left his tablet and stylus sitting on the arm and studied us with dark blue eyes that were sharp with intelligence.</p><p>\u201cGideon,\u201d he began, \u201ctell me what\u2019s happened since I saw you on Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>I settled back and got to the point. \u201cEva\u2019s decided to follow your recommendation to abstain from sex until we marry publicly.\u201d</p><p>Eva\u2019s low, husky laugh broke out. She leaned into me, hugging my arm. \u201cDid you catch the note of accusation?\u201d she asked the doctor. \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault he\u2019s not going to get any for a couple weeks.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than two weeks,\u201d I argued.</p><p>\u201cBut less than three,\u201d she shot back. She smiled at Dr. Petersen. \u201cI should\u2019ve known he\u2019d bring that up first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you start with, Eva?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGideon told me the details about his nightmare last night.\u201d She glanced at me. \u201cThat was huge. It\u2019s a really big turning point for us.\u201d</p> <p>There was no mistaking the love in her eyes when she spoke, or the gratitude and hope. It tightened my throat to see it. Talking to her about the fucked-up shit in my head was the hardest thing I\u2019d ever had to do\u2014even telling Dr. Petersen about Hugh had been easier\u2014but it was all worth it just to see that look on her face.</p><p>The ugliest things about each other brought us closer. It was crazy and it was wonderful. I pulled her hand into my lap, cupping it with both of mine. I felt the same love, gratitude, and hope that she did.</p><p>Dr. Petersen picked up his tablet. \u201cQuite a few revelations for you this week, Gideon. What brought them on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva stopped seeing you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd speaking to me.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Eva. \u201cWas that because Gideon hired your boss away from the agency you work for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the catalyst,\u201d she agreed, \u201cbut we\u2019d been building up to a breaking point. Something had to give. We couldn\u2019t keep going in circles, having the same arguments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you withdrew. That could be considered emotional blackmail. Was that your intent?\u201d</p><p>Her lips pursed as she weighed that. \u201cI\u2019d call it desperation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause Gideon was ... drawing lines to define our relationship. And I couldn\u2019t imagine living within those lines for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Petersen made some notes. \u201cGideon, what do you think about how Eva handled this situation?\u201d</p><p>It took me a minute to answer. \u201cIt felt like a goddamned time warp, but a hundred times worse.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me. \u201cI remember when you first came to see me, you and Eva hadn\u2019t spoken for a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cut me off,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cShe walked out,\u201d I countered.</p><p>Again, it had been a night when we\u2019d really opened up to each other. She told me about Nathan\u2019s assaults, let me see the source of what had unconsciously drawn us together. Then I\u2019d had a nightmare about my own abuse and she pushed me to talk about it.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t and she left me.</p> <p>Eva bristled. \u201cHe broke it off with me via interoffice memo! Who does that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t break it off,\u201d I corrected. \u201cI challenged you to come back. You walk away when things don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s emotional blackmail.\u201d She released my hand and shifted to face me. \u201cYou cut me off for the express purpose of making me accept your status quo. I don\u2019t like the way things are? Well, then, you\u2019ll shut me out until I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you just do that to me?\u201d My jaw clenched. \u201cAnd you seem to take it just fine. If I don\u2019t change, you don\u2019t budge.\u201d</p><p>And that killed me. She\u2019d proven so many times that she could leave and not look back, while I couldn\u2019t breathe without her. That was a fundamental imbalance in our relationship, which gave her the upper hand in everything.</p><p>\u201cYou sound resentful, Gideon,\u201d Dr. Petersen interjected.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t?\u201d Eva crossed her arms.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s not resentment. It\u2019s ... frustration. I can\u2019t walk away, but she can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair! And it\u2019s not true. The only leverage I\u2019ve got is to make you miss me. I try talking it out with you, but in the end, you do what you want. You don\u2019t tell me things, don\u2019t consult me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you are, but I had to pull away to make you do it. Be honest, Gideon, I came along and you realized you had a void in your life that I could fill, and you wanted to put me there and leave the rest of your life as it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I wanted was for you to let us\u2014be us. Just enjoy each other for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy right to decide, to say yes or no, is fucking important to me! You\u2019ve got no business taking that away from me or getting pissed when I don\u2019t like it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Reality check. It felt like I\u2019d taken a punch to the gut. Considering her history, to have her feel\u2014for even a moment\u2014that I\u2019d taken her choices away was a brutal blow. \u201cEva ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I knew what she needed, had recognized it from the first. I\u2019d given her a safeword that I respected at all times, in public or private. She said the word and I stopped. I reminded her often, made sure she always knew that the choice to cease or continue rested entirely with her.</p><p>But I\u2019d failed to make the connection when it came to her job. It was inexcusable.</p><p>I turned toward her. \u201cAngel, I didn\u2019t mean to make you feel powerless. I would never. Ever. I didn\u2019t think of it that way. I\u2019m ... I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The words weren\u2019t enough; they never were. I wanted to be her fresh start, her new beginning. How could I be when I was acting like the assholes in her past?</p> <p>She looked at me with those eyes that saw everything I\u2019d rather keep hidden. For once, I was grateful that she could.</p><p>Her combative posture relaxed. Her gaze softened with love. \u201cMaybe I haven\u2019t been explaining myself well.\u201d</p><p>I sat there, unable to express what was churning through my mind. When we talked about being a team and sharing our burdens, I hadn\u2019t related it to her needing the power to agree or disagree. I thought I could shield her from the troubles we faced and make things smoother for her. Eva deserved that.</p><p>She poked my shoulder. \u201cDidn\u2019t it feel good, even a little bit, to talk to me about your dream last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I exhaled harshly. \u201cI just know you\u2019re happy with me because I did. If that\u2019s what it takes ... then that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p> <p>She sank back into the sofa cushions, her lips trembling. She looked at Dr. Petersen. \u201cAnd now I feel guilty.\u201d</p><p>Silence. I didn\u2019t know what to say. Dr. Petersen just waited with that maddening patience.</p><p>Eva took a deep, shaky breath. \u201cI was thinking if he\u2019d just try it my way, he\u2019d see how much better it could be between us. But if I\u2019m just pushing him into a corner ... if I\u2019m just blackmailing him ...\u201d A tear slid down her face, cutting into me like a blade. \u201cMaybe we have different ideas about what our marriage should be. What if that\u2019s not going to change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d I put my arm around her and pulled her closer, grateful when she leaned into me and put her head on my shoulder. Not surrender. More like a momentary truce. Good enough.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an important question,\u201d Dr. Petersen said. \u201cSo let\u2019s explore it. What if the level of disclosure you want from Gideon isn\u2019t something he will ever feel comfortable with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She swiped at her tears. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that leaves us.\u201d</p> <p>All the hope she\u2019d had when we entered the room was gone. Stroking her hair, I tried to come up with something to say that would take things back to the way they\u2019d been when we arrived.</p><p>Lost, I told her, \u201cYou quit your job for me, even though you didn\u2019t want to. I told you about my dream, even though I didn\u2019t want to. Isn\u2019t that how this works? We both compromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left your job, Eva?\u201d Dr. Petersen asked. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She curled into my side. \u201cIt was starting to cause more trouble than it was worth. Besides, Gideon\u2019s right\u2014he gave a little, so it seems only fair to give a little, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say what either of you compromised was \u2018little.\u2019 And both of you chose to open our session with other things first, which suggests neither of you are completely comfortable with the sacrifice.\u201d He sat back, setting his tablet in his lap. \u201cHave either of you asked yourselves why you\u2019re in such a hurry?\u201d</p><p>We both looked at him.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re both frowning, so I\u2019ll take that as a no. As a couple, you have a lot of strengths. You may not be sharing everything, but you\u2019re communicating and you\u2019re doing so productively. There\u2019s some anger and frustration, but you\u2019re expressing them and validating each other\u2019s feelings.\u201d</p><p>Eva straightened. \u201cBut ...?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re also both pushing personal agendas and manipulating each other to make them happen. My concern is that they\u2019re issues and changes that would naturally present themselves and be resolved in time, but neither of you wants to wait. You\u2019re both driving your relationship forward on an accelerated schedule. It\u2019s only been three months since you two met for the first time. At this point, most couples are deciding to date exclusively, but you two have been married for nearly a month.\u201d</p><p>I felt my shoulders going back. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point in delaying the inevitable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s inevitable,\u201d he responded, his eyes kind, \u201cwhy rush it? But that\u2019s not my point. You\u2019re both jeopardizing your marriage by forcing each other to act before you\u2019re ready. You each have ways of coping with adverse situations. Gideon, you disassociate, as you\u2019ve done with your family. Eva, you blame yourself for why the relationship isn\u2019t working and start subverting your own needs, as you\u2019ve demonstrated with your previous self-destructive romantic relationships. If you continue to maneuver each other into situations where you feel threatened, you will eventually trigger one of these self-defense mechanisms.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As my pulse began to race, I felt Eva stiffen. She\u2019d said as much to me before, but I knew hearing it from a shrink would validate that worry for her. I pulled her closer, breathing her in to calm myself. The hatred I felt for Hugh and Nathan in that moment was vicious. They were both dead and buried, but they were still fucking up our lives.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let them win,\u201d Eva whispered.</p><p>I pressed a kiss to the top of her head, fiercely grateful for her. Her thoughts were like mine and that filled me with a sense of wonder.</p><p>Her head tilted back, her fingertips drifting along my jaw, her gray eyes soft and tender. \u201cI can\u2019t hold out against you, you know. It hurts too much to stay away. Just because you cross the battle lines first doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m less invested. It just means I\u2019m more stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s not,\u201d she said simply. \u201cWe started something new today\u2014you talking, me quitting. Let\u2019s stick with it for a while and see where it takes us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d originally planned to take Eva someplace quiet and tucked away for dinner, but I changed the venue to the Crosby Street Hotel instead. The restaurant was popular and the hotel was known to often have paparazzi nearby. I wasn\u2019t prepared to go to any extremes, but as we\u2019d discussed with Dr. Petersen, I was open to meeting her halfway. We would find our middle ground.</p><p>\u201cHow pretty,\u201d she said, as we followed the hostess to our seats, her gaze taking in the pale blue walls and subdued pendant lighting.</p><p>When we reached our table, I scanned the space as I pulled the chair out for her. She was attracting attention, as she always did. Eva was a stunner by any measure, but her sex appeal was something you had to witness firsthand. It was there in the way she moved, the way she carried herself, in the curve of her smile.</p><p>And she was mine. The glance I spared the other diners made that patently clear.</p><p>I took the seat opposite her, admiring the way the light of the candle on the table gilded her golden skin and hair. The gloss on her lips invited long, deep kisses, as did the look in her eyes. No one had ever looked at me the way she did, with total acceptance and understanding blended in with the love and desire.</p><p>I could tell her anything and she would believe me. Such a simple gift, but so rare and precious. Only my silence could push her away, never the truth.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d I took her hand. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you again, and then I\u2019ll let it go. Are you sure you want to quit your job? You won\u2019t hold it against me twenty years from now? There\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t fix or undo, if you just say the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty years from now, you might be working for me, ace.\u201d Her husky laugh floated through the air and stirred my hunger for her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, okay? It was actually kind of a relief. I\u2019ve got a lot on my plate: packing, moving, planning. When that\u2019s all behind us, I\u2019ll figure out what\u2019s next.\u201d</p><p>I knew her well. If she\u2019d had doubts, I would have sensed them. What I picked up on instead was something different. Something new.</p><p>There was a fire inside her.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off her, even as I ordered wine.</p><p>After the server walked away, I lounged back, enjoying the simple pleasure of staring at my gorgeous wife.</p><p>Eva wet her lips with a teasing swipe of her tongue and leaned forward. \u201cYou are so insanely hot.\u201d</p><p>My mouth quirked. \u201cAm I now?\u201d</p><p>Her calf rubbed mine. \u201cYou are\u2014by far\u2014the hottest man in the room, which makes this really fun. I like showing you off.\u201d</p><p>I gave an exaggerated sigh. \u201cYou still just want me for my body.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTotally. Who cares about your billions? You\u2019ve got better assets.\u201d</p><p>I trapped her wandering leg between my ankles. \u201cLike my wife. She\u2019s the most valuable thing I own.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose with amusement. \u201cOwn, huh?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the server when he returned with our bottle. As he poured, Eva\u2019s foot drifted up to tease me, her eyes heavy-lidded and hot. I pushed the glass toward her, watched her swirl the dark red wine, lift the glass to her nose, then take a swallow. The hum of pleasure she made as she approved my choice sent a surge of heat through me, which was certainly her intent. The slow stroking along my leg was maddening. I grew harder by the minute, already more than primed by days of deprivation.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t known sex could quench a deeper thirst, until Eva.</p><p>Taking a sip out of my freshly poured glass, I waited until the server walked away. \u201cHave you changed your mind about waiting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just keeping things interesting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTwo can play,\u201d I warned.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m counting on.\u201d</p><p>3</p><p>\u201cWhere will you go from here?\u201d I asked Gideon as he escorted me into the lobby of my apartment building. The Upper West Side was my home\u2014for now. Gideon\u2019s penthouse was on the Upper East. The vast green expanse of Central Park divided us, one of the few things between us that was easily crossed.</p> <p>I waved at Chad, one of the night staff at the front desk. He smiled back at me and gave a polite nod to Gideon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going up with you,\u201d Gideon replied, his hand pressed lightly against the small of my back.</p><p>I was hyperaware of that touch. It conveyed possession and control effortlessly, and made me so hot. Which only made it harder for me to deny us both when we reached the elevator. \u201cWe need to say good-bye right here, ace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the willpower,\u201d I confessed, feeling the pull of his need. He\u2019d always been able to lure me in just by the force of his will. It was one of the things I loved about him, one of the ways I knew we were meant to be. The connection we had, it was soul-deep. \u201cYou and me with a bed nearby is a bad idea.\u201d</p> <p>He stared down at me with a wry curve to his lips that was sexy as hell. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m counting on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount down instead\u2014to our wedding. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. Minute by minute.\u201d And it was excruciating. My physical connection to Gideon was as vital to me as our emotional one. I loved him. Loved touching him, soothing him, giving him what he needed ... My right to do so meant everything to me.</p><p>I gripped his forearm, gently squeezing the rock-hard muscle beneath his sleeves. \u201cI\u2019m missing you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to miss me.\u201d</p><p>Pulling him aside, I lowered my voice. \u201cYou say when, you say how,\u201d I murmured, repeating the basic tenet of our sex life. \u201cAnd part of me really wants you to say when right now. But there\u2019s something I want more than that. I\u2019ll call you later tonight, after I talk to Cary a bit, and tell you what that is.\u201d</p><p>The smile faded. His gaze turned avid. \u201cYou can just come next door and tell me now.\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head. When Nathan had been a threat, Gideon had taken up residence in the apartment directly beside mine, watching over me and ensuring I was safe, even though I didn\u2019t know it. He could do that sort of thing because he owned the building, one of many that belonged to him in the city.</p><p>\u201cYou need to go to the penthouse, Gideon. Just relax and enjoy that beautiful place we\u2019ll be sharing soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same without you there. It feels empty.\u201d</p><p>That hit me hard. Before I\u2019d come along, Gideon had structured his life so he could be alone in every way\u2014work interspersed with occasional hookups and avoidance of his family. I\u2019d changed that, and I didn\u2019t want him to regret it.</p><p>\u201cNow\u2019s your chance to get rid of all the things you don\u2019t want me to find when I move in,\u201d I teased, still trying to keep things light.</p><p>\u201cYou know all my secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, we\u2019ll be together in Westport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow\u2019s too far away.\u201d</p> <p>Pushing up onto my tiptoes, I kissed his jaw. \u201cYou\u2019ll sleep through some of it and work through the rest.\u201d Then I whispered, \u201cWe could sext. You can see how creative I can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer the original over reproductions.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my voice to a purr. \u201cVideo, then. With sound.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head and caught my lips, taking my mouth in a long, deep kiss. \u201cThis is love,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAgreeing to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I smiled and pulled back to hit the button for the elevator. \u201cYou could send me naughty pics, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou want pictures of me, angel, you\u2019ll have to take them yourself.\u201d</p><p>Backing into the elevator, I wagged a finger at him. \u201cSpoilsport.\u201d</p><p>The doors started to close. I had to grip the handrail to stop myself from dashing back out to him. Happiness came in so many forms. Mine was Gideon.</p><p>\u201cMiss me,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>I blew him a kiss. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>When I opened the door to my apartment, I was hit with two things at once: the smell of recent cooking and the sounds of Sam Smith.</p><p>It felt like home. But I was abruptly struck with sadness that it wouldn\u2019t be home for much longer. Not that I doubted the future I\u2019d accepted when I married Gideon, because I didn\u2019t. I was so excited about the thought of living with him, being his wife in private and public, sharing my days\u2014and nights\u2014with him. Still, change was harder when you were happy with the pre-change version of your life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHoney, I\u2019m home!\u201d I called out, dropping my bag on one of the teakwood bar stools at the breakfast bar. My mom had decorated the entire apartment in a modern traditional style. I probably wouldn\u2019t have gone with some of her choices, but I liked the result.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, sweet cheeks,\u201d Cary drawled, drawing my attention across the open floor plan to where he lay sprawled on our living room sofa in board shorts and no T-shirt. He was lean and tanned, his abs as beautifully defined as Gideon\u2019s. Even off duty, he looked like the super hot male model he was. \u201cHow was dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I headed over to him, kicking off my heels on the way. I figured I should enjoy doing that while I could. I couldn\u2019t picture myself leaving shoes strewn around Gideon\u2019s penthouse. I thought it might drive him a little crazy. And since I was sure there were other things I\u2019d drive him crazy with, it was probably best to pick my vices carefully. \u201cHow was yours? Smells like you cooked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPizza. Semi-homemade. It\u2019s what Tat was craving.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho doesn\u2019t crave pizza?\u201d I said, plopping gracelessly onto the couch. \u201cIs she still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d He glanced away from the TV to look at me, his green eyes serious. \u201cShe left all pissed off. I told her we wouldn\u2019t be moving in together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d To be honest, I didn\u2019t like Tatiana Cherlin. Like Cary, she was a successful model, although she hadn\u2019t yet attained his level of recognition.</p><p>Cary had met her on a job. Their purely sexual relationship had shifted drastically when she\u2019d found out she was pregnant. Unfortunately, she\u2019d discovered she was expecting around the same time Cary found a great guy he wanted to work on a relationship with.</p><p>\u201cBig decision,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the right one.\u201d He ran a hand over his gorgeous face. \u201cIf Trey weren\u2019t in the picture, I\u2019d be doing the right thing by Tat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says you aren\u2019t? Being a good parent doesn\u2019t mean you have to live together. Look at my mom and dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He groaned. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m choosing myself over my child, Eva. What does that make me, if not a selfish bastard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re cutting her off. I know you\u2019ll be there for her and the baby, just not in that way.\u201d Reaching over, I twirled a lock of his chocolate brown hair around my finger. My best friend had suffered through so much in his life. The twisted way he\u2019d been introduced to sex and love had left him with a lot of baggage and bad habits. \u201cSo Trey\u2019s going to stick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t decided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he call you?\u201d</p> <p>Cary shook his head. \u201cNo. I broke down and called him before he forgot about me altogether.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a little push. \u201cAs if that could ever happen. You, Cary Taylor, are utterly unforgettable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d He stretched out with a sigh. \u201cHe didn\u2019t sound too happy to hear from me. Said he\u2019s still working some stuff out in his head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means he\u2019s thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thinking he dodged a bullet,\u201d Cary muttered. \u201cHe said it was never going to work for us if I was living with Tat, but when I told him I\u2019d fix that, he said that would just make him feel like an asshole for getting in the way. It\u2019s a no-win, but I laid it all out for Tat anyway, because I have to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tough spot to be in.\u201d I couldn\u2019t imagine it myself. \u201cJust try to make the best decisions you can. You have a right to be happy. That\u2019s the best thing for everyone around you, including the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there is a baby.\u201d His eyes closed. \u201cTat says she\u2019s not doing this alone. If I\u2019m not going to be there, she doesn\u2019t want to go through with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it getting a little late for her to say that?\u201d I couldn\u2019t keep the anger out of my voice. Tatiana was a manipulator. It was impossible not to look ahead and see that being a source of misery for an innocent kid.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t even think about it, Eva. I lose my shit. It\u2019s all so fucked up.\u201d He huffed out a humorless laugh. \u201cAnd to think I once said she was easy to deal with. She\u2019s never cared that I\u2019m bisexual, and she didn\u2019t care if I slept around .... Part of me feels good that she cares enough now to want to be exclusive, but I can\u2019t help how I feel about Trey.\u201d</p><p>He turned his troubled gaze away. It tore me up to see him so down.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should talk to her,\u201d I offered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He tilted his head back to look at me. \u201cHow is that supposed to help? You two don\u2019t get along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fan,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut I can work around that. A woman-to-woman talk\u2014if it\u2019s done right\u2014could help. It really couldn\u2019t make things worse, right?\u201d I hesitated before saying more. I meant well, but my good intentions did sound na\u00efve.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cThere\u2019s always worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay to look on the bright side,\u201d I chastised. \u201cDoes Trey know that you talked to Tatiana and she\u2019s not moving in?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI texted him. Got nada back. But I really didn\u2019t expect to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive him a little more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva, at the end of the day, he wishes I were totally gay. In his mind, being bisexual means I have to sleep around. He doesn\u2019t get that just because I\u2019m attracted to men and women doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t be faithful to one person. Or maybe he just doesn\u2019t want to get it.\u201d</p><p>I blew out my breath. \u201cI don\u2019t think I helped with that. He brought it up to me once and I didn\u2019t explain things well.\u201d</p><p>That had been eating at me for a while. I needed to reach out to Trey and set that straight. Cary had been in the hospital recovering from a vicious assault when Trey approached me. My mind hadn\u2019t been at its sharpest at the time.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fix everything for me, baby girl.\u201d He rolled over onto his stomach and looked at me. \u201cBut I love you so much for trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re part of me.\u201d I struggled to find the right words. \u201cI need you to be okay, Cary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on it.\u201d He scooped his hair back from his face. \u201cI\u2019m taking this weekend in Westport to deal with the possibility that Trey might be out of the mix. I have to be realistic about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou be realistic, I\u2019ll be hopeful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun with that.\u201d He sat up and put his elbows on his knees, his head hanging. \u201cWhich brings me back to Tatiana. I guess I am clear about that. We can\u2019t be together. Baby or not, it wouldn\u2019t work for her or me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI respect that.\u201d</p> <p>It was hard not to say more. I would always give my best friend the support and reassurance he needed, but there were some hard lessons to be learned here. Trey, Tatiana, and Cary were all hurting\u2014with a baby on the way to join them\u2014because of Cary\u2019s choices. He pushed those who loved him away with his actions, daring them to stay. It was a test rigged for failure. Facing the consequences might just get him to make a change for the better.</p><p>His grin was wry, one beautiful green eye peeking through the fall of his long bangs. \u201cI can\u2019t pick and choose based on what I\u2019m going to get out of it. Sucks, but hey ... I gotta grow up sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we all?\u201d I gave him an encouraging smile. \u201cI quit my job today.\u201d</p><p>Accepting what I\u2019d done got easier every time I said it aloud.</p><p>\u201cNo shit?\u201d</p><p>Looking up at the ceiling, I replied, \u201cNo shit.\u201d</p><p>He whistled. \u201cShould I break out the bourbon and some shot glasses?\u201d</p><p>I shuddered. \u201cUgh. You know I can\u2019t stand bourbon. And really, Cristal and flutes would be more appropriate for my resignation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeriously? You want to celebrate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to drown any sorrows, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d I stretched my arms out over my head and let the last of my tension go. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it all day, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. Maybe if Mark had taken the news differently, I\u2019d have second thoughts, but he\u2019s leaving, too, and he\u2019s been there way longer than the three months I\u2019ve been there. It wouldn\u2019t make sense for me to be more upset about moving on than he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby girl, things don\u2019t have to make sense to be true.\u201d Grabbing the remote, he turned the speaker volume down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, but I found Gideon at the same time I started at Waters Field and Leaman. Practically speaking, there\u2019s no comparison between a job you\u2019ve had three months and a husband you\u2019re going to spend the rest of your life with.\u201d</p><p>He shot me a look. \u201cYou went from sensible to practical. This just keeps getting worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up.\u201d Cary never let me get away with the easy explanation. Since I was often good at deluding myself, his no-bullshit policy was a mirror I needed.</p><p>My smile faded. \u201cI want more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore of everything.\u201d I looked his way again. \u201cGideon\u2019s got this presence, you know? When he walks into a room, everyone straightens up and pays attention. I want that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou married that. You get it de facto with the name and the bank balance.\u201d</p><p>I sat up. \u201cI want it because I\u2019ve earned it, Cary. Geoffrey Cross left behind a lot of people who want some payback from his son. And Gideon\u2019s made his own enemies, like the Lucases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe who?\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my nose. \u201cThe bat-shit Anne Lucas and her equally insane husband.\u201d Then it hit me. \u201cOh my God, Cary! I didn\u2019t tell you. About the redhead you messed around with at that dinner a few weeks back. That was Anne Lucas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember when I asked you to run a search on Dr. Terrence Lucas? Anne is his wife.\u201d</p><p>Cary\u2019s confusion was obvious.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t go into how Terry Lucas had examined Gideon as a child and lied about finding signs of sexual trauma. He\u2019d done so in order to shield his brother-in-law, Hugh, from prosecution. I would never understand how he could do that, no matter how much he loved his wife. As for Anne, Gideon had slept with her to get back at her husband, but her physical resemblance to her brother had led to sexual depravity that haunted Gideon. He\u2019d punished Anne for the sins of her brother, leaving both himself and her mentally warped in the process.</p><p>That left Gideon and me with two very vicious enemies to contend with.</p> <p>I explained as much as I could. \u201cThe Lucases have this whole twisted history thing with Gideon that I can\u2019t get into, but it\u2019s no coincidence that you two ended up together that night. She planned it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s nuts and she knows it\u2019ll fuck with my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would you care who I tangle with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCary ... I always care.\u201d I heard my mobile phone start ringing. The \u201cHanging by a Moment\u201d ring tone told me it was my husband calling. I stood. \u201cBut in this case, it\u2019s the calculation behind it. You weren\u2019t just some random hot fling. She targeted you specifically because you\u2019re my best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not seeing how that accomplishes anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s flipping the bird at Gideon. Getting his attention is what she wants more than anything.\u201d</p><p>Cary arched a brow. \u201cThe whole thing sounds loopy, but whatever. I ran into her again not too long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast week, maybe.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d just wrapped up a shoot and my Uber was waiting outside the studio. She was stepping out of a caf\u00e9 with a girlfriend at the same time. It was totally out of the blue.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. My phone stopped ringing. \u201cNo way. Did she say anything to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. She kinda flirted a little, which isn\u2019t surprising considering the last time we saw each other. I shut her down, told her I was working on a relationship. She was cool about it. Wished me luck, said thanks again for a fun time. She took off down the street. End of story.\u201d</p><p>My phone started ringing again. \u201cIf you ever see her, walk the other way and call me. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-kay, but you\u2019re not telling me enough for this to make any sense.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me talk with Gideon.\u201d I hurried toward my phone and answered it. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you in the shower?\u201d Gideon purred. \u201cAre you naked and wet, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Hang on a minute.\u201d I dropped the phone to my shoulder and walked back to Cary. \u201cWas she wearing a wig when you saw her?\u201d</p><p>Cary\u2019s brows shot up. \u201cHow the hell would I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it long like when you first met her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Same.\u201d</p><p>I nodded grimly. Anne wore her hair cropped and I\u2019d never seen a picture of her otherwise. She\u2019d worn a wig when she pursued Cary at the dinner, which had thrown me off and hidden her from Gideon.</p><p>Maybe it was a new style for her.</p><p>Or maybe it was another indication that she had special plans when it came to Cary.</p><p>I put the phone to my ear. \u201cI need you to come back over, Gideon. And bring Angus up with you.\u201d</p><p>Something in my tone must have relayed my concern, because Gideon showed up with both Angus and Ra\u00fal. I opened the door and found the three men filling the hallway, my husband front and center, with both bodyguards flanking him. To call the sight of them intense would be an understatement.</p><p>Gideon had loosened his tie and unbuttoned his collar and vest but was otherwise dressed as he\u2019d been when we parted earlier. The slight dishevelment was sexy as hell, sending an instant tingle of arousal through my blood. It was a temptation, an enticement for me to finish taking off those expensive, elegant layers and reveal the powerful, primal male underneath. As smoking hot as Gideon was with clothes on, there was nothing like the sight of him purely nude. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My gaze locked with Gideon\u2019s and gave me away. One darkly winged brow arched upward, and the corner of his mouth lifted in amusement.</p><p>\u201cHello to you, too,\u201d he teased, in reply to my heated look.</p><p>The two men behind him stood in contrast with their bespoke but starkly basic black suits, white shirts, and unembellished black ties all perfectly arranged.</p><p>I\u2019d never really noticed before how superfluous Angus and Ra\u00fal appeared when standing beside Gideon, a man who could clearly manage a hand-to-hand confrontation without any help.</p> <p>Ra\u00fal stood stone-faced, as per his usual. Angus, too, was stoic, but the mischievous glance he sent my way told me he\u2019d caught me eye-fucking his boss.</p><p>I felt my face get hot.</p><p>Stepping back and out of the way, I let them in. Angus and Ra\u00fal headed into the living room where Cary waited. Gideon hung back with me as I shut the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me that look, angel, but you wanted Angus with me. Explain.\u201d</p><p>That made me laugh, which was just what I needed to break the tension. \u201cHow can I help it when it looks like you were stripping when I called you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can finish here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realize I may have to burn all your clothes after the wedding. You should always be naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould make for interesting meetings at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm ... maybe not, then. For my eyes only and all that.\u201d I leaned into the door and took a deep breath. \u201cAnne\u2019s made contact with Cary since the dinner.\u201d</p><p>All the warmth and lightness left Gideon\u2019s eyes, replaced by a chill that warned of bad things ahead.</p><p>He started toward the living room. I raced to catch up, linking our hands to remind him that we were in this together. I knew it was a concept that was going to take some getting used to. Gideon had been standing alone for so long, fighting his own battles and those of the people he loved.</p> <p>Taking a seat on the coffee table, he faced Cary and said, \u201cTell me what you told Eva.\u201d</p><p>Gideon looked ready to tackle Wall Street while Cary looked ready to tackle a nap, but that didn\u2019t seem to impact my husband at all.</p><p>Cary ran through it all again, his gaze darting occasionally toward Angus and Ra\u00fal, who stood nearby. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he finished. \u201cNo offense, guys, but you seem like a lot of muscle for a redhead who\u2019s maybe a hundred twenty pounds soaking wet.\u201d</p><p>I would\u2019ve pegged Anne at a hundred thirty, but that was neither here nor there. \u201cBetter safe than sorry,\u201d I said.</p><p>He shot me a look. \u201cWhat can she do? Seriously. What\u2019s everyone all anxious about?\u201d</p><p>Gideon shifted restlessly. \u201cWe had an ... affair. That\u2019s not the right word. It wasn\u2019t pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucked her,\u201d Cary said bluntly. \u201cI figured that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucked her over,\u201d I elaborated, stepping closer so I could rest my hand on Gideon\u2019s shoulder. I supported my husband, even though I couldn\u2019t condone what he\u2019d done. And truthfully, the part of me that was obsessed with Gideon pitied Anne. There had been times when I believed I\u2019d lost Gideon forever, and I had gone a little crazy myself.</p> <p>Still, she was dangerous in a way I could never be, and that danger was directed at people I loved. \u201cShe\u2019s not taking it well that he\u2019s with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are we talking Fatal Attraction\u2013type stuff ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s a psychologist, so Fatal Attraction meets Basic Instinct would be more accurate. It\u2019s a Michael Douglas marathon wrapped up in one woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke, Eva,\u201d Gideon said tightly.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s joking?\u201d I shot back. \u201cCary saw her in that long wig she wore to the dinner. I\u2019m thinking she wanted him to recognize her so they could chat.\u201d</p><p>Cary snorted. \u201cSo she\u2019s crazy town. What do you want me to do? Let you know if I run into her again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a protection detail on you,\u201d I said.</p><p>Gideon nodded. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Cary rubbed at the five o\u2019clock shadow on his jaw. \u201cYou guys are hard-core about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got enough going on,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cIf she\u2019s got an agenda, you don\u2019t need to deal with it.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted wryly. \u201cCan\u2019t argue with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d Angus said. Ra\u00fal nodded, and then both men headed downstairs.</p><p>Gideon stayed behind.</p><p>Cary looked back and forth between us, then stood. \u201cI don\u2019t think you two need me anymore, so I\u2019m hitting it. I\u2019ll catch you in the morning,\u201d he said to me, before sauntering down the hall to his bedroom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you worried?\u201d I asked Gideon when we were alone.</p><p>\u201cYou are. That\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>I took the spot on the sofa directly across from him. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much worry. More like curiosity. What does she think she can accomplish through Cary?\u201d</p><p>Gideon exhaled wearily. \u201cShe\u2019s playing head games, Eva. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. She was very specific in her comments to me at the dinner, warning me away from you. Like I don\u2019t know you and wouldn\u2019t want you if I did.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened and I knew I\u2019d struck a chord. He\u2019d never really gotten into what they had talked about when he went to her office. It was possible she\u2019d said something similar to him then.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to talk to Anne,\u201d I announced.</p><p>Gideon pierced me with his icy blue gaze. \u201cThe hell you are.\u201d</p><p>I laughed softly. My poor husband. So accustomed to having his word be law and then choosing to marry a woman like me. \u201cI know we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground over the course of our relationship, but somewhere in there we did discuss working as a team.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m open to doing that,\u201d he said smoothly, \u201cbut Anne is not the place to start. You can\u2019t reason with someone who\u2019s completely irrational.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to reason with her, ace. She\u2019s targeting my friends, and she thinks I\u2019m a weak spot for you. She needs to know I\u2019m not helpless, and that by taking you on, she\u2019s taking on both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my problem. I\u2019ll deal with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a problem, Gideon, it\u2019s my problem, too. Listen. Operation Gideva is in full effect now. My inaction is only making this situation with Anne worse.\u201d I leaned forward. \u201cIn her mind, either I know what\u2019s happening and I\u2019m too weak to do something or you\u2019re hiding everything from me, which suggests that I\u2019m too weak to handle it. Either way, you\u2019re making me a target and that\u2019s not what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s in her mind,\u201d he said tightly.</p><p>\u201cThings are a little twisted up there, sure. But she\u2019s a woman. Trust me, she needs to know I have claws and am prepared to use them.\u201d</p> <p>His gaze narrowed. \u201cWhat would you say?\u201d</p><p>A little flare of triumph had me holding back a smile. \u201cHonestly, I think it\u2019s enough if I just pop up somewhere unexpected. An ambush, so to speak. That\u2019ll shake her a little, to find me lying in wait. Will she go on the defensive or take the offense? We\u2019ll get insight from her reaction, and we need it.\u201d</p><p>Gideon shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would.\u201d I stretched out my legs between his. \u201cBut you know I\u2019m right. It\u2019s not my strategy that\u2019s bugging you, Gideon. More like your past won\u2019t go away and you don\u2019t want it in my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will go away, Eva. Let me handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to be more analytical about this. I\u2019m a member of your team, like Angus and Ra\u00fal, but obviously I\u2019m not an employee and I\u2019m sure as hell not a dependent\u2014I\u2019m your better half. It\u2019s not just Gideon Cross anymore. It\u2019s not even Gideon Cross and wife. We are Gideon and Eva Cross, and you need to let me live up to that.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, his gaze hot and intense. \u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to prove to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Because I feel like I have to prove something to you. If you don\u2019t believe I\u2019m strong enough ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEva.\u201d Gideon\u2019s hands cupped the back of my knees and pulled me closer. \u201cYou\u2019re the strongest woman I know.\u201d</p><p>He said the words, but I could see he didn\u2019t truly mean them. Not in the way we needed him to. He saw me as a survivor, not a warrior.</p><p>\u201cThen stop worrying,\u201d I countered, \u201cand let me do what I have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree that you have to do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to agree to disagree.\u201d I leaned into him, draping my arms across his broad shoulders and pressing my lips to the corner of his stern mouth.</p><p>\u201cAngel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be clear, I wasn\u2019t asking permission, Gideon. I\u2019m telling you what I\u2019m doing. You can either participate or stand back\u2014your choice.\u201d</p><p>He made a noise of frustration. \u201cWhere\u2019s the compromise you\u2019re always pushing me for?\u201d</p><p>Pulling back, I shot him a look. \u201cThe compromise is letting me try it my way this time. If it doesn\u2019t work, we try it your way next time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that. We\u2019ll sit down together to work out the logistics of when and where. We\u2019ll need Ra\u00fal to get a handle on her routine. By definition, an ambush is unexpected, but it should happen somewhere she feels safe and comfortable, too. Give her a nice jolt.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s laid down the ground rules. We\u2019re just taking her cue.\u201d</p><p>Gideon took a long, deep breath. I could practically see him thinking, his agile mind trying to find a way to get the result he wanted.</p><p>So I distracted him from that. \u201cRemember this morning, when I said I\u2019d explain why I decided to tell my parents about our marriage?\u201d</p> <p>His focus instantly shifted, his gaze watchful and alert. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it took a lot of courage for you to tell Dr. Petersen about Hugh. Especially considering how you feel about psychologists.\u201d And who could blame him for that distrust? Hugh had come into Gideon\u2019s life under the guise of therapeutic help and had become an abuser instead. \u201cYou inspired me to be equally brave.\u201d</p><p>His gorgeous face softened with tenderness. \u201cI heard that song today,\u201d he murmured, reminding me of the time I\u2019d sung the Sara Bareilles anthem to him.</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou needed me to tell him,\u201d he said quietly. The words were phrased as a statement but were really posed as a question.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d More than that, Gideon had needed it. Sexual abuse was private and personal, but in some way, we had to put it out there. It wasn\u2019t a dirty, shameful secret to shove into a box. It was an ugly truth, and truths\u2014by nature\u2014needed to be aired.</p><p>\u201cAnd you need to confront Anne.\u201d</p><p>My brows rose. \u201cI actually wasn\u2019t swinging the conversation back to that, but yeah ... I do.\u201d</p><p>This time, Gideon nodded. \u201cAll right. We\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>I indulged in a mental fist pump. Score one for Gideva.</p><p>\u201cYou also said there was something you wanted more than having sex with me,\u201d he reminded me dryly, the look in his eyes calling my bluff.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t put it quite like that.\u201d I ran my fingers through his hair. \u201cBanging you is literally my favorite activity. Ever.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to think I\u2019m silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll still think you\u2019re hot.\u201d</p><p>I kissed him for that. \u201cIn high school, most of the girls I knew had boyfriends. You know how it is, raging hormones and epic love stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I heard,\u201d he said wryly.</p><p>My words caught in my throat. So stupid of me to forget how it must have been for Gideon. He\u2019d had no one until Corinne in college, too damaged by Hugh\u2019s exploitation to have the normal teenage-love-affair angst I was thinking of.</p><p>\u201cAngel?\u201d</p> <p>I cursed silently. \u201cForget it. It\u2019s lame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust this once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cSpit it out.\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my nose. \u201cFine. Teenagers talk on the phone at night for hours because they have school and parents and can\u2019t be together. They spend all night chatting with their boyfriends about ... whatever. I never had that. I never ...\u201d I bit back my embarrassment. \u201cI never had a guy like that.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t have to explain. Gideon knew how I\u2019d been. How sex had once been my twisted way to feel loved. The guys I\u2019d fucked hadn\u2019t called me. Not before or after.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d I finished, my voice rough, \u201cI had this idea that we could have that for now ... while we\u2019re waiting. Late-night calls where we talk just to hear each other\u2019s voice.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me.</p><p>\u201cIt sounded better in my head,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Gideon was quiet for a long minute. Then he kissed me. Hard.</p><p>I was still reeling from that when he pulled away and spoke in a voice that was more than a little hoarse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m that guy for you, Eva.\u201d</p><p>My throat tightened up.</p><p>\u201cEvery milestone, angel. Every rite of passage ... Everything.\u201d He swiped at the tear that leaked out of the corner of my eye. \u201cAnd you\u2019re that girl for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d I gave a watery laugh. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>Gideon smiled. \u201cI\u2019m heading home now, because that\u2019s what you want. And you\u2019re going to call me and tell me that again, because that\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>I woke before my alarm the next day. Lying in bed for a few minutes, I let my brain wake up as much as it was going to without coffee. I forced myself to focus on the fact that it was the start of my final day at work. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Surprisingly, I felt more than good about that. I felt ... impatient. It really was time to shake things up.</p><p>And now the really big question. What to wear?</p><p>I rolled out of bed and hit my closet. After rifling through pretty much everything, I decided on an emerald green sheath dress that had an asymmetrical neckline and hemline. It showed a little more leg than I would normally consider for work, but why end the way I began? Why not take the opportunity to transition from the former to the future?</p><p>Today was Eva Tramell\u2019s last. On Monday, Eva Cross would have her debut. I could picture her. Short and blond against her husband\u2019s tall and dark but as dangerous as him in a very similar way.</p> <p>Or maybe not. Maybe, play up the differences. Opposite sides of the same, sharp blade ...</p><p>With a final glance at my cheval mirror, I headed into the bathroom to put on my makeup.</p><p>A short time later, Cary poked his head in. He whistled. \u201cLookin\u2019 good, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I dropped my lipstick brush back into its stand. \u201cCan I talk you into helping me with a chignon?\u201d</p><p>He sauntered in wearing nothing but Grey Isles boxer briefs, looking not so different from the billboards of him presently gracing phone kiosks and buses around the city. \u201cTranslation: Do it for you. Of course.\u201d</p> <p>My best friend got to work, expertly brushing and twisting my hair into a sleek, elegant bun.</p><p>\u201cThat was pretty intense last night,\u201d he said, after pulling the last hairpin out of his mouth. \u201cHaving a living room full of black suits like that.\u201d</p><p>My eyes met his in the mirror. \u201cThree suits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo suits and Gideon,\u201d he shot back, \u201cwho can fill a room by his damn self.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t argue with that.</p><p>He flashed his megawatt smile. \u201cIf anyone gets wind that I\u2019ve got a private security detail, they\u2019ll think either I\u2019m bigger shit than they knew or I\u2019ve got an inflated sense of my own importance. Both of which are true.\u201d</p> <p>Standing, I lifted onto my tiptoes and kissed his chin. \u201cYou won\u2019t even know they\u2019re around. They\u2019ll be in super stealth mode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetcha I can spot \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive bucks,\u201d I said, skirting around him to get a pair of heels from the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWhat? How about five big ones, Mrs. Cross?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d I snatched my phone off the bed when it chimed with an incoming text. \u201cGideon\u2019s on his way up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he spend the night?\u201d</p><p>I answered over my shoulder as I rushed toward the hallway, \u201cWe\u2019re abstaining until the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d Cary\u2019s long strides easily overtook mine, even with him strolling and me scrambling. He swiped my heels right out of my grasp, freeing me to grab my travel mug of coffee off the breakfast bar. \u201cI figured the honeymoon period lasted longer than that. Don\u2019t most husbands get laid at least a few years before they get cut off ?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up, Cary!\u201d I grabbed my bag and yanked the front door open.</p><p>Gideon stood on the other side, his hand lifted with key at the ready. \u201cAngel.\u201d</p><p>Cary reached around me and pulled the door open wider. \u201cI feel for you, man. Put a ring on it and bam, the legs slam shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCary!\u201d I glared. \u201cI\u2019m going to punch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to pack your overnight bag if you do that?\u201d</p><p>He knew me too well.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby girl, I\u2019ll be ready with your bag and mine.\u201d He looked at Gideon. \u201cCan\u2019t help you, I\u2019m afraid. Wait \u2019til you see her in that blue La Perla bikini I\u2019m packing. You\u2019ll have the balls to match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to punch you, too,\u201d Gideon drawled. \u201cYou\u2019ll have bruises to match.\u201d</p><p>Cary gave me a soft push out the door and slammed it shut.</p><p>It was nearing noon when Mark leaned over the top of my cubicle and gifted me with his crooked smile. \u201cReady for our last workday lunch?\u201d</p><p>I clasped a hand over my heart. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy to give your resignation letter back.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I stood, my gaze sliding over my workstation. I hadn\u2019t packed my few personal items yet. When five o\u2019clock rolled around, I expected to feel closure. But for now, I wasn\u2019t quite ready to give up my claim to my desk and the dream it had once represented.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have other lunches.\u201d I grabbed my purse out of the drawer and walked with him to the elevators. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you off the hook that easily.\u201d</p><p>I had a wave ready for Megumi when we hit reception, but she\u2019d already taken off for lunch and her relief was busy manning the phones. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was going to miss seeing her, Will, and Mark every weekday. They were my own little piece of New York, a part of my life that belonged to me alone. That was something else I\u2019d feared giving up by leaving my job\u2014my personal social circle.</p><p>I would work hard to keep my friends, of course. I\u2019d make time to call and plan things for us to do together, but I knew how it was\u2014already I\u2019d gone months without touching base with my San Diego pals. And my life would no longer resemble those of my friends. Our goals, dreams, and challenges would be worlds apart.</p><p>The elevator car that picked up Mark and me held only a few people, but the space filled quickly as it made more stops. I made a mental note to ask Gideon for one of his magic elevator keys that allowed him to glide straight up or down with no interruptions. After all, I\u2019d still be coming to the Crossfire, just heading up to a different floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d I asked, as we shuffled closer together to make room for more passengers. \u201cHave you decided whether you\u2019re staying or going?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded and shoved his hands in his pants pockets. \u201cI\u2019m taking your cue.\u201d</p><p>I could tell from the set of his jaw that he was firm in his decision. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome, Mark. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>We exited on the ground floor and made our way through the security turnstiles.</p><p>\u201cSteven and I talked it out,\u201d he went on, as we crossed the gold-veined marble of the Crossfire lobby. \u201cHiring you was a big step up for me. It was a sign that my career was moving in the right direction.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cLosing you is another sign\u2014it\u2019s time to move on.\u201d</p><p>Mark gestured me through the revolving door first. I felt the heat of the sun before I finished the rotation that ushered me outside. Fall weather couldn\u2019t come quick enough. I was looking forward to the change of seasons. It felt appropriate for there to be some outward shift to match the one happening within me.</p><p>My gaze slid over Gideon\u2019s sleek black limousine parked at the curb, and then I turned to face my boss when he joined me on the sidewalk. \u201cWhere are we headed?\u201d</p><p>Mark gave me an amused glance before he began scouting for an available taxi amid the surging sea of cars. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my hands together. \u201cYay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMiss Tramell.\u201d</p><p>I turned at the sound of my name and found Angus standing beside the limo. Dressed in his usual black suit and traditional chauffeur\u2019s hat, he looked dapper and expensive yet blended in so easily that only a trained observer might suspect his MI6 background.</p><p>It always tripped me out to think about his history. It was so James Bond. I\u2019m sure I romanticized it way too much, but I was comforted by the knowledge, too. Gideon was in the best of hands.</p><p>\u201cHey, you,\u201d I greeted Angus, allowing affection to color my voice.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but feel special gratitude for him. His past with Gideon spanned years and I would never know the whole of it, but I knew he\u2019d been the one support in Gideon\u2019s life after Hugh. And Angus had been the only person from our daily lives who\u2019d witnessed our elopement. The look on his face when he talked to Gideon afterward ... the tears that had shined in both of their eyes ... There was an unbreakable bond there.</p><p>His pale blue eyes sparkled at me as he pulled open the limo door. \u201cWhere would you both like to go?\u201d</p><p>Mark\u2019s brows shot up. \u201cThis is what you left me for? Hell. I can\u2019t compete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never had to.\u201d I paused before I slid into the back and looked at Angus. \u201cMark doesn\u2019t want me to know where we\u2019re headed, so I\u2019ll just climb in and try not to eavesdrop.\u201d</p> <p>Angus tapped the brim of his hat in acknowledgment.</p><p>A few minutes later we were on our way.</p><p>Mark sat on the bench seat opposite me, taking in the interior. \u201cWhoa. I\u2019ve rented limos before, but they never looked like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon has great taste.\u201d It didn\u2019t matter what the style was\u2014modern and contemporary like his office or classic and old world like his penthouse\u2014my husband knew how to present his wealth with class.</p><p>Looking at me, Mark grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re a lucky lady, my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I agreed. \u201cAll of this\u201d\u2014I waved my hand\u2014\u201cis amazing, of course. But he\u2019s the catch all by himself. He\u2019s just genuinely a really great guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to have one of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You sure do. How\u2019s the wedding planning coming along?\u201d</p><p>Mark groaned. \u201cSteven\u2019s killing me. Do I want blue or periwinkle? Roses or lilies? Satin or silk? Morning or evening? I tried to tell him that he can do what he wants, I just want him, but he chewed me out. Said I damned well better care because I didn\u2019t have a chance of ever getting married again. All I can say is thank God for that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cHow about you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to get into it. In this crazy world filled with billions of people, we managed to find each other. As Cary would say, we should celebrate that.\u201d</p><p>We talked about first dances and seating arrangements as Angus maneuvered us through the traffic that seemed to always clog Midtown. Looking past Mark out the window, I watched a cab come to a stop at the light beside us. The passenger in the back pinched a phone between her shoulder and ear, lips moving a mile a minute and hands furiously flipping through a notebook. Behind her, on the corner, a hot dog cart vendor did brisk business with a waiting line of five people.</p> <p>When we finally arrived and I stepped out onto the sidewalk I knew right where we were. \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>Tucked below street level, the Mexican restaurant was one we\u2019d been to before. And it just so happened to employ a server I was very fond of.</p><p>Mark laughed. \u201cYou quit so suddenly Shawna didn\u2019t have time to request the day off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww, man.\u201d My chest felt tight. It was starting to feel like an ending I wasn\u2019t ready for.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He caught me by the elbow and directed me inside, where I quickly spotted the table that held a party of familiar faces and Mylar balloons that said GREAT JOB and BEST WISHES and CONGRATS.</p> <p>\u201cWow.\u201d My eyes burned with a sudden wash of tears.</p><p>Megumi and Will sat with Steven at a table set for six. Shawna stood behind her brother\u2019s chair, their bright red hair impossible to miss.</p><p>\u201cEva!\u201d they shouted in chorus, drawing the attention of everyone in the room.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I breathed, my heart breaking more than a little. I was suddenly filled with sadness and doubt, faced with what I was giving up, even if only in one way. \u201cYou guys are so not getting rid of me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Shawna came over and gave me a hug, her slim arms strong and fierce around me. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bachelorette blowout to plan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoot!\u201d Megumi wrapped me in a hug the second Shawna stepped back.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe we could skip that tradition,\u201d interjected a warm, deep voice behind me.</p><p>Turning in surprise, I faced Gideon. He stood beside Mark with a single, perfect red rose in hand.</p><p>Mark flashed a big smile. \u201cHe touched base earlier to see if we were doing anything and said he wanted to come.\u201d</p><p>I smiled through my tears. I wasn\u2019t losing my friends, and I was gaining so much more. Gideon was always there when I needed him, even before I realized he was the integral piece that was missing.</p><p>\u201cI dare you to try their diablo salsa,\u201d I challenged, holding my hand out for my rose.</p><p>His lips curved faintly with a subtle smile, the one that did me in every time\u2014and every other woman in the room, too, I couldn\u2019t help but notice. But the look in his eyes, the understanding and support for what I was feeling ... That was all mine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your party, angel mine.\u201d</p><p>4</p> <p>The two-story house that sprawled along the coastline glowed with golden warmth spilling from every window. Lights embedded in the curving driveway glittered like a bed of stars in the gloaming, while hydrangea bushes the size of small cars burst with petals around the edges of the wide lawn.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it pretty?\u201d Eva asked, her back to me as she knelt on the black leather bench seat and stared out the window.</p><p>\u201cStunning,\u201d I replied, although I was referring to her. She was vibrating with excitement and a childlike delight. I took that in, needing to understand it and the cause. Her happiness was vital to me. It was the wellspring of my own contentment, the weight that balanced my equilibrium and kept me steady.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder at me as Angus slowed the limo to a halt by the front steps. \u201cAre you checking out my butt?\u201d</p><p>My gaze dropped to her ass, cupped so perfectly by the shorts she\u2019d changed into after work. \u201cNow that you mention it ...\u201d</p><p>She plopped down onto the seat with a huff of laughter. \u201cThere\u2019s no help for you, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I knew there was no cure the first time you kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you kissed me.\u201d</p><p>I held back a smile. \u201cIs that the way it went?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cYou better be joking. That moment should be seared into your brain.\u201d</p><p>Reaching over, I ran my hand down her bare thigh. \u201cIs it seared into yours?\u201d I murmured, pleased by the thought.</p><p>\u201cHey, now,\u201d Cary interrupted, pulling his ear buds out. \u201cDon\u2019t forget I\u2019m sitting right here.\u201d</p><p>Eva\u2019s roommate had been unobtrusively watching a movie on his tablet during the nearly two-hour drive through evening traffic, but I could never forget he was there. Cary Taylor was a fixture in my wife\u2019s life and I accepted it, even if I didn\u2019t like it. While I believed he loved Eva, I also believed he made bad choices that put her in tough situations and even posed a risk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Angus opened the door. Eva was out and running up the steps before I put my tablet away. Monica opened the front door just as her daughter hit the top landing.</p><p>Surprised by my wife\u2019s enthusiasm, considering she barely tolerated her mother most of the time, I stared after her curiously.</p><p>Cary laughed as he gathered his things and shoved them into a small messenger bag. \u201cOne whiff. That\u2019s all it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMonica usually bakes these crazy good cookies with peanut butter cups. Eva\u2019s making sure she stashes some before I get in there and eat \u2019em all.\u201d</p><p>Making a mental note to get that recipe, I looked back toward the two women on the porch, catching them exchanging air kisses before they both turned to look my way. At that moment, with Monica dressed in capris and a casual shirt, the similarities between them were striking.</p><p>Cary hopped out and took the steps two at a time, barreling directly into Monica\u2019s open-armed embrace and lifting her off her feet. Their laughter rang out through the gathering dusk.</p><p>I heard Angus speak to me from where he stood by the open door. \u201cYou can\u2019t spend the weekend in the limo, lad.\u201d</p><p>Amused, I left my tablet on the seat and stepped out.</p> <p>He grinned. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good for you to have family.\u201d</p><p>I set my hand on his shoulder and squeezed. \u201cI already have one.\u201d</p><p>For years, Angus had been all I\u2019d had. And he\u2019d been enough.</p><p>\u201cCome on, slowpoke!\u201d Eva came back to me, grabbing my hand and dragging me up the steps after her.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d Monica\u2019s smile was wide and warm.</p><p>\u201cMonica.\u201d I held out my hand and was startled to be hugged tightly instead.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d tell you to call me Mom,\u201d she said, pulling back. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid I\u2019d feel old.\u201d</p><p>Awkwardness morphed into a prickling that ran down my spine. It struck me then that I\u2019d miscalculated to a wide degree.</p><p>Marriage to Eva made her mine. It also made me hers, and connected me to her loved ones in a very personal way.</p><p>Monica and I had known each other for a while, our paths crossing occasionally because of the various children\u2019s charities we both supported. We\u2019d established particular parameters for our interactions, just as every association followed known protocols.</p><p>Abruptly, that was all blown to hell.</p><p>I found myself glancing back at Angus, at a loss. Apparently my predicament was entertaining, since he gave me a wink and left me to my own devices. He rounded the trunk to greet Benjamin Clancy, who waited by the driver\u2019s-side door of the limo.</p><p>\u201cThe garage is over there,\u201d Monica said, pointing at the two-story building across the road that was a small replica of the main house. \u201cClancy will make sure your driver gets settled and your bags are brought in.\u201d</p><p>Eva tugged on my hand and led me inside. Cary had guessed right. I was inundated with the smell of buttery vanilla. Not candles. Cookies. The homey and comforting scent made me itch to turn around and step back outside.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t prepared. I\u2019d come as a guest, Eva\u2019s plus-one. To be a son-in-law, a true member of the family, was a possibility I hadn\u2019t anticipated.</p><p>\u201cI love this house,\u201d Eva said, taking me through the archway that framed the opening to the living room.</p><p>I saw what I expected. An upscale beach house with white-slipcovered seating and nautical-themed accessories.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you love the espresso hardwood floors?\u201d she asked. \u201cI would\u2019ve gone with bleached oak, but that\u2019s so predictable, right? And the green, orange, and yellow accent colors over the usual blue? Makes me want to go rogue when we get back to the Outer Banks.\u201d</p><p>She had no idea how much I wanted to get back there now. There at least I\u2019d have more than a second to myself before I had to deal with a houseful of brand-new relatives.</p><p>The expansive living area flowed directly into the open kitchen, where Stanton, Martin, Lacey, and Cary all gathered around a large kitchen island with seating for six. The entire space shared the view of the water afforded by a row of sliding glass panels that opened onto a wide veranda.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Eva protested. \u201cYou better save me some cookies!\u201d</p><p>Stanton grinned and approached us. Dressed in jeans and a polo shirt, he looked like a younger version of the man I knew from our dealings in New York. He\u2019d shed the corporate vibe along with his suit, and I felt like I faced a stranger.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d Stanton kissed Eva\u2019s cheek, then turned to me. \u201cGideon.\u201d</p><p>Accustomed to being addressed by my last name, I wasn\u2019t braced for the hug that followed.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said, giving me a firm pat on the back before releasing me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Irritation simmered. Where was the natural evolution? The gradual shifting from business colleague to social acquaintance. And from there, from friend to family?</p><p>I abruptly thought of Victor. He\u2019d understood what my marriage meant in a way I hadn\u2019t.</p><p>While I stood stiffly, Stanton smiled at my wife. \u201cI think your mother stashed some cookies in the warming drawer for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d She rushed into the kitchen, leaving me with her stepfather.</p> <p>My stepfather-in-law.</p><p>My gaze followed her. In doing so, I caught the wave Martin Stanton sent my way, and I acknowledged it with a nod. If he tried to hug me, he was going to get a fist in the face.</p><p>I\u2019d once told him he could count on seeing me at family gatherings. It felt surreal now that it was actually happening. Like I was being punked.</p><p>Eva\u2019s husky laugh carried across the room to me and drew my eye. She held her left hand out to the blonde standing by Martin, showing off the ring I\u2019d given her when I made her my wife.</p><p>Monica joined Stanton and me, sliding into place at her husband\u2019s side. Her youthful beauty aged him, drawing attention to the stark whiteness of his hair and the lines etching his face. It was evident, however, that Stanton didn\u2019t care about the decades that separated him and his wife. He lit up when he looked at her, his faded blue eyes softening with affection.</p> <p>I searched for something appropriate to say. In the end, all that came out was, \u201cYou have a beautiful home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t look this good before Monica got her hands on it.\u201d Stanton wrapped an arm around her slender waist. \u201cSame can be said for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard.\u201d Monica shook her head. \u201cCan I give you a tour, Gideon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s give the man a drink first,\u201d Stanton suggested, eyeing me. \u201cHe\u2019s been in the car awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWine?\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe scotch,\u201d Stanton said.</p> <p>\u201cScotch would be great,\u201d I replied, chagrined that my unease was apparently obvious.</p><p>I was out of my element, something I should be used to since meeting Eva, but she had been an anchor of sorts, even as she sent me reeling. As long as I held on to her, I could weather any storm. Or so I\u2019d thought.</p><p>Looking for my wife, I turned and felt a rush of relief to find her coming toward me with a bounce in her step that had her ponytail swaying.</p><p>\u201cTry this,\u201d she ordered, lifting a cookie to my lips.</p><p>I opened my mouth but snapped my teeth shut a split second too soon, deliberately nipping her fingers.</p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d She frowned, but the literal bite of pain had the intended effect of focusing her attention on me. The frown faded as understanding dimmed the light in her eyes. She saw me, saw what was happening inside me.</p><p>\u201cWant to go outside?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cIn a minute.\u201d I jerked my chin toward the bar in the living room where Stanton was pouring my drink. I also caught her by the wrist, keeping her close.</p> <p>It rankled, holding her back from the group. I didn\u2019t want to be one of those men who smother the women who love them. But I needed time to adjust to all this. The usual distance I maintained from others, including Cary, wouldn\u2019t be acceptable with Monica or Stanton. Not after seeing how much joy Eva took in being with those she considered family.</p><p>Family for her was a safe place. She was as relaxed and easy as I\u2019d ever seen her. For me, gatherings like this sent up red flags.</p><p>I told myself to chill as Stanton returned with our drinks. But I didn\u2019t let my guard down completely.</p><p>Martin came over and introduced his girlfriend, both of them offering congratulations. That went as expected, which soothed me a little, although not as much as the double scotch I polished off with one swallow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to show him the beach,\u201d Eva said, taking the empty glass from me and setting it on an end table we passed on the way to the glass doors.</p><p>It was warmer outside than it was in the house, summer lingering this year to the very end. A strong salt-tinged breeze washed over us, whipping my hair across my face.</p><p>We walked to the edge of the lapping surf, her hand in mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked, facing me.</p><p>The concern in her voice had me bristling. \u201cDid you know this was some sort of family celebration because we\u2019re married?\u201d</p><p>She recoiled from the snap in my tone. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about it like that. And Mom didn\u2019t call it that, but I suppose it makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me.\u201d I turned my back to her and began walking into the wind, letting it blow my hair away from my heated face.</p><p>\u201cGideon!\u201d Eva hurried after me. \u201cWhy are you mad?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I rounded on her. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe assimilation-into-the-family crap.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWell, yeah. I told you they knew.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh ... Why tell them, then? You wanted them to know, Gideon.\u201d She stared at me when I didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cWhat did you think would happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never expected to get married, Eva, so forgive me if I didn\u2019t think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She held up both hands in a gesture of surrender. \u201cI\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>And I didn\u2019t know how to make things clear. \u201cI can\u2019t ... I\u2019m not ready for this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReady for what?\u201d</p><p>I waved an impatient hand toward the house. \u201cFor that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you be more specific?\u201d she asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cI ... No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I miss something in there?\u201d Her voice held a sharp note of anger. \u201cWhat did they say, Gideon?\u201d</p><p>It took me a moment to understand that she was rising to my defense. That only goaded me further. \u201cI came here to be with you. It just so happens you\u2019re spending time with your family\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re your family, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for that.\u201d</p><p>I watched as understanding sifted across her face. When pity followed, my fists clenched at my sides. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. Tell me what you need.\u201d</p><p>I exhaled roughly. \u201cMore liquor.\u201d Her mouth curved. \u201cI\u2019m sure you won\u2019t be the first groom who feels the need to drink around his in-laws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we not call them that, please?\u201d</p><p>The faint smile faded. \u201cWhat would that change? You can call them Mr. and Mrs. Stanton, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who\u2019s confused about where I fit here.\u201d</p> <p>Her lips pursed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I agree with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days ago, they would\u2019ve shaken my hand and called me Cross. Now, it\u2019s hugs and \u2018call me Mom\u2019 and smiles that expect something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, she told you not to call her Mom, but I get it. You\u2019re their son by marriage and it\u2019s freaking you out. Still, is it so terrible that they\u2019re happy about it? Would you prefer it if they were like my dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I knew how to deal with anger and disappointment.</p><p>Eva took a step back, her eyes dark and wide in the light of a waning moon.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I retracted, shoving a hand through my hair. I didn\u2019t know how to deal with disappointing her. \u201cDamn it. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me for a long minute. I looked away, out over the water.</p><p>\u201cGideon ...\u201d She closed the gap she\u2019d put between us. \u201cHonestly, I get it. My mom\u2019s been married three times. Every time it\u2019s a new instant father figure that I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a stepfather,\u201d I interrupted tersely. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing. No one gives a shit whether a stepparent likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what this is about?\u201d She walked into me and hugged me tight. \u201cThey already like you.\u201d</p><p>I gripped her close. \u201cThey don\u2019t fucking know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will. And they\u2019re going to love you. You\u2019re every parent\u2019s dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the bullshit, Eva.\u201d</p><p>She shoved away from me, her temper flaring. \u201cYou know what? If you didn\u2019t want any in-laws, you should\u2019ve married an orphan.\u201d</p><p>She marched back toward the house.</p><p>\u201cGet back here,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>She flipped her middle finger at me over her shoulder.</p><p>I caught her in three strides, grabbing her arm and spinning her back around. \u201cWe\u2019re not done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Eva pushed up onto her tiptoes to get in my face, which still left her tilting her head back to glare at me. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who wanted to get married. If you\u2019re having cold feet, it\u2019s all on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make this my problem!\u201d Fury sizzled through my blood, ratcheting up my frustration.</p><p>\u201cSorry you didn\u2019t realize the commitment involved more than a convenient piece of ass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cConveniently unavailable,\u201d I countered, feeling a muscle twitching in my jaw.</p><p>\u201cScrew you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent idea.\u201d</p><p>She was flat on her back in the sand before she knew what hit her. I pinned her down, pressing hard, my mouth on hers to shut her up. She arched, struggling, and I gripped her ponytail to hold her in place. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her teeth sank into my bottom lip and I pulled back with a curse.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me right now?\u201d Her legs tangled with mine and I found myself beneath her, staring up at her furious, beautiful face. \u201cThis is exactly why you\u2019re not getting any, ace. Sex is your go-to solution for everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to make this worth my while,\u201d I taunted, wanting a fight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worth your while, asshat. Not my vagina.\u201d She pushed down on my shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel ambushed. I\u2019m really sorry that being welcomed with open arms makes you lose your damn mind. But you\u2019re going to have to get used to it because it\u2019s all part of the package you got with me.\u201d</p><p>I knew that. Knew I had to make it work, because I had to have her. It trapped me, my love for her. Pushed me into corners I couldn\u2019t back out of. Forced a family on me when I\u2019d gotten by just fine without one.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want this,\u201d I said tightly.</p><p>Eva stilled. She sank back onto her knees, her thighs bracketing my hips. \u201cThink about what you\u2019re saying,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to play this role, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Her temper left her on a sigh. \u201cJust be yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the last thing they\u2019d want for their daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think that?\u201d She studied me. \u201cYou do. God, Gideon ...\u201d</p><p>I gripped her thighs, holding her in place. She couldn\u2019t leave me now. Whatever happened, I wasn\u2019t letting her leave me.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Her eyes took on a calculation that made me wary. \u201cSo be yourself. If they find out what a terrible guy you are and hate you, you\u2019d like that better anyway, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave the mind games to the shrinks, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just working with what you\u2019re giving me, ace.\u201d</p><p>A whistle drew our gazes to where Martin, Lacey, and Cary were stepping onto the sand from the edge of the slate-covered patio.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are totally newlyweds,\u201d Lacey called out, almost too far away to hear. She laughed as she struggled to balance on the shifting sand, spilling half the contents of her wineglass in the process.</p><p>Eva looked back at me. \u201cDo you want to fight in front of them?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath. Let it out. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d My eyes closed.</p><p>It was a goddamned weekend. A couple days. Maybe we could leave early on Sunday ....</p><p>Her lips brushed mine. \u201cWe can do this. Just try.\u201d</p> <p>What choice did I have?</p><p>\u201cIf it starts driving you crazy,\u201d she went on, \u201cjust imagine some terribly wicked thing you want to do to me on our wedding night as payback.\u201d</p><p>My fingers flexed into her flesh. I wasn\u2019t ashamed to admit that sex with my wife\u2014even just the thought of sex with my wife\u2014took precedence over damn near everything else.</p><p>\u201cYou can even text me all your nefarious plans,\u201d she suggested. \u201cMake me suffer, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your phone on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re evil.\u201d She bent down and pressed her lips to mine in a quick, sweet kiss. \u201cYou\u2019re so easy to love, Gideon. Even when you\u2019re impossible. One day, you\u2019re going to see it.\u201d</p><p>I dismissed that. What mattered was that I see her, that she was right there with me even after I fucked it all up.</p><p>Dinner was simple\u2014salad and spaghetti. Monica cooked and served, and Eva glowed. Wine flowed freely, bottle after bottle opened and emptied. Everyone relaxed. Laughed. Even me.</p><p>Lacey\u2019s presence was a welcome buffer. She was the newest addition to the group and got the most attention. That gave me some breathing room. And as time passed, Eva became flushed and bright-eyed with intoxication. She slid her chair closer and closer to my own, until she was pressed against my side, her body soft and warm.</p><p>Beneath the table, her hands and feet were busy, touching me often. Her voice grew huskier, her laugh became lusty. Eva had once confessed that drinking made her horny, but I would know the signs anywhere regardless.</p><p>It was nearing two in the morning when Lacey\u2019s yawn turned everyone\u2019s thoughts to ending the night. Monica walked with us to the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYour things are already in your room,\u201d she said, speaking to both Eva and me. \u201cLet\u2019s all plan on sleeping in and having brunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ...\u201d My wife frowned.</p><p>I caught her by the elbow. Clearly Eva hadn\u2019t considered that we\u2019d be sharing a room and a bed, but that inevitability had never been far from my mind. \u201cThank you, Monica. We\u2019ll see you later today.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughed and cupped my face in her hands, kissing my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m so happy, Gideon. You\u2019re just what Eva needs.\u201d</p><p>I managed a smile, aware that her sentiments would change if she knew how dangerous it was for her daughter to share a bed with a man whose violent nightmares posed a serious risk of harm.</p><p>Eva and I started up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cGideon\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I cut her off. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>She glanced aside at me. \u201cAll the way up.\u201d</p><p>Eva\u2019s room was indeed at the top, taking up the entirety of what was once probably a large attic. The low-pitched gabled roof made for a comfortable ceiling height and would offer an impressive view of Long Island Sound during daylight.</p><p>The king-size bed sat in the middle of the room, facing the wall of windows. Its brass headboard formed a divider of sorts, with a couch placed against the back to anchor a small seating area. The en suite bathroom filled the other side of the space.</p><p>Eva faced me. \u201cHow is this going to work?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me worry about that.\u201d I was used to worrying about sharing a bed with my wife; it was something I did daily. Of all the things that jeopardized our relationship, my atypical sexual parasomnia\u2014as Dr. Petersen called it\u2014topped the list. I had no defense against my fucked-up mind when I was sleeping. On rough nights, I was a physical danger to the one I loved most.</p><p>Eva crossed her arms. \u201cSomehow, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re as invested in waiting till the wedding as I am.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her, realizing we were thinking of two entirely different things. \u201cI\u2019ll take the couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me on the couch, you mean. You\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fuck you there, given the chance,\u201d I said tightly, \u201cbut I\u2019m not sleeping with you.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened to retort, then closed as comprehension hit her. \u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>The entire mood changed. The challenge in her eyes and voice altered to subdued caution. It killed me to see it, to know that I could be the source of any unhappiness in her life.</p><p>Still, I was too selfish to walk away. One day her family would see that about me and hate me for it.</p><p>Aggravated, I looked for my duffel bag and found it atop a luggage rack by the bathroom. I went to it, needing to do something other than see Eva\u2019s disillusionment and regret.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you sleeping on the couch,\u201d she called after me.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on sleeping.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my grooming kit and went into the bathroom. The lights came on as soon as I entered, revealing a pedestal sink and freestanding tub. I turned on the taps in the floating glass shower and took off my shirt.</p><p>The door opened and Eva stepped in. I glanced at her, pausing with my hand on the fly of my slacks.</p><p>Her hot gaze slid all over me, missing nothing, touching everything. She took a deep breath. \u201cWe have to talk.\u201d</p> <p>I was aroused by her admiration and furious with my own shortcomings; talking was the last thing I wanted to do. \u201cGo to bed, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until I say what I have to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She pulled her tank top up and over her head. Everything roiling inside me coalesced into a single driving need.</p><p>I straightened, every muscle tense and straining.</p><p>She reached behind her back to unsnap her bra.</p><p>My dick hardened painfully as her lush, firm tits bounced into view. I\u2019d never been a breast man before Eva. Now ...</p><p>God. They made me lose my mind.</p><p>\u201cTalking isn\u2019t what\u2019s going to happen if you take your clothes off,\u201d I warned, my cock throbbing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to hear me out, ace, whether it\u2019s out here or in the shower. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight isn\u2019t the night to push me.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her shorts.</p><p>I had my pants opened and on the floor before she finished stepping out of the silky triangle she wore as underwear.</p><p>Despite the building humidity that fogged the room, her nipples tightened into hard points. Her gaze fell to my cock. As if she imagined tasting me, her tongue slid along her lower lip.</p><p>My hunger for her rumbled up from my chest in a near growl. Eva shivered at the sound. I wanted to touch her ... to put my hands and mouth all over her ...</p><p>Instead, I let her look her fill.</p><p>Her breathing picked up. Seeing the effect I had on her was painfully, undeniably erotic. What I felt when she looked at me ... it moved me.</p><p>She remained by the door. Steam drifted over the top of the shower, encroaching on the edges of the mirror and misting my skin. Her eyes dropped to my throat. \u201cI haven\u2019t been completely honest with you, Gideon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My hands fisted reflexively. She couldn\u2019t say those words to me and not redirect my attention. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust now, when we were in the bedroom. I could sense you pulling away and there was this panic I felt ...\u201d</p><p>Eva fell silent for a long moment. I waited, reining my lust back with a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cHolding off until the wedding ... It\u2019s not just about Dr. Petersen\u2019s advice or the way you cope with fights.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cIt\u2019s about me, too. You know how I was\u2014I told you. Sex was all twisted up for me for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>She shifted on her feet, shame bowing her head. It made me sick to see it. It struck me then that I\u2019d been too wrapped up in my own reactions to the events of the last week without thinking about what my wife was going through.</p><p>\u201cIt was for me, too,\u201d I reminded her gruffly. \u201cBut it\u2019s never been that way between us.\u201d</p><p>She caught my gaze. \u201cNo. Never.\u201d</p><p>My clenched fists relaxed.</p><p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t still twist things up in my head,\u201d she went on. \u201cYou walked into the bathroom and my first thought was that I should fuck you. Like if we have sex, it\u2019ll fix everything. You won\u2019t be mad anymore and I\u2019ll have your love again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou always have it. You always will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d And from the set of her jaw, I could see that she did. \u201cBut that didn\u2019t stop the voice in my head from telling me I\u2019m risking too much. That I\u2019m going to lose you if I don\u2019t put out. That you\u2019re too sexual to go so long without it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d How many times and ways could I fuck this up? \u201cThe way I talked to you on the beach ... I\u2019m an asshole, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re also the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. That voice has been screwing me up for years, but it doesn\u2019t have the same power anymore. Because of you. You\u2019ve made me stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d Words failed me.</p><p>\u201cI want you to think about that. Not your nightmares or my parents or anything else. You\u2019re exactly what I need, just the way you are, and I love you so much.\u201d</p> <p>I walked toward her.</p><p>\u201cI still want to wait,\u201d she said quietly, even as her eyes betrayed how I affected her.</p><p>She grabbed my wrist when I reached for her, her gaze holding mine. \u201cLet me do all the touching.\u201d</p><p>I inhaled sharply. \u201cI can\u2019t agree to that.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved. \u201cYes, you can. You\u2019re stronger than I am, Gideon. You have more control. Greater willpower.\u201d</p><p>Her other hand reached up to graze my chest. I caught it and pressed it against my skin. \u201cIs that what you need me to prove? My control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing fine.\u201d She pressed a kiss over my pounding heart. \u201cI\u2019m the one who needs to figure things out.\u201d</p><p>Her tone of voice was soft, almost crooning. I was raging inside, burning with lust and love, and she was trying to gentle me. I almost laughed at the impossibility of that.</p> <p>Then she stepped into me, her plush body fitting tightly against mine, her arms hugging me so hard there wasn\u2019t any space between us.</p><p>I crushed her close, my head bowing over hers. I didn\u2019t know until that moment how badly I\u2019d needed to feel her like that. Tender and accepting, bared in every way possible.</p><p>She leaned her cheek against my chest. \u201cI love you so much,\u201d she whispered. \u201cCan you feel it?\u201d</p><p>It overwhelmed me. Her love for me, my love for her. Every time she said the words, they hit me like blows.</p><p>\u201cYou said once,\u201d she whispered, \u201cthat there\u2019s a moment while we\u2019re making love when I open and you open and we\u2019re together. I want to give you that all the time, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>The suggestion that there was something missing in what we had stiffened my spine. \u201cDoes it really matter how and when we feel it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could argue that.\u201d Her head tilted back. \u201cI won\u2019t disagree. But if you\u2019re on the other side of the world when you need reassurance from me, I need to know that I can give it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be with me,\u201d I muttered, frustrated.</p><p>\u201cNot always.\u201d Her hand cupped my cheek. \u201cThere will be times when you need to be in two places at once. Eventually, you\u2019ll trust me to fill in for you.\u201d</p><p>I studied her, looking for cracks in her resolve. What I saw was determination. I didn\u2019t totally understand what she hoped to achieve, but I wasn\u2019t getting in the way. If she was going to change or evolve, I needed to be part of that process if I expected to keep her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d The words left my throat as a low command, but she must have sensed the yearning behind it.</p><p>She offered her mouth and I took it hard, too hard, my hunger violent and greedy. I lifted her off her feet, wanting her to wrap her legs around me, to open to me so I could push inside her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t. She hung there, her hands stroking through my hair, her body trembling with the same unquenchable desire I felt. The flicks of her tongue against mine were maddening, taunting me with the memory of that tongue stroking over the rest of my body.</p><p>I struggled to pull away when everything inside me was goading me to push further. \u201cI need to be inside you,\u201d I said hoarsely, hating that I had to voice what was so obvious. Why make me plead?</p> <p>\u201cYou are.\u201d She nuzzled her cheek against mine. \u201cI want you, too. I\u2019m so wet for you right now. I feel so empty it hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva ... Christ.\u201d Sweat slid down my back. \u201cLet me have you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips touched mine. Her fingers raked through my hair. \u201cLet me love you another way.\u201d</p><p>Could I handle that? Hell. I had to. I\u2019d vowed to give her whatever she needed, to be the beginning and end of everything for her.</p><p>I set her down and went to the shower, shutting the taps off. Then I moved to the tub, stopped the drain, and started filling it.</p> <p>\u201cAre you mad?\u201d she asked in a low voice I barely heard over the rush of water.</p><p>I looked at her, saw the way her arms crossed her chest and gave away her vulnerability. I told her the truth. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Eva\u2019s lower lip trembled, then curved in a beautiful smile that took my breath away.</p><p>I\u2019d once told her I would take her any way I could get her. That was even more true now than it was then. \u201cCome here, angel.\u201d</p><p>Her arms dropped to her sides and she came.</p><p>The shifting of the bed woke me. Blinking, I registered the sunlight flooding the room. Eva\u2019s face came into focus, haloed by the light and bright with a wide grin.</p> <p>\u201cMorning, sleepyhead,\u201d she said.</p><p>The night came flooding back to me. The long bath with my wife\u2019s soapy hands running through my hair and over my skin. Her voice as she talked about the wedding. Her sensual laugh as I tickled her in bed. Her sighs and moans as we kissed until our lips were sore and swollen, making out like teenagers who weren\u2019t ready to go all the way.</p><p>I won\u2019t lie\u2014sex would\u2019ve taken things to another level. But the night was memorable all the same. It ranked right up there with other all-nighters we\u2019d shared.</p><p>Then I remembered where I was and what that meant.</p><p>\u201cI slept in the bed.\u201d The realization was like a bucket of cold water dumped over me.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d She gave a happy little bounce. \u201cYou did.\u201d</p><p>To have done so was irresponsible in the worst way. I hadn\u2019t even taken the medicine prescribed to help mitigate the risk.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t scowl like that,\u201d she chastised, bending down to kiss the space between my brows. \u201cYou slept hard. When\u2019s the last time you had a good night\u2019s sleep?\u201d</p> <p>I sat up. \u201cThat\u2019s not the point and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, ace. We\u2019ve got enough to be stressed about. We don\u2019t need to get worked up over things that go right.\u201d She stood. \u201cIf you want to be mad about something, be mad at Cary for packing this.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged out of the short white robe she was wearing, revealing a tiny dark blue bikini that hugged what little it managed to cover.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d All the blood in my body rushed to my dick. It waved beneath the sheet in hearty appreciation.</p><p>Eva laughed, her eyes dropping to where my erection tented the luxuriously thick cotton. \u201cYou like.\u201d</p><p>Holding her arms out, she turned, showing off the Brazilian cut of the bikini bottom. My wife\u2019s ass was as voluptuous as her tits. I knew she thought she was too curvy, but I couldn\u2019t disagree more. I\u2019d never been one to appreciate overly generous assets on a woman, but Eva changed that for me, as she\u2019d changed so many other things.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t a clue what kind of material the bikini was made of, but it was seamless and hugged her skin so perfectly it looked painted on. Thin straps at the neck, hips, and back brought to mind thoughts of tying her up and taking what I needed.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d I ordered, reaching for her.</p><p>She danced out of reach. Tossing the sheet back, I surged to my feet.</p><p>\u201cDown, boy,\u201d she teased, darting around the sofa.</p><p>I fisted my cock, stroking it hard from root to tip as I stalked her into the seating area. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to work.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes sparkled with laughter.</p><p>\u201cEva\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She snatched something off the back of the chair and ran to the door. \u201cSee you downstairs!\u201d</p><p>I lunged for her and missed, finding myself facing the back of the slammed door instead. \u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><p>I brushed my teeth, threw on swim trunks and a T-shirt, and followed her down. I was the last one to make an appearance, discovering the rest of the group already seated at the kitchen island and eating heartily. A quick glance at the clock told me it was almost noon.</p><p>I looked for Eva and found her sitting on the patio with a phone to her ear. She\u2019d covered herself in a strapless white skirt thing. I noted that Monica and Lacey were both dressed similarly, with bathing suits partially hidden by barely-there cover-ups. Like me, Cary, Stanton, and Martin had on trunks and T-shirts.</p> <p>\u201cShe always calls her dad on Saturdays,\u201d Cary said, following my gaze.</p><p>I watched my wife for a long minute, looking for any signs of distress. She wasn\u2019t smiling anymore, but she didn\u2019t look upset.</p><p>\u201cHere you go, Gideon.\u201d Monica set a plate of waffles and bacon in front of me. \u201cWould you like coffee? Or maybe a mimosa?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Eva again before answering. \u201cCoffee\u2014black\u2014would be great, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Monica moved toward the coffeemaker on the counter. I joined her.</p> <p>She smiled at me, her lips painted the same pink as the halter tie of her swimsuit. \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a rock.\u201d Which was true, though that was pure luck. The entire household might\u2019ve been woken up by a fight between Eva and me, with her struggling to fight me off while my dreams imagined she was someone else.</p><p>Glancing over my shoulder at Cary, I caught his grim gaze. He\u2019d seen what could happen. He didn\u2019t trust me with Eva any more than I trusted myself.</p><p>I grabbed an extra mug out of the cupboard Monica reached into. \u201cI can get it,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t argue with her. I let her pour my coffee, then followed suit by pouring a cup for my wife. After adding Eva\u2019s preferred amount of half-and-half, I grabbed the handles of both mugs in one hand. Then I picked up the plate Monica had served me and headed out to the patio.</p> <p>Eva glanced up at me as I set everything on the table beside her and took the seat on the other side. She\u2019d left her hair down. Blond tendrils fluttered around her bare face as the breeze ruffled through it. I loved her this way, earthy and natural. Here and now, she was my own piece of heaven on earth.</p><p>Thank you, she mouthed, before snatching up a piece of bacon. She munched quickly while Victor said something I couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u201cEventually, I\u2019ll focus on Crossroads,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is Gideon\u2019s charitable foundation. I hope to be active in that. And I\u2019ve been thinking about maybe going back to school.\u201d</p><p>My brows rose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to be a sounding board for Gideon,\u201d she continued, looking straight at me. \u201cObviously, he\u2019s managed well enough without me and he\u2019s got a great team of advisors, but I\u2019d like him to be able to talk shop with me and at least understand what he\u2019s saying.\u201d</p><p>I tapped my chest. I\u2019ll teach you.</p><p>She blew me a kiss. \u201cIn the meantime, I\u2019m going to be crazy busy trying to pull off a wedding in less than three weeks. I haven\u2019t even picked out invitations yet! I know it\u2019s going to be hard for some of the family to get time off. Could you send out an e-mail in the meantime? Just to get the ball rolling?\u201d</p><p>Eva bit into the bacon while her father talked.</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t discussed it,\u201d she replied, swallowing quickly, \u201cbut I\u2019m not planning on inviting them. They lost the right to be part of my life when they disowned Mom. And it\u2019s not like they\u2019ve ever reached out to me, so I don\u2019t think they\u2019d care anyway.\u201d</p><p>I looked across the span of sand to the water beyond it. I wasn\u2019t interested in meeting Eva\u2019s maternal grandparents, either. They\u2019d rejected Monica for becoming pregnant with Eva out of wedlock. Anyone who found my wife\u2019s existence distasteful was better off not crossing paths with me.</p><p>I listened to Eva\u2019s side of the conversation for another few minutes, and then she said good-bye. When she set her phone on the table, she gave a big sigh that sounded like relief.</p><p>\u201cEverything good?\u201d I asked, studying her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s better today.\u201d She glanced inside the house. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to eat with the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I being antisocial?\u201d</p><p>She smiled wryly. \u201cTotally. I can\u2019t hold it against you, though.\u201d</p><p>I gave her an inquiring look.</p><p>\u201cI realized I haven\u2019t included your mother in the wedding planning,\u201d she explained. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Settling deeper into the chair to conceal the stiffening of my spine, I told her, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Her lips pursed. She reached for another piece of bacon, then handed it to me. True love.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d I waited until she looked at me. \u201cIt\u2019s your day. Don\u2019t feel obligated to do anything but enjoy yourself. And have sex with me, which should fall under enjoying yourself.\u201d</p><p>That brought her smile back. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be wonderful no matter what.\u201d</p> <p>I voiced what was left unsaid. \u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She tucked her hair behind her ear and shrugged. \u201cThinking about my mom\u2019s parents has me thinking about grandparents, and your mother is going to be our children\u2019s grandmother. I don\u2019t want that to be awkward.\u201d</p><p>I bristled. The thought of my mother and a child I created with Eva together in any way filled me with a riot of emotions I couldn\u2019t deal with now. \u201cLet\u2019s cross that bridge when we come to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t our wedding the place to start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like my mother,\u201d I snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend you do for the sake of children who don\u2019t exist yet.\u201d</p> <p>Eva jerked back slightly. She blinked at me, then reached for her coffee. \u201cDid you try the waffles?\u201d</p><p>Knowing it wasn\u2019t in my wife\u2019s nature to steer away from sensitive topics, I still let her do it. If we were going to get into the subject of my mother, we could do it later.</p><p>She set her mug down and tore off a piece of waffle with her fingers. She held it out to me. I took it for what it was: a peace offering.</p><p>Then I stood and took her hand, leading her out to the beach for a walk to clear my head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Turning my head, I saw Cary grinning at me from where he lay on the sand a few feet away.</p> <p>\u201cI know you appreciate my packing that bikini,\u201d he elaborated, jerking his chin toward Eva, who was standing thigh-deep in the water.</p><p>Her hair was damp and slicked back from her face. Oversize aviator sunglasses shielded her eyes from the sun as she threw a Frisbee back and forth with Martin and Lacey.</p><p>\u201cDid you help her pick that out?\u201d Monica asked, smiling from beneath an elegant wide-brim hat.</p><p>I\u2019d watched her slather sunscreen all over Eva, a job I wanted for myself, but I didn\u2019t press the point. Sometimes, Monica mothered Eva as if she were still a child. While my wife rolled her eyes at me, I could see that she basked in the attention. It was a very different relationship from the one I had with my own mother.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t say that my mom didn\u2019t love me, because she did. In her own way\u2014within boundaries. Monica\u2019s love, on the other hand, had no limits, something Eva found stifling at times.</p><p>Who could say which was better or worse? To be loved too much or too little?</p><p>God knew I loved Eva beyond all reason.</p><p>A sudden sea breeze snapped me out of it. Monica hung on to her hat as Cary turned his head toward her.</p> <p>\u201cI did,\u201d Cary replied, rolling over onto his stomach. \u201cShe was looking at one-pieces and I had to intervene. That bikini was made for her.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Hell yeah. I had my arms crossed over my bent knees so I could take in my fill of her. She was wet and nearly naked, and I was hot for her.</p><p>As if she sensed we were talking about her, Eva crooked her finger at me, beckoning me to come to her. I nodded but waited for a few moments before rising from where I\u2019d been sitting in the sand.</p><p>The chill of the water made me suck in a sharp breath, but I was grateful for it a moment later when she surged toward me and plastered herself against me. Her legs wrapped around my waist, her smiling mouth puckering into a heated kiss against my lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not bored, are you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Then she twisted in a way that sent us both tumbling into the water. I felt her hand cup my cock and give it a gentle squeeze. She wriggled away as I came up for air, laughing as she pulled her sunglasses off and tried to run onto the beach.</p><p>I caught her by the waist and took us both down, absorbing the fall onto the sand on my back. Her squeal of surprise was my reward, as was the feel of her cool, sleek body writhing against my own.</p><p>Turning, I pinned her down. My hair hung around my face, dripping water onto hers. She stuck her tongue out at me.</p><p>\u201cThe things I\u2019d do to you if we didn\u2019t have an audience,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re newlyweds. You can kiss me.\u201d</p><p>Looking up, I saw all eyes on us.</p><p>I also spotted Ben Clancy and Angus closing in on a house two lots down. Even at this distance, the glint of light from the patio betrayed a camera\u2019s lens.</p><p>I started to sit up, but Eva\u2019s legs tangled with mine and held me down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKiss me like you love me, ace,\u201d she challenged. \u201cI dare you.\u201d</p><p>I remembered saying those words to her and how she\u2019d kissed my breath away.</p><p>Lowering my head, I sealed my mouth over hers.</p><p>5</p> <p>I\u2019d been dozing more than sleeping when I heard my bedroom door open. After spending a weekend at the beach, the sounds of energetic Manhattan filtering into the apartment had both soothed and excited me. I had a long way to go before I could call myself a New Yorker, but the city already felt like home to me now.</p><p>\u201cRise and shine, baby girl!\u201d Cary shouted. A moment later, he bounded onto my bed, nearly bouncing me off.</p><p>Sitting up, I shoved the hair back from my face. Then I shoved him. \u201cI\u2019m sleeping in, if you hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s after nine o\u2019clock, lazybones,\u201d he drawled, settling on his stomach with his heels kicked up behind him. \u201cI know you\u2019re unemployed, but don\u2019t you have a shit-ton of stuff to get done?\u201d</p><p>As I drifted in and out of sleep, I\u2019d been thinking about everything on my to-do list. There was so much to scratch off, it was overwhelming. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuch enthusiasm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need coffee for that. What about you?\u201d I looked at him, noting that he was dressed in olive cargo pants and a charcoal V-neck T-shirt. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your agenda today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to take it easy, so I can be ready to hit the catwalk tomorrow. For now, I\u2019m all yours.\u201d</p><p>Reaching behind me, I propped my pillows up and scooted back against them. \u201cI need to call the wedding planner, the interior designer, and get the invitation thing sorted out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou also need a dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I wrinkled my nose. \u201cThat\u2019s not on my list today, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you kidding? Even if you bought a dress off the rack\u2014which we both know you can\u2019t\u2014if it needs any alterations whatsoever, Mrs. Big Boobs and Voluptuous Ass, you\u2019re pushing it timewise.\u201d</p><p>Cary was right. I\u2019d realized I had to find something custom after photos of Gideon and me kissing on the beach had spread all over the Internet on Sunday. The number of \u201csteal this look\u201d blog posts on my beachwear boggled my mind. Since the bikini I\u2019d worn had been discontinued, prices for used ones on resale sites were staggering.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, Cary,\u201d I admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I have any designers on speed dial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for you, it\u2019s Fashion Week.\u201d</p><p>That woke me up and sent my thoughts racing around in circles. \u201cNo shit? How did I miss that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been mostly wallowing in misery,\u201d he reminded dryly. \u201cYou know your mom will be hitting a few shows, rubbing elbows and spending thousands. Go with her.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m afraid to talk to her about anything after she flipped out yesterday.\u201d</p><p>He made a face. \u201cYeah, she had a full-on Monica Meltdown.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI swear we just had a conversation about her turning my wedding into a publicity op and now she\u2019s acting like any press is a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, to be fair, she was specific about tabloid coverage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any other kind nowadays?\u201d I sighed, knowing I was due for another talk with my mother. That wouldn\u2019t be fun. \u201cI don\u2019t know what she\u2019s so upset about. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better picture of Gideon and me if I\u2019d tried. It\u2019s perfect for making Corinne Giroux look desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d His grin faded. \u201cAnd honestly, it\u2019s good to see Gideon so into you. He had a stick up his ass most of the weekend. I was starting to think he was cooling off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late for that.\u201d I kept my tone light, but it had torn me up to see how uncomfortable Gideon was with any sign of affection. Friendship seemed to be the closest connection he could tolerate outside our marriage. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t personal, Cary. Remember how he acted at the Vidal Records party at his parents\u2019 house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVaguely.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cNot my problem anyway. Do you want me to reach out to some friends and see if we can\u2019t put the word out while we\u2019re strutting our stuff this week? Your bikini blew up the Internet. I can\u2019t imagine any designer turning down the chance to design your wedding dress.\u201d</p><p>I groaned. How amazing would it be to knock Gideon\u2019s socks off with a glamorous, made-just-for-me dress? \u201cI don\u2019t know. It would suck royally if word got out about how soon it\u2019s all going down. I don\u2019t want a media circus. It\u2019s bad enough we can\u2019t even go out of town for the weekend without some creepy photographer following us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEva.

But I pulled outfits together my own way.</p><p>I reached for my phone on the nightstand to call my mom when Gideon\u2019s face lit up my screen. \u201cHey,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your morning so far?\u201d</p><p>It tickled me to hear his clipped, businesslike tone. My husband\u2019s head was in the game, but he was still thinking of me.</p><p>\u201cI just rolled out of bed, so I can\u2019t really say. How\u2019s yours? You finish buying up everything in Manhattan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite. Have to leave something for the competition. Otherwise, where\u2019s the fun?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do love your challenges.\u201d I headed into the bathroom, my gaze sliding over the tub before pausing on the shower. Just thinking about my husband naked and wet made me hot. \u201cWhat do you think would\u2019ve happened if I hadn\u2019t resisted you to begin with? What if I\u2019d just fallen into bed with you when you asked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would\u2019ve blown my mind, just as you did. That was inevitable. Have lunch with me.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be planning a wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear a yes in there. It\u2019s a business lunch, but you\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>Looking in the mirror, I saw wildly tousled bedhead and creases in my cheeks from the pillow. \u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoon. Ra\u00fal will be waiting for you downstairs shortly before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be responsible and say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you won\u2019t. I miss you.\u201d</p> <p>My breath caught. He tossed that out there nonchalantly, the way some men would say I\u2019ll call you. But Gideon wasn\u2019t the type of man to say anything he didn\u2019t mean.</p><p>Still, I craved to feel the emotion behind the words. \u201cYou\u2019re too busy to miss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d he said. There was a pause. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel right not having you here in the Crossfire.\u201d</p><p>I was glad he couldn\u2019t see me smile. There was an unmistakable trace of perplexity in his voice. It shouldn\u2019t make a difference to him that I wasn\u2019t working floors below his office, where he couldn\u2019t see me. But it did.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cClothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh. A three-piece suit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any other kind?\u201d</p><p>Not for him, there wasn\u2019t. \u201cWhat color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes me hot thinking about it.\u201d Which was true, but not why I was asking. \u201cWhat color tie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso white.\u201d</p><p>Closing my eyes, I pictured him. I remembered that combination. \u201cPinstripes.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d go with a pinstriped suit to keep the business look with that shirt and tie combination.</p><p>\u201cYes. Eva ...\u201d His voice lowered. \u201cI have no idea why this conversation is making me hard, but it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you know I\u2019m seeing you in my head. All dark and dangerous and sexy as hell. You know how much it turns me on to look at you, even if it\u2019s only by memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet me here. Early. Come now.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cGood things come to those who wait, Mr. Cross. I\u2019ll be cutting it close as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d I hung up and faced myself squarely in the mirror. With the picture of Gideon freshly in my mind, I found the sleepy mess looking back at me totally insufficient. I\u2019d changed my look when I\u2019d thought Gideon had left me for Corinne. I had dubbed the result \u201cNew Eva.\u201d In the time since, my hair had grown past its former shoulder length and my highlights had grown out with it.</p><p>\u201cYou decent?\u201d Cary called from the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I faced him when he strolled into the bathroom with my coffee in hand. \u201cChange of plan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d He leaned into the counter and crossed his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hopping in the shower. You\u2019re going to find me a fabulous hair salon that can fit me in about thirty minutes from now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m going to lunch and you\u2019re going to make a few calls for me. In return, I\u2019m taking you out to dinner tonight. You pick the place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know that look you\u2019ve got,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re on a mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d</p><p>I showered quickly, since I didn\u2019t wash my hair. Then I hurried over to my closet, having spent the time in the bathroom thinking about what I wanted to wear. It took a few minutes to locate the right dress. Bright white, with a built-in bra and fitted tulip skirt, it draped beautifully across the bust and thighs. The color and cotton fabric kept it casual, while the fit was both elegant and sexy.</p><p>It took a little longer to find the right pair of shoes. I considered nude for a long time. In the end, I went with a pair of strappy heeled sandals in aqua blue that matched Gideon\u2019s eyes. I had a clutch that matched, and a set of opal earrings that had the same bright blue fire.</p><p>I laid it all out on the bed to make sure it worked, standing back in my bathrobe to eye the ensemble carefully.</p> <p>\u201cNice,\u201d Cary said, as he came up behind me.</p><p>\u201cI bought those shoes,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cAnd the clutch and jewelry.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and tossed an arm around my shoulders. \u201cYeah, yeah. Your hairstylist is here. I told the desk to send him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see you going into any old salon without making a scene. You\u2019ll have to find someone you trust to style you in private appointments. In the meantime, Mario can rock a haircut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about color?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cColor?\u201d His arm dropped and he faced me. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>I caught his hand and started out of the room. \u201cStick with me, kid.\u201d</p><p>Mario was a compact bundle of energy with a stylish flop of purple-tipped curls. Shorter than me and hard with muscle, he set up shop in my bathroom while gossiping with Cary about people they knew, dropping names I sometimes recognized.</p><p>\u201cA natural blonde,\u201d he gushed when he first got his hands on my hair. \u201cYou, my dear, are a rare breed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me blonder,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Taking a step back, he stroked his goatee thoughtfully. \u201cHow much blonder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the opposite of black?\u201d</p><p>Cary whistled.</p> <p>Mario sifted my hair through his fingers. \u201cYou\u2019ve already got platinum highlights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take it up a notch. I want to keep the length, but let\u2019s do something edgy. More layers. A little spiky on the tips. Maybe some bangs to frame my eyes.\u201d I sat up straighter. \u201cI\u2019m sassy, sexy, and smart enough to flaunt it.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Cary. \u201cI like her.\u201d</p><p>My best friend crossed his arms and nodded. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Stepping back from the mirror, I took in the full effect. I loved what Mario had done with my hair. It fell in piecey, choppy layers around my shoulders and face. He\u2019d heavily foiled my crown and around my face, creating an overall look of lighter hair without altering the dark gold strands underneath. Then he\u2019d teased the roots just enough to give me some sexy volume.</p><p>My weekend tan only made my hair look lighter. I\u2019d gone a little wild with a smoky-eye look, using grays and blacks to play up my gray irises. To balance that, I\u2019d kept the rest of my makeup neutral, including my lips, which were glossed in a nude tint. When I juxtaposed my reflection with the image of Gideon in my mind, I saw just the result I was looking for.</p><p>My husband was the definition of tall, dark, and gorgeous. His hair was pure black, as dark as ink and just as lustrous. He wore dark colors more often than not, which focused attention on the chiseled planes of his face and the striking color of his eyes. I\u2019d pulled off being a complementary opposite. The yang to his yin.</p><p>Bam. I looked good.</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Hotness.\u201d Cary raked me with an appreciative glance as I rushed through the living room. \u201cWhat kind of lunch is this that you\u2019re going to?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at my phone, cursing silently to see that ten minutes had passed since Ra\u00fal texted that he was waiting downstairs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Something to do with business, Gideon said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re spectacular arm candy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d But I wanted to be more than that. I wanted to be a weapon in Gideon\u2019s arsenal. I\u2019d have to earn it, though, and I relished the challenge. If I could manage to contribute something\u2014anything\u2014to the conversation today, I\u2019d be happy. If I was out of my depth, though, I could at least make him proud to be seen with me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be hobbled by his blue balls by the time the wedding comes around,\u201d he called after me. \u201cYou can only prime a pump so many times before it has to blow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross, Cary.\u201d I opened the front door. \u201cI\u2019ll text you the numbers of the designer and wedding planner. And I\u2019ll be back in a couple hours.\u201d</p><p>I was lucky to catch the elevator without a wait. When I stepped out onto the sidewalk outside the lobby and Ra\u00fal climbed out from behind the wheel of the Benz, I knew I was on the right track when he gave me the once-over. He kept it professional, but I could tell he liked what he saw.</p><p>\u201cSorry I lagged,\u201d I told him as he opened the rear door for me. \u201cI wasn\u2019t quite ready when you texted.\u201d</p> <p>There was almost a hint of a smile on his stern face. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll mind.\u201d</p><p>During the ride, I texted Cary the phone numbers of Blaire Ash, the interior designer working on the penthouse renovations, and Kristin Washington, the wedding planner, and asked him to arrange meetings with them. By the time I was done and glanced out the window, I realized we weren\u2019t headed to the Crossfire.</p><p>When we arrived at Tableau One, I wasn\u2019t totally surprised. The popular restaurant was a co-venture between Gideon and his friend Arnoldo Ricci. Arnoldo had been unknown when Gideon discovered him in Italy. Now, he was a celebrity chef.</p><p>As Ra\u00fal pulled into the valet area, I scooted forward in the seat. \u201cCould you do me a favor while we\u2019re having lunch?\u201d</p><p>He turned his head to look at me.</p> <p>\u201cCan you find out where Anne Lucas is right now? Today\u2019s as good a day as any for me to rattle her.\u201d I was dressed to impress. Might as well get as much mileage out of that as possible.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cI\u2019ll have to discuss it with Mr. Cross.\u201d</p><p>I almost backed off. Then I remembered that Ra\u00fal technically worked for me, too. If I wanted to step up my game, wasn\u2019t it best to start at home? \u201cNo, I have to. And I will. Just find her for me. I\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He still sounded reluctant. \u201cYou ready? They\u2019re going to take your picture as soon as they see you.\u201d He jerked his chin forward and I followed the gesture to where a half-dozen paparazzi stood outside the entrance.</p><p>\u201cOh boy.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>Ra\u00fal got out and rounded the car to open my door. The moment I straightened, camera flashes lit up the already bright day. I kept my face straight and walked briskly into the restaurant.</p> <p>The place was packed and buzzing with the multitude of loud conversations taking place. Still, I found Gideon almost immediately. He spotted me, too. Whatever he\u2019d been saying before I arrived died on his lips.</p><p>The hostess said something to me, but I didn\u2019t hear her. I was too focused on Gideon, whose stunning face took my breath away\u2014as it always did\u2014but gave me no clue to his thoughts.</p><p>Pushing his chair back, Gideon stood with powerful grace. The four men seated with him glanced my way, then stood as well. There were two women with them, both of whom swiveled in their seats to look at me.</p><p>I remembered to smile and started toward their large round table situated near the center of the room, making my way carefully over the hardwood floors, trying to ignore the stares I garnered as the focus of Gideon\u2019s dark gaze.</p><p>My hand shook a little as reached for his arm. \u201cI apologize for being late.\u201d</p><p>He slid his arm around me and brushed his lips over my temple. His fingers flexed into my waist with near-painful pressure and I pulled back.</p><p>He looked at me with such heated intensity and ferocious love that my pulse skipped. Pleasure rushed through me. I knew that look, understood I\u2019d given him a little buzz he was struggling to process. It was nice to know I could still do that. It made me want to try my hardest to find just the right dress to walk down the aisle in.</p><p>I looked at everyone at the table. \u201cHello.\u201d</p> <p>Gideon pulled his gaze away from my face. \u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure to introduce you to my wife, Eva.\u201d</p><p>Startled, I turned wide eyes toward him. The world thought we were only engaged. I hadn\u2019t realized he was making the fact that we were married known.</p><p>The heat in his gaze softened to warm amusement. \u201cThese are the board members of the Crossroads Foundation.\u201d</p><p>Shock turned into love and gratitude so fast, I swayed with it. He held me up, as he always did, in all ways. At a time when I was likely to feel a little adrift, he was giving me something else.</p><p>He introduced everyone to me, then pulled out my seat for me. Lunch passed in a whirl of excellent food and intense conversation. I was happy to hear that my idea for adding Crossroads to Gideon\u2019s bio on his website had ramped up traffic to the foundation\u2019s site, and that my suggested overhauls to the Crossroads site\u2014now in place\u2014had increased applications for assistance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And I loved how close Gideon sat to me, holding my hand beneath the table.</p><p>When they asked me for input, I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m not qualified to offer anything valuable at this point. You\u2019re all doing an amazing job.\u201d</p><p>Cindy Bello, the CEO, gave me a big smile. \u201cThank you, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like to sit in on board meetings as an observer and get up to speed. If I can\u2019t contribute ideas, I hope to find another way to lend a hand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow that you mention it,\u201d Lynn Feng, the VP of operations, began, \u201cmany of our recipients want to acknowledge and thank Crossroads for its support. They hold luncheons or dinners, which also act as fund-raisers. They would love to have Gideon accept on behalf of the foundation, but his schedule precludes that most of the time.\u201d</p><p>I leaned briefly into Gideon\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou want me to nudge him some more for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d she smiled, \u201cGideon suggested that you might step in and handle those. We\u2019re talking about you representing the foundation in person.\u201d</p><p>I blinked at her. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p> <p>My gaze turned to Gideon. He tilted his head in acknowledgment.</p><p>I tried to wrap my brain around the idea. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a consolation prize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d Gideon conveyed a wealth of disapproval in that one word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being modest,\u201d I countered. \u201cWhy would anyone want to hear me speak? You\u2019re accomplished, brilliant, and a wonderful orator. I could listen to you give a speech all day. Your name sells tickets. Offering me up instead just creates ... an obligation. That\u2019s not helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you done?\u201d he asked smoothly.</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him.</p> <p>\u201cLook at the people in your life and how you\u2019ve helped them.\u201d Like me. He didn\u2019t say it, but he didn\u2019t have to. \u201cIf you put your mind to it, you could deliver a powerful message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can add,\u201d Lynn interjected, \u201cwhen Gideon can\u2019t make it, one of us goes instead.\u201d She gestured at the rest of the board members. \u201cHaving a member of the Cross family personally attend would be wonderful. No one would be disappointed.\u201d</p><p>The Cross family. That had me sucking in a sharp breath. I didn\u2019t know if Geoffrey Cross had left any other family members behind. What was indisputable was that Gideon was the most visible reminder of his infamous father.</p><p>My husband didn\u2019t remember the man who was known as a fraudster and coward. What he remembered was a father who had loved and nurtured him. Gideon worked so hard and had achieved so much, driven by the need to change what people associated with the Cross name.</p><p>Now I had the name, too. One day in the future, we would have children who carried it. I had the same responsibility as Gideon to make our surname something our kids would be proud of.</p><p>I looked at Gideon.</p><p>He held my gaze, unwavering and focused. \u201cTwo places at once,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>My heart felt like it was squeezed inside my chest. This was more than I\u2019d expected, sooner than I had expected it. Gideon had gone straight to something personal, something intimate and essential to who he was. Something that meant a great deal to me, as well, and that I could put my own stamp on.</p> <p>He had been waging the war to clear the stain on his name all alone, as he\u2019d had to fight all of his battles. That he trusted me to join him in this, of all things, was a declaration of love as wonderful to me as the ring on my finger.</p><p>My grip on his hand tightened. I tried to show him, with just a look, how touched I was. He lifted our joined hands to his lips, his gaze saying the same thing back to me. I love you.</p><p>Our server came by to clear our plates.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it,\u201d he said aloud. Then he looked at the others. \u201cI hate to cut this short, but I have an afternoon meeting coming up. I could be generous and leave Eva with you, but I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Smiles and laughter went around the table.</p><p>He looked at me. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute,\u201d I murmured, looking forward to the opportunity to kiss him the way I needed to.</p><p>From the glimmer in his eyes, I suspected he knew exactly what I was thinking.</p><p>Lynn and Cindy both pushed to their feet and came along to the ladies\u2019 room.</p><p>As we made our way through the restaurant, I looked for Arnoldo but didn\u2019t see him. That didn\u2019t surprise me, considering his commitments with the Food Network and other appearances. As much as I wanted to try to repair that relationship, I knew time would tell. Eventually, Arnoldo would see how much I loved my husband, that protecting him and being everything to him was the center of my life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gideon and I challenged each other. We pushed each other to change and grow. Sometimes, we hurt each other to accomplish something or make a point, which worried Dr. Petersen but somehow was working for us. We could forgive each other for anything except betrayal.</p><p>It was inevitable that others, especially those close to us, would look at us from the outside and wonder how and why it worked, and whether it should. They couldn\u2019t understand\u2014and I didn\u2019t blame them because I was only just starting to really grasp it myself\u2014that we pushed ourselves harder than we ever pushed each other. Because we wanted to be the best possible versions of ourselves, to be strong enough to be what the other needed.</p><p>I used the restroom, then washed my hands, taking a moment to look in the mirror when I was done and fluff my hair. I wasn\u2019t sure how Mario had done it, but he\u2019d given me a cut that gained more body the more I touched it.</p><p>I caught Cindy\u2019s smile in the mirror and felt a little self-conscious. Then she pulled out a tube of bright red lipstick and I relaxed.</p> <p>\u201cEva. I almost didn\u2019t recognize you. I love what you\u2019ve done with your hair.\u201d</p><p>Through the mirror, I looked for the person speaking to me. For a split second, I thought it was Corinne and my heart rate kicked up. Then I homed in on the face.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Turning, I faced Ryan Landon\u2019s wife. When I\u2019d first met Angela, she had worn her hair in an artful chignon, which disguised the length of her hair. With it down, the long black strands hung in a straight curtain that reached the middle of her back. She was tall and slender, her eyes a muted blue-gray. Her face was longer than Corinne\u2019s and her features a bit less perfect, but she was still a knockout.</p><p>Her gaze assessed me so casually from head to toe I couldn\u2019t swear that was what she had done. Nice trick. I hadn\u2019t mastered it. It dawned on me that I would be constantly scrutinized by more than just the media as I took my place in the city\u2019s new elite. I wasn\u2019t ready. My mother\u2019s debutante training and rules weren\u2019t going to help me, that was for damn sure.</p><p>Angela smiled and took the sink next to me. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d Now that I was armed with the knowledge of Landon\u2019s vendetta against Gideon, I was on alert. But I wasn\u2019t trying to land her husband\u2019s account anymore. We were equals. Well, almost. My husband was younger, richer, and hotter. And she knew it.</p><p>Cindy and Lynn finished up and started moving toward the exit. I fell into step with them.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering\u2014\u201d Angela began.</p><p>I paused and looked at her inquisitively. Giving us privacy, the other gals left.</p><p>\u201c\u2014if you\u2019ll be attending the Grey Isles show this week? Your close friend\u2014the one who\u2019s living with you\u2014he\u2019s the face of their latest campaign, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>It was hard, but I kept my face straight. Why ask me that? What was she getting at? I couldn\u2019t tell because her face was clear and innocent, with no sign of guile. Maybe I was looking for a hidden objective that wasn\u2019t there. Or I just didn\u2019t have the skill set I needed to play her game as well as she did.</p> <p>Because she was obviously paying attention to me. Not just my relationship with Gideon, but all my relationships. She was following the gossip. Why?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have plans to attend any of the Fashion Week shows,\u201d I replied carefully.</p><p>Her smile faded but her eyes lit up, putting me further on edge. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame. I thought we might go together.\u201d</p><p>I still couldn\u2019t get a read on her, which was driving me a little nuts. She\u2019d seemed nice enough when I met her the first time, but then she had been quiet, letting her husband and the rest of the LanCorp team do all the talking. Would she say outright that her husband had a hatred for mine? Neither she nor Landon had given me any clue there was animosity with Gideon. But then again, it wasn\u2019t something that would come up during a request-for-proposal meeting.</p><p>Or maybe she didn\u2019t know ...? Maybe Landon\u2019s drive for vengeance was something he kept to himself.</p><p>\u201cNot this time,\u201d I said. I deliberately kept the door open because I might be able to use it. She could be as clueless and innocuous as she seemed or she could be more cunning. Either way, I wouldn\u2019t be making friends with anyone whose husband wished Gideon harm, but Keep your enemies closer was an adage for a reason.</p><p>She dried her hands quickly and walked with me the rest of the way to the exit. \u201cMaybe some other time.\u201d</p><p>After the relative quiet of the bathroom, the restaurant was boisterous and noisy, filled with the sounds of voices and clinking silverware atop background music.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We\u2019d just stepped out of the hallway into the main dining room when Ryan Landon climbed out of his booth and stood in front of us. There really wasn\u2019t a bad seat in the house, but Landon\u2019s wasn\u2019t great. Had Gideon known he would be dining at Tableau One? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. After all, my husband had once tracked me down via a credit card I used at one of his nightclubs.</p><p>Landon was tall, though not as tall as Gideon. Six feet, maybe, with wavy brown hair and eyes the color of amber. He was alpha-fit and attractive, with an easy smile and quick laugh. I\u2019d found him charming when I met him and attentive to his wife.</p><p>\u201cEva,\u201d he said in greeting, his gaze briefly sliding past me to where his wife stood at my back. \u201cWhat a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Ryan.\u201d I wished I could\u2019ve caught the look that passed between them. If they were colluding against me, I really needed to know.</p> <p>\u201cI was just talking about you earlier today. Heard that you\u2019ve left Waters Field and Leaman.\u201d</p><p>The warning tingles that hit me in the bathroom intensified. I wasn\u2019t prepared to play these dangerous social games. Gideon had the skill to take on anyone\u2014hell, he ruled the playing field\u2014but I didn\u2019t. It took a lot of effort not to look over and see if he was watching us.</p><p>On new ground, I winged it. \u201cI miss it already, but then Gideon and I are attached to Mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve heard great things about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe really knows his stuff. It was while Mark was working on the Kingsman Vodka campaign that I met Gideon.\u201d</p> <p>Landon\u2019s brows shot up. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have guessed that.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re in great hands. Mark is the best. I\u2019d be more sad about leaving if I didn\u2019t know that we\u2019ll be working with him again.\u201d</p><p>He visibly regrouped. \u201cWell ... We\u2019ve decided to let LanCorp\u2019s in-house team run with it. They really felt like they could knock it out of the park and since that\u2019s what I hired them to do, I figured I better let them do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. I look forward to seeing what they come up with.\u201d I took a step away. \u201cIt was great seeing you both again. Enjoy your lunch.\u201d</p><p>They wished me good-bye and I turned toward my table, noting that Gideon was deep in conversation with the board members. I thought he wasn\u2019t aware of me approaching, but he stood just before I reached the table without even looking.</p><p>We said farewell and left the restaurant, with Gideon\u2019s hand at the small of my back. I loved when he touched me there, the pressure steady and guiding. Possessive.</p> <p>Angus waited at the curb with the Bentley. So did the paparazzi, who took the opportunity to get plenty of shots of us. It was a relief to settle in the backseat and blend into traffic.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d</p><p>The rough timbre of Gideon\u2019s voice sent goose bumps racing across my skin. I glanced at him, saw the fire in his eyes. Then his hands were cupping my face and his lips were slanting across mine. I gasped, startled by his sudden hunger. His tongue stroked deep into my mouth, stirring the need for him that always simmered in my blood.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he said, his hands pushing into my hair. \u201cYou\u2019re always changing. I never know who I\u2019m going to have from one day to the next.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, leaning into him and kissing him back with everything I had. I adored the feel of his mouth, the sensual lines softened from their usual sternness when he surrendered to me, making him even more gorgeous. \u201cGotta keep you on your toes, ace.\u201d</p><p>Gideon pulled me into his lap, his hands sliding all over me. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope so,\u201d I whispered, tracing his bottom lip with the tip of my tongue. \u201cYou\u2019re stuck with me for life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long enough.\u201d Tilting his head, he took my mouth again, his hand at my nape holding me still as he licked strong and quick. Like fucking. I felt the brush of his tongue everywhere.</p> <p>I squirmed, achingly aware of Angus. \u201cGideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to the penthouse,\u201d he breathed, as tempting as the devil. His cock was hard against my buttocks, teasing me with the promise of sex and sin and pleasure too great to bear.</p><p>\u201cYou have a meeting,\u201d I panted.</p><p>\u201cFuck the meeting.\u201d</p><p>I bit back another laugh and hugged him, pressing my nose in the crook of his neck to breathe him in. He smelled amazing, as he always did. Gideon didn\u2019t wear cologne. There was just the clean, primal smell of his skin and faint traces of the body wash he preferred.</p><p>\u201cI love the way you smell,\u201d I told him softly, nuzzling against him. He was so warm, his body so hot and hard, pulsing with life and energy and power. \u201cThere\u2019s something about it. It touches something inside me. It\u2019s one of the things that tells me you\u2019re mine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He growled. \u201cI\u2019m so fucking hard,\u201d he said, his lips to my ear. He nipped my lobe, punishing me for his lust with a small bite of pain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so fucking wet,\u201d I whispered back. \u201cYou made me so happy today.\u201d</p><p>His chest expanded on an unsteady breath, his hands running up and down my back. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>I pulled back, watching as he steadied himself. He so rarely lost control. It was thrilling I could do that to him. Even more thrilling to know he\u2019d been riding that edge since I first showed up and he hadn\u2019t shown any outward clue to the others. His restraint was a major turn-on for me.</p> <p>My fingertips brushed over his striking face. \u201cThank you. It\u2019s not enough for what you gave me today, but thank you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes closed. He leaned his forehead against mine. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you like my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like when you feel confident and sexy.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my nose against his, my love for him filling me until there was no room for anything else. \u201cWhat if I need purple hair to feel that way?\u201d</p> <p>His mouth curved. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be fucking a purple-haired wife.\u201d His hand covered my heart\u2014and took the opportunity to squeeze my breast. \u201cAs long as the inside remains the same, the rest is just wrapping.\u201d</p><p>I thought about telling him he was straying perilously close to being romantic but decided to keep that to myself.</p><p>\u201cDid you see the Landons?\u201d I asked instead.</p><p>Gideon pulled back. \u201cThey talked to you.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed. \u201cYou knew they\u2019d be there, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a surprise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so good at being cagey,\u201d I complained. \u201cAll you guys are. I couldn\u2019t figure out if Angela Landon was yanking my chain when she asked to attend the Grey Isles Fashion Week show with me or if she was serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little of both. What did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m not going.\u201d I kissed him, then squirmed back onto my own seat. He resisted, but let me go. \u201cCorinne would\u2019ve known how to manage her.\u201d I sighed. \u201cProbably Magdalene, too. Certainly my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did fine. What about Landon?\u201d</p><p>My lips pursed. \u201cHow tightly do you have Mark locked in?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a quizzical look. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mentioned we have a strong connection with Mark, since you and I met while you were working with him. I said we look forward to working with him in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to see if Landon will offer Mark a job.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m curious to see how far Landon will go, yes. I\u2019m not worried about Mark. He\u2019s loyal and while he doesn\u2019t know the particulars, he knows LanCorp is part of the reason I quit. Plus, he\u2019s got an in with the head honcho at Cross Industries. He\u2019d just be a drone at LanCorp. He\u2019s not stupid.\u201d</p><p>Gideon settled back in his seat. If I didn\u2019t know him so well, I might have thought he was just getting comfortable. \u201cAnd you want to see if I was straight with you about Landon\u2019s motives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I set my hand on his thigh and felt the tension there. Both of his parents had let him down. I knew there was a part of Gideon that invariably expected everyone else to do the same. \u201cI believe you. I believed you when you told me. Your word is all the proof I\u2019ll ever need.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me for a long minute, then squeezed my hand. Hard. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut maybe you felt the need to prove it to me?\u201d I asked gently. \u201cYou find out Landon\u2019s got a reservation. You want to introduce me to the Crossroads board. Meeting at Tableau One accomplishes two things if I run into Landon while I\u2019m there. Although there was a lot left to faith for that to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if he\u2019s seated by the bathrooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I wouldn\u2019t have gone to the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>Gideon shot me a look.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a foregone conclusion,\u201d I argued.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a woman,\u201d he countered, as if that answered everything.</p><p>My eyes narrowed. \u201cSometimes I just want to smack you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help being right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re deflecting.\u201d</p><p>His lips tightened for a moment. \u201cYou left me because of him. I needed you to see him again after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not entirely accurate, but okay. I see what you were after.\u201d A little frustrated, I pushed my new bangs out of my face. \u201cI still couldn\u2019t get a sense of them, though. He\u2019s a little easier to read than his wife, but they both play sincere very well. And they\u2019re a team.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou and I are a team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting there.

I wouldn\u2019t care if you have green hair or purple hair or whatever color you choose, although I\u2019ll say I like it blond. You\u2019re what I want.\u201d</p><p>Turning my head, I kissed his palm. \u201cAngela looks like Corinne.\u201d</p><p>He huffed out a surprised laugh. \u201cNo, she does not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, she totally does! I mean, not like twins or anything. But the hair and the body type.\u201d</p><p>Gideon shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think Landon went for someone who looks like your ideal woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think your imagination is running away with you.\u201d He put his fingers over my lips when I would\u2019ve said more. \u201cAnd if not, he got it wrong, so the point is moot.\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my nose at him. My clutch vibrated next to my thigh and I reached for it, pulling my phone out.</p><p>There was a text from Ra\u00fal. She\u2019s at work.</p><p>I glanced at Gideon and found him watching me.</p><p>\u201cI asked Ra\u00fal to track down Anne today,\u201d I told him.</p> <p>He muttered something under his breath. \u201cYou\u2019re damned stubborn,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>\u201cAs you pointed out, I feel confident and sexy.\u201d I blew him a kiss. \u201cIt\u2019s a good day to say hi.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lifted to the rearview mirror. Angus met his gaze and something passed between them. Then my husband turned his brilliantly blue gaze back to me. \u201cYou\u2019ll do whatever Angus says. If he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea when the time comes, you back off. Understood?\u201d</p><p>It took me a beat to reply, because I\u2019d expected more pushback. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll come to the penthouse tonight for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did this become a negotiation?\u201d</p><p>He just looked at me, implacable and unwavering.</p><p>\u201cI told Cary I\u2019d take him out to dinner, ace. He\u2019s been making calls for me today while I\u2019ve been with you. You\u2019re welcome to come along.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, thanks. Come over afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you behave?\u201d</p><p>His eyes sparkled with mischief. \u201cOnly if you do.\u201d</p><p>I figured if he could have a sense of humor about it, we were making progress. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>We pulled up in front of the Crossfire and Gideon straightened, preparing to get out. As Angus rounded the car to open the door, I leaned forward and offered my mouth. Cupping my face in both hands, Gideon kissed me, his lips firm and possessive. Unlike the melt-my-panties kiss he\u2019d given me when we left Tableau One, this one was sweeter. And thorough.</p><p>I was breathless when he pulled away.</p><p>He studied me a moment, then gave a satisfied nod. \u201cCall my cell as soon as you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Gideon slid out of the back of the Bentley and strode into the Crossfire.</p><p>I watched him until I couldn\u2019t see him anymore, remembering the first day we met. I\u2019d been inside the lobby then and he\u2019d come back for me. I kept that in mind, knowing it was senseless to feel bereft now, but it was never easy watching him walk away. That was one of my many flaws and something I would have to get over.</p><p>I miss you already, I texted to him.</p><p>His reply was quick. I\u2019m glad, angel mine.</p><p>I was laughing as Angus slid in behind the wheel. He looked at me through the rearview mirror. \u201cWhere to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWherever Anne Lucas works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe may be working for hours yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured. I\u2019ve got a few things I can handle while I wait. If I run out of things to do, we\u2019ll try again some other time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d He started the Bentley and took off.</p><p>I called Cary.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he answered. \u201cHow was lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was good.\u201d I caught him up.</p><p>\u201cEventful,\u201d he said when I finished. \u201cCan\u2019t say I get the whole Landon thing, but then I don\u2019t understand much of what goes on with your old man. Is there anyone not pissed off at him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, but you\u2019re not banging him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCary, I\u2019m going to kill you, I swear.\u201d</p><p>His low chuckle rippled over the line. \u201cI got in touch with Blaire. He said he can meet you at the penthouse tomorrow if you like. Just text him a window of time and he\u2019ll see what he can do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSweet.

She\u2019s champing at the bit to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call her. You figure out where we\u2019re going to dinner yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like Asian.

I\u2019ve got one more thing to do, then I\u2019ll head back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p><p>I killed the call as Angus slid into a spot by the curb.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s her office across the street,\u201d he explained, directing my attention to the brick-faced building on my side. It had several stories and a small, neat lobby visible through glass doors.</p><p>I checked it out briefly, imagining her inside with a patient, someone who was baring their most personal secrets without knowing who they were really talking to. That was the way it worked. The mental health professional we trusted knew everything about us, while we only knew what we could discern from photos on desks and degrees on walls.</p><p>Scrolling through my contacts, I found Kristin\u2019s number and called her office. Her assistant put me through straightaway.</p><p>\u201cHi, Eva. I had you on my list to call, but your friend beat me to it. I\u2019ve been trying to reach you for a few days now, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I saw the pictures of you and Cross at the beach. I don\u2019t blame you for not calling back. We do need to get together, though, and nail down some details.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeptember twenty-second is the date.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cOkay. Wow.\u201d</p><p>I winced, knowing I was asking a lot on incredibly short notice. And that it was going to cost a pretty penny to get it done in time. \u201cI\u2019ve decided my mom\u2019s right about the white, cream, and gold palette, so let\u2019s run with that. I\u2019d like small accents of red. For example, I\u2019ll have a neutral bouquet, but my jewelry will be rubies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh. Let me think. Maybe red damask skirts beneath white tablecloths ...? Or Murano glass chargers under crystal plates ... I\u2019ll pull together some options.\u201d She blew out her breath. \u201cI really have to see the location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can arrange for a flight down. When can you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as possible,\u201d Kristen said briskly. \u201cI\u2019m tied up tomorrow evening, but the morning would work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll work it out and send you the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye out for it. Eva ... do you have your dress?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh ... no.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. When she spoke again, the tension I\u2019d heard before was gone. \u201cI completely understand wanting to hurry things along with a man like yours, but more time would help make sure everything runs smoothly and you have your perfect day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be perfect no matter what might go wrong.\u201d I rubbed the back of my ring with my thumb, taking comfort from its presence on my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s Gideon\u2019s birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew. Okay, then. We\u2019ll make it happen.\u201d</p><p>My mouth curved. \u201cThank you. Talk to you soon.\u201d</p><p>I hung up and looked at the building across the street. Next door was a small caf\u00e9. I\u2019d walk over and get a latte after I contacted the designer.</p><p>I sent Gideon a text. Who should I talk to about flying the wedding planner down to the Outer Banks house tomorrow AM?</p><p>It felt a little weird to ask the question. Who would\u2019ve thought I\u2019d ever have private jets at my disposal? I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever be blas\u00e9 about using them.</p><p>I waited a minute for a reply. When it didn\u2019t come, I called Blaire Ash.</p><p>\u201cHi, Blaire,\u201d I said, when he answered. \u201cIt\u2019s Eva Tramell, Gideon Cross\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva. Of course I know who you are.\u201d His voice was warm and friendly. \u201cIt\u2019s good to hear from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to go over some of the design details with you. Cary said you can meet tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. What time works for you?\u201d</p><p>Thinking of the trip to the Outer Banks with Kristin, I answered, \u201cWould evening work? Say six-ish?\u201d</p><p>Gideon would be with Dr. Petersen until at least seven o\u2019clock. Then he\u2019d have to commute home. That gave me enough time to switch some things up with our design plans.</p><p>\u201cThat works for me,\u201d Blair agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the penthouse?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll see you there. Thanks. Bye.\u201d</p><p>The second I ended the call, my phone buzzed. Looking at the screen, I saw Gideon\u2019s reply: Scott\u2019s making the arrangements.</p><p>I chewed my lower lip, feeling bad for not going through Scott first. I\u2019ll ask him next time. Thank you! \u263a</p><p>I took a deep breath, feeling like I should reach out to Gideon\u2019s mother, Elizabeth.</p> <p>In the front seat, Angus\u2019s phone pinged. He lifted it, then looked back at me. \u201cShe\u2019s on her way down in the elevator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Surprise turned to bafflement. How did he know that? I glanced at the building again. Did Gideon own that one, too? Like he owned the building her husband worked in?</p><p>\u201cHere, lass.\u201d Angus reached into the backseat and offered a small black disk the size of a quarter and three times as thick. \u201cIt\u2019s sticky on one side. Tuck that into the strap of your dress.\u201d</p><p>I shoved my phone in my purse and took the disk, staring at it. \u201cWhat is this? A microphone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s either that or I come with you.\u201d He gave me an apologetic smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not you that\u2019s the worry, it\u2019s her.\u201d</p> <p>Since I had nothing to hide, I stuck the mic inside my bra and hopped out of the back when Angus opened the door. He grabbed my arm securely, then hurried me across the street.</p><p>He winked at me before retreating to the caf\u00e9.</p><p>I was suddenly standing alone on the sidewalk, struck by a wicked case of nerves. They were gone a second later when Anne pushed out of the lobby. Dressed in a leopard-print wrap dress and black Louboutins, she looked fierce and vibrant with her spiky red hair.</p><p>Tucking my clutch under my arm, I started walking toward her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the chances?\u201d I asked, as I got close to her.</p><p>She glanced at me, her hand raised to hail a cab. For a moment, there was blankness on her foxlike face, and then recognition hit her. Her shock was worth the price of admission. Her arm fell to her side.</p> <p>I gave her a once-over. \u201cYou should ditch the wig you\u2019ve been wearing around Cary. The short hair suits you better.\u201d</p><p>Anne recovered quickly. \u201cEva. Don\u2019t you look pretty? Gideon is polishing you up nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he polishes me a lot. Every chance he gets.\u201d That got her attention. \u201cCan\u2019t get enough, actually. He\u2019s got nothing left for you, so I suggest you find someone else to be crazy over.\u201d</p><p>Her face hardened. I realized I\u2019d never seen true hatred before. Even in the heat of the New York summer, I felt a chill.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so clueless\u201d\u2014she stepped closer\u2014\u201cwhen he\u2019s probably fucking someone else at this very moment. That\u2019s who he is and what he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea who he is.\u201d I hated having to tilt my head back to look up at her. \u201cI don\u2019t have any worries about him. You, however, should be worried about me. Because if you come near him or Cary again, you\u2019ll be dealing with me. It won\u2019t be pleasant.\u201d</p><p>I turned away from her. I\u2019d done what I came to do.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a monster,\u201d she called out. \u201cDid he tell you he\u2019s been in therapy since he was a child?\u201d</p> <p>That stopped me. I rounded on her.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cHe\u2019s been broken from birth. He\u2019s sick and twisted in ways he hasn\u2019t shown you yet. He\u2019s thinking he can hide it from you, his pretty little girl who creates just the right fairy tale. Beauty and the beast for the masses. A clever cover-up, but it won\u2019t hold. He can\u2019t suppress his true nature for long.\u201d</p><p>My God ... Did she know about Hugh?</p><p>How could she know that Gideon was a victim of her brother\u2019s perversions and have sex with him anyway? It made me so sick to think of it, bile rose in my throat.</p><p>Her laugh slid over me like shards of glass. \u201cGideon is vicious and cruel at his core. He\u2019ll break you before he\u2019s done with you. If he doesn\u2019t kill you first.\u201d</p><p>My back straightened, my hands fisting at my sides. I was so angry I was shaking with it, fighting the urge to punch her in her smug, nasty face.</p><p>\u201cWho do you think monsters marry, you stupid bitch?\u201d I walked back to her. \u201cPretty little breakable girls? Or other monsters?\u201d</p><p>I pushed up into her face. \u201cYou got the fairy tale right. But Gideon\u2019s the beauty. I\u2019m the beast.\u201d</p><p>6</p><p>\u201cYou think Gideon\u2019s scary? Wait \u2019til you get a load of me.\u201d</p><p>I sat still as stone for a long minute, Eva\u2019s voice echoing in my ears as the recording ended. My gaze lifted from my desk to Angus\u2019s face. \u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>We had looked for any case files Hugh might\u2019ve kept about me. None were found and we assumed he hadn\u2019t kept records. It made sense. Why document your crimes? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll look again,\u201d Angus said quietly. \u201cHer homes and office. Her husband\u2019s office. Everywhere. I\u2019ll find them.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, pushing back from my desk. I sucked in a deep breath and fought off a wave of nausea. There was nothing I could do but wait.</p><p>I walked to the nearest window and looked at the building that housed LanCorp\u2019s offices.</p><p>\u201cEva handled her well,\u201d he said behind me. \u201cShe put the fear of God in Anne. I saw it on her face.\u201d</p> <p>I had eschewed viewing the available security video footage in favor of listening to the audio of their meeting, but it was enough. I knew my wife, her voice and inflections. Knew her temper. And I knew that nothing roused it as swiftly or ferociously as when she was leaping to my defense.</p><p>Over the short time we\u2019d been together, Eva had managed direct confrontations with Corinne at her home, my mother on multiple occasions, Terrence Lucas at his office, and now his wife at hers. I knew my wife felt she had to, which was why I\u2019d forced myself to step back and let her do it.</p><p>I didn\u2019t need defending. Could take care of myself just fine on my own, as I always had. But it felt good to know I wasn\u2019t on my own any longer. Better still to know she could look crazy in the face and frighten it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a tigress.\u201d I faced him. \u201cI\u2019ve got a few badges of honor from her scratches myself.\u201d</p><p>The hard, tense line of Angus\u2019s shoulders relaxed slightly. \u201cShe\u2019ll stand by you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf my past goes public? Yes, she will.\u201d</p><p>As I said the words, I realized how true they were. There had been times in our relationship when I hadn\u2019t been certain I could hold on to Eva. I loved my wife and had no doubts she loved me as deeply, but as perfect as she was for me, she had her flaws. She doubted herself too often. She believed, at times, that she wasn\u2019t strong enough to face certain situations. And when she felt her independence and equanimity threatened, she ran away to protect herself.</p><p>My gaze went to the picture of her on my desk. Things had changed and only recently. She\u2019d pushed me to the edge, cutting me off from the one thing I could not live without\u2014her. I\u2019d tumbled off that edge reluctantly, forced to do so to get her back. The result: She no longer looked at our marriage as her and me but us. My initial resentment was gone. No matter what, I would do it again to keep her, but now, I would do it without the push.</p><p>\u201cShe loves that I can take care of her, keep her safe,\u201d I said, mostly to myself. \u201cBut if I lost everything, she\u2019d still be here. It\u2019s me she wants, as fucked up as I am.\u201d</p><p>The money ... the public image ... They weren\u2019t important to her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fucked up, lad. Too pretty for your own good, to be certain.\u201d Angus\u2019s mouth twisted wryly. \u201cAnd ye\u2019ve made some dubious choices when it comes to the lasses, but who hasn\u2019t? Hard to say nay when you\u2019re randy and they\u2019re lifting their skirts.\u201d</p> <p>Amused by his blunt comments, I pushed thoughts of Anne Lucas aside. Worrying would get me nowhere. Angus would do what he was so very good at. I would focus on my wife and our life as it now was.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Eva now?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cRa\u00fal is driving her to Parker Smith\u2019s studio in Brooklyn.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, understanding that Eva needed to work off some steam. \u201cThank you, Angus.\u201d</p><p>He left and I returned to my desk to get my day back on track. I\u2019d shuffled a dozen things to fit in the Crossroads lunch with Eva and now I had to catch up.</p><p>My smartphone buzzed, rattling atop the smoked glass of my desktop. I glanced at it, hoping to see Eva\u2019s face on the screen and seeing my sister, Ireland\u2019s, instead. I felt a familiar momentary twinge of discomfort, something mildly akin to panic, just before I answered the call.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t see how being in my teenage sister\u2019s life benefited her at all, but Eva felt it was important for some reason and so I made the effort for her.</p><p>\u201cIreland. To what do I owe the pleasure?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGideon.\u201d She hiccupped violently, her voice clogged with tears.</p><p>I immediately tensed, the first surge of fury bristling along my spine. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI c-came home from school and Dad was waiting for me. They\u2019re getting a divorce.\u201d</p><p>I circled my desk and sank into my chair. The anger drained away.</p><p>Before I could say anything, she rushed on.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand!\u201d She wept. \u201cA couple weeks ago everything was fine. Then they started arguing all the time and Dad moved into a hotel. Something happened but neither of them will tell me what it is! Mom won\u2019t stop crying. Dad doesn\u2019t, but his eyes are always red when I see him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My stomach knotted up all over again. My breath came fast and quick.</p><p>Chris knew. About Hugh and me. About Terrence Lucas\u2019s lies, covering up his brother-in-law\u2019s crime. About my mother\u2019s refusal to believe me, to fight for me, to save me.</p><p>\u201cIreland ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s having an affair? He\u2019s the one instigating all of this. Mom says he\u2019s confused. She says he\u2019ll come around, but I don\u2019t think so. He acts like his mind is totally made up. Can you talk to him?\u201d</p> <p>I gripped the phone too tightly. \u201cAnd say what?\u201d</p><p>Hello, Chris. Sorry I was raped and your wife can\u2019t handle it. Bummer about the divorce. No chance you could forgive her and live happily ever after?</p><p>Just thinking about Chris going on with his life, with his wife, as if nothing had happened filled me with rage. Someone knew. Someone cared. Someone couldn\u2019t live with it any more than I. I wouldn\u2019t change that even if I could.</p><p>Something small and cold inside me enjoyed the reckoning. Finally.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be something, Gideon! People don\u2019t go from being madly in love to filing for divorce in less than a month!\u201d</p> <p>God. I rubbed at the back of my neck, where a vicious headache clawed at me. \u201cMaybe counseling.\u201d</p><p>A harsh, humorless laugh burned in my throat, silenced. A therapist had started all of this. How fucking ironic for me to suggest seeing another one to figure it out.</p><p>Ireland sniffled. \u201cMom said Dad suggested it, but she won\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>The mirthless snicker escaped me then. What would Dr. Petersen say if he could see into that mind of hers? Would he pity her? Feel disgust? Anger? Maybe he wouldn\u2019t feel anything at all. I was no different from any other molested child and she was no different from any other weak, self-absorbed woman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ireland.\u201d Sorrier than I could ever tell her. How would she feel about me if she knew this was all my fault? Maybe she would hate me, too, like our brother Christopher.</p><p>The thought tightened my chest like a vise.</p> <p>Christopher couldn\u2019t stand me, but he loved Ireland and was invested in the relationship between their parents. I was the outsider. Always had been. \u201cHave you talked to Christopher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s as torn up as Mom is. I mean, I\u2019m a mess, but the two of them ... I\u2019ve never seen them so upset.\u201d</p><p>I pushed to my feet again, too restless to sit. What should I do, Eva? What could I say? Why aren\u2019t you here when I need you?</p><p>\u201cYour father isn\u2019t having an affair,\u201d I said, offering her what comfort I could. \u201cHe\u2019s not the type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did he file for divorce?\u201d</p><p>I exhaled roughly. \u201cWhy does anyone quit a marriage? It\u2019s not working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter all these years, he decides he\u2019s not happy and that\u2019s it? He quits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe suggested therapy and she said no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo it\u2019s her fault he\u2019s suddenly got a problem with her?\u201d</p><p>The voice was Ireland\u2019s, but the words were my mother\u2019s. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to find someone to blame, I won\u2019t help with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t care if they stay together. You probably think it\u2019s stupid I\u2019m so upset at my age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. You have every right to be upset.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the door to my office when Scott appeared on the other side of it, nodding to acknowledge him when he tapped the face of his watch. He went back to his desk.</p><p>\u201cThen help them fix it, Gideon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. I don\u2019t know why you think I can do anything.\u201d</p><p>She started crying again.</p><p>I cursed silently, hating to hear her in so much pain, knowing I\u2019d caused some of it. \u201cSweetheart ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you at least try to talk some sense into them?\u201d</p><p>My eyes closed. I was the goddamned problem, which made it impossible for me to be part of the solution. But I couldn\u2019t say that. \u201cI\u2019ll call them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She sniffled again. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>A small sound escaped me, the blow of her words sending me reeling. She hung up before I could find my voice, leaving me with the sense of an opportunity lost.</p><p>I set my phone back down on my desk and fought the urge to throw it across the room.</p><p>Scott opened the door and poked his head in. \u201cEveryone\u2019s ready for you in the conference room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, Mr. Vidal would like you to call him when you can.\u201d</p><p>I gave a curt nod but growled inwardly at the sound of my stepfather\u2019s name. \u201cI\u2019ll get back to him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was nearing nine in the evening when Ra\u00fal texted me to let me know Eva was on her way up to the penthouse. I left my home office and went to meet her in the foyer, my brows arching in surprise when she stepped out holding a big box in both hands. Ra\u00fal stood behind her carrying a duffel bag.</p><p>She grinned at me as I took the box from her. \u201cBrought some stuff to invade your space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvade away,\u201d I told her, captivated by the bright, mischievous light in her gray eyes.</p><p>Ra\u00fal deposited the duffel on the living room floor, then slipped away quietly, leaving us alone. I followed Eva with my gaze, taking in the dark jeans that hugged every curve and the loose silk blouse she\u2019d tucked into them. She was wearing flats, which left her nearly a foot shorter than I was in my bare feet. Her hair fell around her shoulders, framing her face, which was scrubbed free of makeup.</p> <p>She tossed her purse onto the wingback chair nearest the front door. As she kicked off her shoes by the coffee table, she looked at me, her gaze sliding over my bare chest and black silk pajama bottoms. \u201cYou said you were going to behave, ace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, considering I haven\u2019t even kissed you yet, I think I\u2019m being very well behaved.\u201d I walked to the dining room table and set the box down, looking inside it to see a collection of framed photos swathed in bubble wrap. \u201cHow was dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTasty. I wish Tatiana weren\u2019t pregnant, but I think it\u2019s making Cary reevaluate and grow up a little bit. That\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p><p>I knew better than to offer my opinion on that, so I just gave a nod. \u201cShould I open a bottle of wine?\u201d</p><p>Her smile lit up the room. \u201cThat would be great.\u201d</p> <p>When I returned to the living room a few moments later, I found the fireplace mantel decorated with a collection of photographs. The montage I\u2019d given her to keep at work was there, showcasing images of us together. There were also pictures of Cary, Monica, Stanton, Victor, and Ireland.</p><p>And a framed image of my father and me on the shore long ago, one that I\u2019d shared with her when we signed the purchase contract on the beach house in the Outer Banks.</p><p>I sipped from my glass, taking in the change. There were no other personal items in the main living space, so the alteration was ... profound. She\u2019d also chosen brilliantly colored mosaic glass frames, which sparkled and drew the eye.</p><p>\u201cAre your bachelor self-preservation warnings going off yet?\u201d Eva teased, taking the glass I held out to her.</p><p>Amused, I glanced at her. \u201cIt\u2019s too late to scare me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that? I\u2019m just getting started.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d She shrugged, then took a drink of the pinot noir I\u2019d selected. \u201cI was willing to pacify you with a blowjob, if you started freaking out.\u201d</p><p>My dick thickened and lengthened. \u201cNow that you mention it ... I am feeling a little cold sweat\u2014\u201d</p><p>A furry ball rolled out from beneath the coffee table, jolting me so hard I nearly spilled red wine onto the Aubusson rug beneath my feet. \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>The ball shook itself out and became a puppy not much bigger in size than my shoes. It stumbled toward me on shaky legs. Mostly black and tan with a white belly, it had huge ears that flopped around a sweet face alight with joy and excitement.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s yours,\u201d my wife said, with laughter in her voice. \u201cIsn\u2019t he adorable?\u201d</p><p>Speechless, I watched as the tiny dog made it to my feet and began licking my toes.</p><p>\u201cAww, he likes you.\u201d She set her glass onto the coffee table and sank down on her knees, reaching out to rub the puppy\u2019s silky head.</p> <p>Confused, I looked around and noticed what I hadn\u2019t before. The duffel bag Ra\u00fal had carried in had ventilation mesh on the top and sides.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you should see your face!\u201d Eva laughed and picked up the dog, rising to her feet. She took my glass and shoved the puppy at me instead.</p><p>I caught the squirming bundle of fur because I had no choice, arching my head back when it started licking madly at my face. \u201cI can\u2019t have a puppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a puppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva ... No.\u201d</p><p>She took my wine to the sofa and sat, curling her legs beneath her. \u201cNow the penthouse won\u2019t feel so empty until I move in.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her. \u201cI don\u2019t need a dog. I need my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you have both.\u201d She drank from my glass and licked her lips. \u201cWhat will you name him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t have a puppy,\u201d I repeated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eva looked at me serenely. \u201cHe\u2019s an anniversary gift from your wife, you have to keep him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnniversary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been married a month.\u201d She leaned back into the sofa and gave me the fuck-me look. \u201cI was thinking we could go to the beach house and celebrate.\u201d</p><p>I readjusted my hold on the wriggling dog. \u201cCelebrate how?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll access.\u201d</p><p>I was hard instantly, something she didn\u2019t fail to notice.</p><p>Her gaze darkened as it caressed my erection where it tented my pants. \u201cI\u2019m dying, Gideon,\u201d she breathed, her lips and cheeks flushing pink. \u201cI wanted to wait, but I can\u2019t. I need you. And it\u2019s our anniversary. If we can\u2019t make love then and have it be just you, me, and what we have\u2014with no bullshit\u2014then we can\u2019t make love ever and I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her.</p><p>Her lips curved wryly. \u201cIf that makes any sense at all.\u201d</p> <p>The puppy licked my jaw frantically and I hardly noticed, my attention focused on my wife. She just kept surprising me, in all the best ways. \u201cLucky.\u201d</p><p>Her head tilted to the side. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s his name. Lucky.\u201d</p><p>Eva laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re a fiend, ace.\u201d</p><p>By the time Eva went home, I had new dog crates in my bedroom and home office, and fancy water and feed bowls in my kitchen. Puppy food in an airtight plastic storage container sat in my pantry, and plush dog beds took up space in every room in the house. There was even a patch of fake grass, which supposedly Lucky would urinate on\u2014when he wasn\u2019t relieving himself on my priceless rugs, as he\u2019d done not long ago.</p><p>All the items, including treats, toys, and enzymatic sprays for accidents, had been left waiting in the foyer outside the elevator, telling me that my wife had enlisted Ra\u00fal and Angus in her plan to foist a pet on me.</p> <p>I stared at the puppy, who sat at my feet, looking up at me with soft, dark eyes filled with something akin to adoration. \u201cWhat the hell am I supposed to do with a dog?\u201d</p><p>Lucky\u2019s tail wagged so hard, his back end shifted from side to side along with it.</p><p>When I\u2019d asked Eva the same question, she\u2019d laid out her plan: Lucky would ride with me to work, and then Angus would drop him off at doggy daycare\u2014who knew there was such a thing?\u2014and pick him up in time to ride home with me.</p><p>The real answer was written in the note she\u2019d left on my pillow.</p><p>My dearest Dark and Dangerous,</p><p>Dogs are excellent judges of character. I\u2019m certain the adorable beagle you now own will worship you nearly as much as I do, because he\u2019ll see what I see in you: fierce protectiveness, thoughtfulness, and loyalty. You\u2019re an alpha through and through, so he\u2019ll obey you when I don\u2019t. (I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll appreciate that!) In time, you\u2019ll get used to being loved unconditionally by him and me and everyone else in your life.</p><p>Yours always and forever,</p><p>Mrs. X</p> <p>Rising up onto his back legs, Lucky pawed at my shin, whining softly.</p><p>\u201cNeedy little thing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I picked him up and tolerated the inevitable face licking. He smelled faintly of Eva\u2019s perfume, so I pressed my nose into him.</p><p>Owning a pet had never been on my wish list. Then again, neither was having a wife and that was the best thing to ever happen to me.</p><p>Holding Lucky away from me, I eyed him consideringly. Eva had put a red leather collar on him with an engraved brass plate. Happy Anniversary. Next to that was the date of our wedding, so I couldn\u2019t give him away.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re stuck with each other,\u201d I told him, which made him bark and wiggle harder. \u201cYou may regret that more than me.\u201d</p><p>Sitting alone in my bedroom, I can hear Mom yelling. Dad pleads with her, then shouts back. They turned the television on before they slammed their bedroom door shut, but it\u2019s not loud enough to cover their fighting.</p><p>Lately, they fight all the time.</p><p>I pick up the remote to my favorite radio-controlled car and drive it into the wall, over and over. It doesn\u2019t help.</p><p>Mom and Dad love each other. They look at each other for a long time, smiling, like they forget anyone else is around. They touch each other a lot. Holding hands. Kissing. They kiss a lot. It\u2019s gross, but it\u2019s better than the screaming and crying they\u2019ve been doing the last couple of weeks. Even Dad, who\u2019s always smiling and laughing, has been sad. His eyes are red all the time and he hasn\u2019t shaved the hair off his face in days.</p><p>I\u2019m scared they\u2019re going to split up, like my friend Kevin\u2019s parents did.</p><p>The sun goes down slowly, but the fighting doesn\u2019t stop. Mom\u2019s voice is hoarse now and scratchy from tears. Glass breaks. Something heavy hits the wall and makes me jump. It\u2019s been a long time since lunch and my stomach is growling, but I\u2019m not hungry. I really feel like throwing up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The only light in my room comes from the television, which is showing some boring movie I don\u2019t like. I hear my parents\u2019 bedroom door open, then shut. A few minutes later, the front door opens and shuts, too. Our apartment goes all quiet in a way that makes me feel sick again.</p><p>When my bedroom door finally opens, Mom stands there like a shadow with light shining all around her. She asks me why I\u2019m sitting in the dark, but I don\u2019t answer her. I\u2019m mad at her for being so mean to Dad. He never starts the fights, it\u2019s always her. About something she saw on television or read in the paper or heard from her friends. They\u2019re all talking bad about Dad, saying things I know aren\u2019t true.</p><p>My dad isn\u2019t a liar or a thief. Mom should know that. She shouldn\u2019t listen to other people who don\u2019t know him like we do.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d</p> <p>Mom flips the lights on and I jerk in surprise. She\u2019s older. She smells like stale milk and baby powder.</p><p>My room is different. My toys are gone. The carpet beneath me is now a rug over stone floors. My hands are bigger.</p><p>I stand and I\u2019m the same height as her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I snap, crossing my arms.</p><p>\u201cYou have to stop this.\u201d She swipes at the tears streaming from her eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep acting like this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet out.\u201d The sickness in my gut spreads, dampening my palms until I clench them into fists.</p><p>\u201cThese lies have to stop! We have a new life now, a good life. Chris is a good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t have anything to do with Chris,\u201d I bite out, wanting to hit something. I never should have said anything. I don\u2019t know why I thought anyone would believe me.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>I jerked upright, panting, the sheet in my hands tearing violently. It took a moment for the pounding of my blood to subside as I tuned in to the incessant barking that woke me.</p><p>Scrubbing at my face, I cursed, then jumped as Lucky scrambled up the hanging comforter, pulling himself onto the bed. He leaped, tackling me in the chest.</p> <p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, calm down!\u201d</p><p>He whined and curled into my lap, making me feel like a dick.</p><p>I caught him up, holding him against my sweaty chest. \u201cSorry,\u201d I muttered, stroking his head.</p><p>Closing my eyes, I pushed back and leaned against the headboard, willing my pulse to slow. It took several minutes to get my bearings, and about that long to realize that petting Lucky was calming me down.</p><p>I laughed to myself, then reached for my phone on the nightstand. The time, a little after two in the morning, gave me pause. So did the need to be strong, to handle my own crap.</p><p>But a lot had happened since I first called Eva to talk about a nightmare. Good things.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Eva answered, sounding groggy and sexy. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter now that I\u2019m hearing your voice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou having puppy troubles? Or a nightmare? Maybe you\u2019re feeling frisky?\u201d</p><p>Calm settled over me. I\u2019d been braced for a push. Seemed she was going to ease me into it, instead. Yet another reason for me to try harder to give her what she wanted, regardless of my first instincts about it. Because when Eva was happy, I was happy. \u201cMaybe all of the above.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Sheets rustled. \u201cTake it from the top, ace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I latch the crate door, Lucky bitches about it and I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re a softie. He\u2019s got your number. Did you put him in your office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He barks in there and I still can\u2019t sleep. I ended up just closing the crate door without locking it and he settled down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to learn to control his bladder if you don\u2019t crate-train him.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at the beagle curled up and sleeping in my lap. \u201cHe woke me from a nightmare. I think he did it on purpose.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet a minute. \u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>I did and she listened. \u201cHe\u2019d been trying to jump up to the bed earlier and couldn\u2019t make it,\u201d I finished. \u201cHe\u2019s too little and the bed\u2019s too high. But he hauled his ass up here to wake me.\u201d</p><p>Her exhale drifted across the line. \u201cGuess he can\u2019t sleep when you\u2019re making noise, either.\u201d</p><p>It took me a second, then I laughed. The lingering distress from the dream dissipated like smoke in a breeze. \u201cI feel the sudden urge to take you over my knee and spank you, angel.\u201d</p><p>Amusement warmed her voice. \u201cTry it, babe. See what happens.\u201d</p><p>I knew what would happen. She was the one who couldn\u2019t see it. Yet.</p><p>\u201cGoing back to your dream ...\u201d she murmured, \u201cI know I\u2019ve said it before, but I\u2019ll say it again. I really think you need to bring Hugh up to your mother again. I know it\u2019ll be painful, but I think it has to be done.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt won\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d I shifted and Lucky gave a protesting grunt. \u201cI didn\u2019t get around to telling you earlier. Chris filed for divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? When?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I just heard about it today from Ireland. I talked to Chris after work, but he just went over their prenup and let me know that he wanted to make some added concessions. We didn\u2019t discuss his reasons for wanting to end the marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s because he found out about Hugh?\u201d</p><p>I sighed, grateful I could talk to her about it. \u201cI think it\u2019s too much of a coincidence to be totally unrelated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cI think I really love your stepfather.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t say how I felt about Chris. I didn\u2019t know. \u201cWhen I think about my mother being upset about this ... I can picture it, Eva. I\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate it. I hated her like that. It hurt me to see her that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love her. That\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>And I loved Eva. For her lack of judgment. Her unqualified devotion. It gave me the courage to say, \u201cI\u2019m also glad. What kind of asshole feels good that his mother is hurting?\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause. \u201cShe hurt you. She\u2019s still hurting you. It\u2019s a natural animal instinct to want to see her wounded, too. But I think what you\u2019re glad about is having a ... champion. Someone who\u2019s telling her it really did happen to you and it\u2019s not okay.\u201d</p><p>My eyes closed. If I had a champion, it was my wife.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want me to come back over?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I almost said no. My routine after a nightmare was a long shower, followed by losing myself in work. It was what I knew, how I dealt with it. But soon she\u2019d be living with me, sharing my life in a way I needed but wasn\u2019t wholly prepared for. I had to start making adjustments for that.</p><p>More than the logistics, though, was that I wanted her right then. Wanted to see her, smell her, feel her close.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come get you,\u201d I told her. \u201cI\u2019ll take a quick shower and text you before I head out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be ready. I love you, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, let the words flow through me. \u201cI love you, too, angel.\u201d</p><p>I woke again with the sun, feeling rested despite the hours I\u2019d spent awake. Stretching, I felt something warm and furry shift against my arm, then the lash of a friendly tongue against my biceps.</p><p>Opening one eye, I glanced at Lucky. \u201cCan\u2019t you keep that thing in your mouth?\u201d</p> <p>Eva rolled onto her back and smiled, her eyes still closed. \u201cCan\u2019t blame him. You\u2019re extremely, lickably delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring your tongue over here, then.\u201d</p><p>Her head turned my way and her eyes opened. Her hair was mussed and her cheeks pink.</p><p>I grabbed Lucky and tucked him against my stomach as I rolled to my side. Propping my head on one hand, I took in the sight of my sleepy wife, feeling a rare contentment just from starting the day with her in my bed.</p><p>Fact was, I shouldn\u2019t have risked it. Eva hadn\u2019t seen the state of my sheets, since I changed them before leaving to get her, but they were only a small sample of the damage I could cause when sleeping. Neither Lucky nor my wife was safe near me while I was sleeping. It was only because I never had multiple nightmares in one night that I\u2019d taken the chance.</p><p>And because I missed Eva fiercely. She wasn\u2019t alone in her craving.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you called me,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Reaching over, I brushed my fingertips down her cheek. \u201cDidn\u2019t turn out so badly.\u201d</p><p>She moved slightly and kissed my hand.</p><p>Eva saw the worst there was in me and loved me more each time she did. I\u2019d stopped questioning it. I just had to deserve her and I would. I had a lifetime to work on it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not planning any more ambushes on enemies today, are you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She stretched, drawing my eye to where her full tits strained against the ribbed cotton of her tank top. \u201cBut I\u2019m ready if someone decides to ambush me.\u201d</p><p>I dropped Lucky to the floor and snatched Eva close, rolling on top of her. Her legs widened instinctively and I settled between them, circling my hips to rock my cock against her cunt.</p><p>She gasped and grabbed my shoulders, her eyes wide. \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about you, ace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not someone?\u201d I buried my face in the warmth of her neck, nuzzling her. She smelled heavenly, soft and sweet. Totally sexy. Hard, I rubbed against her, feeling the heat of her through her underwear and the silk of my pants. She softened for me, melted in the way that turned me on ferociously. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, her eyes darkening. She reached down and grabbed my ass, digging her nails in, urging me on. \u201cYou\u2019re The One. The only one for me.\u201d</p><p>As luxurious and feminine as Eva was, she\u2019d grown stronger through Krav Maga. That turned me on, too. My head lowered, my mouth brushing over hers. My heart pounded, struggling to accept what she meant to me. The way she made me feel was so fresh and new, yet would never get old.</p><p>Maybe that was why I\u2019d gone through everything I had, so I would be able to appreciate her when I found her. I would never take her for granted.</p><p>A tongue that wasn\u2019t my wife\u2019s licked my side, tickling me. I jerked, cursing, and Eva laughed.</p> <p>I glared over my shoulder at the little offender, who hopped with excitement, tail wagging madly. \u201cListen, Lucky. You\u2019re not living up to your name.\u201d</p><p>Eva giggled. \u201cHe\u2019s helping you live up to your promise to behave.\u201d</p><p>I turned my glare back to the wife whose nails were still firmly dug into my ass. \u201cWhich had the caveat that you behave as well.\u201d</p><p>Pulling her hands away, Eva held them up by her head, waggling her fingers. But her gaze was hot and her lips parted with rapid breaths. She shivered beneath me, even while her skin felt feverish. Her desire for me soothed my own raging need. And her commitment to waiting, now that I knew the reason for it, gave me the strength to move away.</p><p>It was physically painful to separate from her. Her low moan of anguish echoed inside me, reflecting my own. I flopped onto my back and was immediately subjected to a tongue bath, Lucky-style.</p> <p>\u201cHe really loves you.\u201d Eva rolled onto her side and reached out to scratch behind his ears. That had the welcome effect of luring him over to her. Her squeal of laughter as Lucky proceeded to slather her face made me smile despite my aching dick.</p><p>I could complain about the damn dog, lack of sex and sleep, and more. But really, my life was as close to perfect as I could want.</p><p>Once I got to work, I powered through my morning.</p><p>The release of the new GenTen gaming console was imminent and while speculation was rampant, we had managed to keep the virtual reality component a secret. VR was in development everywhere, but Cross Industries was years ahead of the competition. I knew decisively that LanCorp\u2019s PhazeOne system was simply an overhaul, with advanced optics and increased speed. It could compete with the previous-generation GenTen, but that was all.</p><p>Shortly before lunch, I took the time to call my mother.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d She sighed tremulously. \u201cI suppose you heard?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I could tell she was hurting. \u201cIf you need anything, please let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris is the one who suddenly isn\u2019t happy in our marriage,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all my fault, of course.\u201d</p><p>I softened my tone, but spoke firmly. \u201cNot to be insensitive, but the details don\u2019t concern me. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to him.\u201d The plea was heartfelt. Her voice cracked. \u201cTell him he\u2019s made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>I debated how to answer. The assistance I offered was fiduciary, not personal. There was nothing personal left in my relationship with my mother. Still, I found myself saying, \u201cYou won\u2019t want my advice, but I\u2019ll offer it anyway. You might want to consider therapy.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you, of all people, would suggest that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreaching what I practice.\u201d My gaze slid to the photo of my wife, as it so often did during my day. \u201cEva suggested couples counseling shortly after we began dating. She wanted something more out of our relationship. I wanted her, so I agreed. Initially, I was just going through the motions, but now I can say it\u2019s been really worthwhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe started all of this,\u201d she hissed. \u201cYou\u2019re such a smart man, Gideon, but you can\u2019t see what she\u2019s doing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd this is where I say good-bye, Mother,\u201d I replied before she got me riled. \u201cCall if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>I hung up, then spun in my chair, making a slow revolution all the way around. The disappointment and anger that always accompanied interactions with my mother was there, simmering, but I was more aware of it than usual. Maybe because I\u2019d so recently dreamed of her, reliving the moment when I had realized she would never come around, was deliberately choosing to turn a blind eye for reasons I would never comprehend.</p><p>For years, I made excuses for her. I manufactured dozens of reasons for her refusal to protect me to give myself some comfort. Until I realized she was doing the same thing in reverse, making up stories about why I\u2019d lie about being abused so she could live with her decision to pretend it never happened. So I stopped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had failed me as a mother but preferred to believe I\u2019d failed her as a son.</p><p>And so it went.</p><p>When I faced my desk again, I picked up the phone and called my brother.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he answered.</p> <p>I could picture the scowl on his face. A face very unlike mine. Of my mother\u2019s three children, only Christopher resembled his father more than he did our mom.</p><p>His acrimony had the predictable effect of making me want to bait him. \u201cThe pleasure of hearing your voice. What else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the shit, Gideon. Did you call to gloat? Your fondest wish has finally come true.\u201d</p><p>Leaning back in my chair, I looked up at the ceiling. \u201cI\u2019d tell you I\u2019m very sorry your parents are divorcing, but you wouldn\u2019t believe me, so I won\u2019t bother. Instead, I\u2019ll say that I\u2019m here for you, if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to hell.\u201d He hung up.</p> <p>I pulled the receiver away from my ear and held it aloft a moment. Contrary to Christopher\u2019s belief, I hadn\u2019t always disliked him. There had been a time when I welcomed him in my life. For a short time, I\u2019d had a comrade. A brother. The animosity I felt now, he\u2019d earned. But no matter, I would take care of him and see that he didn\u2019t stumble too badly, whether he liked it or not.</p><p>Returning the handset to its cradle, I got back to work. After all, I couldn\u2019t have anything pressing over the weekend. I planned to be completely incommunicado while with my wife.</p><p>I studied Dr. Petersen, who sat completely at ease across from me. He wore dark, loose jeans with a tucked-in white shirt, as comfortable as I\u2019d ever seen him. I wondered if that was a deliberate decision in an effort to seem as innocuous as possible. He knew my history with therapists now, understood why I would always find them threatening to some degree.</p><p>\u201cHow did your weekend in Westport go?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDid she call you?\u201d In the past, when Eva wanted to make sure I discussed something in therapy, she would bring it up to Dr. Petersen in advance. I grumbled about it and often didn\u2019t appreciate it, but her motivation was her love for me and I couldn\u2019t bitch about that.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He smiled, and it was gentle, almost fond. \u201cI saw the photographs of you and Eva.\u201d</p> <p>That surprised me. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have taken you for the type to follow the tabloids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife does. She showed me the pictures because she found them very romantic. I have to agree with her. You both looked very happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you get along with Eva\u2019s family?\u201d</p><p>I settled back, draping my arm over the armrest. \u201cI\u2019ve known Richard Stanton for many years and Monica for the last few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasual and business acquaintances are very different from in-laws.\u201d</p><p>His perceptiveness rankled. Still, I was honest. \u201cIt was ... awkward. Unnecessarily so, but I dealt with it.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Petersen\u2019s smile widened. \u201cHow did you deal with it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI focused on Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you maintained distance from the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than usual.\u201d</p><p>He scribbled notes into his tablet. \u201cAnything else happen since I saw you on Thursday?\u201d</p><p>My mouth twisted wryly. \u201cShe bought me a dog. A puppy.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cEva\u2019s tickled by the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it her dog, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She got all the gear and dropped him in my lap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite a commitment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine. Animals are good at self-sufficiency.\u201d Because he waited with expectant patience, I moved on. \u201cMy stepfather filed for divorce.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Petersen\u2019s head tilted a little as he studied me. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from in-laws, to a new dog, to the dissolution of your parents\u2019 marriage in the space of a few minutes. That\u2019s a tremendous amount of change for someone who strives for structure.\u201d</p><p>That was stating the obvious, so I didn\u2019t add anything.</p><p>\u201cYou seem remarkably composed, Gideon. Because things are going well with Eva?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExceptionally well.\u201d I knew the contrast to last week\u2019s therapy session was striking. I\u2019d been wild with panic over the separation from Eva, terrified and frantic that I might lose her. I could recall the feelings with anguished clarity, but I had difficulty accepting how quickly I had ... unraveled. I didn\u2019t recognize that desperate man, couldn\u2019t reconcile him with what I knew about myself.</p><p>He nodded slowly. \u201cOf the three things you mentioned, how would you rank them from most important to least important?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat would depend on your definition of importance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Which would you say impacts you most?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he or she have a name?\u201d</p> <p>I held back a smile. \u201cHis name is Lucky.\u201d</p><p>He noted that, for whatever reason. \u201cWould you buy Eva a pet?\u201d</p><p>The question took me aback. I answered without really thinking about it. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>I considered that a minute. \u201cAs you pointed out, it\u2019s a commitment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you resentful that she made you take on that commitment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any pictures of Lucky?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cNo. Where are you going with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d He set his tablet aside and held my gaze. \u201cBear with me a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTaking on a pet is a big responsibility, similar to adopting a child. They\u2019re dependent on you for food and shelter, for companionship and love. Dogs more so than cats or other animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told,\u201d I said dryly.</p><p>\u201cYou have the family you were born into and the family you\u2019ve married into, but you keep yourself separate from both. Their activities and overtures don\u2019t impact you in a meaningful way because you don\u2019t allow them to. They\u2019re disruptive to the order of your life, so you keep them at a comfortable distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see anything wrong with that. I\u2019m certainly not the only person to say family is who you choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho have you chosen, aside from Eva?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ... wasn\u2019t a choice.\u201d</p><p>I pictured her in my mind the way she\u2019d been when I first saw her. She had been dressed to work out, her face naturally bare, her amazing body hugged by form-fitting fitness gear. Just like thousands of other women on the island of Manhattan, but she\u2019d struck me like lightning without even knowing I was there.</p><p>\u201cMy concern is that she\u2019s become a coping mechanism for you,\u201d Dr. Petersen said. \u201cYou\u2019ve found someone who loves you and believes you, who supports you and gives you strength. In many ways, you feel like she\u2019s the only one who will ever truly understand you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s in a unique position to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that unique,\u201d he said kindly. \u201cI\u2019ve read the transcripts of some of your speeches. You\u2019re aware of the statistics.\u201d</p><p>Yes, I knew that one in every four women I met had been exposed to sexual abuse. That didn\u2019t change the fact that none of them had evoked the feelings of affinity that Eva did. \u201cIf there\u2019s a point, Doctor, I\u2019d like you to get to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to be mindful of a potential tendency to seclude yourself with Eva, to the exclusion of everyone else. I asked if you would gift her with a pet, because I can\u2019t see you doing so. That would shift her focus and affection away from you, even if only slightly, while your focus and affection is centered entirely on her.\u201d</p><p>I drummed my fingertips on the arm of the sofa. \u201cThat\u2019s not unusual for newlyweds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unusual for you.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cDid Eva say why she gave Lucky to you?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, preferring to keep something so intimate to myself. \u201cShe wants me to have more unconditional love.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cAnd I\u2019m certain it will give her great pleasure to see you reciprocating that. She\u2019s pushed very hard for you to open up to her and to me. Now that you\u2019re taking those steps, she\u2019ll want you to open up to others. The bigger her intimate circle is, the happier she is. She wants to pull you into that, not have you pull her out of it.\u201d</p><p>My lungs expanded on a long, deep breath. He was right, much as I hated to admit it.</p><p>Dr. Petersen sat back again and resumed scrawling on the screen of his tablet, giving me time to absorb what he said.</p><p>I asked him something that had been on my mind. \u201cWhen I told you about Hugh ...\u201d</p><p>He gave me his full attention. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want to know why.\u201d His gaze was kind. \u201cThere were certain markers. I could say I deduced it, but that wouldn\u2019t be entirely true.\u201d</p><p>I felt my phone buzz in my pocket but ignored it, despite knowing that only a handful of people were programmed to bypass the do-not-disturb setting I used during my meetings with Dr. Petersen.</p><p>\u201cI saw Eva shortly after she moved to New York,\u201d he went on. \u201cShe asked me if it was possible for two abuse survivors to have a meaningful relationship. It was only a few days later when you contacted me and asked if I\u2019d be open to seeing you, in addition to seeing you and Eva as a couple.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My pulse quickened. \u201cI hadn\u2019t told her then. I didn\u2019t until we\u2019d been coming to you for a while.\u201d</p><p>But I\u2019d had nightmares, the really bad ones that had been coming less frequently of late.</p><p>My phone buzzed again and I pulled it out. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>It was Angus. I\u2019m outside the office door, he\u2019d texted first. This time, It\u2019s urgent.</p> <p>My spine stiffened. Angus wouldn\u2019t disturb me without a very good reason. I stood. \u201cI\u2019ll have to cut this short,\u201d I told Dr. Petersen.</p><p>He set aside his tablet and rose to his feet. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf not, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll hear about it on Thursday.\u201d I shook his hand quickly and left the office, passing through the empty reception area before stepping out to the hallway.</p><p>Angus stood there, looking grim. He wasted no time. \u201cThe police are at the penthouse with Eva.\u201d</p><p>My blood turned to ice. I strode to the elevator with Angus falling into step beside me. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnne Lucas filed charges of harassment.\u201d</p><p>7</p><p>My hand shook as I poured freshly brewed coffee into three mugs. I couldn\u2019t tell if that was because I was so pissed off or because I was afraid. Certainly, I was both. Being a cop\u2019s daughter, I understood the unwritten rules followed by those who worked behind the blue wall of law enforcement. And after everything Gideon and I had been through regarding Nathan\u2019s death, I was doubly on my guard now.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Detectives Graves and Michna of the homicide division who wanted to speak to me. I couldn\u2019t decide if that made me more or less anxious. They were the devil I knew, so to speak. And while I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call Shelley Graves an ally, she\u2019d dropped the case when she still had questions without answers.</p><p>This time around, it was Officers Pe\u00f1a and Williams who had shown up on our doorstep.</p><p>And it was Anne Lucas who sent them my way. That fucking bitch.</p> <p>I\u2019d had to cut my appointment with Blaire Ash short, knowing it was unavoidable that the designer would pass the officers in the lobby when he exited the private elevator. I didn\u2019t have time to worry about what he\u2019d make of that. Instead, I took the brief time alone to call Ra\u00fal and tell him to find Arash Madani. I wanted to call Gideon, but he was with Dr. Petersen and I considered that more important. I could handle the police. I knew the basics: Have an attorney present and be succinct. Don\u2019t elaborate or offer information not asked for.</p><p>Setting the three mugs of coffee on a serving tray, I searched for something to pour the half-and-half into.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go to any trouble, Ms. Tramell,\u201d Officer Pe\u00f1a said as he and his partner entered the kitchen with their hats tucked under their arms.</p><p>Pe\u00f1a had a baby face that made him look younger than he probably was, which I guessed was close to my age. Williams was a petite, curvy black woman, with sharp cop eyes that told me she\u2019d seen things I would never want to.</p><p>I\u2019d asked them to wait in the living room and they had followed me instead. That made me feel hunted, which I\u2019m sure was part of their intention.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble.\u201d I gave up trying to be classy about the half-and-half and just set the carton on the island. \u201cAnd I\u2019m waiting for my attorney to arrive, so there\u2019s really not much else for me to do in the meantime.\u201d</p><p>Officer Williams eyed me coolly, as if she were wondering why I felt the need for counsel.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have to justify myself but knew it wouldn\u2019t hurt to let them know why I was cautious. \u201cMy dad\u2019s on the job in California. He\u2019d chew me out if I didn\u2019t follow his advice.\u201d</p> <p>I grabbed the box of sugar I\u2019d dug out of the pantry and set it on the tray before moving it all over to the island.</p><p>\u201cWhere in California?\u201d Pe\u00f1a asked, grabbing a mug and taking his coffee black.</p><p>\u201cOceanside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSan Diego area, right? Nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, yes.\u201d</p><p>Williams took her coffee with a splash of half-and-half and a whole lot of sugar, which she poured straight from the box. \u201cIs Mr. Cross here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in a meeting.\u201d</p><p>She kept her gaze on me as she lifted her mug to her lips. \u201cWho was the guy leaving when we came up?\u201d</p><p>The deliberate casualness of her tone made me glad I\u2019d sent word to Arash. I didn\u2019t believe for a minute that the question was just small talk. \u201cBlaire Ash. He\u2019s the interior designer working on some renovations we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou live here?\u201d Pe\u00f1a asked. \u201cWe stopped by an apartment on the Upper West Side we heard was yours.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in the process of moving in.\u201d</p><p>He leaned into the island and looked around. \u201cNice place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, too.\u201d</p><p>Williams caught my eye. \u201cHave you been dating Gideon Cross long?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s married to me, actually,\u201d Gideon said, appearing in the doorway.</p><p>Pe\u00f1a straightened, swallowing quickly. Williams set her mug down with enough force to spill some coffee.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s gaze swept over all of us, then locked with mine. He looked perfect, his suit pristine, his tie immaculately knotted, his dark hair framing that savagely beautiful face. There was the faintest shadow of stubble around his sensual mouth. That, and the sexy length of his hair, lent a dangerous edge to his otherwise civilized appearance.</p><p>Not even the two cops standing between us could diminish the surge of hunger that flooded me at the sight of him.</p><p>I watched as he came toward me, shrugging out of his suit jacket as if it were the most natural thing to have two of New York\u2019s finest there to question me. He tossed it over the back of a bar stool at the island and moved beside me, taking my coffee out of my hands and pressing a kiss to my temple.</p> <p>\u201cGideon Cross,\u201d he said, extending his hand to both officers. \u201cAnd this is our counsel, Arash Madani.\u201d</p><p>It was then I noticed that Arash had entered the kitchen behind my husband. The officers, as focused on Gideon as I was, didn\u2019t seem to have noticed him either.</p><p>Supremely confident, with dark good looks and easy charm, Arash swept into the room and took over, introducing himself with a wide smile. The disparity between him and Gideon was striking. Both men were elegant, handsome, and poised. Both were courteous. But Arash was accessible, relatable. Gideon was imposing and remote.</p><p>I looked up at my husband, watching as he drank from my mug. \u201cWould you like some black coffee instead?\u201d</p><p>His hand swept down my back, his eyes on the officers and Arash. \u201cI\u2019d love some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re here, Mr. Cross,\u201d Pe\u00f1a said. \u201cDr. Lucas also filed a complaint against you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, that was fun,\u201d Arash said an hour later, after showing the officers out to the elevator.</p><p>Gideon shot him a look as he deftly opened a bottle of malbec. \u201cIf that\u2019s your idea of entertainment, you need to get out more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was planning on doing that tonight\u2014with a very hot blonde, I might add\u2014until I got your call.\u201d Arash pulled out one of the island bar stools and sat.</p><p>I scooped up all the mugs and moved them to the sink. \u201cThank you, Arash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re most welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you don\u2019t step into courtrooms all that often, but I want to be there the next time you do. You\u2019re awesome.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank him for doing his job,\u201d Gideon muttered. He poured the dark red wine into three glasses.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m thanking him for doing his job well,\u201d I countered, still impressed by the way Arash worked. The attorney was charismatic and disarming, as well as humble when it served his purposes. He put everyone at ease, then let them do the talking while he figured out his best angle of attack.</p><p>Gideon scowled at me. \u201cWhat the hell do you think I\u2019m paying him so much to do? Fuck up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDial it back, ace,\u201d I said calmly. \u201cDon\u2019t let that bitch get to you. And don\u2019t take that tone with me. Or your friend.\u201d</p><p>Arash winked at me. \u201cI think he\u2019s jealous you like me so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Then I saw the way Gideon glared at Arash and my brows went up. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back on topic. How are you fixing this?\u201d my husband challenged, looking daggers at his friend over the rim of his wineglass.</p><p>\u201cFixing your fuck-up?\u201d Arash asked, his brown eyes bright with silent laughter. \u201cYou both provided Anne Lucas the ammunition for this by going to her place of employment on two separate occasions. You\u2019re damned lucky she embellished her story with a little assault accusation against Eva. If she\u2019d just stuck with the truth, she\u2019d have you both by the throats.\u201d</p><p>I went to the fridge and started pulling out items to throw together for dinner. I\u2019d been kicking myself for being stupid all evening. It would never have occurred to me to think she might voluntarily reveal her sordid extramarital affair with Gideon. She was supposed to be an upstanding member of the mental health community and her husband was a well-regarded pediatrician.</p><p>I\u2019d underestimated her. And I hadn\u2019t listened to Gideon when he had warned me she was dangerous. The result was that she had a legitimate complaint that first Gideon had barged into her office during a therapy session, and then I\u2019d ambushed her at work again two weeks later. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Arash accepted the glass Gideon slid briskly over to him. \u201cThe district attorney may or may not decide to go after her for falsely reporting an incident, but she damaged her credibility by accusing Eva of putting hands on her when security footage proves otherwise.

I blew him a kiss.</p><p>It tickled me that he would feel even the slightest bit of jealousy. The most impressive thing about Arash was that he held his own next to Gideon; he certainly couldn\u2019t surpass him. While I\u2019d seen that Arash could be every bit as threatening as my husband, it wasn\u2019t his default setting.</p><p>Gideon was always dangerous. No one ever mistook him for anything else. I was intensely attracted to that about him, understood that I would never tame him. And God, was he gorgeous. He knew it, too. Knew how dazzled I was by him.</p> <p>But the green-eyed monster could still get the better of him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay for dinner?\u201d I asked Arash. \u201cNo idea what I\u2019m making yet, but we ruined your plans and I feel bad about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still early.\u201d Gideon took a deep swallow of his wine. \u201cHe can make other plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to stay for dinner,\u201d Arash said, grinning wickedly.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t resist copping another feel, so I reached around my husband to get my wine and caressed his thigh while I was at it. I brushed my breasts across his back as I withdrew my hand.</p><p>Lightning quick, Gideon\u2019s hand caught my wrist. He squeezed and a shiver of arousal slid through me.</p> <p>Those blue eyes turned on me. \u201cYou want to misbehave?\u201d he asked silkily.</p><p>I was instantly desperate for him. Because he looked so cool and savagely civilized, completely contained while he basically asked if I wanted to fuck.</p><p>He had no idea how much.</p><p>I heard a faint buzz. Still holding me captive by the wrist, Gideon looked across the island at Arash. \u201cPass my phone over.\u201d</p><p>Arash looked at me and shook his head, even as he turned to dig Gideon\u2019s phone out of the suit jacket on the bar stool. \u201cHow you put up with him, I will never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s great in bed,\u201d I quipped, \u201cand he\u2019s not surly there, so ...\u201d</p><p>Gideon yanked me into his side and bit my earlobe. My nipples tightened into hard points. He growled almost inaudibly against my neck, though I doubted he cared if Arash heard.</p><p>Breathless, I pulled away and tried to focus on cooking. I hadn\u2019t taken over Gideon\u2019s kitchen before, hadn\u2019t a clue where anything was or what he had stocked, aside from what I\u2019d glimpsed while getting coffee ready for the police. I found an onion, and located a knife and cutting board. Grateful as I was for the distraction, I had to do something else besides getting us both revved up.</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d Gideon said into the phone with a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>I looked up. \u201cDo you have to go somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Angus is bringing Lucky up.\u201d</p><p>I grinned.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Lucky?\u201d Arash asked.</p><p>\u201cGideon\u2019s dog.\u201d</p><p>The lawyer looked suitably shocked. \u201cYou have a dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do now,\u201d Gideon said ruefully, leaving the kitchen.</p><p>When he returned a moment later with a squirming Lucky happily licking his jaw, I melted. There he stood, in his vest and shirtsleeves, a titan of industry, a global powerhouse, and he was being overwhelmed by the cutest puppy ever.</p><p>Picking up his phone, I unlocked it and snapped a picture.</p><p>That was going into a frame, ASAP.</p><p>While I was at it, I texted Cary. Hey, it\u2019s Eva. Want to come over to the penthouse for dinner?</p><p>I waited a beat for him to reply, then set Gideon\u2019s phone down and went back to chopping.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve listened to you about Anne,\u201d I told Gideon as we returned to the living room after saying good-bye to Arash. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hand at my lower back slid over farther, cupping my waist. \u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got to be frustrating for you to deal with my stubbornness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re great in bed, and you\u2019re not stubborn there, so ...\u201d</p><p>I laughed as he tossed my words back at me. I was happy. Spending the evening with him and Arash, watching how relaxed and easy he was with his friend, being able to move around the penthouse as if it were my home ...</p> <p>\u201cI feel married,\u201d I murmured, realizing that I hadn\u2019t truly felt that way before. We had the rings and the vows, but those were the trappings of marriage, not the reality of it.</p><p>\u201cYou should,\u201d he replied, with a familiar note of arrogance, \u201csince you are and will be for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him as we settled on the sofa. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>His gaze went to the playpen by the fireplace where Lucky slept. \u201cAre you asking if I feel domesticated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will never happen,\u201d I said dryly.</p> <p>Gideon looked at me, searching. \u201cDo you want me to be?\u201d</p><p>I ran my hand down his thigh, because I couldn\u2019t help myself. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight ... You liked having Arash here.\u201d</p><p>I shot him a look. \u201cYou\u2019re not jealous of your lawyer, are you? That would be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it, either.\u201d He scowled. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what I meant. You like having people over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>He looked away, his lips pursed. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>I stilled. Gideon\u2019s home was his sanctuary. Before me, he\u2019d never brought any women here. I\u2019d assumed he had entertained his guy friends, but maybe not ...? Maybe the penthouse was where he retreated from everyone.</p><p>I reached for his hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gideon. I should\u2019ve asked you first. I didn\u2019t think about it and I should have. It\u2019s your home\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur home,\u201d he corrected, focusing back on me. \u201cWhat are you apologizing for? You have every right to do whatever you like here. You don\u2019t have to ask me for permission for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you shouldn\u2019t feel invaded in your own home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur home,\u201d he snapped. \u201cYou need to grasp that concept, Eva. Quickly.\u201d</p><p>I jerked back from his sudden flare of temper. \u201cYou\u2019re mad.\u201d</p><p>He stood and rounded the coffee table, his body vibrating with tension. \u201cYou went from feeling married to acting like you\u2019re a guest in my house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur house,\u201d I corrected. \u201cWhich means we share it and you have the right to say you\u2019d rather we didn\u2019t entertain here.\u201d</p><p>Gideon shoved a hand through his hair, a sure sign of his increasing agitation. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certainly acting like you do,\u201d I said evenly.</p><p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d He faced me, his hands on his lean hips. \u201cArash is my friend. Why would I care if you cook him dinner?\u201d</p><p>Were we circling back to jealousy? \u201cI cooked dinner for you, and invited him to join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem fine, \u2019cuz you\u2019re pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m confused and that\u2019s starting to make me pissed.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. He turned away, walking to the fireplace and looking at the family photos I\u2019d placed on the mantel.</p><p>I suddenly regretted doing that. I would be the first to admit that I pushed him into change faster than I should, but I understood the need for a haven, a quiet place to let your guard down. I wanted to be that for him, wanted our home to be that for him. If I made it a place he wanted to avoid\u2014if he ever found it easier to avoid me\u2014then I would effectively be jeopardizing the very marriage I valued more than anything.</p><p>\u201cGideon. Please talk to me.\u201d Maybe I\u2019d made that difficult, too. \u201cIf I\u2019ve crossed a line, you have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>He faced me again, frowning. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re upset with me. Help me understand.\u201d</p><p>Gideon heaved a sigh of frustration, then focused on me with the laserlike precision that had exposed every secret I\u2019d had. \u201cIf there weren\u2019t anyone else on earth, just you and me, I\u2019d be okay with that. But that wouldn\u2019t be enough for you.\u201d</p><p>I sat back, startled. His mind was a labyrinth I would never map. \u201cYou would be okay with just me and no one else\u2014indefinitely? No competitors to squash? No global domination to plan?\u201d I snorted. \u201cYou\u2019d be bored out of your mind.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs that what you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d he challenged. \u201cHow would you manage with no friends to invite over and no one else\u2019s life to meddle in?\u201d</p><p>My gaze narrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t meddle.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a patient look. \u201cWould I be enough for you, if there were no one else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no one else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva. Answer the question.\u201d</p><p>I had no idea where he was coming from, but that only made it easier for me to answer him. \u201cYou fascinate the fuck out of me, you know that? You\u2019re never boring. A lifetime alone with you wouldn\u2019t be long enough to figure you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you be happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving you all to myself ? That would be heaven.\u201d My mouth curved. \u201cI have a Tarzan fantasy. You Tarzan, me Jane.\u201d</p><p>The tension in his shoulders visibly eased and a faint smile touched his mouth. \u201cWe\u2019ve been married a month. Why am I just now hearing about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured I\u2019d give it a few months before I whipped out the freaky.\u201d</p><p>Gideon flashed me a rare, wide smile and fried my brain in the process. \u201cHow does the fantasy go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know.\u201d I waved one hand carelessly. \u201cTree house, loincloth. Weather hot enough to put a sheen of sweat on you, but not too hot. You\u2019d be seething with the need to fuck but have no experience doing it. I\u2019d have to show you how.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me. \u201cYou have a sexual fantasy in which I\u2019m a virgin?\u201d</p><p>It took a lot of effort not to laugh at his incredulity. \u201cIn every way,\u201d I said, with utmost seriousness. \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen breasts or a woman\u2019s pussy before mine. I have to show you how to touch me, what I like. You catch on quick, but then I\u2019ve got a wild man on my hands. You can\u2019t get enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s reality.\u201d He headed toward the kitchen. \u201cI have something for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA loincloth?\u201d</p><p>He answered over his shoulder. \u201cHow about what goes in it?\u201d</p><p>My mouth curved. I half expected him to come back out with wine. I straightened when I saw that he had something small and bright red in his hand, a color and shape I recognized as Cartier. \u201cA present?\u201d</p><p>Gideon crossed the distance between us with his confident, sexy stride.</p><p>Excited, I rose onto my knees. \u201cGimme, gimme.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, holding his hand aloft as he sat. \u201cYou can\u2019t have what I haven\u2019t given you yet.\u201d</p> <p>I sank back down, putting my hands on my thighs.</p><p>\u201cIn answer to your questions ...\u201d He brushed his fingertips across my cheek. \u201cYes, I feel married.\u201d</p><p>My pulse fluttered.</p><p>\u201cComing home to you,\u201d he murmured, his gaze on my mouth, \u201cwatching you whip up dinner in our kitchen. Even having damned Arash here. That\u2019s what I want. You. This life we\u2019re building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon ...\u201d My throat burned.</p><p>He looked down at the red suede pouch in his hand. He flipped open the button that kept it closed and poured two platinum crescents into the palm of his hand.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d My hand went to my throat.</p><p>He caught my left wrist and pulled it gently into his lap, sliding one half of the bracelet beneath it. The other half he held up to me, so I could see that he\u2019d inscribed something inside.</p><p>ALWAYS MINE. FOREVER YOURS. \u2014GIDEON</p><p>\u201cOh, boy,\u201d I breathed, watching as my husband fit the top half of the bracelet to the bottom. \u201cThis is sooo getting you laid.\u201d</p><p>His soft laugh made me fall deeper in love with him.</p><p>The bracelet had a screw motif that circled the entire band, with two actual screws on the sides that he secured with a small screwdriver.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d he held up the screwdriver, \u201cis mine.\u201d</p><p>I watched him tuck it into his pocket, understanding that I wouldn\u2019t be able to get the bracelet off without him. Not that I\u2019d want to. I already treasured it\u2014and the proof of his romantic soul.</p><p>\u201cAnd this\u201d\u2014I straddled his hips, draping my arms over his shoulders\u2014\u201cis mine.\u201d</p><p>His hands gripped my waist, his head tipping back to expose his throat to my questing lips. It wasn\u2019t surrender. It was indulgence, and that was just fine with me.</p><p>\u201cTake me to bed,\u201d I whispered, my tongue rimming the shell of his ear.</p><p>I felt his muscles bunch, then flex effortlessly as he stood while holding me as if I weighed nothing at all. I gave a throaty purr of appreciation and he swatted my ass, hitching me higher before carrying me out of the living room.</p><p>I was panting, my heart racing. My hands were everywhere, sliding through his hair and over his shoulders, unknotting his tie. I wanted to get to his skin, to feel him flesh to flesh. My lips roved over his face, kissing everywhere I could reach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His stride was purposeful, but leisurely. His breathing even and steady. He kicked the door closed with a graceful, easy push.</p><p>Oh God, it drove me insane when he was that controlled.</p><p>He tried to set me down on the bed, but I held on.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take your clothes off if you don\u2019t let me go.\u201d Only the hoarseness of his voice betrayed his need.</p><p>I released him, tackling the buttons of his vest before he straightened. \u201cTake your clothes off.\u201d</p><p>He swatted my fingers away so he could take over. I stared, my breath held, as he started to strip.</p><p>The sight of his hands, tanned by the sun, glittering with the rings I\u2019d given him, deftly unknotting his tie ... How could that be so erotic?</p><p>The whisper of the silk as he tugged it off. The careless way he let it fall to the floor. The heat of his eyes as he watched me watching him.</p><p>It was the worst sort of denial, extreme self-torture, and I forced myself to bear it. Wanting to touch him but restraining myself. Waiting for him while coveting him. I\u2019d tortured us both by making us wait, so it was the least I deserved.</p><p>I\u2019d missed him. Missed having him like this.</p><p>The collar of his shirt parted as he slid the buttons from their holes, exposing the strong column of his throat, then a glimpse of his chest. He stopped at the button below his pecs, teasing me, switching to his cuff links.</p><p>He removed them slowly, one at a time, setting them carefully and deliberately on the nightstand.</p><p>A soft whimper escaped me. Desperation was a wild thing inside me, sliding through my veins, the most potent aphrodisiac.</p><p>Gideon shrugged out of his shirt and vest, his shoulders bunching, then relaxing.</p><p>He was perfect. Every inch of him. Every hard slab of honed muscle visible beneath the rough silk of his skin. Nothing brutish in any way. Not too much of anything.</p><p>Except his cock. Jesus.</p><p>My thighs squeezed together as he toed out of his oxfords and pushed his slacks and boxer briefs down his long, strong legs. My sex ached and swelled, the blood rushing to my core, my slit slick with wanting.</p><p>The rigid lacing of his abs flexed as he straightened. The muscles veed at his hips and pointed to the thick, long penis that curved upward between his thighs.</p><p>\u201cOh God. Gideon.\u201d</p><p>Pre-ejaculate slicked the wide head. His testicles hung heavily, balancing the weight of his thickly veined cock. He was magnificent, beautiful in the most primal way, savagely masculine. The sight of him stirred everything feminine inside me.</p><p>I licked my lips, my mouth flooded with moisture. I wanted to taste him, to hear his pleasure when I wasn\u2019t lost to my own, to feel him quake and shiver when I took him over the edge.</p><p>Gideon fisted his erection, stroking it hard from root to tip, pumping a thick pearl of moisture up to bead the tip.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours, angel,\u201d he said roughly. \u201cTake it.\u201d</p> <p>I scrambled off the bed and started to sink to my knees.</p><p>He caught me by the elbow, his mouth a taut line. \u201cNaked.\u201d</p><p>It was hard to straighten my legs, my knees weak with desire. Harder still to resist yanking off my clothes in a rush. I was shaking as I untied my sleeveless wrap top, trying to pull open the loosened halves with some semblance of a striptease.</p><p>His hissed intake of air when I exposed the lace of my bra betrayed his fraying control. My breasts were heavy and tender, the nipples hard and tight.</p><p>Gideon took a step toward me, his hands sliding beneath the shoulder straps and pulling them down until I fell into his waiting palms. My eyes closed on a low moan as he squeezed gently, hefting the weight of my breasts before stroking over my nipples with the pads of his thumbs.</p><p>\u201cShould\u2019ve kept you dressed,\u201d he said tightly. But his touch said something else. That I was beautiful. Sexy. That I was all he could see.</p><p>He pulled away and I cried out, missing his hands.</p><p>His eyes were so dark they seemed black. \u201cOffer them to me.\u201d</p><p>I shifted on my feet, my sex throbbing. Shrugging, I let my shirt drop, then reached behind me to unclasp my bra. It slid down my arms, freeing me to cup my breasts and lift them up to him.</p><p>Bending his head with frustrating patience, Gideon ran the tip of his tongue over my nipple in a slow, unhurried lick. I wanted to scream ... hit him ... something. Anything to break that maddening restraint.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I begged, shameless. \u201cGideon, please ...\u201d</p><p>He sucked, hard. Drawing on me with deep rapid pulls, his tongue furiously lashing the sensitive tip. I could smell the animal lust on him, pheromones and testosterone, the scent of a ferociously aroused virile male. It called to me, demanding and possessive. I felt the pull of it, of him. Felt the melting inside me, the surrender.</p><p>I swayed and he caught me, tipping me back over his arms and moving to my other breast. His cheeks hollowed with the force of his sucking, my core clenching in rhythm. My spine ached with the strain of the pose I had to hold for him to take his pleasure, and that turned me on to the point of madness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019d fought for him. He had killed for me. There was a bond between us, primitive and ancient, that transcended definition. He could take me, use me. I was his. I\u2019d made him wait and he\u2019d allowed me to for reasons I wasn\u2019t sure I knew. But he was reminding me now that I could walk far and try to keep my distance at times, but his hand would always hold the chains that bound us together. And he would pull me back when it suited him, because I belonged to him.</p><p>Always mine.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wait.\u201d My hands went into his hair. \u201cFuck me. I need your cock inside me\u2014\u201d</p><p>He spun me and bent me over the bed, pinning me down with a hand between my shoulder blades, reaching for the back zipper of my capris. He yanked on the pull, ripping it open and rending the cotton.</p><p>\u201cAre you with me?\u201d he growled, shoving his hand into the opening to cup the cheek of my buttock.</p><p>\u201cYes! God, yes ...\u201d And he knew it, but he asked. Always making sure to remind me that I had the control, that I gave him permission.</p><p>He destroyed my pants getting them down to my knees, using just one hand while the other fisted my hair. He was rough, impatient. He gripped the band of my thong and tugged, the material digging into my skin before breaking with a snap.</p><p>He pushed his hand between my bound legs, cupping my sex. My back arched, my body trembling.</p><p>\u201cChrist, you\u2019re wet.\u201d He pushed a finger inside me. Pulled out. Pushed in with two. \u201cI\u2019m so fucking hard for you.\u201d</p><p>The tender tissues grasped at his plunging fingers. He withdrew, circling my clit, rubbing it. I pressed into his fingertips, seeking the pressure I needed, soft pleading sounds pouring from my throat.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come until I\u2019m inside you,\u201d he growled. He grabbed my hips with both hands, pulling me back as he notched the broad head of his cock into my slit.</p><p>He paused a moment, breathing hard and loud. Then he shoved inside me. I screamed into the mattress, stretched wide and too full, writhing to accommodate him.</p><p>He held me aloft, my feet leaving the floor. He rolled his hips and claimed that last little space inside me, his penis tunneling deep. I squeezed every inch of him, pulsing around him in frantic pleasure.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d he bit out, his fingers kneading restlessly into my flesh.</p><p>I pushed back with my arms, so close to coming it hurt. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>Through the roaring of blood in my ears I heard him groan my name. His cock swelled and lengthened, jerking as he orgasmed in hard spurts. It felt endless and maybe it was, because he started fucking through his climax, pumping me full of hot, creamy semen. The feel of him coming sparked my orgasm. It rushed over me in powerful spasms, racking my body with violent shudders.</p><p>My nails clawed at the comforter, trying to find purchase as Gideon pounded his cock into me, lost in a hot furious rut. The slickness of his semen wet the lips of my sex, then rolled down my legs. He groaned and thrust deep, rolling his hips, screwing into me. He shuddered, coming again, only moments after his first.</p><p>Folding over me, Gideon kissed my shoulder, his breath gusting hot and fast over the sweat-slick curve of my back. His chest heaved against my spine, his bruising grip on my hips easing. His hands began to stroke, to soothe. His fingers found my clit and massaged, stirring me, rubbing me into another trembling climax.</p><p>His lips moved against my skin. Angel ... Over and over he said the word. Brokenly. Desperately. Breathlessly.</p><p>Forever yours.</p><p>While deep inside me, he remained hard and ready.</p><p>I was lying on the bed, tucked against Gideon\u2019s side. My pants were gone and he was nude, his magnificent body still damp with sweat.</p><p>My husband lay sprawled on his back, one thickly muscled arm arched over his head, while the other curled beneath and around me, his fingers running absently up and down the length of my torso.</p> <p>We lay naked atop the sheets, his legs spread, his cock semierect and curving up to his navel. It glistened in the light of the bedside lamps, wet from me and him. His breathing was just beginning to slow, his heartbeat calming beneath my ear. He smelled delicious, like sin and sex and Gideon.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember how we got on the bed,\u201d I murmured, my voice throaty and near hoarse.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s chest rumbled with a laugh. Turning his head, he pressed his lips to my forehead.</p><p>I curled tighter into him, my arm draping across his waist and holding on tight.</p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Tipping my head back, I looked at him. He was flushed and sweaty, his hair clinging to his temples and neck. His body was a well-oiled machine, used to the strenuous mixed martial arts he used to condition it. He wasn\u2019t wiped from fucking; he could do that all night, tirelessly. It was the effort of holding back as long as he could, reining himself in until I was as wild for him as he was for me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou fucked my brains out.\u201d I smiled, feeling drugged. \u201cMy toes and fingers are tingling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was rough.\u201d He touched my hip. \u201cI bruised you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm ... \u201d My eyes closed. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I felt him shift, rising, blocking out the light.</p> <p>\u201cYou like that,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>I looked up at him leaning over me. I touched his face, tracing his brow and his jaw with my fingertips. \u201cI love your control. It turns me on.\u201d</p><p>He caught my fingers in his teeth, then released them. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when you lose it ... \u201d I sighed, remembering. \u201cIt drives me crazy to know I can do that to you, that you want me that much.\u201d</p><p>His head dropped, his forehead touching mine. He tugged me closer, making me feel how hard he was again. \u201cMore than anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you trust me.\u201d In my arms, he let every guard down. The ferocity of his need didn\u2019t hide his vulnerability; it revealed it.</p><p>\u201cMore than anyone.\u201d He slid over me, covering my body from ankle to shoulder, effortlessly supporting his weight so he didn\u2019t crush me. The sensual pressure made me hot for him all over again.</p><p>Tilting his head, Gideon brushed his lips over mine. \u201cCrossfire,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Crossfire was my safeword, what I said to him when I was overwhelmed and needed him to stop whatever he was doing. When he said the word to me, he was overwhelmed, too, but he didn\u2019t want me to stop. For Gideon, Crossfire conveyed a connection deeper than love.</p><p>My mouth curved. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping myself around a pillow, I looked toward the closet and listened to the sound of Gideon singing. I smiled ruefully. He was showered and dressing, and obviously feeling energetic despite beginning the morning by screwing me into an orgasm that left me seeing stars.</p> <p>It took me a moment to recognize the song. When I did, I felt butterflies. \u201cAt Last.\u201d Whether it was the Etta James or Beyonc\u00e9 version he was hearing in his mind didn\u2019t matter. What I heard was his voice, rich and nuanced, singing about seeing blue skies and smiles that cast a spell on him.</p><p>He stepped out knotting a charcoal tie, his vest unbuttoned and his jacket slug over his arm. Lucky scurried out after him, never far behind. After being freed from the playpen that morning, the puppy had become his shadow.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s gaze landed on me. He flashed me a heartbreaker of a smile. \u201cAnd here we are,\u201d he crooned.</p><p>\u201cHere I am, anyway. Leveled by hours of sex. I don\u2019t think I can stand and you\u2019re\u201d\u2014I gestured at him\u2014\u201cyou. It\u2019s not fair. I\u2019m not doing something right.\u201d</p><p>Gideon sat on the edge of the rumpled bed, looking impeccable. Bending over, he kissed me. \u201cRemind me ... How many times did I come last night?\u201d</p><p>I shot him a look. \u201cNot enough, apparently, since you were ready to go again when the sun came up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich proves the point that you\u2019re doing something very right.\u201d He brushed the hair off my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m tempted to stay home, but I\u2019ve got to clear the decks so we can disappear for a month. As you can see, I\u2019m extremely motivated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were serious about that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou thought I wasn\u2019t?\u201d Brushing the sheet aside, he cupped my breast.</p><p>I caught his hand before he aroused me again. \u201cA monthlong honeymoon. I\u2019ll wear you out at least once. I\u2019m determined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you?\u201d His eyes sparkled with laughter. \u201cOnly once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking for it, ace. By the time I\u2019m done, you\u2019ll beg me to leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will never happen, angel. Not in a million years.\u201d</p><p>His confidence challenged me.</p><p>I tugged the sheet back up again. \u201cWe\u2019ll just see about that.\u201d</p><p>8</p><p>As Angus walked into my office, I looked up from the e-mail I was reading. He held his hat in his hands and came to a stop in front of my desk.</p><p>\u201cI went through Terrence Lucas\u2019s office last night,\u201d he said. \u201cI didnae find anything.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t expected him to, so wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s possible Hugh told Anne what he knows and there are no records to be found.\u201d</p><p>He nodded grimly. \u201cWhile I was at it, I deleted all traces of Eva\u2019s appointment on both their onsite hard drives and backups. I also wiped the video footage of you and Eva being there. I checked and he never asked security for a copy, so you should be fine if he takes his wife\u2019s cue and files any complaints of his own.\u201d</p><p>That was Angus, always taking all possibilities into consideration. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t the police find that interesting?\u201d I sat back. \u201cThe Lucases have as much to lose as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re culpable, lad. You\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have everything you\u2019ve wanted and deserve. They cannae take anything from you.\u201d</p> <p>Except my self-respect and the respect of my friends and colleagues. I\u2019d worked so hard to regain both in the aftermath of my father\u2019s very public disgrace. Those who wanted to find weaknesses in me would be satisfied. That didn\u2019t alarm me as much as it once would have.</p><p>Angus was right. I\u2019d made my fortune and I had Eva.</p><p>If securing her peace of mind meant retreating from public scrutiny, I could do it. It was something I\u2019d taken into consideration when Nathan Barker was still a threat. Eva had been willing to hide our relationship from the world to spare me from any possible scandal stemming from her past. It was a sacrifice I hadn\u2019t been willing to make. Hiding. Sneaking moments together. Pretending for others that we weren\u2019t falling deeply and irrevocably in love.</p><p>It was different now. She\u2019d become as necessary as air. Protecting her happiness was more crucial than ever. I knew what it felt like to be judged for the sins of someone else and I would never put my wife through that. Contrary to her belief, I could live without having my hand in everything Cross Industries was involved in.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t spend my days in a damned loincloth role-playing Tarzan, but there was a comfortable medium between the two extremes.</p> <p>\u201cYou warned me about Anne.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI should\u2019ve listened to you.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged that off. \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done. Anne Lucas is a grown woman. She\u2019s old enough to take responsibility for her decisions.\u201d</p><p>What are you doing, lad? he\u2019d asked, as Anne slid into the back of the Bentley that first night. In the weeks that followed, he made his disapproval more and more clear until one day, he raised his voice to me. Disgusted with myself for punishing a woman who\u2019d done nothing to me, I\u2019d taken it out on him, telling him to remember his place.</p><p>The brief look of pain he\u2019d quickly hidden would haunt me to my grave.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, holding his gaze. \u201cFor how I handled it.\u201d</p><p>A small smile crinkled the lines on his face. \u201cThe apology isn\u2019t necessary, but I accept it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Scott\u2019s voice came through the speaker. \u201cThe PosIT team is here. I also have Arnoldo Ricci on the line for you. He says it won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Angus to see if he had anything further for me. He tapped his brow in a casual salute and left.</p><p>Speaking to Scott, I said, \u201cPut him through.\u201d</p><p>I waited for the red light to flash, then opened the line on speaker. \u201cWhere are you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello to you, too, my friend,\u201d Arnoldo greeted, his voice accented with the notes of Italy. \u201cI hear I missed you and Eva at the restaurant this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had an excellent lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, it is the only kind we serve. We are not so bad with dinner, either.\u201d</p> <p>I rocked back in my chair. \u201cYou\u2019re in New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and planning your bachelor party, which is why I\u2019m calling. If you have plans this weekend, cancel them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva and I will be out of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will be out of town. In fact, out of the country, from what I understand from Shawna. And you will be out of town, too. The rest of the guys are in agreement with me. We are going to force you to leave New York for a change.\u201d</p><p>I was so taken aback by the first part of what Arnoldo said that I hardly heard the last. \u201cEva isn\u2019t leaving the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to take that up with her and her friends,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cAs for us, we are going to Rio.\u201d</p><p>I found myself standing. Damn it. Eva wasn\u2019t in the Crossfire. I couldn\u2019t just take an elevator and find her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ask Scott to arrange the flight,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave Friday evening and plan to return Monday in time for you to go to work, if you are ambitious enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Eva going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. Shawna wouldn\u2019t say, because it\u2019s not for you to know. She told me only that they would be gone for the weekend and I should plan on keeping you occupied, because Cary doesn\u2019t want you to interfere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not his decision to make,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>He paused. \u201cBeing angry at me won\u2019t help you, Gideon. And if you don\u2019t trust her, my friend, you shouldn\u2019t be marrying her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My grip on the phone tightened. \u201cArnoldo, you\u2019re the closest friend I have. But that\u2019ll change if you don\u2019t get your head out of your ass when it comes to Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mistake me,\u201d he corrected hurriedly. \u201cIf you cage her for your own security, you will lose her. What is considered romantic in a boyfriend can be stifling in a husband.\u201d</p><p>Realizing he was offering advice, I started counting to ten. I made it to seven. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. Arash assures me she is the best thing to ever happen to you. He says he has never seen you happier and that she adores you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve said the same.\u201d</p><p>Arnoldo exhaled audibly. \u201cMen in love do not make the best witnesses.\u201d</p><p>Amusement replaced irritation. \u201cWhy are you and Arash discussing my personal life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is what friends do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl friends. You\u2019re grown men. You should have something better to do with your time.\u201d I rapped my knuckles on the desktop. \u201cAnd you want me to spend a weekend in Brazil with a bunch of guy gossips?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cListen.\u201d His tone was annoyingly calm. \u201cManhattan is out. I love the city, too, but I think we\u2019ve exhausted its charms. Especially for such an occasion.\u201d</p><p>Chagrined, I looked out the windows at the city I loved. Only Eva knew about the hotel room I\u2019d kept perpetually reserved\u2014my \u201cfuck pad,\u201d as she\u2019d called it. Until her, it was the only place where I took women for sex. It was safe. Impersonal. There was nothing to learn about me there but how I looked nude and how I liked to fuck.</p><p>Leaving New York meant I wouldn\u2019t get laid, so of course I\u2019d always insisted the guys keep our prowling close to home.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I won\u2019t argue.\u201d I was going to discuss it with Eva\u2014and Cary\u2014but that wasn\u2019t Arnoldo\u2019s concern.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. I will let you get back to work. We can catch up this weekend.\u201d</p><p>We ended the call. I looked over at Scott through the glass wall and lifted one finger, telling him I needed an additional minute of time. Picking up my smartphone, I called Eva.</p> <p>\u201cHey, ace,\u201d she answered, sounding flirty and happy.</p><p>I absorbed that, along with the punch of pleasure and heat that moved through me. Her voice, always throaty, was huskier than it had been lately. I was reminded of the long night, the sounds she made when aroused, her cries for me when she came.</p><p>It was a new goal of mine to keep her sounding like that eternally, to keep her skin flushed and her lips swollen, her stride slow and sultry because she could still feel me inside her. Wherever she went, it should be obvious that I fucked her often and thoroughly. It felt obvious on me. I was loose-limbed and relaxed, a bit weak in the knees\u2014although I\u2019d never admit it.</p><p>\u201cHave our plans for the weekend changed?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI might increase my vitamins,\u201d she teased, \u201cbut otherwise, no. I\u2019m really looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>The purr in her voice aroused me. \u201cI\u2019ve been told our friends plan to keep us apart this weekend for our respective bachelor and bachelorette parties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cI was kinda hoping everyone forgot about that.\u201d</p><p>My mouth curved in a smile I wished she could see. \u201cWe could run away where they can\u2019t find us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI think these things are more for them than us. It\u2019s their last chance to have us all to themselves in the way they\u2019re used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose days were over when I met you.\u201d But I knew they weren\u2019t yet over for Eva. She\u2019d hung on to her independence, maintaining her friendships as she always had.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an odd sort of ritual, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she mused. \u201cTwo people commit to each other for life and their friends take them out, get them drunk, and encourage them to be bad one last time.\u201d</p><p>All the sexy playfulness she\u2019d had when the conversation started was gone. My wife was an intensely jealous woman. I knew that, accepted it, just as she accepted my possessiveness. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this more tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay,\u201d she said, sounding anything but happy about it.</p><p>There was some consolation in that. I preferred to picture her suffering through a weekend without me rather than having the time of her life.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Eva.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Ending the call, I turned to retrieve my jacket from the coatrack, then changed my mind. I retraced my steps to my desk and called Cary.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you planning on taking my wife this weekend?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He answered so quickly, I knew he\u2019d been braced to hear from me. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to have you controlling her,\u201d Cary said tightly, \u201cwith guards cockblocking any dude that comes near her, like you did in Vegas. She\u2019s a big girl. She can handle herself and she deserves to have fun.\u201d</p><p>So that was what this was about. \u201cThere were extenuating circumstances then, Cary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Sarcasm was heavy in his tone. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNathan Barker was still breathing and you\u2019d just had a goddamned orgy in your living room. I couldn\u2019t trust her safety to you.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. When he spoke again, his voice was markedly less heated. \u201cClancy\u2019s covering security. She\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath. Clancy and I were wary of each other, since he knew what I\u2019d done to remove Nathan as a threat to Eva\u2019s life. Regardless, we both wanted the same thing\u2014for Eva to be happy and safe. I trusted him with her, knew him to be very good at his job running Stanton and Monica\u2019s security.</p><p>I would talk to Clancy personally, put him in contact with Angus. Contingencies had to be planned for and communication aligned. If she needed me, I had to be able to get to her as swiftly as possible.</p><p>My gut tightened at the thought. \u201cEva needs her friends and I want her to enjoy herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he said airily. \u201cWe agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t interfere, Cary, but keep in mind that no one\u2019s as invested in keeping her safe as I am. She\u2019s only part of your life. She is my life. Don\u2019t be too stubborn to reach out to me if you need me. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it helps you feel better, I\u2019ll be in Brazil.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet a minute. \u201cI haven\u2019t nailed down where we\u2019re going yet, but I\u2019m leaning toward Ibiza.\u201d</p><p>I cursed silently. It would take half a day to get to her from Rio.</p><p>I wanted to argue\u2014I would certainly be making some alternate suggestions for locales in South America\u2014but I held my tongue for the moment, too aware of Dr. Petersen\u2019s comments about Eva\u2019s need for a wide social circle. Instead, I said, \u201cLet me know what you decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Ending the call, I grabbed my jacket and slipped it on.</p><p>I was sure Eva and Dr. Petersen would disagree, but friends and family could be more of a pain in the ass than anything.</p><p>The rest of the afternoon passed as scheduled and planned. It was nearing five o\u2019clock when Arash strolled in and settled comfortably on the nearest sofa, spreading his arms wide across the back.</p><p>I wrapped up my call with one of our distribution centers in Montreal and stood, stretching my legs. I was due for a session with my trainer, but he was going to kick my ass. I was sure Eva would be delighted to know she\u2019d sapped my stamina.</p><p>Not that it would prevent me from having her again when the day was done.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019d better be a good reason why you\u2019re making yourself at home,\u201d I told Arash dryly, rounding my desk.</p><p>He flashed a cocky grin. \u201cDeanna Johnson.\u201d</p><p>My stride slowed, the name taking me by surprise. \u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>Arash whistled. \u201cYou do know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a freelance journalist.\u201d I walked to the bar and pulled two chilled bottles of water out of the refrigerator. Deanna was also a woman I\u2019d fucked, which turned out to be a colossal mistake in more ways than one.</p><p>\u201cOkay. The hot blonde I bailed on last night?\u201d</p><p>I shot him an impatient look. \u201cGet on with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe works in the legal department of the publishing house that acquired the rights to Corinne\u2019s book. She told me the ghostwriter is Deanna Johnson.\u201d</p><p>I exhaled roughly, my hands squeezing the bottles so hard they leaked under the strain. \u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><p>My wife had warned me about Deanna and I hadn\u2019t listened.</p><p>\u201cLet me take a wild guess,\u201d Arash drawled. \u201cYou know Ms. Johnson in the biblical sense.\u201d</p><p>I turned and faced him, moving back to where he sat. I tossed a bottle at him, sending sprinkles of water arcing between us. Opening my own, I drank deeply.</p><p>Eva was right: We needed to be a better, more cohesive team. She and I were going to have to learn to trust\u2014and take\u2014each other\u2019s advice implicitly.</p><p>My friend set his elbows on his knees, holding his water in both hands. \u201cNow I see why you were in such a rush to get a ring on Eva. Seal the deal before she runs away screaming.\u201d</p><p>Arash was joking, but I could see the concern on his face. It echoed my own. Really, how much could my wife take? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pulled the bottle away from my lips. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a nice bit of news to wrap up the day,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>Arash and I both turned our heads to discover Eva bouncing through the open door of my office with only her smartphone in her hands. She was dressed in the same workout gear she\u2019d been wearing the day I first saw her. Her ponytail was lighter nowadays and shorter, her body leaner and more defined. But she would always be that girl who took my breath away.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d Arash stood quickly.</p> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d She flashed him a smile as she came toward me, rising onto her tiptoes to press a kiss to my mouth. \u201cHi, ace.\u201d</p><p>As she lowered back down, she frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is it a bad time?\u201d</p><p>I slid an arm around her waist, pulling her close. I loved the feel of her body against mine; it soothed the anxiousness I felt whenever we were apart. \u201cNever, angel. You come to me whenever you want.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes sparkled. \u201cMegumi and I are going to hit the gym together, but I\u2019m early, so figured I\u2019d drop in on you. Grab a glimpse of your hotness to motivate me.\u201d</p><p>I dropped a kiss on her forehead. \u201cDon\u2019t wear yourself out,\u201d I murmured. \u201cThat\u2019s my job.\u201d</p> <p>There was a frown between her brows as I straightened. \u201cSeriously. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>Arash cleared his throat and gestured toward the door. \u201cI\u2019ll head back to my office.\u201d</p><p>I answered her question before he left. \u201cDeanna is ghostwriting Corinne\u2019s book.\u201d</p><p>Eva stiffened. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows about Deanna?\u201d Arash looked at us both with wide eyes.</p><p>My wife pinned him with her gaze. \u201cDo you know Deanna?\u201d</p> <p>He held up both hands. \u201cNever met her. Never even heard of her before today.\u201d</p><p>Stepping out of my embrace, Eva shot me a look. \u201cI told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold him what?\u201d Arash asked, shoving his hands in his pockets.</p><p>She took my water bottle and dropped into a club chair. \u201cThat she couldn\u2019t be trusted. She\u2019s butthurt because he got her naked, then blew her off. Not that I blame her. I\u2019d be totally humiliated if I showed the goods but couldn\u2019t make the sale.\u201d</p><p>Arash sat back down on the sofa. \u201cYou have performance problems, Cross?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have your eye on unemployment, Madani?\u201d I took the other chair.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d already played hide-the-salami with Gideon once,\u201d Eva went on. \u201cAnd she really liked the salami. Can\u2019t blame her there, either. I told you what a great lay he is.\u201d</p> <p>Arash glanced at me, highly amused. \u201cYou did, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlows the top of your head right off. Your toes curl and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, Eva,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>She looked at me innocently. \u201cJust trying to give some context, baby. And give credit where it\u2019s due. Anyway, poor Deanna is torn between hating his guts and wanting to bang him like a drum. Since she can\u2019t do the latter, she\u2019s stuck with the former.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her. \u201cAre you done?\u201d</p><p>My wife blew me a kiss, then took a big swallow of water.</p><p>Arash sat back. \u201cProps for laying that all out for her,\u201d he said to me. \u201cYou\u2019re a saint, Eva, for putting up with him and the trail of scorned women in his wake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say?\u201d Her lips pursed. \u201cHow\u2019d you guys find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got an inside connection at the publishing house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I thought maybe Deanna said something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t. They don\u2019t want it known that Corinne isn\u2019t writing the book, so they\u2019ve got a confidentiality clause. They\u2019re negotiating the contract now.\u201d</p><p>Eva sat forward, her fingers picking at the label on the bottle. Her phone buzzed on the chair by her thigh and she picked it up to read the text. \u201cOff I go. Megumi\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>She stood. Arash and I stood with her. She was in my arms a moment later, tilting her head back for a kiss. I gave it to her, nuzzling my nose against hers before she retreated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so lucky I came along.\u201d She handed me back the water. \u201cThink of how much more trouble you would\u2019ve gotten into if you\u2019d stayed single any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trouble enough for a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>She said good-bye to Arash, then headed out. I watched her leave, hating to see her go. She waved to Scott as she passed him, then disappeared.</p><p>\u201cShe got any sisters?\u201d Arash asked, as we both sat down again.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s one of a kind.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, wait,\u201d Eva called out as she ran back in.</p><p>Arash and I both jumped to our feet.</p><p>She rejoined us. \u201cIf they\u2019re negotiating, nothing\u2019s been signed, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Arash answered.</p> <p>She looked at me. \u201cYou can get her not to sign.\u201d</p><p>My brows rose. \u201cHow am I supposed to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOffer her a job.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her, then said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>My wife looked at Arash. \u201cYour employee agreements include things like nondisclosure, nondisparagement, noncompetes, et cetera, right?\u201d</p><p>Arash considered that a minute. \u201cI see where you\u2019re going, and yes, they do. But there are limitations as to what those clauses cover and how they can be enforced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than nothing, though, maybe?

I have to go.\u201d She waved and hurried back out.</p> <p>The lack of a kiss or good-bye rubbed me the wrong way. Seeing her leave again ... I hated it more the second time.</p><p>She\u2019d made me wait to have sex with her. She\u2019d just casually suggested I seduce another woman.</p><p>The Eva I knew and loved would never have done either of those things.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want that book published,\u201d I called after her.</p><p>Eva stopped at the door and turned. She looked at me, her head tilting slightly. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>That examining look of hers got my back up. She saw right through me, saw the roiling inside me. \u201cYou know she\u2019d expect me to offer her more than just a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to entice her,\u201d she agreed, retracing her steps. \u201cYou\u2019re a juicy carrot, Cross. And you know how to dangle out of reach without even trying. She just needs to sign on the dotted line. Afterward, you can transfer her to Siberia as long as you give her work that fits the job description.\u201d</p><p>Something in her voice set me on edge\u2014that and the way she looked at me like a lion tamer circling the lion, cautious and watchful but very much in control.</p> <p>Provoked, I baited her. \u201cYou\u2019re whoring me out to get what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Cross,\u201d Arash muttered. \u201cDon\u2019t be an ass.\u201d</p><p>Eva\u2019s gaze narrowed, the clear gray of her eyes turning stormy. \u201cBullshit. You\u2019d have to lead her on, not fuck her. I want that book published as much as you want to hear \u2018Golden Girl\u2019 on repeat, but you\u2019re living with the damn song and I can live with the damn book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why bring up hiring her?\u201d I countered, taking a step toward her. \u201cI don\u2019t want that fucking woman within a mile of me, let alone working for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. It was just a suggestion. I could tell you were upset about it when I got here and I don\u2019t like you upset\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, I don\u2019t get upset!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she drawled. \u201cOf course not. You like bad-tempered better? Sullen? Moody? Are those more masculine for you, ace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should take you over my knee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry it and I\u2019ll split your sexy lip,\u201d she snapped back, her quick temper ignited. \u201cYou think I like the idea of you getting that bitch hot and bothered? Just imagining you flirting with her, giving her the idea you\u2019d like to screw her, makes me want to break stuff\u2014including her face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I\u2019d gotten what I needed. Eva couldn\u2019t hide her jealousy when she was angry. She was seething with it, vibrating with fury. I, however, was appeased.</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe Deanna dropping out won\u2019t change anything,\u201d she continued, still spitting mad. \u201cThe publisher could hire someone else to ghostwrite the fucking book. Hopefully someone unbiased, but hey, you\u2019ve got ex-lovers crawling out of the woodwork, so they might get lucky again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t whore you out just to stop that book from being published. You\u2019re the fuck of the century.

I caught her as she passed through the doors, grabbing her around the waist and hauling her off her feet.

Including Megumi\u2019s as she rounded the corner at just the right moment.</p><p>\u201cKiss me good-bye,\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want my mouth anywhere near you right now!\u201d</p> <p>Tossing her up, I spun her in midair and brought her down facing me, catching her mouth in a hard kiss. It was sloppy, graceless. Our noses bumped. But the feel of her mouth under mine, her warm skin beneath my hands, was just what I needed.</p><p>She nipped my bottom lip with her teeth. She could\u2019ve hurt me, drawn blood. Instead the bite was a gentle scold, as was the tug of my hair in her fists.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d she complained. \u201cWhat the hell is the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave without kissing me good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you for real?\u201d She glared at me. \u201cI did kiss you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe first time. Not the second or third.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, fuck me sideways,\u201d she breathed. Tightening her grip on my neck, she pulled herself up and wrapped her legs around my waist. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t beg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never do.\u201d She touched my face. \u201cYou give orders.

An epic brain fart of some kind.\u201d</p><p>I shot him a warning look. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe nice.\u201d Eva kissed me lightly. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about this later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour place or ours?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, her temper gone. \u201cOurs.\u201d</p><p>Her legs unwound and I set her down.</p><p>I could let her go now. I still didn\u2019t like it, but the knot in my stomach had eased. Eva was no worse for wear. Her temper always hit like a sudden storm and dissipated as swiftly, washing the slate clean.</p><p>\u201cHello, Megumi.\u201d I extended my hand.</p> <p>She took it, showing off glittering nude nails. Megumi was an attractive woman, with jaw-length black hair and almond-shaped eyes.</p><p>Eva\u2019s friend and former co-worker looked stronger than she had the last time I\u2019d seen her, which pleased me, because I knew how much my wife worried about her. I knew her only in passing prior to the sexual assault that had recently changed her life. I regretted that. The woman who stood before me now had a wounded look in her dark brown eyes and an air of bravado that betrayed vulnerability.</p><p>Experience had taught me she had a long road ahead of her. And she would never again be the person she\u2019d been before.</p><p>I glanced at Eva. My wife had come so far, from both the girl she\u2019d been long ago and the young woman I had first met. She was stronger now, too. I was happy to see that and wouldn\u2019t change it for anything.</p><p>I could only pray that strength wouldn\u2019t eventually take her away from me.</p><p>I left James Cho\u2019s studio exactly the way I expected\u2014with my ass handed to me. Still, I\u2019d managed to redeem myself at the end, taking the former champion fighter down in our last sparring match.</p><p>Angus was waiting for me outside, standing beside the Bentley. He opened the door and took my duffel bag but didn\u2019t smile. On the backseat, Lucky barked in his carrier, his excited face peering from behind the bars.</p><p>Pausing before sliding into the back, I held Angus\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cI have some information,\u201d he said grimly.</p><p>Considering the search for Hugh\u2019s files, I\u2019d been braced for bad news. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk when we get to the penthouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour office would be better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d I slid into the back, frowning. Either location was private. I\u2019d suggested home so that Eva could be with me, supporting me, when he relayed whatever information he had. Angus\u2019s preference for the office could only mean he didn\u2019t want Eva nearby.</p><p>What would he have to tell me that was best kept from my wife?</p><p>Lucky pawed at the carrier door, whining softly. Absently, I opened it and he tumbled out, climbing into my lap and rearing up to lick my jaw.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d I held him so he wouldn\u2019t fall in his frenzy, tilting my head back to avoid getting licked on the mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you, too.\u201d</p><p>Rubbing his warm, soft body with one hand, I looked out at the city as we drove through it. New York was an entirely different landscape at night, a fusion of dark alleys and twinkling high-rises, garish neon storefronts and intimate sidewalk dining. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With nearly two million people living on an island of less than twenty-three square miles, privacy was both rare and imagined. Apartment windows faced each other, with scarcely any distance between them. Often those windows remained uncovered, exposing private lives to anyone who chose to look. Telescopes were a popular item.</p><p>It was a New Yorker\u2019s way to live within a bubble, minding their own business with the expectation that others would do the same. The other option was to feel claustrophobic, the antithesis of the spirit of freedom that was the foundation of the Empire State.</p><p>We reached the Crossfire and I exited the Bentley with Lucky. Angus followed me through the revolving doors and we crossed the lobby in silence. The security guards stood as I approached, greeting me briskly by name, while darting glances at the tiny puppy tucked under my arm. I smiled inwardly as I caught my reflection. Dressed in sweats and a T-shirt with shower-damp hair, I doubted any person not in the know would believe I owned the building.</p><p>The elevator shot us up quickly and we were walking through the Cross Industries headquarters within moments of our arrival. Most offices and cubicles were dark and empty, but some ambitious employees were still getting things done\u2014or didn\u2019t have a reason to go home. I could relate. It wasn\u2019t long ago that I\u2019d spent more time at work than the penthouse.</p> <p>Entering my office, I turned the lights on and activated the opacity of the glass wall. Then I went to the seating area, settling on the couch and dropping Lucky on the cushion beside me. It was at that time I noticed Angus carried a worn leather binder.</p><p>He pulled a club chair close to the coffee table and sat. His gaze held mine.</p><p>My throat closed as another possibility came to mind. Angus seemed too somber, the meeting too formal.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not retiring,\u201d I preempted him, the words thick in my mouth. \u201cI won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me a moment, and then his face softened. \u201cAh, laddie. Ye\u2019ll be stuck with me for a while yet.\u201d</p> <p>Relief hit me so hard, I sagged back into the sofa, my heart pounding. Lucky, always ready to play, jumped on my chest.</p><p>\u201cDown,\u201d I ordered, which only made him more excitable. I pinned him in place with one hand and gave a brisk nod to Angus to get started.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll remember the dossier we compiled when you met Eva,\u201d he began.</p><p>Focused by the sound of my wife\u2019s name, I straightened. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>The memory of the day I met Eva came rushing back. I\u2019d been seated in the limo at the curb, seconds from pulling away from the Crossfire. She had been entering the building. I watched her, felt the pull of her. Unable to resist, I told Angus to wait and I went back in to find her, chasing after a woman\u2014something I\u2019d never done.</p><p>She\u2019d dropped her name badge when she saw me and I retrieved it for her, noting her name and the company she worked for. By the end of the night, I\u2019d had a thin folder on my home office desk containing a quick background check\u2014again, something I\u2019d never done for a mere sexual interest. Somehow, on a level I hadn\u2019t yet recognized, I knew she was mine. Knew that however I deluded myself, she was going to be important to me.</p> <p>In the days that followed, the dossier grew, encompassing Eva\u2019s parents and Cary, then Eva\u2019s paternal and maternal grandparents.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve kept a lawyer on retainer in Austin,\u201d Angus went on, \u201cto send us any reports of unusual activity with Harrison and Leah Tramell.\u201d</p><p>Monica\u2019s parents. Their estrangement from their daughter and granddaughter was just fine with me. Less family to deal with. But I also understood that while they might not have had any interest in Eva as an illegitimate grandchild, their minds might change when Eva publicly became my wife. \u201cWhat have they done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey died,\u201d he said bluntly, unzipping the binder. \u201cNearly a month ago.\u201d</p><p>That gave me pause. \u201cEva doesn\u2019t know. We were just talking over the weekend about wedding invitations and they came up. I assume Monica doesn\u2019t keep tabs on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wrote the obituary that appeared in the local paper.\u201d Angus withdrew a photocopy and set it on the table.</p><p>Picking it up, I scanned through it quickly. The Tramells had died together, in a boating accident during a summer vacation. The accompanying photo was decades old, with clothing and hair dating it to sometime in the seventies. They were an attractive couple, well dressed and expensively accessorized. What didn\u2019t fit was the hair\u2014even in a black-and-white newspaper printing I could see they were both dark-haired.</p><p>I read the closing sentence. Harrison and Leah are survived by their daughter, Monica, and two grandchildren. Looking up at Angus, I repeated aloud, \u201cTwo grandchildren?

The woman in the photo was a brunette, like her parents. And she looked nothing like the Monica I knew or my wife. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t yet figured out what Eva\u2019s mother\u2019s actual name is, but the real Monica Tramell had a brother named Jackson who was briefly married to Lauren Kittrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLauren.\u201d Eva\u2019s middle name. \u201cWhat do we know about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now, nothing, but that\u2019ll change. We\u2019re looking.\u201d</p> <p>I raked my hand through my hair. \u201cIs it possible we\u2019ve confused the Tramells and looked at the wrong family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, lad.\u201d</p><p>Standing, I went to the bar. I took two tumblers off the shelf and poured two fingers of Ardbeg Uigeadail single malt into each. \u201cStanton would\u2019ve checked out Monica\u2014Eva\u2019s mother\u2014thoroughly before he married her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t find out about Eva\u2019s past until she told you,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>He was right. The records of Eva\u2019s abuse, her miscarriage, the court transcripts, the settlement ... they\u2019d all been meticulously buried. When I\u2019d tasked Arash with drafting the prenuptial agreement, we had verified her financial assets and debts, but that was all. I loved her. I wanted her. Discrediting her in any way had never been considered.</p><p>Stanton loved his wife as well. Her personal fortune, accumulated after two financially advantageous divorces, would have addressed the most pressing concern. As for the rest, I expect he and I had acted similarly. Why search for trouble when all indications were that there was none? Love was willfully blind and made fools of men.</p> <p>I rounded the bar and nearly tripped over Lucky as he bounded in front of me. \u201cBenjamin Clancy is damned good. He wouldn\u2019t have missed this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe missed it.\u201d He took the glass I handed him. \u201cIf the Tramells hadn\u2019t passed away, we still wouldn\u2019t know. The background check was clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can it be clean, for fuck\u2019s sake?\u201d I knocked back the whiskey in one swallow.</p><p>\u201cEva\u2019s mother used Monica\u2019s name, birthdate, and family history, but she never opened a line of credit, which is how most identity theft is discovered. The bank account she\u2019s using was established twenty-five years ago and is a business account with a separate tax ID.\u201d</p><p>She would\u2019ve had to provide a personal SSN, as well, when she opened it, but the world was a very different place before the Internet.</p><p>The enormity of the fraud was difficult for me to grasp. If Angus was right, Eva\u2019s mother had lived more of her life as another woman than she had as herself.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no trail, lad,\u201d he reiterated, setting his tumbler down untouched. \u201cNo crumbs to follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the real Monica Tramell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer husband manages everything. In that sense, she hardly exists.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at the puppy who pawed at my shin. \u201cEva doesn\u2019t know about any of this,\u201d I said grimly. \u201cShe would\u2019ve told me.\u201d</p><p>Even as I said it, I had to wonder how she would\u2019ve told me. How would I tell her, if I were in her place? Could she keep such a huge secret, having lived with the lie so long she now believed it was true?</p><p>\u201cAye, Gideon,\u201d Angus said, his tone low and conciliatory. He wondered, too. It was his job to do so. \u201cShe loves you. Deeper and truer than I\u2019ve ever seen a lass love a man.\u201d</p><p>I lowered back onto the sofa, felt the slight weight of Lucky as he scrambled up beside me. \u201cI need to know more. Everything. I can\u2019t bring information like this to Eva in bits and pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have it,\u201d he promised.</p><p>9</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ...\u201d Wincing at the detailed sketch Cary had placed in front of me, I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty, but it\u2019s not ... right. It\u2019s not the right one.\u201d</p><p>Cary heaved out his breath. From where he sat on the floor at my feet, he dropped his head back on the couch to look at me upside down. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding. I hand you a one-of-a-kind wedding dress designed just for you and you blow it off ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a strapless dress. And this has a high-low hemline\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a train,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cThen why can I see the shoes? You shouldn\u2019t be able to see the shoes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a five-minute sketch. You can tell him to make the front longer.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, I grabbed the bottle of wine we\u2019d opened earlier and added more to my glass. Journey\u2019s greatest hits piped out through the surround sound speakers, the volume on low. The rest of the penthouse was quiet and dark \u0327 the living room illuminated by two end table lamps.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too ... contemporary,\u201d I complained. \u201cToo modern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d He lifted his head to look at the drawing again. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it cool.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s trendy, Cary. When I have kids, they\u2019ll look at it and wonder what I was thinking.\u201d I took a sip of my wine and ran my fingers through his thick hair. \u201cI want something timeless. Like Grace Kelly or Jackie Kennedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKids, huh?\u201d He leaned into my touch, like a cat. \u201cIf you hurry up, we can push strollers through the park together and plan playdates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Maybe in ten years.\u201d That sounded about right to me. Ten years of having Gideon to myself. Time for us to both grow a little more, smooth things out and find our groove.</p><p>Things were getting better every day, but we remained a volatile couple with a tempestuous relationship. What we\u2019d argued about earlier in his office?... I still didn\u2019t know. That was Gideon, though. As sleek, wild, and dangerous as a wolf. Eating out of my hand one minute and snapping at it the next. Which was usually followed by fucking me like a beast, so ... it worked for me.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cary said morosely. \u201cIt\u2019ll take ten years\u2014and immaculate conception\u2014for you to get knocked up if you don\u2019t start nailing him again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUgh.\u201d I yanked on his hair. \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business, but I rocked his world last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d He leered at me over his shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>I smirked. \u201cGoing to rock it again when he gets home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m jealous. I\u2019m not getting any. Zip. Zero. Zilch. My palm\u2019s going to have a permanent indentation from my lonely dick.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, I leaned back into the sofa. \u201cIt\u2019s good to take a break for a while. Puts things in perspective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou barely made it a week,\u201d he scoffed.</p> <p>\u201cTen days, actually. Ten horrible, hellacious, horrendous days.\u201d I took another drink.</p><p>\u201cRight? Sucks. Bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to go through it again, but I\u2019m glad we were able to take sex out of the equation for a little bit. Made us focus on talking things out and enjoying just hanging out. When we finally let loose, it was ...\u201d I licked my lips. \u201cExplosive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me hard.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He shot me an arch glance. \u201cI will not be ashamed of my healthy sex drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be proud of yourself for taking some time to figure out where you\u2019re going. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww, thanks, Mom.\u201d He leaned his head on my knee. \u201cYou know ... I could be lying to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope. If you were fucking around, you\u2019d want me to know about it, because then I\u2019d kick your ass, which is part of the fun.\u201d Not. But it was a way he used me to punish himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to be fun is Ibiza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIbiza?\u201d It took me a second to put it together. \u201cFor my bachelorette party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Spain. Half a world away. I hadn\u2019t been expecting that. \u201cHow long is this party supposed to last?\u201d</p><p>Cary flashed his million-dollar smile. \u201cThe weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that he gets a say, but Gideon\u2019s not going to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI smoothed him out. He\u2019s antsy about security, but he\u2019s going to be busy himself, in Brazil.\u201d</p><p>I sat up. \u201cBrazil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like a parrot tonight, repeating everything.\u201d</p><p>I loved Brazil. Loved the music, the weather, the passion of the people. There was a sensuality to the culture of Brazil that was unmatched in the world.</p><p>And thinking of Gideon there, with that pack of hot, rich men he called friends, celebrating the last days of a bachelorhood he\u2019d already given up ...</p><p>My best friend twisted to face me. \u201cI know that look. You\u2019re getting twitchy just thinking about him surrounded by Brazilian bikinis and the hot-blooded women wearing them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Cary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got the right crew to hit it hard, too. Especially that Manuel character. He\u2019s a major player.\u201d</p><p>I remembered watching Manuel Alcoa make a conquest when we\u2019d all gone out together to a karaoke bar. Like Arnoldo, Gideon, and Arash, Manuel didn\u2019t even have to try. He just had to pick from the wide selection of women throwing themselves at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What would my husband do when his friends paired off with beautiful babes? Sit by himself and nurse a caipirinha? I didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>Gideon wouldn\u2019t cheat. He wouldn\u2019t even flirt; it wasn\u2019t his style. He hadn\u2019t even flirted with me in the beginning and I was the love of his life. No, he would dominate the room, looking dark and dangerous and untouchable, while an endless tide of gorgeous women frothed around him.</p><p>How could he possibly be unaffected by that?</p><p>Cary laughed. \u201cYou look ready to murder someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re closest,\u201d I warned him.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kill me. Who else will pack just the right outfits for you to make Gideon as jealous as you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like I came home at just the right time.\u201d</p><p>Cary and I both looked over at the front door and found Gideon coming in with a duffel bag slung over his shoulder and a pet carrier dangling from his hand.</p><p>My scowl was chased away by the delight that ran through me at the sight of him. I couldn\u2019t say how he did it, but Gideon made even sweats and a T-shirt look insanely hot.</p><p>He set his stuff down on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you got there?\u201d Cary climbed to his feet and walked over to the carrier.</p><p>I stood and went to my husband, thrilled with the simple joy of welcoming him home. He met me halfway, his arms coming around me. I pushed my hands up beneath the back of his shirt, caressing the warm, hard muscle. As he bent to kiss me, I tilted my head back. His lips brushed mine, then settled in for a soft, wordless hello.</p><p>As he straightened, he licked his lips. \u201cYou taste like wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>I headed into the kitchen to grab another glass. Behind me, I heard the guys greet each other, and then Gideon introduced Lucky to Cary. Happy barking and Cary\u2019s rich laugh filtered through the air.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t moved in yet, but it felt like home.</p><p>Cary had been gone an hour before I worked up the nerve to ask Gideon the burning question on my mind.</p><p>We were sitting on the couch. He slouched comfortably, knees wide, one arm slung over my shoulder, one hand lying casually on his thigh. I was curled against his side, my legs pulled up, my head on his shoulder, my fingers toying with the hem of his T-shirt. Lucky slept in the playpen by the unlighted fireplace, occasionally whimpering as he dreamed about whatever it was that dogs dreamed about.</p><p>Gideon had been quiet for the last thirty minutes, almost contemplative, as I discussed the merits of the wedding dress sketch he\u2019d picked up from the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d I said, finishing, \u201cI feel like I\u2019ll know it when I see it, but I\u2019m running out of time. I\u2019m trying not to panic about it. I just don\u2019t want to settle.\u201d</p><p>His hand lifted from my shoulder and cupped the back of my head. His lips pressed against my forehead. \u201cYou could wear jeans, angel, and be the most beautiful bride ever.\u201d</p><p>Touched, I snuggled closer. I inhaled deeply, then asked, \u201cWhere in Brazil are you going?\u201d</p> <p>Gideon\u2019s fingers sifted through my hair. \u201cRio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I could picture him lazing on the white sand shore of Copacabana, his magnificent sun-bronzed body on display, the brilliant blue of his eyes shielded behind dark sunglasses.</p><p>The lovely women on the beach wouldn\u2019t be able to tell if he was watching them or not. That would excite them, make them bold.</p><p>At night, he and the guys would take in the nightlife in Ipanema or maybe they\u2019d be true hedonists and head to Lapa. Anywhere they went, stunning, passionate, scantily clad women would follow. It was inevitable.</p><p>\u201cI heard Cary say you\u2019re jealous,\u201d he murmured, nuzzling the crown of my head. There was a smug note of satisfaction in his voice.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you picked Brazil? So I\u2019d suffer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d His grip on my hair tightened, gently urging my head back to look at him. \u201cI had nothing to do with the selection of the destination.\u201d His lips tilted up in a sexy smile. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad you\u2019ll suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadist.\u201d I pulled away from him.</p><p>Gideon wouldn\u2019t let me get far, tugging me back. \u201cAfter your suggestion about Deanna, I was beginning to think you were getting bored with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hysterical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me,\u201d he said evenly. His gaze searched my face.</p><p>Realizing he was at least partly serious, I stopped trying to get away. \u201cI told you I didn\u2019t like the idea of you hiring her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right away you didn\u2019t. You recommended I seduce her like you\u2019d tell me to pick up a bottle of wine on the way home from work.

The other is a last hurrah for sport fucking in the one of the sexiest cities in the world!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know better.\u201d His voice was low and smooth, easy.

Let\u2019s get back to the Deanna scenario.\u201d I wriggled away and stood. Facing the coffee table, I stretched out my hands, directing. \u201cThis is how I pictured it before I made the suggestion. You in your office, leaning back against your desk in that way you do that\u2019s sexy as hell. Jacket on the coatrack, maybe a scotch on the rocks next to your hand for an informal touch.\u201d</p><p>I faced the couch. \u201cDeanna\u2019s in the chair farthest from you, so she can get the full picture. You give her a slow once-over, say a few double entendres about getting things done together. She gets ideas and seals the deal with a signature on the dotted line. That\u2019s it. You never get closer than a few feet from her and you never sit down. The glass wall stays clear, so she won\u2019t make a move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou imagined all this in a split second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u201d\u2014I tapped my temple\u2014\u201cI have some memories rattling around up here that fueled the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy memories of seduction in my office don\u2019t include anyone else,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cListen, ace.\u201d I sat on the coffee table. \u201cIt was a spontaneous thought that came to me because I was worried about you.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s face softened. \u201cAngels rush in. I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Leaning forward, I put my hands on his knees. \u201cI\u2019m always going to be possessive, Gideon. You\u2019re mine. I wish I could put a sign on you that says it.\u201d</p><p>He held up his left hand, showing off his wedding band.</p><p>I scoffed. \u201cYou know how many women are going to pay attention to that when you\u2019re trolling through Rio with your crew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll pay attention when I point it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen one of the guys will let slip that it\u2019s a bachelor party and they\u2019ll just try harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying won\u2019t get them anywhere.\u201d</p><p>My gaze ran over him. \u201cYou\u2019ll be irresistible in graphite gray dress slacks and a black V-neck shirt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re remembering that night at the club.\u201d</p> <p>He obviously did, too. His cock thickened and lengthened, tenting his sweatpants obscenely.</p><p>I almost moaned as his arousal proved what I\u2019d suspected: He was commando beneath the soft cotton.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you after you left my office,\u201d he murmured. \u201cCouldn\u2019t get the vision of you out of my mind. Then I called you at work and you taunted me, telling me you were going home to play with your vibrator when my cock was hard and ready for you.\u201d</p><p>I squirmed, recalling every detail. He had been wearing a V-neck sweater that night in New York, but what I imagined him wearing in Rio made allowances for the tropical climate and the steamy press of bodies in a nightclub.</p><p>\u201cIn my mind, I saw you on your bed,\u201d he went on, reaching between his legs to stroke his erection through his pants. \u201cYour legs spread. Your back arching. Your body naked and shiny with sweat as you pushed a thick plastic cock in and out of your creamy cunt. I was half crazed with the idea of it. I\u2019d never felt lust like that. It felt like I was in heat. The need to fuck was a fever inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Gideon.\u201d My sex ached. My breasts felt swollen and tender, the nipples tight and sore.</p><p>He watched me, his eyes hooded. \u201cI went out before I arranged to meet you. I was going to find someone who wouldn\u2019t say no like you did. I was going to take her to the hotel, spread her out, fuck her until the madness went away. Who she was didn\u2019t matter. She was going to be faceless, nameless. I wasn\u2019t going to look at her while I was inside her.

At them for being inferior. At me for being too weak to forget you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I felt,\u201d I confessed. \u201cEvery guy I met was wrong. They weren\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always going to be that way for me, Eva. Just you. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about you cheating,\u201d I reiterated, standing. I took off my tank top, then my shorts. My nude lace Carine Gilson bra and panties followed. I stripped quickly, methodically. No tease whatsoever.</p><p>Gideon lounged, watching, unmoving. Like the sex god he was, waiting to be pleasured.</p><p>Then I saw him through someone else\u2019s eyes, my husband sitting just like that in a crowded Brazilian club, the silent demand for sex pouring off him in waves of heat and need. It was just who he was, an intensely and insatiably sexual creature. Was there a woman alive able to resist the challenge of him? I hadn\u2019t met one yet.</p><p>I moved to him. Straddled him. My hands slid over his broad shoulders, feeling the warmth of him through the cotton of his T-shirt. His hands went to my hips, burning my skin. \u201cThe women who see you will want to do this,\u201d I murmured. \u201cTouch you like this. They\u2019ll imagine it.\u201d</p><p>Looking up at me, Gideon stroked his tongue slowly over his bottom lip. \u201cI\u2019ll be imagining you. Just like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll only make it worse, because they\u2019ll see how bad you want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow badly I want you,\u201d he corrected, moving his hands to cup my ass and urge me against his erection. The lips of my sex, parted by the spread of my thighs, hugged his cock through the lace. My clit pressed against his hardness and I rolled my hips with a gasp of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI can see them finding the best vantage point,\u201d I told him breathlessly, \u201cstaring at you with fuck-me eyes. Running their fingers down their cleavage so you appreciate their assets. They shift on their feet, crossing and recrossing their legs because they want this.\u201d</p><p>I cupped his hard, thick penis and stroked it. He flexed in my palm, vitally alive and eager. His lips parted, the only break in his control.</p><p>\u201cYour mind\u2019s on me, so you\u2019re hard. And if you\u2019re sitting like this, with your legs spread, they can see how big your cock is and how ready you are to use it.\u201d</p><p>Reaching behind me, I circled his wrist with my fingers and pulled his left arm up to drape over the low back of the sofa. \u201cYou look like this. Don\u2019t move.\u201d I moved his other arm to his lap. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a tumbler in this hand, with two fingers of dark cacha\u00e7a inside it. You sip it every now and then, licking it off your lips.\u201d</p><p>I leaned forward and stroked my tongue over the sensual curve. He had a gorgeous, sexy mouth. The lips were full, but firm. They were often stern, giving little clue to his thoughts. He smiled rarely, but when he did, he could flash a boyishly playful grin or a smugly confident challenge. His slow smiles were erotic teases, while his wry half-smiles mocked both himself and others.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll seem distant and remote,\u201d I went on. \u201cLost in your own thoughts. Bored by the frenetic energy and pounding music. The guys ebb and flow around you. Manuel always has a hot beauty on his lap. A different one every time you look. As far as he\u2019s concerned, there\u2019s more than enough of him to go around.\u201d</p><p>Gideon smiled. \u201cAnd he has a fondness for Latinas. He totally approves of my choice in wives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWife,\u201d I corrected. \u201cYour first and last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy only,\u201d he agreed. \u201cHot-tempered. Hot-blooded. My one and only permanent one-night stand. I know exactly how it will be between us, and then you go and take me by surprise. You eat me alive, every time, and want more.\u201d</p><p>I cupped his jaw in one hand and kissed him, still stroking his penis in long, leisurely pulls. \u201cArash stops by with a new drink for you every time he makes his way around the room. He tells you stories about what he\u2019s seen while circling and you briefly look amused, which drives the women watching you wild. That little flash of intimacy and warmth only makes them want more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Arnoldo?\u201d he murmured, watching me with hot dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s detached, like you. He\u2019s wounded and wary from his broken heart, but he\u2019s accessible. He flirts and smiles, but there\u2019s always that sense of something unreachable about him. The women who are too intimidated by you will go for Arnoldo. He\u2019ll make them forget you, even while he\u2019s forgetting about them altogether.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A ghost of a smile touched his mouth. \u201cWhile I sit there stewing and brooding with a perpetual hard-on, missing you so badly I can\u2019t have any fun at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way I\u2019m picturing it, ace.\u201d I sat back on his rock-hard thighs. \u201cAnd the women will be envisioning themselves coming up to you and sitting on your lap like I am. They\u2019ll want to push their hands up your shirt like this.\u201d</p><p>I slid my palms beneath the hem of his T-shirt and pressed them against the rigid lacing of his abs. My fingers followed the grooves, tracing every muscle of his eight-pack that I could reach. \u201cThey\u2019ll fantasize about how hard your body is beneath your clothes, how your pecs will feel when they squeeze them.\u201d</p><p>My actions accompanied my words, my heartbeat starting to race at the feel of him beneath my hands. Gideon was so cut and strong, a powerful sexual machine. There was a primitive female drive that responded instantly to that. Craved it. He was a male worthy of mating with, an alpha in his prime. Vigorous. Potent. Eminently dangerous and untamable.</p><p>He moved and I stopped. \u201cNo, stay still,\u201d I admonished. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t touch them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be near me at all.\u201d But he resumed the pose I\u2019d put him in. A sultan of old, being worshipped by an eager harem girl.</p><p>I lifted his shirt. I pulled it up and over his head, pinning his shoulders back with the hard stretch of fabric. His head turned, his mouth latching onto my nipple and suckling, easy, gentle tugs of suction on the sensitive point. I whimpered and tried to pull away, too turned on to bear it. His teeth caught the hardened tip, trapping me.</p><p>My head bowed, my eyes riveted to the sight of his hollowing cheeks. Inside the heat of his mouth, his tongue lashed my nipple, his lean throat working as he swallowed. My core tightened and trembled, echoing the rhythmic pulls.</p><p>Reaching between us, I untied the drawstring of his waistband and pushed the elastic down enough to free him. I held him in both hands, my fingertips tracing the thick pulsing veins coursing along his brutally sexy length. He was wet at the crown, my hands gliding over the slickness of pre-ejaculate.</p><p>His mouth released me when I aligned his cock with the opening to my sex. \u201cTake it slow, angel,\u201d he ordered gruffly. \u201cWork it in. I\u2019ll be in you all night and I don\u2019t want you sore.\u201d</p><p>Goose bumps swept over my skin. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t imagine taking you slow,\u201d I argued.</p><p>Gideon reached up with both hands, pushing the hair back from my face. \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking of other women now, angel. It\u2019s you you\u2019re picturing.\u201d</p><p>With a start, I realized he was right. The woman mounting him wasn\u2019t one of the leggy brunettes I\u2019d visualized eye-fucking him. That was me. I was the one stroking his cock adoringly. I was the one positioning him, lowering onto him, taking a moment to rub the wide head of his penis back and forth between the lips of my sex.</p><p>My husband groaned at the feel of me, his hips lifting slightly, pushing demandingly into the entrance of my body. He grabbed my hips, pulled me down, spreading my sex open with the flared tip of his cock.</p><p>\u201cOh, Gideon.\u201d My eyelids grew heavy as I sank onto him, taking a thick inch inside me.</p><p>He lifted me slightly, until just the crown was in me, then lowered me again, making me take more. The tendons in his neck stood out in stark relief. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me wearing a sign. You want me wearing you, your tight, little cunt squeezing my cock. You imagine yourself topping me, as I just sit back and let you have it.\u201d</p><p>He stretched his arms out along the back of the sofa, displaying that magnificently male torso. \u201cOr do you want me to participate?\u201d</p><p>Wetting my dry lips, I shook my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I pushed up, then slid back down. Over and over. Working him deeper each time, until my buttocks sat atop his thighs. He was thick and long. I whimpered softly as he throbbed inside me.</p><p>And I didn\u2019t have all of him yet.</p><p>Tilting my head, I kissed him, savoring the slow slide of his tongue against mine.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re watching you, aren\u2019t they?\u201d he purred.</p><p>\u201cWatching you. When I lift, they can catch a glimpse of you, see how large your cock really is. They want it, ache for it, but it\u2019s mine. You\u2019re the one watching me. You can\u2019t take your eyes off me. For you, there\u2019s no one else in the room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I still don\u2019t touch you, do I?\u201d His mouth curved wickedly when I shook my head. \u201cI sip the cacha\u00e7a casually, as if I don\u2019t have the sexiest woman alive riding my dick in full view of everyone. I\u2019m not bored anymore, but then, I never was. I was waiting. For you. Knowing you were there because of the hum in my blood.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With my hands on his shoulders, I fucked him with cadenced pumps of my hips. He was delicious. The feel of his cock moving inside me. The low, dangerous rumble in his chest that betrayed how aroused he was. The sheen of sweat on his chest. The way his abs clenched when I dropped down and his cock pushed deep. I couldn\u2019t get enough.</p><p>And the way he joined my game ... how well he knew me ... how much he loved me ...</p><p>Gideon lost himself in sex with me, but he was always aware, his focus on me before his orgasm. He\u2019d recognized my fantasy of exhibitionist sex before I had, and he indulged it. Always keeping me safe, never truly risking exposure but teasing me with the possibility of it. I would never share him that way, I was too possessive. And he would never share even a glimpse of me because he was too protective.</p><p>But we teased and we played. For two people for whom sex had been introduced with pain and shame, that we could find such joy and love in the act was wondrous.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so hard inside you,\u201d he growled, flexing in my sex the way he had in my hand. \u201cThe music is loud, so no one hears the sounds I make, but you can feel them. You know you\u2019re driving me crazy. The fact that I don\u2019t show it turns you on as much as being watched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour control,\u201d I gasped, speeding up the tempo.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m topping from the bottom,\u201d he said darkly. \u201cYou pretend to be in charge, but that\u2019s not what you want. I know your secrets, Eva. I\u2019ll know them all. There\u2019s nothing you can hide from me.\u201d</p><p>He put the pad of his thumb to his lips and ran his tongue across it in a slow, sensual lick, his eyes never leaving my face. Reaching between us, he rubbed my clit in hard, quick circles and I came with a cry, my sex milking his cock in ecstatic ripples.</p><p>He exploded into action, catching me close and rising, bearing me down to the couch on my back as he pushed off the floor with his feet, driving that final thick inch of cock inside me. Then he was fucking me with a violent, primal hunger, powering through the ripples of my climax in the race for his own.</p><p>Throwing his head back, he gasped my name and jerked inside me. He spurted hotly, groaning, his hips still thrusting as if he couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Blinking, I came to, slowly aware of moonlight on the ceiling. A pillow cushioned my head and the warmth of a comforter blanketed my nude body.</p><p>I turned my head to look for Gideon, but the space beside me was empty, the covers disturbed but folded up neatly. I sat up and looked at the clock. It was almost three in the morning.</p><p>Sitting up, I looked toward the bathroom, then the hallway. Faint light filtered in through the crack of the partially closed door. I climbed out of bed and went to it, unhooking the robe that hung on the back. I slid into the peacock blue silk as I left the room, cinching the belt while I walked to Gideon\u2019s home office.</p><p>It was the light from that room that lit the hallway and I squinted as I entered, my eyes unaccustomed to the brightness. I took in the scene with a swift glance: the puppy asleep on the dog bed and the pensive man sitting at his desk. His gaze was on the collage of photos of me that graced his wall, his arms balanced on the armrests of his chair, a tumbler of amber liquid held between his hands.</p><p>He looked at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, padding across the room in my bare feet. \u201cYou\u2019re not avoiding the bed, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I should,\u201d he qualified, \u201cbut no. I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to wear you out?\u201d I offered a smile, which probably looked silly considering I had one eye closed against the glare.</p><p>My husband set his drink down and patted his lap. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>I went to him, curling up against him with my arms around his neck. I pressed my lips to his jaw. \u201cSomething\u2019s bugging you.\u201d</p><p>And it had been bothering him all night, whatever it was.</p><p>Nuzzling the tip of his nose against the curve of my ear, he whispered, \u201cIs there anything you haven\u2019t told me?\u201d</p><p>I frowned and pulled back, searching his face. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike anything.\u201d His chest expanded on a deep breath. \u201cDo you have any secrets left?\u201d</p><p>I absorbed that, feeling an odd twisting in my stomach. \u201cYour birthday present. But I\u2019m not telling you what it is.\u201d</p><p>A tiny smile softened his mouth.</p><p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d I murmur, charmed by that smile. \u201cAll the pieces of you that only I know. You are a secret I will keep until I breathe my last breath.\u201d</p><p>His head bowed, his hair briefly shielding his face. \u201cAngel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas something happened, Gideon?\u201d</p><p>It took him a long moment to reply. He looked at me. \u201cWould you tell me if someone you knew, someone close to you, was doing something illegal?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The twisting in my gut turned into a knot. \u201cWhat have you heard?

That\u2019s why things are really good between us right now.\u201d</p><p>The soft smile came back. \u201cThey are, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally.\u201d I kissed his smiling mouth. \u201cNo more running, no more hiding.\u201d</p><p>Adjusting his hold on me, Gideon stood, lifting me with him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d I queried, burrowing into his warm body.</p> <p>He headed back to the bedroom. \u201cYou\u2019re going to wear me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay.\u201d</p><p>The next morning passed like the morning before, with Gideon up at the usual time while I lazed naked in the bed like a sloth.</p><p>As he knotted his tie in the closet, he glanced away from the mirror to look at me. \u201cWhat are your plans for the day?\u201d</p><p>Yawning, I hugged my pillow closer. \u201cI\u2019m going back to sleep when you leave. Just for an hour. Blaire Ash is stopping by at ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he?\u201d He looked back at the mirror. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m changing things around. We\u2019re going to turn the guest bedroom into a home office with a Murphy bed. That way, we still have room for guests and I have a place to work.\u201d</p><p>Gideon smoothed his tie, then started buttoning his vest, stepping out into the bedroom. \u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue.\u201d I deliberately moved my leg so that the sheet slid off it. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to argue about it.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019d originally agreed to turn the guest room into my room and connect it to the master bath to form a his-and-hers master suite. The layout would address Gideon\u2019s parasomnia but also meant we\u2019d have to sleep in separate rooms.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be sharing a bed,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI disagree.\u201d Before he could press the point, I went on. \u201cI tried to make the best of it, Gideon, but I\u2019m not happy with the idea of being apart like that.\u201d</p><p>He stood there silently, shoving his hands into the pockets of his slacks. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to make me choose between your happiness and your safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I\u2019m not making you choose, I already decided. I\u2019m aware that\u2019s not fair, either, but the call had to be made and I made it.\u201d I sat up and shoved the pillow behind me, scooting back so I could lean against the headboard.</p><p>\u201cWe made the call together. Then you apparently changed your mind without discussing it further. And flashing your tits at me\u2014as stunning as they are\u2014isn\u2019t going to distract me.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him. \u201cIf I wanted to distract you, I wouldn\u2019t have brought the subject up in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCancel the consult, Eva,\u201d he said tightly. \u201cWe need to talk about this first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe consult already happened. We had to cut it short because the cops came over, but Blaire\u2019s already working on new designs. He\u2019s bringing me some ideas today.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s hands came out of his pockets and his arms crossed. \u201cSo your happiness comes first and to hell with mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not happy sharing a bed with me?\u201d</p><p>A muscle in his jaw ticced. \u201cDon\u2019t jerk me around. You\u2019re not taking into consideration what it would do to me if I hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly my frustration turned to shame. \u201cGideon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not thinking about what it would do to us,\u201d he bit out. \u201cI\u2019ll let you experiment with a lot of things, Eva, but nothing that\u2019s going to damage our relationship. If you want to fall asleep next to me, I\u2019ll be there. If you want to wake up with me beside you, I can do that, too. But the hours in between when we\u2019re both unconscious are too dangerous to gamble with on a fucking whim.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed past a lump in my throat. I wanted to explain further, to tell him that I worried about the distance separate bedrooms would create. Not just physically but emotionally. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It hurt me to have him make love to me, then leave my bed. It took something beautiful and magical and turned it into something else. And if he stayed until I slept, then woke before me to return, he would suffer from lack of sleep. As tireless as he so often seemed, he was still human. He worked hard, worked out harder, and had to deal with tons of stress day after day. Being short on sleep couldn\u2019t become routine.</p><p>But his fears for my safety weren\u2019t going to be dismissed in a single conversation. We would have to go step-by-step.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I conceded. \u201cLet\u2019s agree to this: Blaire will drop off his concepts and we\u2019ll look them over together later.

He wants you.\u201d</p><p>I sat back. \u201cHe finds me attractive,\u201d I corrected. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a natural-born flirt.\u201d</p> <p>Gideon\u2019s eyes took on a dangerous gleam. \u201cHas he been hitting on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing unprofessional. If he crossed a line I\u2019d fire him myself, but I think he probably finesses all his female clients. I bet it\u2019s good for business.\u201d I smiled. \u201cHe cooled his jets when I told him I was getting used to your stamina and didn\u2019t feel like I needed a separate bed for sleep anymore.\u201d</p><p>His brows shot up. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI totally did. I can sleep when I\u2019m dead, I told him. In the meantime, if my husband wants to hit it with me a half-dozen times every night and he\u2019s as skilled as he is at doing it, who am I to complain?\u201d</p><p>The first time we\u2019d consulted with Blaire, I hadn\u2019t considered what the designer would think about Gideon marrying a woman he didn\u2019t intend to sleep with. When Blaire\u2019s subtle flirtation registered, I realized why he might think I\u2019d be receptive\u2014and understood how awkward the whole situation was for my husband. Yet Gideon had never complained about how it might look to an outsider. His concern was for me, not his reputation as a world-class player.</p><p>I\u2019d enjoyed setting Blaire straight.</p> <p>I fluffed my messy hair. \u201cI\u2019m a blonde with big tits. Throw a giggle in there and I can usually get away with saying anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Gideon feigned a long-suffering sigh but was clearly amused. \u201cIs it a compulsion of yours to share the details of our sex life with everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I winked. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly fun.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t go to sleep after Gideon left for work. Instead, I picked up the phone and called my trainer, Parker Smith. Since it was early, he wasn\u2019t working yet and picked up.</p><p>\u201cHey, Parker. It\u2019s Eva Tramell. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. You coming in today? You\u2019re slacking lately.\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my nose. \u201cI know. And yes, I\u2019m coming in. That\u2019s why I\u2019m calling. I want to work on something with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What\u2019s on your mind?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve gone over situational awareness and what to do if you\u2019re cornered, how to get away. But what if I\u2019m completely taken off guard, like when I\u2019m sleeping?\u201d</p><p>He absorbed that. \u201cA hard knee shot in the balls will lay any man out. Gives you the opening you need.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d done that before to Gideon, to snap him out of a vicious nightmare. I would do it again, if it came to that, but I\u2019d prefer to break his hold and get away without hurting him. He was already hurting so much in his dreams. I didn\u2019t want him to wake up to pain, too.</p><p>\u201cBut what if ... How would you knee someone when they\u2019re lying on top of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can work it out. Choreograph some different scenarios.\u201d He paused. \u201cEverything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s great,\u201d I assured him, and then I lied. \u201cIt just came up on a TV show I was watching last night and I realized that no matter how prepared you are, you can\u2019t be situationally aware when you\u2019re sleeping.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll be at the warehouse in a couple hours and stay until closing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>I ended the call, then headed into the shower. When I came back out, there were two missed calls from Cary. I dialed him back.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking. You said something about a classic dress, right?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. It made me cringe every time I thought about it. Because no matter how much I wanted to believe the perfect dress would fall out of the sky before the big day, it was more realistic to accept that I was going to have to settle.</p><p>Still, I had to love Cary for staying on me about it. He knew me as well as I knew myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat about one of Monica\u2019s bridal gowns?\u201d he suggested. \u201cSomething old and all that. You two have the same build. It wouldn\u2019t take much alteration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh. Really? No, Cary. If she\u2019d married my dad in it, maybe. But I can\u2019t wear something she wore to marry a stepdad. That\u2019s just weird.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. She has great taste, though.\u201d</p><p>I ran my fingers through my damp hair. \u201cI don\u2019t think she keeps her wedding dresses, anyway. Not a great souvenir to have hanging around your new husband\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so it\u2019s a stupid idea. We can hunt for something vintage. A pal of mine knows every couture and designer consignment shop in Manhattan.\u201d</p><p>The thought had merit. \u201cCool. That\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, I\u2019m brilliant. I\u2019m tied up with Grey Isles today, but tonight works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have couples counseling tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, right. Have fun with that. Tomorrow? Maybe we\u2019ll pick up a few things for Ibiza, too.\u201d</p><p>The reminder of the weekend\u2019s plans made me feel pressed for time. I couldn\u2019t help being anxious about it, even knowing how much fun it would be to spend time with my friends. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s good. I\u2019ll come to the apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet. We\u2019ll pack, too.\u201d</p><p>We hung up and I held my phone in my hand for a long time, feeling a sense of grief. For the first time since we\u2019d moved to New York, it felt like Cary and I were living in two separate places. I was settling into being home with Gideon, while Cary\u2019s home was still very much the apartment.</p><p>My calendar app beeped a reminder that Blaire would be showing up in thirty minutes. Cursing to myself, I dropped my phone on the bed and hurried to get ready.</p><p>\u201cHow are you both doing?\u201d Dr. Petersen asked, as we all three took our seats.</p><p>Gideon and I sat on the couch, as usual, while Dr. Petersen settled into his armchair and picked up his tablet.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re better than ever,\u201d I answered.</p> <p>My husband said nothing, but he reached over and took my hand, pulling it over to rest on his thigh.</p><p>\u201cI received an invitation to your reception.\u201d Dr. Petersen smiled. \u201cMy wife and I are very much looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been able to convince my mom to include even the tiniest bit of red on the invites, but I thought they were pretty all the same. We\u2019d agreed on a vellum invitation, tucked into a sheer pocket, with an exterior white envelope for mailing and privacy. It gave me butterflies thinking of them being received. We were another step closer to putting the fa\u00e7ade of an engagement behind us.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d I leaned my shoulder against Gideon\u2019s and he put his arm around me.</p><p>\u201cThe last time we met,\u201d Dr. Petersen said, \u201cyou\u2019d just quit your job, Eva. How has that been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasier than I thought. I\u2019ve been busy, though, so that helps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelps with what?\u201d</p><p>I considered my answer. \u201cFrom feeling aimless. I\u2019m busier now. And I\u2019m working on things that actually make a difference in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wedding, of course. And moving into the penthouse, which I\u2019m doing in baby steps. And planning some renovations, which I\u2019d like to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He studied me. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about those baby steps first. Is there any significance to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, just that I\u2019m not doing it all at once. It\u2019s ongoing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you view it as a way to ease into the commitment? Previously, you\u2019ve acted very decisively. Eloping. Separating. Quitting your job.\u201d</p><p>That made me think. \u201cIt\u2019s a transition that affects Gideon and Cary as much as it does me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Gideon interjected, \u201cthe sooner she\u2019s moved in, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just being careful.\u201d I shrugged. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dr. Petersen scrawled across his tablet screen, taking notes. \u201cIs Cary having difficulty adjusting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admitted. \u201cHe\u2019s not acting like he is. But I worry. He falls into bad habits without support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any thoughts about that, Gideon?\u201d</p><p>He kept his tone neutral. \u201cI knew what I was getting into when I married her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlways a good thing.\u201d Dr. Petersen smiled. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t tell me much.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s hand lifted from my shoulder and went to my hair, playing with it. \u201cAs a married man yourself, Doctor, you know there are concessions a husband makes to keep the peace. Cary is one of mine.\u201d</p><p>That hurt me to hear, but I understood Cary had started out with a clean slate with Gideon. Then he\u2019d made several wrong moves\u2014like having group sex in our living room one night\u2014that put marks against him.</p><p>Dr. Petersen looked at me. \u201cSo you\u2019re attempting to balance the needs of both your husband and your best friend. Is that stressful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fun,\u201d I hedged, \u201cbut it\u2019s not really balancing, either. My marriage\u2014and Gideon\u2014comes first.\u201d</p> <p>I could tell Gideon liked hearing that when his hand fisted gently\u2014possessively\u2014in my hair.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d I continued, \u201cI don\u2019t want to overwhelm Gideon and I don\u2019t want Cary to feel abandoned. Moving a small bag of stuff over every day makes the change gradual.\u201d</p><p>Once the thought was out, I had to admit how maternal that sounded. Still, I couldn\u2019t help wanting to protect those in my life who needed it, especially from pain my own actions might cause.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve mentioned everyone but you,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe penthouse is starting to feel like home. The only thing I\u2019m struggling with is our sleeping arrangements. We\u2019ve been sharing a bed, but Gideon wants us to sleep separately and I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the nightmares?\u201d Dr. Petersen asked, his gaze on Gideon.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cHave you had any lately?\u201d</p><p>My husband nodded. \u201cNot the really bad ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat constitutes a really bad nightmare? One that you act out physically?\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s chest expanded on a deep breath. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The doctor looked at me again. \u201cYou understand the risk, Eva, but you still want to share a bed with Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d My heartbeat quickened at the memories. Gideon had pinned me down viciously, ugly words of pain and fury spilling out in terrible threats of violence.</p><p>In the grip of a nightmare, Gideon didn\u2019t see me, he saw Hugh\u2014a man he wanted to tear apart with his bare hands.</p> <p>\u201cMany happily married couples sleep separately,\u201d Dr. Petersen pointed out. \u201cThe reasons are varied\u2014the husband snores, the wife steals the covers, et cetera\u2014but they find that sleeping apart is more conducive to marital harmony than sleeping together.\u201d</p><p>I straightened away from Gideon, needing them both to understand. \u201cI like sleeping next to him. Sometimes, I wake up in the middle of the night and I watch him sleep. Sometimes, I wake up and I don\u2019t even open my eyes, I just listen to him breathing. I can smell him, feel his warmth. I sleep better when he\u2019s beside me. And I know he sleeps better, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d Gideon\u2019s hand stroked my back.</p><p>Looking over my shoulder, I caught his gaze. His face was impassive. Gorgeous. His eyes, however, were dark blue pools of pain. I reached for his hand. \u201cI know it hurts you. I\u2019m sorry. I just need us to work toward having that. I don\u2019t want us to ever give up on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you describe,\u201d Dr. Petersen said gently, \u201cis intimacy, Eva. And it\u2019s one of the true joys of marriage. It\u2019s understandable that you crave it. Everyone does to some extent. For you and Gideon, however, it probably seems particularly important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does to me,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>\u201cAre you implying it\u2019s different for me?\u201d Gideon said tightly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I twisted to face him. \u201cPlease don\u2019t get defensive. This isn\u2019t your fault. I\u2019m not blaming you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how shitty this makes me feel?\u201d he accused.</p><p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t take it personally, Gideon. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife wants to watch me sleep and I can\u2019t even give her that,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWhat is that, if not fucking personal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s discuss,\u201d Dr. Petersen said quickly, drawing our attention to him. \u201cThe root of this conversation is a craving for intimate familiarity. Human beings, by nature, desire intimacy, but childhood sexual abuse survivors can find this need especially acute.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gideon was still tense, but he was listening attentively.</p><p>\u201cIn many cases,\u201d the doctor continued, \u201cthe abuser works hard to isolate the victim to help conceal their crime and make the victim dependent. The victims themselves very often withdraw from friends and family. Everyone else\u2019s lives seem so ordinary and the troubles of others so insignificant next to the terrible secret they feel forced to hide.\u201d</p><p>I slid back into place against Gideon\u2019s side, pulling my knees up to hug him with the whole of my body. His arm came tight around me once more, his other hand reaching for mine.</p><p>Dr. Petersen\u2019s face softened as he watched us. \u201cThat deep loneliness was alleviated when you both opened up to each other, but being starved of true intimacy for so long leaves a mark. I urge you to consider alternative ways to achieve the closeness you crave, Eva. Create signals and rituals that are unique to your relationship, that don\u2019t threaten either one of you and bring you both a sense of connection.\u201d</p> <p>Sighing, I nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll work on it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd your nightmares, Gideon, are likely to continue to lessen in quantity and severity as we do. But this is just the beginning. We\u2019ve taken some first steps in a long journey.\u201d</p><p>Tilting my head back, I looked up at Gideon. \u201cA lifetime,\u201d I vowed.</p><p>Gideon touched my cheek with gentle fingers. He didn\u2019t say the words, but I saw them in his gaze, felt them in his caress.</p><p>We had love. The rest would come.</p> <p>10</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been communicating with Benjamin Clancy,\u201d Ra\u00fal said, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees. \u201cYou and Mrs. Cross will be heading toward the airport at the same time, so you can travel together, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I needed that time with Eva before we went our separate ways. The hours in the workday were too long to be away from her. A weekend was going to be torture. \u201cI\u2019ll call her and let her know we\u2019ll be picking her up. We\u2019ll need the limo.\u201d</p><p>A professional to the core, Ra\u00fal showed no reaction. It would make more sense to use the limo for Eva\u2019s friends, instead of us, but neither the Bentley nor the Benz offered the privacy I required.</p><p>Sitting on the couch in my office, I faced both Angus and Ra\u00fal, who\u2019d settled into the two club chairs. We\u2019d decided that Angus should stay behind while Ra\u00fal headed the security team accompanying me to Brazil.</p><p>Angus would be heading to Austin to dig into the background of Lauren Kittrie.</p> <p>Ra\u00fal nodded his understanding. \u201cWe\u2019ll make separate transportation arrangements for her friends and yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is Eva getting to Ibiza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivate jet,\u201d he replied, \u201cchartered by Richard Stanton. I suggested they stay at the Hotel Vientos Cruzados Ibiza and Clancy agreed. It took some doing, as the resort is fully booked for the summer season, but the property manager was able to make it happen. They\u2019ve stepped up security in anticipation of Mrs. Cross\u2019s arrival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Having Eva stay in a Cross Industries resort gave me added peace of mind. We had two well-known nightclubs in Ibiza as well, one in Ibiza Town and one in Sant Antoni. I knew without asking that both had been pointed out to Clancy in advance. I expected he\u2019d use the information. He was a smart man and would appreciate the added support provided by their security and staff.</p><p>\u201cAs we discussed previously,\u201d he went on, \u201cwe\u2019ll have our own team in place at the airport, and they\u2019ll follow Mrs. Cross over the weekend. They\u2019ve been instructed to stay in plainclothes and blend in, providing backup for Clancy\u2019s team and interceding only when absolutely necessary.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Clancy was good, but he had both Monica and Eva under his watch, and they considered Cary family, so Clancy would be watching him closely, too. His focus would be divided three ways, with Monica taking precedence as the wife of his employer. Eva wasn\u2019t the priority for anyone else that she was for me. I wanted dedicated eyes on her every moment she was out of the hotel.</p><p>Thank God this weekend was a once-in-a-lifetime event.</p><p>Ra\u00fal stood. \u201cI\u2019ll touch base with Clancy to discuss the protocol for getting to the airport.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Ra\u00fal.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, he left.</p><p>Angus rose to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll be hieing off to take Lucky to your sister. She\u2019s texting me every hour to see if I\u2019ve left yet.\u201d</p><p>That almost made me smile. Ireland had been excited when I asked if she would watch the dog for me. I figured Lucky would like that better than boarding, and Ireland could use a distraction from our mother\u2019s depression over the divorce. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Angus paused on the way to the door. \u201cHave fun, lad.

She had watched me pack with her chin propped on her hands, commenting occasionally on my choices. She\u2019d noted that I didn\u2019t pack either the graphite gray slacks she fantasized about or a black V-neck T-shirt. The deliberate omission was the one thing that made her smile. Otherwise, she had been mostly quiet and moody.</p><p>\u201cYou and I are going to ride to the airport together,\u201d I told her. \u201cAlone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d She let that sink in. \u201cThat\u2019ll be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m shooting for more than nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh ... \u201d Her voice lowered, took on the soft huskiness that told me her thoughts had turned to sex. \u201cGot a little transportation fetish yourself ?\u201d</p><p>Warm amusement slid through me, helping to ease the stress brought on by thinking of the days ahead. Eva would let me have her anywhere, but she frequently seduced me while we were en route to somewhere. Having previously been restricted to having sex only in the hotel, she\u2019d rocked my world by inciting me to make love to her in cars and planes, as well as my home and various places of business.</p><p>I would never say no to her. I wasn\u2019t capable of it. When she wanted me, I was ready and more than willing.</p><p>\u201cI have an Eva fetish,\u201d I murmured, turning around something she\u2019d once said to me.</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cIs the weekend over yet?\u201d</p><p>I heard Cary say something I couldn\u2019t quite make out. \u201cSoon, angel. I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever let me go, Gideon.\u201d There was a fervency to her words that moved me, betraying how unsettled she was by the weekend ahead. After the separation she\u2019d enforced, it was good to know she wasn\u2019t looking forward to another, even under much happier circumstances.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you get back to it,\u201d I corrected. \u201cSo you can be ready when Ra\u00fal comes for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind him. I\u2019ll be ready to come for you,\u201d she purred back, leaving me hard and aching as I ended the call.</p><p>Arash entered my office shortly after four, sauntering in with his hands in his pockets and humming a tune. He grinned as he sank into one of the chairs in front of my desk. \u201cYou ready for the weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs ready as I\u2019m going to be.\u201d I sat back and drummed my fingers on the armrests of my chair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be happy to hear that Anne Lucas\u2019s assault complaint is going away.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d expected as much, but it was still good to have confirmation. \u201cAs it should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard if she\u2019ll be charged with falsely reporting an incident. In the meantime, if she attempts contact with you, Eva, or Cary in any way, I need to know immediately.\u201d</p><p>I nodded absently. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He studied me. \u201cWhere\u2019s your head at right now?\u201d</p><p>My mouth twisted wryly. \u201cI just got off the phone with one of the Vidal Records board members. Christopher is continuing to work on acquiring the capital for a buyout.\u201d</p><p>Arash\u2019s brows shot up. \u201cIf he pulls it together, would you consider getting out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I only had him to worry about, I would.\u201d Whether Ireland chose to join the family business in the future was still to be seen, but regardless, she had a stake in the success of the company, and Christopher made poor decisions. All of my offers to support him and offer guidance had been rejected. He often refused to listen to Chris as well, apparently assuming his father\u2019s wisdom came in some part from me.</p><p>\u201cWhat does the board think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s viewed as a family feud and they want me to find a quick, painless resolution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that possible? You\u2019ve never gotten along with your brother.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s a nonstarter.\u201d</p><p>I knew Arash couldn\u2019t understand. He had a brother and sister of his own, and his family was extremely tight-knit.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cSorry, man. That\u2019s tough.\u201d</p><p>In an ideal world, Christopher would be attending my bachelor party weekend. We\u2019d be close. He would be the best man at my wedding ... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>... which was a position I hadn\u2019t yet asked anyone to fill. Arnoldo had taken the reins with the weekend planning, but I didn\u2019t know if he had done so because he assumed he\u2019d be standing beside me at the wedding. Maybe he just had more initiative than the other guys.</p><p>Only a few short weeks ago it would have been a no-brainer to have Arnoldo stand with me. Part of me hoped that he still would.</p><p>Arash was also a good choice. Unlike Arnoldo, I saw Arash nearly every day. And as my attorney, he knew things about me\u2014and Eva\u2014that no one else did. I could trust him with anything, even without the protection of attorney/client privilege.</p><p>But Arnoldo was direct with me in a way no one else was, aside from my wife. I\u2019d long thought that Arnoldo\u2019s blunt, incisive advice had kept me from becoming too cynical and jaded.</p> <p>This weekend should make the choice between the two men clear.</p><p>It felt ... wrong to stand outside Eva\u2019s apartment door and wait for her. As I leaned against the wall opposite the doorway, I considered how swiftly things had turned a corner and how violently opposed I was to having them ever go back. I hadn\u2019t known it could be like this between us. Open, nothing to hide, so deeply in love.</p><p>There had been glimpses of this life before. Some of the nights we\u2019d spent together in the apartment next door. The weekends we\u2019d sneaked away to be alone together. But those times had existed in a vacuum. Now, we lived those moments openly. It would be even better when the world knew we were married and she lived completely in the penthouse with me.</p><p>The door opened and Eva stepped out, looking cool and sexy in a sleeveless red wrap dress and heeled sandals. She had sunglasses perched atop her head and was wheeling a suitcase out beside her. The next time she packed, it would be for our honeymoon. We\u2019d leave together, like we were doing now, but we would stay together from that moment forward.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I said, straightening to take the suitcase from her.</p> <p>She tackled me as I reached for it, her body soft and warm against mine. She pulled my head down and kissed me, a quick, sweet kiss. \u201cYou should\u2019ve come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me with a bed nearby?\u201d I caught her around the waist and steered her toward the elevator. \u201cI would\u2019ve taken advantage, if I didn\u2019t think Cary would bang on the door and bitch about missing your flight.\u201d</p><p>Eva separated from me as we descended to the lobby, reaching behind her to grab the handrail and showing off her sexy legs. It was a full-body flirt, with her eyes playing the game, too. They sparkled at me as she licked her bottom lip. \u201cYou look super sexy.\u201d</p><p>I glanced down at the white V-neck T-shirt and khakis I\u2019d changed into before leaving work.</p><p>\u201cYou usually wear dark colors,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cToo hot for that where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re too hot.\u201d She lifted one foot off the elevator floor and slowly rubbed her thighs together.</p><p>Amused and feeling the slow heat of building arousal, I settled back and enjoyed the show.</p><p>Once we\u2019d reached the lobby, I gestured her out in front of me, catching up to her in two strides so I could place my hand at the small of her back.</p><p>She tossed me a smile over her shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be traffic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Traffic\u2014and the time it would add to the commute\u2014was what I was counting on.</p><p>\u201cYou sound sooo disappointed,\u201d she teased, before smiling at the doorman, who opened the door for her.</p><p>Ra\u00fal waited outside by the limo. In moments, we were on our way, merging into the sea of cars battling their way across Manhattan.</p><p>Eva took the bench seat that spanned the length of the vehicle, while I settled on the seat in the back. \u201cWant a drink?\u201d she asked, looking at the bar across from her.</p> <p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Her lips pursed. \u201cI wanted one earlier.\u201d</p><p>I waited for her to make up her mind, my gaze sliding over her. She was my joy, the light in my world. I would do anything to keep her carefree and content for the rest of her life. It weighed on me to think I might have to hurt her. She\u2019d been through so much already.</p><p>If we found out that Monica was not who Eva thought she was at all, how would I break that news? My wife had been crushed when she realized her mother was tracking her via her mobile phone, her watch, and a compact mirror in her purse. A false identity was a much worse betrayal.</p><p>And what did that fake identity hide?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find a dress,\u201d she said abruptly, her lush mouth turned down in a frown.</p><p>It took me a beat to snap out of my thoughts and register what she was saying. \u201cFor the wedding?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded, looking so despondent I wanted to pull her close and press kisses all over her beautiful face.</p><p>\u201cWant me to help, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. The groom isn\u2019t supposed to see the wedding dress before the big day.\u201d Her eyes widened with shock and horror. \u201cYou saw the dress I wore when we got married the first time!\u201d</p><p>I had. I\u2019d picked it out. \u201cIt was only a dress when I saw it,\u201d I soothed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a wedding dress until you wore it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The smile came back. She peeled off her sandals and joined me, lying down with her head in my lap, her hair a silvery gold fan across my thighs.</p><p>Running my fingers through the thick silk strands, I took a deep breath, relishing the smell of her perfume.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to wear?\u201d she asked, her eyes closing.</p><p>\u201cAre you picturing something in particular?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved. Her answer came out slow and dreamy. \u201cA tux. You\u2019re always gorgeous. But in a tuxedo, you\u2019re something else.\u201d</p><p>I brushed my fingertips over her lips. There had been times when I hated my face, hated that my looks attracted intense sexual interest at a time when being lusted after made my skin crawl. Eventually, I got used to the attention, but not until Eva did I begin to value who I was for my own sake.</p><p>She took so much pleasure in looking at me. Clothed. Unclothed. In the shower. Wrapped in a towel. On top of her. Underneath her. About the only time her eyes weren\u2019t on me was when she was asleep. Which was when I often took the most pleasure in looking at her, lusciously naked, wearing nothing but the jewelry I\u2019d given her.</p><p>\u201cA tux it is, then.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes opened, revealing the soft gray I adored. \u201cBut it\u2019s a beach wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I bet you can.\u201d</p><p>Turning her head, she nuzzled her nose against my cock. The heat of her breath drifted through the khakis to my sensitive skin. I hardened for her.</p><p>I played with her hair. \u201cWhat do you want, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d She ran her fingers along the length of my erection.</p><p>\u201cHow do you want it?\u201d</p><p>Her tongue darted out to wet her lips. \u201cIn my mouth,\u201d she breathed, already freeing the button of my waistband.</p><p>My eyes closed for a moment on a deep inhalation. The sound of my zipper lowering, the release of pressure as she carefully freed my cock ...</p><p>I steeled myself for the wet heat of her mouth, but it was pointless. I jerked hard when she pulled me in with easy suction, hunger and need tingling down my spine. I knew her moods and how they translated to sex. She planned to take her time, to enjoy me and drive me out of my mind.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d I groaned as she stroked me with gentle fingers, her mouth working softly. She tongued the head of my dick with slow, savoring licks.</p> <p>Opening my eyes, I looked down at her. The sight of her, so perfectly presentable, her focus entirely on the feel of my cock in her mouth was both searingly erotic and achingly tender.</p><p>\u201cGod, that\u2019s good,\u201d I said hoarsely, cupping the back of her head in one hand. \u201cTake it deeper ... yes, like that ...\u201d</p><p>My head fell back as my thighs tensed, straining with the need to thrust. I fought the urge, letting her take what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t finish like this,\u201d I warned her, knowing that was her goal.</p><p>She hummed a protest and fisted me, pumping my cock in her soft, firm grip. Challenging me to resist her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be riding your perfect cunt, Eva. My cum is going to be deep inside you while you spend the weekend away from me.\u201d</p><p>My eyes closed as I imagined her in Ibiza, a city famous for its wild nightlife, dancing with her friends in a crush of bodies. Men would covet her, dream of fucking her. All the while she\u2019d be marked by me in the most primitive way possible. Possessed, even though I wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>I felt her moan vibrate along the length of my dick.</p><p>She pulled back, her lips already red and plump. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d she pouted.</p><p>I caught her wrist and lifted her hand to my chest, pressing it against my pounding heart. \u201cYou\u2019ll be right here, angel. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMano, you can\u2019t be working right now,\u201d Manuel complained, dropping into the lounger beside me. \u201cYou\u2019re missing the view.\u201d</p><p>I glanced up from my phone, the ocean breeze rifling through my hair. We\u2019d remained in Barra today, directly across Avenida L\u00facio Costa from the hotel we were staying in. Recreio Beach was more laid-back than Copacabana, less touristy and crowded. All along the shore, women in bikinis frolicked in the surf, breasts bouncing as they jumped waves, nearly-bare asses glistening with tanning oil. On the white sand in front of them, Arash and Arnoldo continued tossing a Frisbee back and forth. I\u2019d bowed out when I felt my phone buzz in the pocket of my board shorts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked at Manuel, finding him flushed and glistening with sweat. He\u2019d disappeared about an hour ago and it was obvious why, even without knowing him as well as I did.</p><p>\u201cMy view is better.\u201d I turned my phone to show him the selfie Eva had just sent me. She was lying out on the beach, too, stretched across a lounger not much different from the one I occupied. Her bikini was white, her skin already lightly tanned. A thin chain hooked around her neck, nestled between her plump tits, then wrapped around her trim waist. Sunglasses shielded her eyes and bright red gloss stained the lips she\u2019d puckered in a kiss.</p><p>Wish you were here ... she\u2019d texted.</p><p>So did I. I was counting down the several hours remaining until we\u2019d get on the plane home. Saturday had been enjoyable enough, a blur of alcohol and music, but Sunday was a day too long.</p> <p>Manuel whistled. \u201cHot damn.\u201d</p><p>I grinned, as that about summed up my thoughts on my wife\u2019s photo.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry that things will change after you say I do?\u201d he asked, leaning back with his hands tucked behind his head. \u201cWives don\u2019t look like that. They don\u2019t send selfies like that.\u201d</p><p>I exited out to the home screen and flipped my phone around again.</p><p>Manuel\u2019s eyes widened at the wedding photo that served as my wallpaper. \u201cNo way. When?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA month ago.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t see it. Marriage, I mean, not you and Eva. How does it not get old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing happy never gets old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t variety the spice of life or some shit?\u201d he asked, in some sort of half-assed philosophical mood. \u201cPart of the fun in fucking a woman is figuring out what makes her tick and being surprised when she shows you something new. You keep tagging it, doesn\u2019t it become routine? Touch her here, lick her there, keep the rhythm she likes to get her off ... Rinse and repeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen your time comes, you\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou want kids? Is that why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEventually. Not any time soon.\u201d I couldn\u2019t even picture it. Eva would make a wonderful mother; she was a nurturer. But the two of us together as parents? One day, I\u2019d be ready for that. One day far away, when I could bear to share her with someone else. \u201cRight now, I just want her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Cross.\u201d</p><p>I looked up and saw Ra\u00fal standing behind me, his mouth a tight line. I instantly stiffened, then sat up, my legs swinging off the side to plant my feet in the sand. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Fear for Eva settled heavily in my gut. She\u2019d just texted me moments before, but ...</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll want to see this,\u201d he said grimly, drawing my attention to the tablet he carried.</p><p>Standing, I shoved my phone in my pocket and closed the distance between us. I held out my hand. The glare from the sun darkened the screen, so I shifted to cast my shadow over the glass. The photo that came into focus froze the blood in my veins. The headline made my teeth grind.</p><p>Gideon Cross\u2019s Wild Brazilian Bachelor Party.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d I snapped.</p> <p>Manuel slapped a hand on my shoulder as he came up beside me. \u201cLooks like a good time, cabr\u00f3n. With two very hot babes.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Ra\u00fal.</p><p>\u201cClancy sent that to me,\u201d he explained. \u201cI ran a search and it\u2019s gone viral.\u201d</p><p>Clancy. Fuck. Eva ...</p><p>Shoving the tablet at Ra\u00fal, I yanked my phone back out. \u201cI want to know who took that picture.\u201d Who knew I was in Brazil? Who\u2019d followed me into a club one night, into a private VIP area, and taken pictures?</p><p>\u201cAlready on it.\u201d</p><p>Cursing under my breath, I called my wife. Impatience and fury rode me hard as I waited for her to pick up. Her voice mail kicked in and I hung up. Dialed again. Worry crowded in.</p><p>The worst fears of her fantasies were captured in living color in that photo. I had to explain, even without knowing how. Sweat beaded my forehead and dampened my palms, but inside, I was chilled.</p><p>Her voice mail picked up a second time.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it.\u201d Hanging up, I dialed again.</p><p>11</p><p>\u201cYou look like you need a refill,\u201d Shawna said, setting down two rebujitos on the small table between our two loungers.</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d I laughed, slightly tipsy. The mix of dry sherry and sweet soda in the drink had a sneaky punch. And it wasn\u2019t exactly wise to chase away a hangover with more alcohol. \u201cI\u2019m going to need to detox after this weekend.\u201d</p><p>She grinned and stretched back out, her freckled skin still pale and slightly pink after two days in the sun. Her red hair was piled atop her head in a sexy mess, her voice slightly hoarse from laughing so hard the night before. She\u2019d donned a bright aqua blue bikini that drew many appreciative eyes her way. Shawna was a bright spot of color, with a ready smile and bawdy sense of humor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In that way, she was a lot like her brother, who I knew and loved as the fianc\u00e9 of my former boss, Mark.</p><p>Megumi walked up on my other side, carrying two more drinks. She looked at the empty lounger where my mom had been. \u201cWhere\u2019s Monica?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe went to cool off in the water.\u201d I looked for her but didn\u2019t see her. She was hard to miss in her lavender bikini, so I figured she\u2019d wandered off somewhere. \u201cShe\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been with us the whole time, partying alongside us every step of the way. It wasn\u2019t her style to drink too much and stay up too late, but she seemed to be having fun. She was certainly causing a stir. Men of all ages flocked around her. There was a kittenish sensuality about my mother that was irresistible. I wished I had that.</p> <p>\u201cLook at him go,\u201d Shawna said, drawing my attention to where Cary played in the surf. \u201cHe\u2019s a total chick magnet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d</p><p>The beach was packed, so much so that it was hard to see the sand. Dozens of shoulders and heads bobbed amid the ocean waves, but it was easy to see the cluster around Cary. He was flashing his grin, soaking up the attention like a cat in the sun. With his hair slicked back, the beauty of his gorgeous face was on display, despite the aviator shades he wore to block out the bright sun.</p><p>Catching me watching him, he waved. I blew him a kiss, just to stir things up.</p><p>\u201cYou and Cary never got together?\u201d Shawna asked. \u201cDid you ever want to?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head. Cary was stunning now, healthy and leanly muscular, a prime example of the perfect male. But when I\u2019d met him, he had been gaunt and hollow-eyed, always shrouded in hoodies even in the warmth of San Diego summers. He\u2019d kept his arms covered to hide the evidence of his cutting and wore the hood over his closely cropped head.</p><p>In group therapy sessions, he\u2019d always sat outside the circle and against a wall, his chair kicked back to balance on the rear legs. He commented rarely, but when he did, his humor was dark and laced with sarcasm, his insight almost always cynical.</p><p>I had approached him once, unable to ignore the deep inner pain that radiated from him. Don\u2019t waste my time easing into it, he\u2019d said smoothly, his beautiful green eyes devoid of any light at all. You want to ride my dick, just say so. I never say no to a fuck.</p><p>I knew that was true. Dr. Travis had a lot of messed-up patients, many of whom used sex as a salve or form of self-punishment. Cary was available to be used by all of them, and many walked through that open-door invitation frequently.</p><p>No, thanks, I\u2019d shot back, disgust triggered by his sexual aggression. You\u2019re too skinny for me. Eat a fucking cheeseburger, dickhead.</p><p>I regretted trying to be nice to him after that. He\u2019d stalked me mercilessly, constantly putting me off with crass sexual come-ons. I\u2019d been prickly at first. When that didn\u2019t work, I\u2019d killed him with kindness. Eventually, he\u2019d realized I really wasn\u2019t going to sleep with him.</p> <p>In the meantime, he started putting on weight. He let his hair start growing out. He stopped being the resident fuck, although he was simply more selective. I had noticed how gorgeous he was, but there was no attraction there. He was too much like me and my self-preservation instincts had been on high alert.</p><p>\u201cWe were friends,\u201d I told her. \u201cThen he became like a brother to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI adore him,\u201d Megumi said, smoothing suntan lotion over her legs. \u201cHe told me that things are rough with him and Trey right now. I\u2019m sorry to hear that. They\u2019re so great together.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, my gaze going back to my dearest friend. Cary was lifting a woman up by the waist to toss her into the waves. She came up sputtering and laughing, clearly smitten. \u201cIt\u2019s lame to say that it\u2019ll work out if it\u2019s meant to, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m going with.\u201d</p><p>I still needed to call Trey. And Gideon\u2019s mom, Elizabeth. I wanted to touch base with Ireland, too. And Chris. Since I\u2019d probably be wiped out from jet lag and too much alcohol, I made a mental note to fit in all those calls while I recovered at the penthouse. I had to touch base with my dad, too, since I\u2019d put off our scheduled Saturday call due to the time difference between us.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go home.\u201d Megumi stretched out with a sigh, her drink in her hands. \u201cThese two days went by too fast. I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re leaving in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>I could easily stay another week, if I weren\u2019t missing Gideon so much.</p><p>\u201cEva, honey.\u201d</p> <p>My head tilted at the sound of my mom\u2019s voice. She\u2019d come up behind me and stood behind my lounger wrapped in her cover-up. \u201cIs it time to go already?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shook her head. Then I noticed she was wringing her hands. Never a good sign.</p><p>\u201cCan you come back to the hotel with me?\u201d she asked. \u201cI need to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>I saw Clancy standing behind her, his jaw tight and hard. My pulse began to race. Standing, I grabbed the sarong I\u2019d worn down to the beach and tied it around my waist.</p><p>\u201cShould we come?\u201d Shawna asked, sitting up.</p><p>\u201cStay here with Cary,\u201d my mom replied, offering a reassuring smile.</p><p>It amazed me how she did that, acting so cool and unruffled when I knew she was anxious. I was too expressive to hide my reactions, but my mom only showed emotion with her eyes and her hands, often saying that even laughter put lines on a face. Since she was wearing sunglasses, she was effectively camouflaged.</p><p>Mutely, I followed her and Clancy back to the hotel. Once we reached the lobby, it seemed like every employee had to greet us with a smile or wave. They all knew who I was. After all, we were staying in one of Gideon\u2019s resorts. The name Vientos Cruzados meant Crosswinds.</p><p>Gideon had married me at a Crosswinds resort. I hadn\u2019t realized they were a global chain.</p><p>We stepped into an elevator and Clancy slid a key card into the necessary slot, a security measure that limited access to our floor. Since there were other people in the car with us, I still had to wait for answers.</p><p>I felt sick to my stomach, my thoughts bouncing all over the place. Had something happened to Gideon? Or my dad? I realized I\u2019d left my phone on the table by my drink and kicked myself. If I could only send a quick text to Gideon, I\u2019d feel like I was doing something besides driving myself crazy.</p><p>After three stops, the elevator car was empty except for us as we continued the climb to our floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked, turning to face both my mom and Clancy.</p><p>She pulled her shades off with trembling fingers. \u201cThere\u2019s a scandal brewing,\u201d she began. \u201cMostly online.\u201d</p><p>Which meant it was out of control. Or about to be. \u201cMom. Just tell me.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cThere are some pictures ...\u201d She glanced at Clancy for help.</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d I thought I might vomit. Had the pictures my stepbrother Nathan had taken gotten out somehow? Or stills from the sex tape with Brett?</p><p>\u201cPhotos of Gideon Cross in Brazil went viral this morning,\u201d Clancy said. He spoke neutrally, but there was something oddly stiff about his stance. So much tension was unusual for him.</p><p>I felt as if I\u2019d been punched in the gut. I didn\u2019t say anything more. There was nothing to say until I saw the evidence.</p><p>We exited directly into our suite, a massive space with several bedrooms and a large central living area. The maids had opened the doors leading out to the wraparound balcony, and the sheer drapes fluttered in the breeze, escaping the ties meant to contain them. Bright with the color and warmth of Spain, the suite had delighted me the moment we arrived.</p><p>I barely registered any of it now.</p><p>I walked on shaky legs to the couch and waited for Clancy to key in his code on a tablet and pass it over to me. My mom took the seat beside me, silently offering her support.</p><p>Looking down, I sucked in a quick audible breath. My chest felt like it was being crushed in a vise. What I saw freaked me out ... it was as if someone had crawled inside my head and captured one of the images in my mind.</p><p>My gaze locked on Gideon, so dark and gorgeous dressed entirely in black. The fall of his hair partially hid his face, but it was clearly my husband. I hoped it wouldn\u2019t be, tried to find something that would betray the man in the photo as a fraud. But I knew Gideon\u2019s body as well as I knew my own. Knew how he moved. How he relaxed. How he seduced.</p> <p>I looked away from that beloved figure in the center of the obscene tableau, unable to bear it.</p><p>A U-shaped sectional sofa. Black velvet curtains. A half-dozen bottles of top-shelf liquor on a low table.</p><p>A private VIP booth.</p><p>A slender brunette reclined on a mound of throw pillows. The low V of her sequined top shoved aside. Gideon\u2019s body was partly over hers. His mouth sucked her nipple.</p><p>A second leggy brunette. Draped over his back. One thigh hooked over his. Her legs spread. Her mouth a wide O of pleasure. Gideon\u2019s arm reached behind him. His hand beneath her short skirt.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t visible, but his fingers were inside her. I knew it. It was a sharp, jagged knife in my heart.</p><p>The image blurred as I blinked the tears away, feeling them run hotly down my face. I scrolled, swiping the picture out of sight. Then I saw my name and scanned the writer\u2019s crude speculation as to what I would think about my fianc\u00e9\u2019s sexcapades as he said farewell to bachelorhood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I set the tablet on the coffee table, breathing hard. My mother scooted closer and put her arm around me, pulling me into her embrace. The room phone rang loudly, jolting me and abrading my nerves.</p><p>\u201cShh ...\u201d she whispered, her hand stroking over my hair. \u201cI\u2019ve got you, honey. I\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>Clancy went to the handset and answered with a brusque \u201cYes?\u201d Then his tone took on a chilly bite. \u201cI see you\u2019re having a good time.\u201d</p><p>Gideon.</p> <p>I looked at Clancy and felt the heat rippling off him. He met my gaze. \u201cYes, she\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>I straightened away from my mother and managed to stand. Fighting off a wave of nausea, I went to him and held out my hand for the phone. He gave the cordless handset to me and stepped back.</p><p>I swallowed a sob. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. Gideon\u2019s breathing quickened. I\u2019d said one word, but from that, he knew that I knew.</p><p>\u201cAngel\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Abruptly sick, I ran to the bathroom and dropped the phone, barely managing to lift the toilet seat before emptying the contents of my stomach in racking, violent heaves.</p><p>My mother ran in and I shook my head at her. \u201cGo away,\u201d I gasped, sinking to the floor with my back against the wall.</p><p>\u201cEva\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a minute, Mom. Just ... give me a minute.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me, then nodded, closing the door behind her.</p><p>From the phone on the floor, I heard Gideon yelling. I reached for it, wrapping my hand around it and dragging it over. I lifted it to my ear.</p> <p>\u201cEva! For God\u2019s sake, pick up the phone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop shouting,\u201d I told him, my head pounding.</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d He took a ragged breath. \u201cYou\u2019re sick. Damn it. I\u2019m too far away ...\u201d His voice rose. \u201cRa\u00fal! Where the fuck are you? I want the goddamn jet ready now! Get on the damn phone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happened before I met you.\u201d He spoke too fast, was breathing too fast. \u201cI don\u2019t know when or\u2014What?\u201d Someone spoke in the background. \u201cCinco de Mayo? For fuck\u2019s sake. Why is this coming out now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva, I swear to you that fucking picture wasn\u2019t taken this weekend. I would never do that to you. You know that. You know what you mean to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon, calm down.\u201d My racing pulse began to slow. He was frantic. Panicked. It broke my heart to hear it. He was so strong, capable of managing and surviving and crushing anything.</p> <p>I was his weakness, when all I wanted was to be his strength.</p><p>\u201cYou have to believe me, Eva. I would never do that to us. I would never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014fuck around\u2014What?\u201d</p><p>Closing my eyes, I let my head fall back to rest against the wall. My stomach began to settle. \u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>His shuddered exhale came hard and heavy across the line. \u201cGod.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>I knew how much it meant to him that I believed him utterly. About everything. Anything. He couldn\u2019t help but find that nearly impossible to accept, even as he craved my trust more than I think he craved my love. To him, my belief in him was my love.</p><p>His explanation was simple, some might say too simple, but knowing him the way I did, it was the one that made the most sense.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d His voice was soft. Weary. \u201cI love you so much, Eva. When you didn\u2019t answer your phone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He made a small noise filled with pain and regret. \u201cSo sorry you saw that. It\u2019s so fucked up. All of this is fucked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen worse.\u201d Gideon had seen me kiss Brett Kline, right in front of him. He\u2019d watched at least some of the sex tape that featured Brett and me. Compared to that, a photo was nothing.</p><p>\u201cI hate that you\u2019re there and I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d I wanted the solace of his arms around me. More than that, I wanted to comfort him. To show him again that I wasn\u2019t going anywhere and he had no reason to fear.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not doing this again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re only getting married twice\u2014both times to me. No more bachelor parties for you.\u201d</p><p>He huffed out a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Clancy to bring you home now. We\u2019re packing up to head to the airport.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, even though he couldn\u2019t see. \u201cTake tomorrow off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow ...? Yes.

Nothing you can do will change that.\u201d I pulled myself up off the floor. \u201cYou can hunt him\u2014or her\u2014down later.

It was what it was. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely Gideon.\u201d</p> <p>Cary, who sat beside me in the limo, took my hand in his and linked our fingers. My mom sat on the bench seat directly behind the driver, looking at fabric swatches. Her sleek legs were crossed, her foot tapping restlessly.</p><p>Both Megumi and Shawna shot me pitying looks.</p><p>Their sympathy chafed my pride. I\u2019d made the mistake of looking at social media. It amazed me how cruel people could be. According to some, I was a woman scorned. Or I was just too stupid not to realize I was marrying a man who would give me his name while giving his body and attention to anyone he chose. I was a gold digger willing to put up with the humiliation for the money. I was a woman who could be a champion for all women ... if I turned my back on Gideon and found someone else.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an old photo,\u201d I reiterated.</p><p>In reality, May wasn\u2019t all that long ago, but no one needed to know exactly when, aside from the fact that the photo hadn\u2019t been taken while he was in a relationship with me.</p><p>He\u2019d changed so much since then. For me. For us. And I was no longer the woman he\u2019d met that fateful day in June.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s ancient,\u201d Shawna said decisively. \u201cTotally.\u201d</p><p>Megumi nodded but still looked dubious.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he lie?\u201d I asked flatly. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take much work to find the club in the background. It has to be one of Gideon\u2019s, and I bet you it\u2019s in Manhattan. He couldn\u2019t be in New York and have a passport stamped in Brazil on the same day.\u201d</p><p>It had taken me a couple of hours to figure that out and I was kind of glad about that. I didn\u2019t need proof my husband was telling me the truth. But if we could somehow prove the photo was taken in a specific, identifiable location, it would be nice to set the public record straight.</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Megumi gave me a big smile. \u201cAnd he\u2019s crazy about you, Eva. He wouldn\u2019t mess around.\u201d</p><p>I nodded my agreement, then pushed the subject aside. We would be at the airport soon and I didn\u2019t want us to leave each other thinking about stupid gossip instead of the amazing trip we\u2019d had. \u201cThank you for coming. I had a great time.\u201d</p><p>I would\u2019ve loved to take them to Rio, too, but they didn\u2019t have the required visas to enter the country. Plus, they both had to work on Monday. So we\u2019d part ways, with the girls heading home with Clancy\u2019s security team, while Cary, my mom, and Clancy flew with me to Brazil on a jet Gideon had secured for us.</p><p>It was going to be a quick trip. We\u2019d arrive on Monday morning and leave Monday night. What sleep we managed to catch would be on the jet. But by the time I was done, Gideon would leave Brazil with a smile. I didn\u2019t want him looking back on the weekend with regret. He had enough bad memories. Moving forward, I wanted him to store up nothing but good ones.</p> <p>\u201cWe should be thanking you.\u201d Shawna grinned. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have missed this for the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with Shawna,\u201d Megumi said. \u201cThis was a trip of a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>Closing her eyes, Shawna leaned her head back against the seat. \u201cSay hi to Arnoldo for me.\u201d</p><p>I knew Shawna and Arnoldo had become friends since they had been introduced the night we\u2019d gone to the Six-Ninths concert. I think they felt safe with one another. Shawna was waiting for her boyfriend, Doug, to come home from Sicily, where he was attending an exclusive course for chefs. Arnoldo was nursing a broken heart, but he was a man who loved women and likely appreciated being able to enjoy the companionship of one who expected nothing more.</p><p>Cary was dealing with something similar. He missed Trey and wasn\u2019t interested in screwing around, which was huge for him. Usually, when he was hurting, he fucked to forget. Instead, he\u2019d spent the weekend sticking close to Megumi, who looked like a deer in headlights when men approached her. Cary had been her shield, keeping things light and fun for both of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gideon wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d come a long way.</p><p>As for me, I was dying to be with my husband. Stress brought on nightmares for him, so I pulled out my phone and texted him. Dream of me.</p><p>His response was so perfectly Gideon, it brought a smile to my face. Fly faster.</p><p>And just that quick, I knew he was back on his game.</p> <p>\u201cWow.\u201d I stared out the window of the jet as it taxied to a halt at a private airport on the outskirts of Rio. \u201cNow, that\u2019s a view.\u201d</p><p>Standing on the tarmac were Gideon, Arnoldo, Manuel, and Arash. All dressed casually in long shorts and T-shirts. All dark-haired and tall. Beautifully muscular. Tanned.</p><p>They were lined up like a row of exotic, outrageously expensive sports cars. Powerful, sexy, dangerously fast.</p><p>I had no doubts about my husband\u2019s fidelity, but if there had been any, looking at him would\u2019ve settled them. His friends were loose-limbed and relaxed, their engines cooled by long, hard rides. That they\u2019d enjoyed Rio\u2014and its women\u2014was stamped all over them. Gideon, however, was taut. Watchful. His motor was running, purring with the need to roar from zero to sixty in the space of a pounding heartbeat. No one had given my man a test drive.</p><p>I had come to him with the intent to soothe, to strategize, to take a bit of my wounded pride back. Instead, I was going to be the driver who burned his fuel.</p> <p>Yes, please.</p><p>I felt a slight bump as the rolling staircase was positioned against the jet. Clancy exited first. My mom followed. I went after her, pausing at the top of the stairs to snap a picture with my phone. The image of Gideon and his friends was going to give the Internet something else to talk about.</p><p>I took the first step down and Gideon moved, his arms unfolding as he closed the distance between us. I couldn\u2019t see his eyes, only myself in the reflection of his lenses, but I felt the intensity with which he had me in his sights. It made my knees weak, forcing me to hold on to the handrail for balance.</p><p>He shook Clancy\u2019s hand. He endured and even managed to reciprocate a brief hug from my mother. But he never took his eyes off me or slowed more than a few seconds.</p><p>I\u2019d put on red fuck-me heels for him. Tight, white shorts barely covered my ass and fastened well below my navel. My top was red lace, with thin straps. A red satin ribbon secured the corsetlike back. I had clipped my hair in a messy updo. Gideon made it messier when he caught me up on the last step and shoved his hand into it.</p><p>His mouth sealed over mine, as if he hadn\u2019t noticed the red gloss I\u2019d slicked on my lips. I was held suspended in his embrace, my feet off the ground, his arm banded tightly around my waist. Wrapping myself around him, I locked my ankles together at the small of his back, pushing up so that his head tilted back and I curved around him, my tongue licking deep into his mouth. The hand he\u2019d had in my hair slid down to cup and support me, his grip kneading my ass in the demanding, possessive way I loved.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s fucking hot,\u201d Cary said from somewhere behind me.</p><p>Manuel gave a piercing whistle.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t care less what kind of spectacle we made. Gideon\u2019s hard body felt delicious and the taste of him was intoxicating. My thoughts scattered. I wanted to ride him, rub up against him. I wanted him naked and sweaty, covered in my scent. On his face, his hands, his cock.</p><p>My husband wasn\u2019t the only one who wanted to mark his territory.</p><p>\u201cEva Lauren,\u201d my mother scolded. \u201cGet ahold of yourself.\u201d</p><p>The sound of my mom\u2019s voice cooled us both off instantly. I unwound my legs from his hips and let him ease me down until I was standing again. I pulled away reluctantly, my hands briefly lifting Gideon\u2019s sunglasses so I could look into his eyes. Fury ... lust ...</p><p>I wiped the traces of my lip gloss off his mouth with my fingers. His lips were swollen from the passion of our kiss, the sensual curves softened.</p><p>He cupped my face in his hands, his thumbs brushing over my lips. Urging my head back, he kissed the tip of my nose. He was tender now, his ferocious joy at seeing me tempered by having touched me.</p> <p>\u201cEva,\u201d Arnoldo said, coming up beside me with a small smile on his handsome face. \u201cSo good to see you.\u201d</p><p>I turned to greet him, feeling nervous. I wanted us to be friends. I wanted him to forgive me for hurting Gideon. I wanted\u2014</p><p>He kissed me full on the mouth. Stunned, I didn\u2019t react.</p><p>\u201cOff!\u201d Gideon snapped.</p><p>\u201cI am not a dog,\u201d Arnoldo shot back. He looked at me with amusement. \u201cHe has been pining for you. Now, you can release him from his torment.\u201d</p><p>My anxiety faded. He was warmer toward me than he\u2019d been recently, more like he\u2019d been when we were first introduced. \u201cIt\u2019s really good to see you, too, Arnoldo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Arash came up next.

They were heading in a different direction.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve had their weekend with us,\u201d he said, in answer to my unspoken question. \u201cToday is ours.\u201d</p><p>He ushered me through an expedited customs process, then back out to the tarmac where a helicopter waited.</p> <p>The rotor blades began to revolve as we approached. Ra\u00fal abruptly appeared and opened the rear door. Gideon helped me up into the back, climbing in directly behind me. I reached for the safety belt, but he brushed my hands aside, securing me in quickly before settling back. He handed me a headset, then slipped on his own.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he told the pilot.</p><p>We were lifting into the air before Gideon had his seat belt on.</p><p>I was breathless when we reached the hotel, still awed by the sight of Rio sprawled beneath us, its beaches dotted with high rises and its hills covered in colorfully painted favelas. Cars packed the roads below, the traffic impressively dense even considered against the commutes I experienced in Manhattan. The famous Christ the Redeemer statue glistened on Corcovado Mountain in the distance to my right, as we rounded Sugarloaf and followed the coastline up to Barra da Tijuca.</p><p>It would have taken hours by car to get to the hotel from the airport. Instead, the trip took minutes. We were entering Gideon\u2019s suite before my jet-lagged brain fully appreciated that I\u2019d been in three countries in as many days.</p><p>Vientos Cruzados Barra was as luxurious as all the Crosswinds properties I had seen but with a local flavor that made it unique. Gideon\u2019s suite was as large as the one I\u2019d had in Ibiza and his view as impressive.</p><p>I paused to admire the beach from the balcony, noting the endless rows of coconut stands and the golden bodies on the beach. Samba music drifted through the air, earthy and sexy and upbeat. I took a picture, then uploaded both it and the one of the guys on the tarmac to my Instagram account. The view from here ... #RioDeJaneiro</p><p>I tagged everyone and discovered that Arnoldo had snapped a picture of Gideon and me kissing passionately at the airport. It was a great photo, sexy and intimate. Arnoldo had a few hundred thousand followers and the photo already had dozens of comments and likes.</p> <p>Dear friends enjoying #RioDeJaneiro and each other.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s smartphone rang and he excused himself. I heard him speaking in another room and followed. We hadn\u2019t said a word since we left the airport, as if we were saving them for intimate conversation. Or maybe we just didn\u2019t need to say anything. Let the world talk and spread lies. We knew what we had. It didn\u2019t need to be qualified, justified, or expressed.</p><p>I found him in an office, standing in front of a U-shaped desk covered in photos and notes, some of which had spilled onto the floor. The place was a mess, so unlike the rigid order my husband usually maintained. It took a moment to register that the photos were of the inside of a club and that they matched the background I\u2019d seen in the photo of Gideon on Cinco de Mayo.</p><p>It was kind of eerie that we\u2019d come to the same idea. It was also kind of awesome.</p><p>I turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cEva. Wait.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow morning is better,\u201d he said to whoever was on the other end of the call. \u201cText me when it\u2019s confirmed.\u201d</p><p>Gideon hung up and silenced his phone, setting it down by his sunglasses. \u201cI want you to see these.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I told him, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to prove anything to me.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me. Without his shades, I saw the shadows under his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep last night.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. I should have known he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fix this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s broken.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI heard you over the phone,\u201d he said tightly.</p><p>I leaned into the doorjamb. I knew how he\u2019d felt when I kissed Brett\u2014murderous. They\u2019d fought like beasts. A violent physical confrontation hadn\u2019t been an option for me. My body had purged my jealousy the only way it could.</p><p>\u201cDo what you have to do,\u201d I murmured. \u201cBut I don\u2019t need anything. I\u2019m good. You and me\u2014us\u2014we\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>Gideon took a deep breath. Let it out. Then he reached up behind him and yanked his shirt over his head. He kicked off his sandals while he unfastened his shorts, letting them drop to the floor. He wore nothing underneath.</p> <p>I watched him prowl toward me naked, noting the darker tan lines and the rigidness of his cock. He was impossibly hard, his balls already drawn up tight. Every muscle flexed as he moved. His powerful thighs, his washboard abs, his thick biceps.</p><p>I didn\u2019t move, barely breathed, hardly blinked. It amazed me that I could take him. He was nearly a foot taller and close to a hundred pounds heavier. And strong. So very strong.</p><p>When we made love, it turned me on to lie beneath him and feel all of that incredible power focused solely on pleasuring my body and taking pleasure in it.</p><p>Gideon reached me and pulled me into his arms. He lowered his head to take my mouth in a lush, deep kiss. Savoring and unhurried. Soft licks and coaxing lips. I didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d untied my top until it slipped down my arms. He slid his thumbs beneath the waistband of my shorts, gliding them back and forth across the sensitive skin, until he halted the kiss to crouch and help me step out of my clothes. I whimpered, wanting more.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s leave the heels on,\u201d he murmured, straightening to his full height. His eyes were so brilliantly blue they reminded me of the water we\u2019d skinny-dipped in when we married.</p> <p>I wrapped my arms around his shoulders and he lifted me, carrying me to the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cAnd some of those little round cheese puff breads,\u201d I told Gideon, who relayed the addition to room service in Portuguese.</p><p>Lying prone on the bed facing the open sliding doors to the balcony, I kicked my legs up behind me, still wearing the fuck-me shoes. But nothing else. I rested my chin on my crossed arms. The warm ocean breeze felt good on my skin, cooling the sweat that covered every inch of me. The fan over the bed, with its mahogany blades carved into the shape of palm fronds, swirled lazily above.</p><p>I took a deep breath and smelled sex and Gideon.</p><p>Hehung up and the mattress dipped as he moved toward me, his lips brushing over my ass, then along my spine to my shoulder. He sprawled beside me, propping his head in one hand. The other stroked up and down my back.</p><p>I turned to look at him. \u201cHow many languages do you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA little of many and a lot of a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d I arched into his touch.</p><p>He kissed my shoulder again. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d he murmured. \u201cGlad I stayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI occasionally have good ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d The lascivious gleam in his eyes told me exactly what he was thinking about.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t slept all night, then super-slow-fucked me for nearly two hours. He\u2019d come three times, the first time so hard he\u2019d growled. Loudly. I knew the sound must have carried out the open windows. I\u2019d orgasmed just hearing it. And he was ready to go again. He was always ready. Lucky me.</p><p>I rolled to my side, facing him. \u201cDoes it take two women to wear you out?\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s face shuttered instantly. \u201cI\u2019m not going there.\u201d</p> <p>I touched his face. \u201cHey. It was a joke, baby. A bad one.\u201d</p><p>He rolled to his back and grabbed a pillow, putting it between us. Then he turned his head toward me, a frown between his brows. \u201cThere used to be this ... emptiness. Inside me,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou called it a void. Said you filled it. You did.\u201d</p><p>Listening, I just waited. He was talking. Sharing. It was hard for him and he didn\u2019t like it. But he loved me more.</p><p>\u201cI was waiting for you.\u201d He brushed the hair back from my cheek. \u201cA dozen women couldn\u2019t have done what you did. But ... Christ.\u201d He ran both hands through his hair. \u201cDistractions made it easier not to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make that happen,\u201d I purred, wanting him to be happy and playful again. \u201cI can make you not think about anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat emptiness is gone. You\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>Leaning over him, I kissed him. \u201cI\u2019m right here, too.\u201d</p><p>He shifted, rising to his knees and scooping me up, dropping me onto the pillow so that my ass was lifted into the air.</p><p>\u201cThis is how I want you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked at him over my shoulder. \u201cYou remember room service is coming, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey said forty-five to sixty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the boss. They won\u2019t take that long.\u201d</p><p>He moved, positioning himself between my legs. \u201cI told them to take an hour.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. I\u2019d thought lunch was a break. Apparently, only the phone call was.</p><p>He grabbed my butt cheeks in both hands and squeezed, kneading. \u201cGod, you have the most amazing ass. It\u2019s the perfect cushion for doing this ...\u201d</p><p>Holding my hips, he slid inside me. A long, slow glide. He groaned with masculine pleasure and my toes curled in my shoes.</p><p>\u201cMy God.\u201d I dropped my forehead to the bed and moaned. \u201cYou\u2019re so hard.\u201d</p><p>His lips pressed to my shoulder. He rolled his hips, stroking inside me, pushing deep enough to cause the tiniest bit of pain. \u201cYou excite me,\u201d he said roughly. \u201cI can\u2019t turn it off. I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d I arched my back, pushing up into his easy, measured thrusts. That was his mood today. Gentle. Indulging. Making love. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>His arms bracketed me, his palms pressing into the mattress. He nuzzled against me. \u201cI\u2019ll make you a deal, angel. I\u2019ll wear out when you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d I stared at myself in the mirror, shifting from side to side. \u201cIt\u2019s never a good idea to put on a bikini after pigging out.\u201d</p><p>I tugged at the bandeau top of the emerald green swimsuit Gideon had picked up in the lobby shop, then tried to rearrange the fit of the bottom.</p><p>He appeared behind me, looking sexy and yummy in a pair of black board shorts. His arms came around me from behind, hefting the weight of my breasts in his palms. \u201cYou look amazing. I want to peel this off you with my teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d Why go to the beach? We\u2019d been to the beach last weekend.</p><p>\u201cDo you still want pictures of us here?\u201d His gaze met mine in the mirror. \u201cIf not, I\u2019m good with tossing you back in the bed and having my way with you again.\u201d</p><p>I chewed my lower lip, debating.</p><p>He pulled me back against him. Without my heels on, he could set his chin on the crown of my head. \u201cCan\u2019t decide? Okay, we\u2019ll go down to the beach, just so you don\u2019t regret not going later. Thirty minutes ... an hour ... then we\u2019ll come back up until we have to leave.\u201d</p><p>I melted. He was always thinking about me and what I needed. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>The look that came over his face nearly stopped my heart. \u201cYou believe me,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Turning my head, I pressed my cheek against his chest. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful picture,\u201d my mother whispered, keeping her voice down because the guys were all sleeping. The jet\u2019s cabin lights were dimmed, the men all reclined in their seats. \u201cI just wish it didn\u2019t show so much of your derriere.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, my gaze on the tablet in her hand. Vientos Cruzados Barra had photographers on staff to cover the many events, conventions, and weddings that took place on the beautiful property. Gideon had arranged for one to photograph us on the beach, having them shoot from a distance so that I wasn\u2019t even aware.</p> <p>The previously released photos of us in Westport had Gideon pinning me beneath him with the surf lapping at our legs. The new photos were of us in the sun, with him sprawled on his back and me lying atop him, my arms crossed over his abs and my chin on my hands. We were talking, my gaze on his face as he looked at me and ran his fingers through my hair. Yes, the Brazilian cut of my bikini meant my ass was on display, but what really stood out was the intensity of Gideon\u2019s focus on me and the easy, comfortable familiarity between us.</p><p>My mom looked at me. There was a sadness in her eyes I couldn\u2019t understand. \u201cI had hoped you two would have a quiet, normal life. But the world isn\u2019t going to let that happen.\u201d</p><p>The photo had gone viral shortly after it was posted to a media site. Speculation was rampant. How could I be with Gideon in Rio and be okay with him fucking two other women? Was our sex life that kinky? Or maybe it wasn\u2019t Gideon Cross in the photo at the club.</p><p>Before he\u2019d fallen asleep, Gideon had told me his public relations team was working around the clock, fielding calls and managing his social media. As of today, the official answers were simply to confirm that I had been in Rio with Gideon. He said he\u2019d handle the rest personally when he got home, although he was cagey about how he was going to do that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being secretive,\u201d I\u2019d accused, without heat.</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d he had agreed with a faint smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I put my hand over my mom\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.

The media will move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d she sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re getting married on Saturday. I can\u2019t believe it. There\u2019s still so much to do.\u201d</p><p>Saturday. Only a handful of days away. I didn\u2019t think it was possible for Gideon and me to feel any more married than we already did, but it would be nice to say our vows with our families watching.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come over to the penthouse tomorrow?\u201d I suggested. \u201cI would love for you to see it and we can discuss everything that still needs to be decided. We\u2019ll have lunch in and just hang out.\u201d</p> <p>Her face brightened. \u201cWhat a wonderful idea! I would love that, Eva.\u201d</p><p>Leaning over the armrests, I kissed her cheek. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even going to take a nap?\u201d I watched, astonished, as Gideon shifted through his closet.</p><p>He was wearing only boxer briefs, his hair towel-dried after the shower he\u2019d taken the moment we got home. I was on the bed, feeling exhausted and wrung out even though I\u2019d slept on the plane.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a short day,\u201d he said, pulling out a dark gray suit. \u201cI\u2019ll be home early.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to catch a cold if you don\u2019t get enough sleep. I don\u2019t want you sick at our wedding or on our honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the blue tie I loved off his tie rack. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get sick.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the clock on his nightstand. \u201cIt\u2019s not even seven! You never go to work this early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have things to do.\u201d He buttoned his shirt quickly. \u201cStop nagging me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not nagging.\u201d</p><p>He shot me an amused look. \u201cDidn\u2019t you get enough of me yesterday?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh my God. Are you full of yourself or what?\u201d</p><p>He sat and tugged on his socks. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, angel. I\u2019ll give you more when I get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to throw something at you right now.\u201d</p><p>Gideon was dressed in a flash, yet somehow looked so polished and perfect. That only soured my mood more.</p><p>\u201cStop scowling at me,\u201d he chastised, bending to kiss the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cIt takes me forever to look as good as you do without trying,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cAnd you\u2019re wearing my favorite tie.\u201d It brought out the color of his eyes, made sure you didn\u2019t see anything else but him and how gorgeous he was.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI know. When I get home, would you like me to fuck you while wearing it?\u201d</p><p>I pictured it and my scowl faded. What would it be like if he just opened his fly and screwed me with one of his power suits on? Totally hot. In more ways than one.</p> <p>\u201cWe sweat too much.\u201d I pouted at the thought. \u201cWe\u2019d ruin it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a dozen.\u201d He straightened. \u201cYou\u2019re staying home today, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. You\u2019ve got a dozen of those ties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your favorite,\u201d he replied simply, as if that explained everything. Which I supposed it did. \u201cHome, right?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes, my mom will be here in a few hours and I have calls to make.\u201d</p><p>He started toward the door. \u201cTake a nap, grumpy angel. Dream about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d I muttered, hugging a pillow and closing my eyes.</p><p>I dreamed of him. Of course.</p><p>\u201cMost of the RSVPs have come in already,\u201d my mom said, running her fingers over the trackpad on her laptop to show me a spreadsheet that made my eyes cross. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect so many guests would attend on such short notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, right?\u201d Honestly, I hadn\u2019t a clue. I didn\u2019t even fully know who all had been invited to the reception. I just knew it was Sunday evening, at one of Gideon\u2019s hotels in the city.</p><p>We never would have gotten the space we needed otherwise. Scott never said so, but I had to think someone else\u2019s event had gotten bumped at the last minute. And the number of rooms we\u2019d reserved to accommodate my dad\u2019s side of the family ... I hadn\u2019t considered any of that when I picked Gideon\u2019s birthday as the date.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s great.\u201d My mom smiled at me, but it was a tight smile. She was stressed to the max and I felt bad about that, too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be wonderful, Mom. Totally amazing. And we\u2019re all going to be so happy, we won\u2019t care if something goes wrong.\u201d She flinched and I rushed on. \u201cWhich it won\u2019t. All of the staff are going to make sure they do everything right. This is their boss\u2019s big day.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She nodded, looking relieved. \u201cYou\u2019re right.

Gideon and I were already married, but celebrating his birthday was something we hadn\u2019t done together yet. I couldn\u2019t wait.</p><p>My smartphone chimed with a text message. I picked it up and read it, frowning. I reached for the TV remote.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d my mom asked.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Gideon wants me to turn the TV on.\u201d My stomach tightened, worry crowding out the anticipation I\u2019d just felt. How much more would we have to take?</p><p>I clicked on the channel he\u2019d specified and recognized the set of a popular talk show. To my shock, Gideon was just settling into a chair at a table circled by the five female hosts\u2014to applause, catcalls, and whistles. Think what they would about his fidelity, women couldn\u2019t resist him. His charisma and sheer sexiness were a million times more potent in person.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d my mother breathed. \u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d</p><p>I turned up the volume.</p><p>As was to be expected, after congratulating him on our engagement, the hosts launched right into the topic of Rio and the infamous m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois club photo. Of course, they made sure to point out that it couldn\u2019t be shown on air because it was too risqu\u00e9. But they directed viewers to the show\u2019s website, which was highlighted on a banner that ran continuously along the bottom of the screen.</p> <p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s subtle,\u201d my mom snapped. \u201cWhy is he giving this any more attention?\u201d</p><p>I hushed her. \u201cHe\u2019s got a plan.\u201d At least I hoped he did.</p><p>Holding a coffee mug branded with the show\u2019s logo between both hands, Gideon looked thoughtful as the hosts all chimed in before letting him speak.</p><p>\u201cShould we even be having bachelor and bachelorette parties anymore?\u201d one of the hosts asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s one of the things I can clear up,\u201d Gideon interjected, before they started debating that point. \u201cSince Eva and I married last month and I\u2019m no longer a bachelor, it couldn\u2019t be a bachelor party.\u201d</p><p>Behind them, on a massive video screen, the show\u2019s logo gave way to a photo of Gideon kissing me after we\u2019d said our vows.</p> <p>My breath caught right along with the live audience\u2019s gasps. \u201cWow,\u201d I murmured. \u201cHe outed us.\u201d</p><p>I barely caught the rush of conversation that followed the reveal, too stunned by what he was doing to process everything. Gideon was such a private man. He never gave personal interviews, only ones focused on Cross Industries.</p><p>The photo of us changed to a series of shots taken inside the same nightclub where the leggy brunettes had climbed all over him. When he glanced at the audience and suggested that some of them might be familiar with the location, there were a few shouted affirmatives.</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d he went on, looking back at the hosts. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be in New York and Brazil at the same time. The photo that went viral was digitally altered to remove the club\u2019s logo. You can see that it\u2019s embroidered into the curtains of the VIP lounge. All it took was the right software and a couple of clicks to make it disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the girls were there,\u201d one of the hosts countered, \u201cand what was happening with them was real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. I had a life before my wife came along,\u201d he said evenly and unapologetically. \u201cI can\u2019t change that, unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a life before you, too. She\u2019s the Eva mentioned in, um, a Six-Ninths song.\u201d She squinted slightly. \u201c \u2018Golden Girl.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>The host was obviously reading the information from a teleprompter.</p> <p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s her,\u201d he confirmed.</p><p>His tone was neutral. He seemed unruffled. While I knew the show was never as spontaneous as it seemed, it was still surreal to see our lives used to boost the morning ratings.</p><p>A photo of Brett and me at the \u201cGolden Girl\u201d video launch in Times Square popped up and a portion of the song played for a moment. \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>Gideon gave them one of his rare smiles. \u201cIf I were a songwriter, I\u2019d compose ballads about her, too.\u201d</p><p>The photo of Gideon and me in Brazil appeared on the screen. It was quickly followed by the photo of us in Westport, and a series of shots taken while we\u2019d walked the red carpet at various charity events. In all of them, his eyes were on me.</p><p>\u201cOoh, he\u2019s good at this,\u201d I said, mostly to myself. My mom was busy shutting down her laptop. \u201cHe\u2019s sincere, but still aloof and confident enough to seem like the legendary Gideon Cross. And he gave them a ton of photos to work with.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was also a good choice to go with the talk show format of multiple female hosts exploring female-focused topics. They weren\u2019t going to give him a free pass for alleged infidelity or even tiptoe around the subject. It was going to clear the air in a way an interview with a male anchor might not have.</p><p>One of the hosts leaned forward. \u201cThere\u2019s a book coming out about you, too, isn\u2019t there? Written by your former fianc\u00e9e?\u201d</p><p>A photo of Gideon and Corinne at the Kingsman Vodka party came up on the screen. A collective murmur arose from the audience. My teeth ground together. She looked stunningly beautiful, as always, and complemented Gideon\u2019s dark handsomeness so well.</p><p>I chose to believe the show had dug that image up on their own.</p> <p>\u201cGhostwritten, actually,\u201d he answered. \u201cBy someone with an ax to grind. I\u2019m afraid Mrs. Giroux is being taken advantage of and can\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that. Who\u2019s the ghostwriter?\u201d She looked at the audience and quickly explained what a ghostwriter was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not at liberty to say who\u2019s actually writing the book.\u201d</p><p>The host pressed the point. \u201cBut you know him? Or her? And they don\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct\u2014on both counts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it an ex-girlfriend? A former business partner?\u201d</p><p>The one host who\u2019d been mostly listening switched gears. \u201cAbout Corinne ... Why don\u2019t you tell us what the story is there, Gideon?\u201d</p><p>My husband set down the mug he\u2019d just taken a sip out of. \u201cMrs. Giroux and I dated in college. We were engaged for a time, but even then, the relationship wasn\u2019t going anywhere. We were immature and, truthfully, too ignorant to know what we wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing young and confused isn\u2019t very interesting or salacious, is it? We remained friends after she married. I\u2019m sorry she feels the need to commercialize that particular time in our lives now that I\u2019m married. I\u2019m sure this is as awkward for Jean-Fran\u00e7ois as it is for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her husband, right? Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Giroux. Do you know him?\u201d</p> <p>Corinne and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois in evening wear at some event appeared on the screen. They were an attractive couple, although the contrast between the two men wasn\u2019t flattering for the Frenchman. He couldn\u2019t compete with Gideon, but then, who could?</p><p>Gideon nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re in business together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked about this with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t discuss it all, usually.\u201d That faint smile touched his mouth again. \u201cI\u2019m a newlywed. I have other things on my mind.\u201d</p><p>I clapped my hands together. \u201cYay! That was my idea. I told him to keep reminding people she\u2019s married and that he knows her husband.\u201d And he got a dig in about Deanna, too. Well played all around.</p><p>\u201cYou knew he was going to do this?\u201d my mom asked, sounding horrified.</p><p>I looked at her, frowning when I saw how pale she was. Considering the tan she\u2019d gotten over the last two weekends, that was worrying. \u201cNo. I had no idea. We talked about the Giroux thing a while ago. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her fingertips into her temples. \u201cI\u2019ve got a headache.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHang on till this is over and I\u2019ll get you something for that.\u201d I looked back at the TV, but they broke for a commercial. I ran to the bathroom medicine cabinet and came back out rattling a little bottle of pills, surprised to find my mother packing up her stuff. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving? What about lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired, Eva. I\u2019m going home to lie down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could take a nap here in the guest room.\u201d I figured she\u2019d like that. After all, Gideon had precisely replicated her design of my apartment bedroom right here. A misguided but thoughtful effort to give me a safe haven in his home at a time in our relationship when I hadn\u2019t known whether I should fight for us or just run away.</p><p>She shook her head and slung the carrying strap of her laptop case over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. We covered the most important things. I\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p><p>She air-kissed both my cheeks and left.</p><p>Sinking back onto the couch, I put the pills on the coffee table and watched the rest of Gideon\u2019s interview.</p><p>12</p><p>\u201cMr. Cross.\u201d Scott stood up behind his desk. \u201cWill you be in today after all?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and opened my office door, waving Angus inside before me. \u201cI just have to take care of something. I\u2019ll be in tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d cleared my schedule, redistributing my meetings and appointments throughout the rest of the week. I hadn\u2019t planned to come to the Crossfire at all, but the information Angus had been sent to gather was too sensitive to risk disclosing anywhere else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Taking a moment to close the door and make the glass opaque, I followed Angus to the seating area and dropped into a chair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had a busy few days, lad,\u201d he said, his lips twisted wryly.</p><p>\u201cNever a dull moment.\u201d I exhaled roughly, fighting off fatigue. \u201cTell me you have something.\u201d</p><p>Angus leaned forward. \u201cLittle more than I had to start with: a marriage license with a fictitious hometown and Jackson Tramell\u2019s death certificate, which has Lauren Kittrie listed as his spouse. He was dead less than a year after they wed.\u201d</p> <p>I homed in on the most important information. \u201cLauren lied about where she was from?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cEasy enough to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d Studying him, I saw the tension in his jaw. \u201cThere\u2019s something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cManner of death is listed as undetermined,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cJackson took a bullet to the right temple.\u201d</p><p>My spine stiffened. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t decide if it was suicide or homicide?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye. It couldnae be determined conclusively one way or the other.\u201d</p><p>More questions without answers, with the biggest issue being whether Lauren had any relevance at all. Maybe we were chasing our tails.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d I scrubbed a hand over my face. \u201cI just want a photo, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, Gideon. A quarter of a century. Maybe someone from her hometown would remember her, but we dinnae know where that is.\u201d</p><p>Dropping my hand, I looked at him. I knew the inflections of his voice and what they signified. \u201cYou think someone went through and tidied things up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible. Also possible that the police report of Jackson\u2019s death was truly misplaced over the years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>He confirmed my statement with a shake of his head. \u201cI brought in a lass to pose as an IRS agent looking for Lauren Kittrie Tramell. She questioned Monica Dieck, who said she hasn\u2019t seen her former sister-in-law in many years and to her knowledge, Lauren is deceased.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, trying to make sense of it all and getting nowhere.</p><p>\u201cMonica was scared, lad. When she heard Lauren\u2019s name she went white as a ghost.\u201d</p><p>Pushing to my feet, I began to pace. \u201cWhat the fuck does that mean? None of this is getting me any closer to the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone else who might have the answers.\u201d</p><p>I came to an abrupt halt. \u201cEva\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou could ask her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus.\u201d I stared at him. \u201cI just want to know that my wife is safe. That none of this poses any danger to her whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>Angus\u2019s features softened. \u201cFrom what we ken of Eva\u2019s mother, protecting her daughter has always been a priority. I cannae see her putting Eva at risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer overprotectiveness is exactly my concern. She\u2019s been tracking Eva\u2019s movements for God knows how long. I assumed it was because of Nathan Barker. But maybe he was just part of the reason. Maybe there\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRa\u00fal and I are already working on revised protocols.\u201d</p><p>I raked a hand through my hair. In addition to their security duties, they were dealing with the problem of Anne and finding whatever records her brother had kept, as well as trying to identify the photographer who took the photo of me and unravel the mystery of Eva\u2019s mother. Even with their auxiliary teams, I knew they were stretched thin.</p><p>My security detail was used to managing only my affairs. Now I had Eva in my life, which effectively doubled their duties. Angus and Ra\u00fal were accustomed to rotating shifts, but lately they were both working nearly round the clock. They had standing orders to hire whatever support they required, but what we needed was another security chief\u2014maybe two. Experts whose sole charge would be Eva and whom I could trust as implicitly as I did my existing team.</p><p>I\u2019d have to make the time to get that done. When Eva and I returned from our honeymoon, I wanted everything in place.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Angus.\u201d I exhaled harshly. \u201cLet\u2019s head to the penthouse. I want to be with Eva now. I\u2019ll figure out the next steps after I get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>I looked at Eva as I stripped out of my clothes. \u201cI thought you\u2019d like the surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. But still. That was huge.\u201d</p><p>I could tell she was happy about the interview. The way she\u2019d tackled me when I came home had been a good indication. She was also talking fast and hopping around all over the place. Which, come to think of it, wasn\u2019t too different from Lucky, who was darting under the bed and rolling out again, yipping happily. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stepping out of the closet in my boxer briefs, I went to the bed and sprawled. God, I was tired. Too tired to even make a pass at my beautiful wife, who looked adorable in a strapless short romper thing. That said, I was certainly able to rise to the occasion if she propositioned me.</p><p>Eva sat on her side of the bed, then leaned over the edge to help Lucky, who tried to scramble up and couldn\u2019t quite make it. A moment later, he was on my chest, whining in protest as I held him off from slathering saliva all over my jaw. \u201cHey, I get it. I like you, too, but I don\u2019t lick your face.\u201d</p><p>He barked at that. Eva laughed and lay down on her pillow.</p><p>It struck me then that this was it. This was home. In a way it had never been before. Nothing had really felt like home since my dad died. But I had it back, now, better than ever.</p> <p>Tucking Lucky against my stomach, I rolled toward my wife. \u201cHow did things go with your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I guess. We\u2019re pretty much ready for Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guess?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cShe got a headache during your interview. Seemed like she freaked out a little.\u201d</p><p>I studied her. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat you were talking about our personal stuff on television. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t get her sometimes.\u201d</p><p>I remembered Eva telling me about how she\u2019d discussed Corinne\u2019s book with Monica and using the media to our advantage. Monica had cautioned her against it, told her to value our privacy. At the time, I agreed with Eva\u2019s mother and\u2014today\u2019s interview aside\u2014I would continue to agree with her. But in light of what little I knew about Monica\u2019s identity, it seemed probable that Eva\u2019s mother was concerned about her own privacy as well. It was one thing to appear in brief mentions in the local society papers. Quite another to gain the attention of the world.</p><p>Eva had her mother\u2019s face and some of her mannerisms. She also had the Tramell name, which was a curious error. It would have been better cover to give her Victor\u2019s last name. Someone might be looking for Monica. If they knew at least as much as I did, having Eva\u2019s face on national television would put an X on the map.</p><p>My heart began to pound. Was my wife in danger? I had no idea what Monica might be hiding from.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Eva bolted up. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you ... I\u2019ve got a dress!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. You damn near gave me a heart attack.\u201d Lucky took advantage of my startled state and pounced, licking madly.</p> <p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Eva caught up the puppy and rescued me, pulling him into her lap as she sat cross-legged beside me. \u201cI called my dad today. My grandmother asked him if I\u2019d want to wear her wedding dress. He sent me a picture of it, but it\u2019s been in storage so long, I couldn\u2019t really make it out. So he scanned a photo of her wearing it on her wedding day and it\u2019s perfect! It\u2019s totally what I didn\u2019t know I wanted!\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my chest and smiled wryly. How could I be anything but captivated that she was so excited to marry me again? \u201cI\u2019m glad, angel.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes sparkled with excitement. \u201cMy great-grandmother made it for her, with the help of her sisters. It\u2019s a family heirloom, how cool is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExceptionally cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight? And we\u2019re about the same height. I get my butt and boobs from that side of the family. It might not need to be altered at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love your butt and boobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFiend.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI feel like it\u2019ll be good for the relatives on that side to see me in it. I\u2019ve been worried that they\u2019ll feel out of place, but now I\u2019ll be wearing the dress, so they have to feel like they\u2019re included in a big way. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d I crooked my finger at her. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p> <p>She eyed me. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still thinking about my butt and boobs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways. But for now, just a kiss will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Leaning over, she offered her mouth.</p><p>I cupped the back of her head and took what I needed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impressive, son.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m looking up at the Crossfire from street level, but the sound of my father\u2019s voice turns my head. \u201cDad.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s dressed like me, in a dark three-piece suit. His tie is burgundy as is the handkerchief tucked into his breast pocket. We\u2019re the same height and that startles me for a moment. Why does that surprise me? The answer hovers in the back of my mind, but I can\u2019t grasp it.</p><p>His arm comes around my shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019ve built an empire. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I take a deep breath.

Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should come to the penthouse with me and meet my wife.\u201d I\u2019m anxious. I don\u2019t want him to say no. There are so many things I want to say to him and we never have time. Only a few minutes here and there, snatches of conversation that can only scratch the surface. And with Eva there, I would have the courage to say what I needed to. \u201cYou\u2019ll love her. She\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>My dad grins. \u201cBeautiful, too. I\u2019d like a grandson. And a granddaughter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d I laugh. \u201cLet\u2019s not move too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife moves fast, son. Before you know it, it\u2019s over. Don\u2019t waste it.\u201d</p><p>I swallow past a hard lump in my throat. \u201cYou could\u2019ve had more time.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not what I want to say. I want to ask him why he gave up, why he checked out. But I\u2019m afraid of the answer.</p><p>\u201cAll the time in the world wouldn\u2019t have seen me build something like this.\u201d He looks back up at the Crossfire. From the ground, it seems to reach to infinity, an optical illusion created by the pyramid at the top. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a lot of work, keeping this standing. Same with a marriage. Eventually, you\u2019ll have to put one before the other.\u201d</p> <p>I think about that. Is it true? I shake my head. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep it standing together.\u201d</p><p>He slaps a hand on my shoulder and the ground reverberates beneath my feet. It starts out faintly, then builds, until glass begins to rain down around us. Horrified, I watch as the distant spire at the top explodes outward, then radiates down, windows bursting under the pressure.</p><p>I woke with a gasp, breathing hard, pushing at the weight on my chest and feeling warm fur. Blinking, I found Lucky climbing over me, low whimpers rumbling in his chest.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d I sat up and shoved my hair back.</p><p>Eva slept beside me, curled in a ball with her hands tucked beneath her chin. Through the windows beyond her, I saw the sun was fading fast. A quick glance at the clock told me it was just past five in the evening. My alarm had been set for quarter past the hour, so I reached for my smartphone to turn it off.</p><p>Lucky shoved his head beneath my forearm. Picking him up, I held him at eye level. \u201cYou did it again.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d woken me from a nightmare. Who the fuck knew if he was doing it consciously or not? I was grateful either way. I gave him a brisk rubdown and slid out of bed.</p><p>\u201cAre you getting up?\u201d Eva asked.</p><p>\u201cI have to go to Dr. Petersen\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Forgot about that.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d debated skipping the appointment, but Eva and I would be leaving for our honeymoon soon and I wouldn\u2019t see the good doctor for a month. I figured I could tough it out until then.</p><p>I set Lucky down on the floor and started for the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she called after me. \u201cI invited Chris over for dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>My stride faltered, then halted. Turning, I faced her.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that.\u201d She sat up, rubbing her eyes with her fists. \u201cHe\u2019s lonely, Gideon. He\u2019s on his own, without his family. It\u2019s a rough time for him. I figured I\u2019d make something simple for dinner and we could watch a movie. Take his mind off the divorce for a while, maybe.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. That was my wife. Always circling the wagons around the lost and wounded. How could I fault her for being the woman I\u2019d fallen in love with? \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. It was worth going along with anything, just to see that.</p><p>\u201cI just finished watching your interview,\u201d Dr. Petersen said, as he settled into his armchair. \u201cMy wife told me about it earlier and I was able to catch it on the Internet. Very well done. I enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>Tugging up my slacks, I sank onto the sofa. \u201cA necessary evil, but I agree, it went well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Eva?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me how she reacted to seeing that photo?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Petersen smiled. \u201cI can imagine the reaction. How is she doing now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay.\u201d I was still shaken by the memory of hearing her being so violently ill. \u201cWe\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>Which didn\u2019t change the fact that I seethed with fury every time I thought of it. That photo had existed for months. Why hold on to it, then release it now? It would have made news in May.</p><p>The only answer I could come up with was that they\u2019d wanted to hurt Eva. Maybe put a wedge between us. They wanted to humiliate her and me.</p><p>Someone was going to pay for that. When I was done, they\u2019d know what hell felt like. They would suffer, the way Eva and I had suffered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou and Eva both say things are good. What does that mean?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my shoulders back to alleviate the tension there. \u201cWe\u2019re ... solid. There\u2019s a stability now that wasn\u2019t there before.\u201d</p><p>He set his tablet on the armrest and met my gaze. \u201cGive me an example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe photo\u2019s a good one. There were times in our relationship when a photo like that would\u2019ve really screwed us up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis time was different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery. Eva and I discussed having my bachelor party in Rio before I left. She\u2019s very jealous. She always has been and I don\u2019t mind. In fact, I like it. But I don\u2019t like her torturing herself with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealousy is rooted in insecurity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s change the word, then. She\u2019s territorial. I will never touch another woman for the rest of my life and she knows that. But she has an active imagination. And that photo was everything she feared in living color.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Peterson was letting me do the talking, but for a second I couldn\u2019t. I had to push the image\u2014and the rage that it stirred\u2014out of my mind before I could continue.</p> <p>\u201cEva was thousands of miles away when the damn thing exploded online and I had nothing in the way of proof. I had only my word and she believed me. No questions. No doubt. I explained as best I could and she accepted it as the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat surprises you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2014\u201d I paused. \u201cYou know, now that I\u2019m talking about this, it really didn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both had a rough moment there, but we didn\u2019t fuck it up. It was like we knew how to make it right between us. And we knew that we would. There wasn\u2019t any doubt about that, either.\u201d</p><p>He smiled gently. \u201cYou\u2019re being very candid. In the interview and now.\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged. \u201cAmazing what a man will do when faced with losing the woman he can\u2019t live without.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were angry about her ultimatum before. Resentful. Are you still?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d My answer came without hesitation, although I would never forget how it felt when she\u2019d forced a separation on us. \u201cShe wants me to talk, I\u2019ll talk. It doesn\u2019t matter what I throw at her, what mood I\u2019m in when I tell her, how horrible she feels when she hears it ... She can deal. And she loves me more.\u201d</p><p>I laughed out loud, startled by a sudden rush of joy.</p><p>Dr. Petersen\u2019s brows rose, a faint smile on his lips. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard you laugh like that before.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, nonplussed. \u201cDon\u2019t get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know about that. More talking. More laughter. They\u2019re connected, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on who\u2019s talking.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes were warm and compassionate. \u201cYou stopped talking when your mother stopped listening.\u201d</p><p>My smile faded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s said that actions speak louder than words,\u201d he went on, \u201cbut we still need words. We need to speak and we need to be heard.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, my pulse inexplicably speeding up.</p><p>\u201cYour wife is listening to you, Gideon. She believes you.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019m listening and I believe you. So you\u2019re talking again and getting a different response from the one you\u2019ve conditioned yourself to expect. It opens things up, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpens me up, you mean.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt does. To love and acceptance. To friendship. Trust. A whole new world, really.\u201d</p><p>Reaching up, I rubbed the back of my neck. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore laughter is a good start.\u201d Dr. Petersen sat back with a smile and picked up his tablet again. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure out the rest.\u201d</p><p>I entered the foyer of the penthouse to the sounds of both Nina Simone and Lucky, feeling good. The puppy barked from the other side of the front door, his claws scratching madly. Smiling despite myself, I turned the knob and crouched, catching the little wriggling body as he launched himself through the opening.</p><p>\u201cHeard me coming, did you?\u201d Standing, I cradled him against my chest and let him lick my jaw as I rubbed his back.</p><p>I entered the living room in time to watch my stepfather push to his feet from where he\u2019d been sitting on the floor. He greeted me with a warm smile and even warmer eyes, before he dialed it back and schooled his expression into something ... less.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he greeted me, closing the distance between us. He wore jeans and a polo shirt but had taken his shoes off, revealing white socks with red threading along the toes. His wavy hair, the color of a worn penny, was longer than I\u2019d ever seen it, and a few days\u2019 growth of stubble shadowed his jaw. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t move, my thoughts tumbling around themselves. For an instant, Chris had looked at me like Dr. Petersen did. Like Angus did.</p><p>Like my father did, in my dreams.</p><p>Unable to look at him, I took a second to set Lucky down and take a deep breath. When I straightened, I found Chris holding his hand out to me.</p><p>Feeling a familiar tingle of awareness, I looked beyond Chris\u2019s shoulder and found Eva standing in the doorway to the kitchen. Her gaze met mine, soft and tender and full of love.</p> <p>Something about him had changed radically. His easygoing greeting made me remember how it was between us years ago. There had been a time when Chris hadn\u2019t been so formal with me. A time when he had looked at me with affection. He\u2019d stopped because I told him to. He wasn\u2019t my father. Would never be my father. I knew I was just the baggage that came along with him loving my mother. I didn\u2019t need him to pretend that he gave a shit about me.</p><p>Instead, it seemed, he had pretended that he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>I took his hand, then pulled him into a quick hold, slapping him firmly but gently across the shoulders before releasing him. He held on and I froze, my gaze darting to Eva.</p><p>She pretended to pour an imaginary drink for me, then retreated to get me a real one.</p><p>Chris let me go, stepping back and clearing his throat. His eyes behind his gold-framed spectacles were shiny and wet. \u201cCasual Tuesday?\u201d he asked gruffly, looking at my jeans and T-shirt. \u201cYou work too hard. Especially with such a cute dog and beautiful wife waiting at home for you.\u201d</p> <p>Your wife is listening to you, Gideon. She believes you. I\u2019m listening and I believe you.</p><p>My stepfather believed me, too. And it was costing him. I could see the pain he was living with, recognized it from the times I\u2019d felt that way myself. Separation from Eva felt almost like living death, and our relationship was still new. Chris had been married to my mother for over two decades.</p><p>\u201cI had an appointment with my therapist,\u201d I told him. The ordinary words sounded foreign to my ears, like something a mentally unstable person oversharing would say.</p><p>His throat worked on a hard swallow. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing someone. That\u2019s good, Gideon. I\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201d</p><p>Eva appeared with a glass of wine in her hand. She passed it to me, tipping her chin up to offer her mouth. I kissed her, holding my lips to hers for a long, sweet moment.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d she asked, when I let her go.</p> <p>\u201cStarved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, then.\u201d</p><p>I checked her out as she preceded us into the kitchen, admiring the way her capris hugged her lush ass. She was barefoot, with her blond hair swinging softly around her shoulders. Aside from something glossy on her lips, she was barefaced and breathtaking.</p><p>She\u2019d set us up to eat at the island, putting Chris and me on the side with bar stools, while she stood opposite us and ate standing up. She was so casual and relaxed, as was the atmosphere she had created.</p><p>Three pillar candles fragranced the air with something citrusy and spicy. Dinner was a seared steak salad, with Gorgonzola, sliced red onions, red and yellow sweet peppers, and a tangy vinaigrette. Crispy bread soaked in garlic butter stayed warm in a napkin-lined basket, while a decanted bottle of red wine waited to fill stemless glasses.</p><p>I watched her as she swayed to the music while she ate and chatted with Chris about the Outer Banks beach house. I remembered for a moment how the penthouse had been before she\u2019d started moving in. It was where I lived, but I couldn\u2019t say it was home. On some level, I must have known she was coming when I bought the place. It had waited for her, as I had, needing her to bring life into it.</p><p>\u201cYour sister is coming with me to the dinner tomorrow night, Gideon,\u201d Chris said. \u201cShe\u2019s very excited.\u201d</p><p>Eva frowned. \u201cWhat dinner?\u201d</p> <p>His brows rose. \u201cYour husband is being honored for his generosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Her eyes got big and she did a little hop. \u201cAre you giving a speech?\u201d</p><p>Amused, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s usually expected, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d She jumped and clapped like a cheerleader. \u201cI love hearing you speak.\u201d</p><p>For once, I thought I might even like doing it, considering that just the thought put a fuck-me gleam in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd I can\u2019t wait to see Ireland,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it black tie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble yay! You in a tux, giving a speech.\u201d She rubbed her hands together.</p><p>Chris laughed. \u201cClearly, your wife is your biggest fan.\u201d</p><p>She winked at him. \u201cYou better believe it.\u201d</p><p>I savored my wine before swallowing. \u201cOur social calendar should be synced to your phone, angel.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eva\u2019s smile faded into a frown. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a look.\u201d</p><p>Settling back in his chair, Chris held his glass close to his chest and sighed. \u201cThat was wonderful, Eva. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>She waved that off. \u201cIt was salad. But I\u2019m glad you enjoyed it.\u201d</p> <p>My gaze moved from her to my stepfather. I debated saying anything, stewed over it. Things were fine the way they were. Change sometimes fucked things up that were good before.</p><p>\u201cWe should do this more often.\u201d The words were out of my mouth before I realized it.</p><p>He stared at me, then looked down into his glass. He cleared his throat. \u201cI would like that, Gideon.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cI\u2019ll take you up on the offer whenever you like.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Sliding off my stool, I grabbed his plate and my own and carried them over to the sink.</p><p>Eva joined me, handing me her plate. Our gazes met and she smiled. Then she turned to Chris. \u201cLet\u2019s open another bottle of wine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re ahead of schedule by two weeks. Barring any unforeseen events, we should be finished early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Standing, I shook the project manager\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019re doing good work, Leo.\u201d</p><p>Opening the newest Crosswinds resort earlier than planned offered myriad benefits, not the least of which was combining the necessary final inspections with some playtime with my wife.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Cross.\u201d He gathered up his materials and straightened. Leo Aigner was a stout man, with thinning blond hair and a big smile. A hard worker, he stuck rigidly to timelines and sped them up whenever he could. \u201cCongratulations, by the way. I heard that you got married recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, yes. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>I walked with him to the door of my office, then glanced at my watch when he left. Eva was coming to the Crossfire at noon to have lunch with Mark and his fianc\u00e9 Steven. I wanted to catch her while she was close. I needed her opinion before I proceeded with a possibility I\u2019d been entertaining all day.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Cross.\u201d Scott stood in the doorway, intercepting me on the way to my desk.</p><p>I shot him a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cDeanna Johnson has been waiting at reception for half an hour. What would you like me to tell Cheryl?\u201d</p><p>I thought of Eva. \u201cTell her to send Ms. Johnson in.\u201d</p><p>While I waited, I texted my wife. Save me some time before you leave the Crossfire. I need to ask you something.</p><p>An in-person meeting? she texted back. Are you thinking about my butt and boobs again?</p><p>Always, I replied.</p><p>That was how Deanna found me, smiling at my phone. I looked up as she walked in, all amusement gone in a flash. She was dressed in a white pantsuit, with a chunky gold choker around her neck; it was clear she\u2019d taken care with her appearance. Her dark hair hung in waves around her face and shoulders, and her makeup had been applied with drama in mind.</p> <p>She walked toward my desk.</p><p>\u201cMs. Johnson.\u201d I set my phone aside and settled into my chair before she sat down. \u201cI don\u2019t have much time.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth tightened. She tossed her purse onto the nearest chair and remained standing. \u201cYou promised me an exclusive on your wedding photos!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, yes.\u201d And since I remembered what I\u2019d extracted from her in exchange, I hit the control that closed my office door.</p><p>She set her hands on my desk and leaned over it. \u201cI gave you all the information about that sex tape of Eva and Brett Kline. I held up my end of the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile you convinced Corinne to give you what you needed to write a book about me.\u201d</p><p>Something passed through her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDid you think I was bluffing during the interview?\u201d I asked evenly, leaning back and tapping my fingertips together. \u201cThat I didn\u2019t know the ghostwriter is you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the deal we made!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Deanna pushed away from the desk in a violent explosion of movement. \u201cGod, you smug son of a bitch. You don\u2019t give a shit about anyone but yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve said. Which raises the question\u2014why would you trust me to follow through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotal stupidity. I thought you were actually sincere when you apologized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sincere. I\u2019m very sorry I fucked you.\u201d</p><p>Fury and embarrassment colored her face. \u201cI hate you,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware. You\u2019re certainly free to do so, but I suggest you think twice before pursuing a vendetta against me or my wife.\u201d I stood. \u201cYou\u2019re going to walk out the door and I\u2019ll forget you exist\u2014again. You don\u2019t want me thinking about you, Deanna. You won\u2019t like the direction my thoughts would take.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI could\u2019ve made a fortune with that sex tape!\u201d she accused. \u201cAnd they were going to pay me good money to write that book. Your wedding photos would\u2019ve made me a mint. Now, what have I got? You\u2019ve taken everything away from me. You fucking owe me.\u201d</p><p>I arched a brow. \u201cThey don\u2019t want you to write the book anymore? How interesting.\u201d</p><p>She straightened, visibly pulling herself together. \u201cCorinne didn\u2019t know. About us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s be clear. There was no us.\u201d My smartphone chimed with a text from Ra\u00fal, letting me know that he was nearly at the Crossfire with Eva. I moved to the coatrack. \u201cYou wanted to fuck and I fucked you. If you wanted me, well ... I\u2019m not responsible for your exaggerated expectations.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t take responsibility for anything! You just use people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used me, too. To get laid. To try to pad your bank account.\u201d I shrugged into my jacket. \u201cAs for what I owe you for your financial losses, my wife suggested I offer you a job.\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was my response, too.\u201d I retrieved my smartphone and slid it into my pocket. \u201cBut she was quite serious, so I\u2019ve made the offer. If you\u2019re interested, Scott can put you together with someone in human resources.\u201d</p><p>I headed toward the door. \u201cYou can see yourself out.\u201d</p> <p>Going down to the lobby was totally unnecessary. Eva had lunch plans and the few words I could trade with her wouldn\u2019t amount to a conversation of any importance.</p><p>But I wanted to see her. Touch her for just a moment. Remind myself that the man I\u2019d been when I\u2019d screwed women like Deanna no longer existed. Never again would the scent of sex turn my stomach and make me scrub my skin nearly raw in the shower.</p><p>I was passing through the security turnstiles in the lobby when Ra\u00fal escorted Eva through the revolving door, then retreated to his post outside. My wife wore a wine-colored jumpsuit with sky-high heels so delicate I couldn\u2019t see how they stayed on. Her tanned shoulders were bared by thin straps, and gold hoops dangled from her ears. Sunglasses partially hid her face, drawing the eye to the plump mouth that had ringed my cock just hours ago. She carried a nude clutch in her hand and walked across the golden-veined marble with a naturally seductive sway to her hips.</p><p>Heads swiveled as she walked by. Some of those gazes lingered to admire her ass.</p><p>What would they think if they knew that deep inside her, she was still creamy with my cum? That her nipples were tender from the suction of my mouth and the plump lips of her perfect little cunt were swollen from the friction of my cock sliding through them?</p><p>I knew what I thought. Mine. All mine.</p> <p>As if she felt the heat of that silent demand, her head turned sharply, catching me coming toward her. Her lips parted. I watched her chest lift and fall with a quick intake of breath.</p><p>Same here, angel. Like a punch in the gut every time.</p><p>\u201cAce.\u201d</p><p>Catching her slender waist in both hands, I pulled her into me and pressed a kiss to her forehead, breathing in the scent of her perfume. \u201cAngel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a nice surprise,\u201d she murmured, leaning into me. \u201cAre you heading out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wanted to see you.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back, her eyes bright with pleasure. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it real bad for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s highly contagious. Caught it from you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, did you?\u201d Her laughter flowed over me in a warm rush of love.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the big man himself,\u201d Steven Ellison said, coming up beside us. \u201cCongratulations, you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteven.\u201d Eva turned from me and offered the brawny redhead a hug.</p><p>He caught her in an embrace that lifted her feet from the floor. \u201cMarriage looks good on you.\u201d</p><p>He released her and shook my hand. \u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt feels good,\u201d I said.</p><p>Steven grinned. \u201cI can\u2019t wait. Mark\u2019s kept me waiting for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep kicking my ass about that,\u201d Mark said, appearing next to us. He shook my hand, too. \u201cMr. Cross. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you joining us for lunch?\u201d Steven asked.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on it, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to. The more, the merrier. We\u2019re heading to Bryant Park Grill.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Eva. She\u2019d pushed her sunglasses up on top of her head and eyed me expectantly. She gave a little nod of encouragement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot to catch up on,\u201d I said, which wasn\u2019t a lie. I was two days behind. Considering I needed to be ahead before we left for our honeymoon, I\u2019d planned on eating in and working. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the boss,\u201d Eva said. \u201cYou can play hooky if you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad influence, Mrs. Cross.\u201d</p><p>She linked her arm with mine and pulled me toward the door. \u201cYou love it.\u201d</p><p>I held back, glancing at Mark.</p> <p>\u201cI know you\u2019re busy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it would be nice if you could come along. I want to talk to you both about something.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, I agreed. We exited out to the street, immediately hit with the heat of the day and the sounds of the city. Ra\u00fal waited at the curb with the limo, his gaze catching mine before he opened the door for Eva. A glare turned my head, drawing my attention to the telephoto lens of a camera peering at us from a car parked across the street.</p><p>I pressed a kiss to Eva\u2019s temple before she slid into the back. She glanced at me, delighted and surprised. I didn\u2019t explain. She\u2019d asked for more photos of us to combat the upcoming release of Corinne\u2019s book. It was no hardship to show my affection for her, regardless of whether that damned tell-all ever saw the light of day.</p><p>It was a short drive to Bryant Park. In moments, we were taking the steps up from the street and I was taking a trip back in time, remembering when Eva and I had fought in this very location. She\u2019d seen a photo of me with Magdalene, a woman I considered a longtime family friend but who was rumored to be my lover. I\u2019d seen a photo of Eva with Cary, a man she loved like a brother but who was rumored to be her live-in paramour.</p><p>We had both been crazed with jealousy, our relationship too new and stunted by too many secrets between us. I was already obsessed with her, my world tilting on its axis to accommodate her. Even in her fury, she\u2019d looked at me with such love and accused me of not knowing it when I saw it. But I did know. I did see. It terrified me as nothing ever had. And it gave me hope, for the first time in my life.</p> <p>She glanced at me as we approached the ivy-covered entrance to the restaurant, and I could see she remembered as well. We\u2019d been here more recently, too, when Brett Kline had tried to win her back. She was already mine then, my rings on her fingers, our vows exchanged. We\u2019d been stronger than before, but now ... Now, nothing could shake us. We were anchored deep.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said, as we followed Mark and Steven through the door. The sounds of a popular restaurant inundated us. The clang of silverware against china, the hum of multiple conversations, the barely discernible piped music, and the bustle of a busy kitchen.</p><p>My mouth curved. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>We were seated immediately and a server stopped by right away to take our drink order.</p><p>\u201cShould we order champagne?\u201d Steven asked.</p><p>Mark shook his head. \u201cCome on. You know I have to go back to work.\u201d</p> <p>I held my wife\u2019s hand beneath the table. \u201cAsk again when he\u2019s working for me. We\u2019ll celebrate then.\u201d</p><p>Steven grinned. \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>We placed our drink order\u2014flat and sparkling water and one soda\u2014and the server took off to fill them.</p><p>\u201cSo here\u2019s the thing,\u201d Mark began, straightening in his seat. \u201cPart of the reason Eva quit was because of the LanCorp proposal ...\u201d</p><p>She preempted him, her mouth curved in a cat-that-ate-the-canary smile. \u201cRyan Landon offered you a job.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>She looked at me, then back at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not taking it, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Mark sat back, studied us both. \u201cIt would have been a lateral move. Nothing like the bump I\u2019ll get with Cross Industries. More than that, though, I remembered you telling me that there\u2019s bad blood between Landon and Cross. I looked it up after you quit. Knowing the background, the whole thing wasn\u2019t sitting right\u2014him declining to work with us, then trying to poach me right after.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCould be he just wants you, without the agency,\u201d Eva said.</p><p>Steven nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what I said.\u201d</p><p>As he would, I thought, because he believed in his partner. But it appeared Mark knew better. Eva glanced at me. I clearly saw the I told you so in her gaze. I squeezed her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe that,\u201d Mark countered, proving us both right.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t. I\u2019ll be honest, I baited them. Told them Gideon and I are very fond of you and look forward to working with you again. I wanted to see if they\u2019d bite. I figured if it was a great offer, I was doing you a favor. And if it wasn\u2019t, no harm no foul.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cBut why would you do that? Don\u2019t you want me at Cross Industries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we do, Mark,\u201d I interjected. \u201cEva was honest with them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was testing the waters,\u201d she said. \u201cI debated saying something to you, but I didn\u2019t want you to feel awkward if he offered you a great job that you might seriously consider taking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do you do now?\u201d Steven asked.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d Eva shrugged. \u201cGideon and I are planning a vow renewal ceremony and then taking off for a long honeymoon. Ryan Landon isn\u2019t a problem that\u2019s going away any time soon. He\u2019ll be around, doing his thing. I just won\u2019t underestimate him. And Mark is going to start a great new job with Cross Industries.\u201d</p><p>Eva glanced at me and I knew. Like all of my other battles, Landon wasn\u2019t going to be something I took care of on my own anymore. My wife would be there, doing what she could for me, fighting the good fight.</p> <p>Mark\u2019s smile flashed white from within the frame of his goatee. \u201cSounds good to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to play naughty secretary again?\u201d Eva whispered.</p><p>Her hand was in mine, her other hand cupping my biceps as we entered my office. I glanced at her, enjoying the come-on, and saw the warm laughter in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI do have to work sometime today,\u201d I said dryly.</p><p>She winked and released me, dropping dutifully into one of the chairs facing my desk. \u201cHow can I be of service, Mr. Cross?\u201d</p> <p>I was smiling as I hung my jacket on the coatrack. \u201cWhat do you think about me asking Chris to stand with me at our wedding?\u201d</p><p>I turned just in time to see her surprise.</p><p>She blinked at me. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThoughts?\u201d</p><p>Sitting back, she crossed her legs. \u201cI\u2019d like to hear yours first, before I give you mine.\u201d</p><p>I joined her in the chair beside her rather than taking a seat behind my desk. Eva was my partner, my best friend. We would deal with this, and everything else, side by side.</p> <p>\u201cAfter Rio, I was going to ask Arnoldo, once I\u2019d discussed it with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be okay with that,\u201d she said, and I could see she meant it. \u201cIt\u2019s a decision you should make for yourself and not for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe understands what we have together and that it\u2019s good for both of us.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d I rubbed my jaw. \u201cBut after last night ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich part of last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner with Chris. It got me thinking. Things have changed. And there was something Dr. Petersen said. I just ...\u201d</p><p>She reached over and took my hand.</p> <p>I searched for the right words. \u201cI want someone who knows everything to be standing with me when you come down the aisle. I don\u2019t want there to be any pretense. Not for something this important. When we face each other and say our vows again, I need that to be ... real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gideon.\u201d She slipped out of her chair, crouching beside me at my knee. Her eyes were wet and luminous, like a stormy sky just after a cleansing rain. \u201cYou beautiful man,\u201d she breathed. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know how romantic you are.\u201d</p><p>I cupped her face, my thumbs brushing over the tears that slid down her cheeks. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d</p><p>She caught my wrists and surged up, pressing her mouth to mine. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m this happy,\u201d she murmured, her lips whispering the words against my skin. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem real sometimes. Like I\u2019m dreaming, and I\u2019m going to wake up and realize I\u2019m still on the floor in the lobby, looking at you for the first time and imagining all this because I want you so badly.\u201d</p><p>I pulled her up and onto my lap, holding her, burying my face in her neck. She could always say what I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Her hands ran through my hair and over my back. \u201cChris will be delighted.\u201d</p><p>Squeezing my eyes shut, I held her tighter. \u201cYou did this.\u201d</p><p>She made everything possible. She made me possible.</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d she laughed softly, pulling back to touch my face with gentle fingertips. \u201cIt\u2019s all you, ace. I\u2019m just the lucky girl who gets a front-row seat.\u201d</p><p>Marriage suddenly didn\u2019t seem like enough to safeguard what she meant to me. Why wasn\u2019t there something more binding than a mere piece of paper that gave me the right to call her my wife? Vows were a promise, but what I needed was a guarantee that every day of my life would have her in it. I wanted my heart to beat in rhythm with hers and stop when hers did. Inextricably entwined, so I would never live even a moment without her.</p><p>She kissed me again, softly. Sweetly. Her lips so gentle. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>I would never tire of hearing that. Never stop needing to hear it. Words, as Dr. Petersen said, that needed to be spoken and heard. \u201cI love you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>More tears fell. \u201cGod.

I\u2019m going to have fun helping you into your tux\u2014and out of it.\u201d</p><p>I let her go when she slid away and stood, but I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off her.</p><p>She crossed the room and disappeared into the bathroom. I sat there, not sure I had the strength to stand yet. She weakened my knees, made my pulse race too hard and fast.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d My mother pushed into my office, Scott hot on her heels. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p> <p>I rose to my feet and gave a nod to Scott. He retreated, closing the door. The warmth from Eva bled away, leaving me feeling empty and cold as I faced my mother.</p><p>She wore dark jeans that fit her like a second skin and a loose shirt she\u2019d tucked in at the waist. Her long black hair was pulled back in a ponytail and her face was bare. Most who saw her would simply see a stunning woman who looked younger than her years. I knew her to be as worn and weary as Chris was. No makeup, no jewelry. It wasn\u2019t like her.</p><p>\u201cThis is a surprise,\u201d I said, moving into position behind my desk. \u201cWhat brings you into the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just left Corinne.\u201d She marched right up to my desk and remained standing, much as Deanna had only hours before her. \u201cShe\u2019s in pieces over that interview you gave yesterday. Completely destroyed. You have to go see her. Talk to her.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her, unable to comprehend the way her mind worked. \u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\u201d she snapped, looking at me like I\u2019d lost my mind. \u201cYou need to apologize. You said some very hurtful things\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told the truth, which is likely more than can be said about that book she\u2019s publishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t know you had a history with that woman ... that ghostwriter. She told her editor she couldn\u2019t work with that person as soon as she found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care who writes the book. A different author won\u2019t change the fact that Corinne\u2019s violating my privacy and putting something out in the world with the potential to hurt my wife.\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted. \u201cI can\u2019t even talk about your wife, Gideon. I\u2019m upset\u2014no. I\u2019m furious that you would get married without your family, your friends. Doesn\u2019t that tell you anything? That you had to do something so important without the blessing of the people who love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you implying that no one would\u2019ve approved?\u201d My arms crossed. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly not true, but even if it were, choosing someone to spend your life with isn\u2019t decided with a majority rule. Eva and I married privately because it was intimate and personal and didn\u2019t need to be shared.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you shared the news with the world?! Before you shared it with your family! I can\u2019t believe you could be so thoughtless and insensitive. You need to make things right,\u201d she said vehemently. \u201cYou have to be responsible for the pain you inflict on others. I didn\u2019t raise you this way. I can\u2019t tell you how disappointed I am.\u201d</p><p>I caught movement behind her and saw Eva fill the doorway of the bathroom, her face hard with rage, her hands clenched into fists at her sides. I gave her a curt shake of my head, my gaze narrowing with warning. She\u2019d fought this battle enough for me. It was my turn, and I was finally ready.</p><p>I hit the controls to opaque the glass. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to lecture me about inflicting pain or feeling disappointed, Mother.\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped back as if I\u2019d slapped her face. \u201cDon\u2019t take that tone with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew what was done to me. And you did nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about this again.\u201d She slashed her hand through the air.</p><p>\u201cWhen have we ever talked about it?\u201d I bit out. \u201cI told you, but at no point were you open to discussing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make this my fault!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was raped.\u201d</p><p>The words lashed out and hung in the air, sharp as a blade and raw.</p><p>My mother jerked back.</p><p>Eva reached blindly for the doorjamb and gripped it hard.</p><p>Taking a deep breath to regain a modicum of control, I drew strength from my wife\u2019s presence. \u201cI was raped,\u201d I said again, my voice calmer. Steadier. \u201cFor close to a year, every week. A man you invited into your home fondled me. Sodomized me. Over and over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She breathed harshly, her chest heaving. \u201cDon\u2019t say those ugly, awful things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happened. Repeatedly. While you were only a few rooms away. He\u2019d be nearly panting with excitement when he showed up. He\u2019d stare at me with this sick gleam in his eyes. And you couldn\u2019t see it. Refused to see it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie!\u201d</p><p>Fury burned through me, made me restless with the need to move.

Or that you chose to ignore it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop saying that!\u201d she snapped, straightening. \u201cI took you to be examined. I tried to find the proof\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause my word wasn\u2019t enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a disturbed child! You lied about everything. Anything. The most obvious things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat gave me some control! I had no power over anything in my life\u2014aside from the words that came out of my mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was supposed to just magically divine what was truth and what was a lie?\u201d She leaned forward, taking the offensive. \u201cYou were seen by two doctors. You wouldn\u2019t let the one anywhere near you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have another man touch me there? Can you even grasp how terrifying that thought was to me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou let Dr. Lucas\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. Dr. Lucas.\u201d I smiled coldly. \u201cWhere did you get his name, Mother? From the man molesting me? Or from your doctor, who was overseeing his dissertation? Either way, he steered you right toward his brother-in-law, knowing the well-respected Dr. Lucas would say anything to protect the reputation of his family.\u201d</p><p>She recoiled, stumbling back until she bumped into the chair behind her.</p><p>\u201cHe sedated me,\u201d I went on, remembering it still. The prick of the needle. The cold table. The shame as he poked and prodded a part of my body that made me tremble with revulsion. \u201cHe examined me. Then he lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would I know that?\u201d she whispered, her eyes so strikingly blue in her pale face.</p><p>\u201cYou knew,\u201d I said flatly. \u201cI remember your face afterward, when you told me Hugh wasn\u2019t coming back and to never bring it up again. You could barely look at me, but when you did, I saw it in your eyes.\u201d</p> <p>I looked at Eva. She was crying, with her arms wrapped tight around herself. My eyes stung, but she was the one who wept for me.</p><p>\u201cDid you think Chris would leave you?\u201d I wondered aloud. \u201cDid you think it was too much for your new family to take? For years, I thought you told him\u2014I heard you mention Dr. Lucas to him\u2014but Chris didn\u2019t know. Tell me what reason a wife would have to keep something like that from her husband.\u201d</p><p>My mother didn\u2019t speak, just shook her head over and over, as if that silent denial answered everything.</p><p>My fist hit my desk, rattling everything on top of it. \u201cSay something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Wrong. It\u2019s all twisted up for you. You don\u2019t ...\u201d She shook her head again. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen that way. You\u2019re confused ...\u201d</p><p>Eva stared at my mother\u2019s back with a visible, heated rage. Loathing tightened her mouth and jaw. It hit me then that I could let her carry that burden for me. I had to put it down. I didn\u2019t need it anymore. Didn\u2019t want it.</p><p>I had done the same for her in a different sense, with Nathan. The action I\u2019d taken had chased the shadows from her eyes. They lived in me now, as they should. She\u2019d been haunted by them long enough.</p><p>My chest expanded on a deep, slow breath. When I let it out, all the anger and disgust went with it. I stood there for a long moment, absorbing the dizzying lightness I felt. There was grief, a profound anguish that burned in my chest. And resignation. A clarifying, terrible acceptance. But it weighed on me so much less than the desperate hope I\u2019d harbored: that one day my mother would love me enough to accept the truth.</p> <p>That hope was dead.</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cLet\u2019s end this.

A moment more and she was gone, lost on the other side of the frosted glass.</p><p>I looked at Eva. She started toward me and I went to her, rounding my desk to meet her partway. She hugged me so tightly I could hardly breathe.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t need air.

What about my man?\u201d I countered, working hard not to get distracted by how hot he looked. The problem was his distance. There wasn\u2019t a trace of the razor-sharp focus on me that I was used to. Part of his mind was somewhere else, and I worried that it was a dark place where he shouldn\u2019t be alone. \u201cThat\u2019s the only one I care about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel. You\u2019ve been telling me to have it out with my mother for months. I\u2019ve done it. It\u2019s over and behind us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about it, though? It has to hurt, Gideon. Please don\u2019t hide it from me, if it does.\u201d</p> <p>His fingers drummed into the top of the built-in dresser, his gaze still focused on his damned cuff links. \u201cIt hurts. Okay? But I knew it would. That\u2019s why I put it off so long. But it\u2019s better this way. I feel ... Fuck. It\u2019s settled.\u201d</p><p>My lips pursed. Because I wanted him to look at me when he was saying stuff like that, I untied my robe and let the silk whisper off my shoulders. I turned away to hang it by the closet door, stepping over Lucky, who\u2019d passed out right in the middle of the floor. I arched my back as I reached for the hook, giving Gideon a prime view of the ass he loved.</p><p>As I had come to expect of my husband, he\u2019d gifted me with a new dress for the occasion, a gorgeous dove gray gown with a beaded bodice and lightly layered diaphanous skirt that drifted like smoke when I moved.</p><p>Because of the plunging neckline\u2014which I knew from experience would bring out his inner caveman\u2014I\u2019d chosen a bra designed to put my boobs on display. Together with the matching underwear, smoky eyes, and glossy lips, I looked like expensive sex.</p><p>When I faced him again, my husband was just how I wanted him\u2014frozen in place with his eyes on me.</p><p>\u201cI need you to promise me something, ace.\u201d</p> <p>He raked me from head to toe with a scorching glance. \u201cAt the moment, I\u2019ll promise you anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust this moment?\u201d I pouted.</p><p>He muttered something and walked over to me, cupping my face in his hands. Finally, he was with me. One hundred percent. \u201cAnd the next, and the next after that.\u201d His gaze caressed my face. \u201cWhat do you need, angel mine?\u201d</p><p>I caught him by the hips, searched his eyes. \u201cYou. Just you. Happy and whole and madly in love with me.\u201d The elegant arch of his brows lifted slightly, as if being happy seemed like a dubious proposition. \u201cYou\u2019re so sad. It\u2019s killing me.\u201d</p><p>A soft sigh left him and I watched the tension drain away with it. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I wasn\u2019t better prepared. She\u2019s incapable of accepting what happened. If she can\u2019t do it to save her marriage, she sure as hell won\u2019t do it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something missing in her, Gideon. Something essential. Don\u2019t you dare believe this has anything to do with you.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted wryly. \u201cBetween her and my dad ... Not the greatest gene pool, is it?\u201d</p><p>Sliding my fingers into the tailored waistband of his trousers, I yanked him closer. \u201cListen, ace. Your parents both buckled under pressure and put themselves first. Reality is something they can\u2019t face. But guess what? You didn\u2019t get any of their flaws. Not a single one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEva\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, Gideon Geoffrey Cross, are the distillation of what\u2019s best about them. Individually, they don\u2019t amount to much. But together ... Man, did they hit it out of the park with you.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t need this, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not bullshitting you. You don\u2019t have any problem with reality. You face it head on and tackle that bitch to the ground.\u201d</p><p>He huffed out a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a right to be hurt and pissed, Gideon. I\u2019m pissed, too. They\u2019re not worthy of you. That doesn\u2019t make you less, it makes you more. I wouldn\u2019t have married you if you weren\u2019t a good man, someone I respect and admire. You inspire me, don\u2019t you know that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hand slid through my hair to my nape. \u201cAngel.\u201d His forehead touched mine.</p><p>I caressed his back, feeling the warm hard muscle beneath his shirt. \u201cGrieve if you have to, but don\u2019t close up and blame yourself. I won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d He nudged my head back and kissed the tip of my nose. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me for anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were right. I needed to get it out and confront her. I never would have, if not for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Gideon looked at me with such love, my breath caught. \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>His smartphone chimed with an incoming text. He pressed his lips to my forehead, then moved to the dresser to read the message. \u201cRa\u00fal\u2019s on his way with Cary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI better get dressed, then. I need you to fasten me up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlways my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Pulling the gown off its hanger, I stepped into it and slid my arms into the heavily beaded straps. My husband made quick work of the hook-and-eye fastening that rested just above the small of my back. I watched in the full-length mirror, biting my lower lip as the bodice tightened and settled into place where I\u2019d thought it would. The neckline plunged to a spot halfway between my cleavage and my navel.</p><p>It was outrageously sexy, the kind of revealing style smaller-breasted women pulled off easily. On me, it was risqu\u00e9, although the rest of the gown covered everything except my back and arms. I\u2019d decided against jewelry to tone down the effect as much as I could. Still, it was a beautiful dress and we were a young couple. We could pull it off.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s gaze met mine in the mirror. I gave him my best innocent look and waited for him to see how much of my assets he\u2019d put on display.</p><p>The storm started brewing with a faint line between his brows. That quickly progressed into a full-on scowl. He tugged at the straps from the back.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d I asked sweetly.</p> <p>His gaze narrowed. Reaching around with both hands, he slid his fingers into my cleavage and tried pushing my breasts apart to hide the curves beneath the thick straps.</p><p>I hummed and leaned against him.</p><p>Taking my shoulders, he straightened me up so he could study the fit. \u201cIt didn\u2019t look like that in the photo.\u201d</p><p>Deliberately misunderstanding him, I told him, \u201cI haven\u2019t put my heels on yet. It won\u2019t drag on the ground when I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about the bottom,\u201d he said tightly. \u201cWe need to put something in that middle part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would we do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know damned well why.\u201d He prowled over to the dresser and yanked a drawer open. A moment later, he came back and thrust a white handkerchief toward me. \u201cPut that in there.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cOh my God. You\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p> <p>But he wasn\u2019t. Reaching around from behind me, he shoved the unfolded cloth into my bodice, tucking it into either side.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I told him crossly. \u201cThat looks ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>When his hands fell away, I gave him a second to see how stupid it looked. \u201cForget it. I\u2019ll wear something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he agreed, nodding and shoving his hands in his pockets.</p><p>I tugged the handkerchief out.</p><p>\u201cSomething like this,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Sparks of fire shot out of his hands as he reached over my head and wrapped a dazzling diamond choker around my neck. At least two inches wide, it hugged the base of my throat and glittered as if lit from within.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d I touched it with trembling fingers as he fastened it securely. \u201cIt\u2019s ... gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>His arms wrapped around my waist, his lips touching my temple. \u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous. The necklace is just pretty.\u201d</p><p>I turned in his embrace and looked up at him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The quick flash of his smile made my toes curl into the carpet.</p><p>Smiling back, I said, \u201cI thought you were serious about my boobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel, I take your tits very seriously. So tonight, when someone ogles them, they\u2019ll realize you\u2019re much too expensive and they couldn\u2019t possibly afford you.\u201d</p><p>I smacked his shoulder. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my hand and pulled me to the dresser. He reached into the open drawer and pulled out a diamond cuff. I watched, stunned, as he slid it around my wrist. That was followed by a velvet box, which he opened to show me the diamond teardrop earrings inside. \u201cYou should put these on yourself.\u201d</p><p>I gaped at them, then at him.</p><p>Gideon just smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re priceless. The necklace alone wasn\u2019t going to get the message across.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Staring at him, I couldn\u2019t find the words to say anything.</p><p>My silence turned his smile into a wicked grin. \u201cWhen we get home, I\u2019m going to fuck you while you\u2019re wearing diamonds and nothing else.\u201d</p><p>The erotic image that popped into my mind sent a shiver through me.</p><p>Catching my shoulders, he turned me around and swatted my ass. \u201cYou look sensational. From every angle. Now, stop distracting me and let me get ready.\u201d</p> <p>I grabbed my sparkly heels off the shoe rack and left the closet, more dazzled by my husband than by the jewels he\u2019d given me.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a million dollars.\u201d Cary pulled back from my hug and checked me out. \u201cActually, I think you\u2019re wearing a million dollars. Jesus. I was so blinded by your bling I almost missed that you\u2019d let your girls come out and play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Gideon\u2019s point,\u201d I said dryly, giving a turn to set the skirt of my gown drifting around my legs. \u201cYou, of course, are gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>He gave me his famous bad-boy grin. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I had to laugh. I thought most men looked good in a tuxedo. Cary, however, looked amazing. Very dapper. Like a Rock Hudson or Cary Grant. The combination of his roguish charm and stunning good looks made him irresistible. He\u2019d put on a little weight. Not enough to change his clothing size, but enough to fill out his face a little more. He looked good and healthy, which was rarer than it should be.</p> <p>Gideon, on the other hand, was more ... 007. Lethally sexy, with a refined edge of danger. He entered the living room and I could only stare helplessly, riveted by the graceful elegance of his chiseled body, that easy commanding stride which hinted at how amazing he was in bed.</p><p>Mine. All mine.</p><p>\u201cI put Lucky in his crate,\u201d he said, joining us. \u201cWe ready?\u201d</p><p>Cary gave a decisive nod. \u201cLet\u2019s hit it.\u201d</p><p>We took the elevator down to the garage, where Angus waited with the limo. I climbed in first and chose the long bench, knowing Cary would sit beside me while Gideon took his usual seat in the back.</p><p>I\u2019d had so little time with Cary lately. Fashion Week had kept him super busy, and since I was spending the nights at the penthouse, we didn\u2019t even have a chance for quick chats in the evening or coffee in the morning.</p> <p>Cary looked at Gideon and gestured at the bar before we rolled out. \u201cYou mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither of you want something?\u201d</p><p>I considered. \u201cKingsman and cranberry, please.\u201d</p><p>Gideon shot me a warm look. \u201cI\u2019ll have the same.\u201d</p><p>Cary poured and served, then sat back with a beer and took a deep pull straight out of the bottle. \u201cSo,\u201d he began, \u201cI\u2019m flying to London next week for a shoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I sat forward. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, Cary! Your first international job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He smiled into his beer, then looked at me. \u201cI\u2019m stoked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow. Everything has happened so fast for you.\u201d A few months ago we\u2019d still been living in San Diego. \u201cYou\u2019re going to take the world by storm.\u201d</p><p>I managed a smile. I was truly, genuinely happy for my best friend. But I could picture a time, in the not-so-distant future, when we\u2019d both be so busy and traveling so often we would rarely see each other. It made my eyes sting to think of it. We were closing a chapter of our lives and I mourned a little for the end, even knowing that the best was yet to come for both of us.</p><p>Cary raised his bottle in a silent toast. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Tatiana?\u201d</p><p>His smile grew tight, his eyes hard. \u201cShe says she\u2019s dating someone. She moves quick when she sees something she likes, always has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He started peeling the label off his beer bottle. \u201cSome dude\u2019s blowing his load where my baby is. I think that\u2019s sick.\u201d He glanced at Gideon. \u201cCan you imagine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one wants me imagining that,\u201d he answered, in that even tone that screamed danger.</p><p>\u201cRight? It\u2019s fucked up. But I can\u2019t stop her and I\u2019m not getting back together with her, so ... It is what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d I reached for his hand and held it. \u201cThat\u2019s tough. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re being civil to each other,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cShe\u2019s less of a bitch when she\u2019s getting laid regularly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you guys are talking a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI check in with her every day, make sure she\u2019s got what she needs. Told her I was good for whatever\u2014except my dick, of course.\u201d He heaved out his breath. \u201cIt\u2019s depressing. Without sex, we really don\u2019t have anything to say to each other. So we talk about work. We\u2019ve got that in common, at least.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you tell her about London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d Cary squeezed my hand. \u201cHad to tell my best girl first. I\u2019ll tell her tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I debated bringing up the question, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. \u201cAnd Trey? Anything there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I send him a text or photo every couple days. Stupid shit. Stuff I\u2019d send you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo no dick pics?\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cYeah, no. I\u2019m trying to keep it real with him. He thinks I\u2019m oversexed\u2014which he totally doesn\u2019t mind when he\u2019s in bed with me\u2014but whatever. I send him something every now and then, and he replies, but that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>My nose wrinkled. I looked at Gideon and found him typing something into his phone.</p><p>Cary took another drink, his throat working on a hard swallow. \u201cIt\u2019s not a relationship. Not even friendship at this point. For all I know, he could be seeing someone, too, and I\u2019m the odd man out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for what it\u2019s worth, celibacy looks good on you.\u201d</p> <p>He snorted. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve put on a few pounds? Happens. You eat, because you crave the endorphins you\u2019re not getting with an orgasm, and you get less exercise, because you\u2019re not practicing any mattress gymnastics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCary.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cLook at you, baby girl. You\u2019re all tight and toned from Marathon Man Cross over there.\u201d</p><p>Gideon looked up from his phone. \u201cCome again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I just said, dude,\u201d Cary drawled, winking at me. \u201cIn so many words.\u201d</p><p>After waiting in a line of limos discharging their passengers, we finally pulled up to the red carpet rolled out in front of a historic brick-faced building, home to a private members-only club. Paparazzi were as thick as fall leaves on the ground, lining the velvet ropes that cordoned them off from the walkway.</p> <p>Leaning forward, I looked through the open glass entrance doors and saw more photographers held back on the right side of the entrance, while logoed backdrops lined the wall on the left for event and sponsor-branded photo ops.</p><p>Angus opened the door and I could feel the momentary expectation as the paparazzi waited to see who would step out. The moment Gideon did, it was like the mother of all lightning storms, camera flashes exploding in rapid, endless succession.</p><p>Mr. Cross! Gideon! Look this way!</p><p>He held his hand out to me, the rubies in his wedding band catching the light and glittering. Holding my skirt up with one hand, I made my way over to him and set my hand in his. The moment I stepped out, I was blinded, but I kept my eyes open despite the spots dancing across my vision, a practiced smile pasted on my lips.</p><p>I straightened, Gideon\u2019s hand settled on the small of my back, and pandemonium ensued. It somehow managed to get worse when Cary appeared. The shouts became deafening. I spotted Ra\u00fal by the entrance, his hard gaze sweeping the melee. He lifted his arm and spoke into his wrist mic, coordinating with someone under his command. When he looked at me, my smile turned genuine. He gave me a brisk nod.</p><p>Inside, we were met by two event handlers, who kept the required photo op moving along quickly, then escorted us up an elevator to the ballroom floor.</p><p>We stepped into a vast space filled with New York\u2019s elite, a glamorous assembly of powerful men and perfectly presented women displayed to flattering effect by dimmed chandelier lighting and a profusion of candlelight. The atmosphere was heavily fragranced by the massive floral arrangements centering each dining table and enlivened by a society orchestra playing upbeat instrumentals through the hum of conversation.</p><p>Gideon steered me through the groups of people clustered around the dining tables, pausing often for those who stepped into our path with greetings and congratulations. My husband had slid effortlessly, seamlessly into his public persona. Splendidly handsome, completely at ease, quietly commanding, coolly aloof.</p> <p>I, however, was stiff and edgy, though I hoped that practiced smile hid my nervousness. Gideon and I didn\u2019t have a good track record at events like these. We ended up fighting and leaving separately. Things were different now, but still ...</p><p>His hand slid up my bared back and cupped my nape, kneading the tense muscles gently. He continued to speak to the two gentlemen who\u2019d intercepted us, discussing market fluctuations, but I was instinctively certain that he was focused on me. I stood to his right and he shifted smoothly, sliding just a bit behind me so that the right side of his body touched my back from shoulder to knee.</p><p>Cary reached around my shoulder and passed me a chilled flute of champagne. \u201cI see Monica and Stanton,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019ll let them know we\u2019re here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I followed his direction as he closed in on where my mom stood beside her husband, her smile bright and beautiful as they talked with another couple. Stanton was elegantly handsome in his tuxedo, while my mother gleamed like a pearl in an off-white silk column dress.</p><p>\u201cEva!\u201d</p><p>I turned at the sound of Ireland\u2019s voice, my eyes widening as I found her rounding the nearest table. For a moment, my brain stopped processing anything but the sight of her. She was tall and willowy, her long black hair artfully arranged in a chic updo. The side slit in her sophisticated black velvet gown showed off mile-long legs, while the single-shoulder bodice cupped breasts that were the perfect size for her slender frame.</p><p>Ireland Vidal was a stunningly beautiful girl, her thickly lashed eyes the same striking blue as her mother\u2019s and Gideon\u2019s. And she was only seventeen. Picturing her as the woman she would become was breathtaking. Cary wasn\u2019t the only one who was going to set the world on fire.</p> <p>She walked right into me, hugging me tight. \u201cWe\u2019re sisters now!\u201d</p><p>I smiled and hugged her back, careful not to spill my champagne on her. I glanced at Chris, who stood behind her, and he gave me a grin in return. The look in his eyes when they returned to his daughter was both tender and proud. God help the guys who set their sights on Ireland. With Chris, Christopher, and Gideon watching out for her, they would have some formidable men to get through first.</p><p>Ireland pulled back and checked me out. \u201cWow. That necklace is amazing! And your boobs! I want a pair of those.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect just the way you are. You\u2019re the most beautiful woman here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. But thanks.\u201d Her face lit up as Gideon excused himself from the conversation and turned to face her. \u201cHey, bro.\u201d</p> <p>She was in his arms in an instant, hugging him as tightly as she\u2019d hugged me. Gideon stood statue-still for a moment. Then he hugged her back, his face softening in a way that made my heart skip a beat.</p><p>I\u2019d spoken to Ireland briefly on the phone after Gideon\u2019s interview, apologizing for keeping the secret of our wedding and explaining why. I wanted us to be closer than we were, but I was holding off on making too many overtures. It would be so easy to become the bridge between her and Gideon, and I didn\u2019t want it that way. They needed to have their own connection, independent of anyone else.</p><p>My sister-in-law would be attending Columbia University soon, like her brothers before her. She\u2019d be close and we\u2019d see each other more often. Until then, I would continue to encourage Gideon to foster their budding relationship.</p><p>\u201cChris.\u201d I went to him and gave him a hug, pleased with the enthusiasm with which he hugged me back. He\u2019d cleaned up since coming over to dinner, his hair freshly trimmed and his jaw clean-shaven.</p><p>Christopher Vidal Sr. was a quietly handsome man with a gentle gaze. There was an innate kindness in him that radiated in his voice and the way he looked at people. I\u2019d thought so the first time I met him, and he\u2019d done nothing to alter that first impression.</p><p>\u201cGideon. Eva.\u201d Magdalene Perez joined us, looking seductively beautiful in a sleek, emerald green gown, her arm linked with her boyfriend\u2019s.</p> <p>It was good to see that Magdalene had moved on from her unrequited interest in Gideon, which had caused problems for Gideon and me when our relationship was just getting started. She\u2019d been a bitter, nasty bitch then, spurred on by Gideon\u2019s brother\u2019s manipulations. Now that she was happy with her artist, she was serene and lovely and was slowly becoming a close acquaintance.</p><p>Greeting them both warmly, I shook Gage Flynn\u2019s hand as Gideon kissed Magdalene\u2019s proffered cheek. I didn\u2019t know Gage all that well yet, but he was obviously head over heels for Magdalene. And I knew that Gideon would\u2019ve checked him out, making sure the guy was good enough for the woman who\u2019d been a longtime friend of Gideon\u2019s family.</p><p>We were accepting their congratulations when my mother and Stanton joined us, followed by Martin and Lacey, whom we hadn\u2019t seen since the weekend in Westport. I watched with a smile as Cary and Ireland both laughed about something shared between them.</p><p>\u201cWhat a beautiful girl,\u201d my mother said, sipping champagne and eyeing Gideon\u2019s sister.</p><p>\u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Cary looks good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said the same thing.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me with a smile. \u201cYou should know that we\u2019ve offered to let him keep the apartment if he likes or help him find something smaller.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d My gaze went to him, catching him nodding at something Chris told him. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019d offered him a private apartment adjoining Gideon\u2019s penthouse.\u201d She angled toward me. \u201cYou\u2019ll all decide what works best for you, but I wanted to give him the option to stay where he is. It\u2019s always good to have options.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sighed, then nodded.</p><p>She reached for my hand. \u201cNow, you and Gideon are handling your public image in your own way, but you have to be aware of what those horrible gossip blogs are saying about you and Cary being lovers.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, the frenzy on the red carpet made sense. The three of us, arriving together.</p><p>\u201cGideon denied that he\u2019s ever cheated on you,\u201d she went on quietly, \u201cbut he\u2019s now known to have, shall we say ... adventurous sexual appetites. Can you imagine how rumors will fly if the three of you are living together?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, man.\u201d Yeah, I could. The world had seen in graphic detail that my husband was up for a threesome. Not with another man in the mix, but even so. Those days were behind him, but they didn\u2019t know that\u2014and wouldn\u2019t want to believe it anyway. It was just too salacious.</p><p>\u201cBefore you say you don\u2019t care, honey, realize that many people do. And if someone Gideon wants to do business with thinks he\u2019s morally corrupt, it could cost him a fortune.\u201d</p><p>Really. These days, not likely, but I bit my tongue instead of making a crack about my mom\u2019s concern about the bottom line. It always came down to that, in one way or another. \u201cI hear you,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>As the time approached for the start of dinner, everyone began searching for their assigned tables. Gideon and I were at the front, of course, since he was speaking. Ireland and Chris had place cards at our table, as did Cary. My mom, Stanton, Martin, and Lacey were at the table to our right; Magdalene and Gage were further back.</p><p>Gideon pulled my chair out for me and I moved to sit, then stopped, startled by the couple I spotted a few tables away. Straightening, I looked at Gideon. \u201cThe Lucases are here.\u201d</p> <p>His head went up, his gaze searching. I knew the moment he spotted them by the way his jaw hardened. \u201cSo they are. Sit down, angel.\u201d</p><p>I sat and he pushed my chair in, taking a seat beside me. He pulled out his phone and typed out a quick text.</p><p>Leaning toward him, I whispered, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen them together before.\u201d</p><p>His phone buzzed with a reply as he looked up at me. \u201cThey don\u2019t go out as a couple often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you texting Arash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngus.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh? About the Lucases?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck \u2019em.\u201d He slid his phone back into his jacket and leaned toward me, draping one arm along the back of my chair and the other on the table, caging me in. He put his lips next to my ear. \u201cNext time we come to one of these, I\u2019m putting you in a short skirt and you\u2019re going to be naked underneath.\u201d</p><p>I was grateful everyone else was looking elsewhere and couldn\u2019t possibly hear\u2014and that the orchestra was playing a little louder to keep all the guests moving toward their seats. \u201cYou\u2019re a fiend.\u201d</p><p>His voice dropped into a seductive purr. \u201cI\u2019m going to slide my hand between your thighs and slip my fingers into your soft, sweet cunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon!\u201d Scandalized, I glanced at him and found him watching me with a feral grin and lustful eyes.</p><p>\u201cAll through dinner, angel,\u201d he murmured, nuzzling against my temple, \u201cI\u2019m going to be finger-fucking you slow and easy, working that tight perfect pussy of yours until you come for me. Again and again ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d His low, rough voice was pure sin and sex. I shivered just from that, but his dirty talk had me sagging into my chair. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d</p><p>He pressed a quick, hard kiss against my cheek and straightened. \u201cYou were all knotted up. Now, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>If we\u2019d been totally alone, I would\u2019ve smacked him. I told him so.</p><p>\u201cYou love me,\u201d he shot back, turning to glance around the ballroom as servers began to bring out the salads.</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>He focused on me again. \u201cYes. Madly.\u201d</p><p>No point in arguing. He was right.</p><p>We were just being served dessert, a dome of chocolate cake that looked delicious, when a woman in a conservative navy gown came over to our table and crouched between Gideon and me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to begin the program in about fifteen minutes,\u201d she said. \u201cGlen\u2019s going to speak for a few minutes, then we\u2019ll have you come up.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cNo problem. I\u2019m ready whenever you are.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and I could tell she was a little flustered being that close to him. She had to be at least his mother\u2019s age, but then women of all ages appreciated a gorgeous man.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d Ireland leaned toward me. \u201cYou want to take a break before he goes up?\u201d</p><p>I understood what she meant. \u201cOf course.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gideon and Chris pushed back from the table and pulled out our chairs. Since I\u2019d lost all my lip gloss while eating and drinking, I pressed a kiss to my husband\u2019s jaw.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear you talk,\u201d I told him, my smile wide with anticipation.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThe things that turn you on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do. Madly.\u201d</p><p>Following Ireland, I weaved through the tables, passing directly by the Lucases. They watched us, looking cozy, with Dr. Terrence Lucas\u2019s arm slung around his wife\u2019s shoulders. Anne caught my gaze and flashed a sharp smile that made my skin crawl.</p><p>I reached up and smoothed my middle finger over my brow in a subtle but obvious fuck you.</p><p>Ireland and I had moved a few tables farther when she abruptly stopped in front of me.</p><p>I bumped into her back. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p> <p>When she didn\u2019t continue forward, I angled around her to see what was blocking our way. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She turned to look at me. Her eyes were bright with tears. \u201cIt\u2019s Rick,\u201d she said, her voice wavering.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d My brain scrambled to catch up. She looked so hurt. And lost. The connection suddenly clicked. \u201cYour boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>She turned her head forward again and I tried to track her attention, searching the packed tables for ... someone. \u201cWhere? What does he look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight there.\u201d She gave a hard jerk of her chin and I spotted tears running down her face. \u201cWith the blonde in the red dress.\u201d</p><p>Where? I found a few possibilities, then zeroed in on the youngest couple. One look at him and I knew the type. I used to fall for them, too. Confident, sexually experienced, all the right lines. I felt a bit sick thinking about how many guys like that I\u2019d once let use me.</p> <p>Then I got pissed. Rick was giving the girl plastered to his side a cocky, sexy smile. They certainly weren\u2019t just friends. Not when they were both eye-fucking each other.</p><p>I caught Ireland by the elbow and guided her forward. \u201cKeep walking.\u201d</p><p>We got to the ladies\u2019 room. The sudden quiet when we stepped inside made it possible to hear her sobbing. I pulled her aside in the vanity area, thankful we were the only ones there, and handed her some tissues I pulled out of the box on the counter.</p><p>\u201cHe told me he had to work tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I said yes when Dad asked me if I wanted to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the guy who won\u2019t tell his parents about you because of Gideon\u2019s father?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re out there. Sitting with him.\u201d</p><p>It was coming back to me, that conversation we\u2019d had during the launch of the Six-Ninths music video. Rick\u2019s grandparents had lost a chunk of their wealth to Geoffrey Cross\u2019s Ponzi scheme. They thought it was \u201cconvenient\u201d that Gideon was one of the wealthiest men in the world now, even though it was evident to anyone who looked that he\u2019d built his empire with his own hard work and capital.</p><p>But then, Rick was probably just making excuses to juggle multiple dates. After all, his parents were here and Gideon was the star attraction. Made me question whether the animosity he\u2019d told her about was bullshit.</p> <p>\u201cHe told me he\u2019d broken up with her months ago!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cThe blonde?\u201d</p><p>Sniffling, she nodded again. \u201cI just saw him last night. He didn\u2019t say anything about getting the night off and coming here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you mention that you would be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t talk about Gideon. Not with him, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Was Rick just a young, dumb kid getting his rocks off with every pretty girl who\u2019d let him? Or was he screwing with Gideon\u2019s sister as some sort of twisted payback? In any case, the guy was a douche.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry over that loser, Ireland.\u201d I got her more tissue. \u201cDon\u2019t give him the satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to go home.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to help. Honestly, nothing\u2019s going to help. It\u2019s going to hurt for a while. But you can get back at him if you want to. That might feel good.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me, tears still streaming. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got one of the hottest male models in New York sitting by you. Just say the word and Cary will become your very attentive, very crazy-about-you date.\u201d The more I thought of it, the more I liked it. \u201cTogether you can run into Rick and oops ... well, hellooo. Fancy seeing you here. But what can he say? He\u2019s got the blonde. And you get to walk away with an even score.\u201d</p><p>Ireland started shaking. \u201cMaybe I should just talk to him ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Magdalene stepped into the ladies\u2019 room and paused, assessing the situation. \u201cIreland. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I kept my mouth shut, since it wasn\u2019t my story to share.</p><p>Ireland shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Magdalene looked at me. \u201cI won\u2019t pry, but you should know that I\u2019d never share anything with your brothers if you told me not to.\u201d</p> <p>It took her a moment, and then Ireland spoke through her tears. \u201cThis guy I\u2019ve been seeing for a couple months now ... he\u2019s out there with someone else. His old girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Personally, I suspected Rick had never broken up with that girlfriend to begin with and had been stringing Ireland along on the side, but then I was cynical about things like that.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Magdalene\u2019s face softened in sympathy. \u201cMen can be such assholes. Look, if you want to slip out without him noticing, I\u2019ll order a car for you.\u201d She snapped open her clutch and took out her smartphone. \u201cOn me. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d I interjected. I laid out my plan.</p><p>Magdalene\u2019s brows rose. \u201cDevious. Why get mad when you can get even?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know ...\u201d Ireland glanced at the mirror and cursed. She grabbed more tissues and worked on fixing her eye makeup. \u201cI look like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look a million times better than that tramp out there,\u201d I told her.</p><p>She gave a watery laugh. \u201cI hate her, too. She\u2019s such a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet she\u2019s admired some of Cary\u2019s Grey Isles ads,\u201d Magdalene said. \u201cI know I have.\u201d</p><p>That did the trick. While Ireland wasn\u2019t ready yet to completely write off Rick, she was certainly open to making his date envious.</p><p>The rest would come in time. Hopefully.</p> <p>Then again, there were some lessons we women had to learn the hard way.</p><p>We made it back to our table just as a gentleman I assumed was Glen headed up the stairs onto the stage and crossed over to the lectern. I knelt by Cary, setting my hand on his arm.</p><p>He glanced down at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>I explained what I wanted him to do and why.</p><p>His grin flashed white in the dimmed lighting. \u201cSure thing, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best, Cary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they all say.\u201d</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I stood and headed back to my chair, which Gideon pulled out for me. My cake was still there and I eyed it eagerly.</p> <p>\u201cThey tried to take that,\u201d Gideon murmured. \u201cI defended it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww. Thank you, baby. You\u2019re so good to me.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand on my thigh beneath the table and gave it a soft squeeze.</p><p>I watched my husband while I ate, admiring Gideon\u2019s air of calm relaxation as we both listened to Glen talk about the importance of the work his organization did in the city. Whenever I thought about giving speeches on behalf of Crossroads, I got butterflies in my stomach. But I\u2019d eventually get the hang of it, figure things out. I would learn what I needed to know to be an asset to both my husband and Cross Industries.</p><p>We had time and I had Gideon\u2019s love. The rest would fall into place.</p><p>\u201cIt is our pleasure to honor a man who truly needs no introduction\u2014\u201d</p><p>Putting my fork down, I sat back and listened as Glen extolled my husband\u2019s many accomplishments and his generous commitment to causes that benefited victims of sexual abuse. It didn\u2019t escape my notice that Chris was watching Gideon with a new understanding in his gaze. And pride. The look he gave my husband was no different from the one I\u2019d seen him give Ireland.</p><p>The room exploded into applause as Gideon rose lithely to his feet. I stood, too, along with Chris, Cary, and Ireland. The rest of the room followed suit, until a full standing ovation welcomed Gideon to the stage. He glanced at me before he walked away, his fingers brushing the ends of my hair.</p><p>Seeing him traverse the stage was its own pleasure. His stride was smooth and unhurried, but it commanded attention. Gracefully powerful, he moved so beautifully it was a joy to watch him.</p><p>He set the plaque they\u2019d given him atop the lectern, his tanned hands in notable contrast to the white of his cuffs. Then he began speaking, his dynamic baritone smooth and cultured, making each word a separate caress. There was no other sound in the room, everyone riveted by his dark good looks and consummate oration.</p><p>It was over too quickly. I was on my feet again the moment he picked up the plaque, my hands clapping so hard my palms hurt. They directed him to the side of the stage, where a photographer waited with Glen. Gideon spoke to them, then looked at me, beckoning me to him with an outstretched hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He met me at the bottom of the stairs, offering his arm to help me navigate the ascent in my dress and heels.</p><p>\u201cI am so hot for you right now,\u201d I told him softly.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cFiend.\u201d</p><p>We danced for an hour after the dinner was over.</p> <p>Why didn\u2019t I dance with my husband more often? He was as skilled and sexual on the dance floor as he was in bed, his body moving with fluid strength, his lead confident and expertly assertive.</p><p>Gideon was intimately familiar with how we flowed together and used that to his advantage, taking every opportunity to slide his body against mine. I was wildly aroused and he was aware, his gaze on my face both hot and knowing.</p><p>When I could tear my attention away from him, I spotted Cary dancing with Ireland. He had scoffed when I first asked him to take dancing lessons with me, but he\u2019d come around and quickly become our instructor\u2019s favorite. He was a natural and he easily led Ireland, despite her inexperience.</p><p>A flamboyant dancer, Cary claimed a wide space on the floor, which made him and Ireland the focus of much attention. He, however, only had eyes for his partner, playing the part of a completely spellbound date to perfection. Even heartbroken, Ireland couldn\u2019t help but be charmed by his unwavering, focused attention. I saw her laugh often, her cheeks prettily flushed with exertion.</p><p>I\u2019d missed that oops moment with Rick I\u2019d hoped to witness, but I saw the result. He was dancing with his girlfriend, woefully unable to compete with Cary in either skill or looks. There was no more smiling or eye-fucking, since both he and the blonde kept glancing at Cary and Ireland, who were clearly having far more fun.</p> <p>Terrence and Anne Lucas danced, too, but were wise enough to stay on the other side of the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d Gideon murmured, as the song ended and we slowed to a halt, \u201cand put some sweat on those diamonds.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>We went back to our table to retrieve his plaque and my clutch.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll head out with you,\u201d Stanton said, joining us with my mother beside him.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Cary?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cMartin will take him home,\u201d my mother answered. \u201cThey\u2019re all still enjoying themselves.\u201d</p><p>It took us just as long to leave as it\u2019d taken us to arrive, with so many people catching Gideon and Stanton for the first time all evening. I could only say thank you to congratulations, but my mother occasionally spoke with authority, adding brief but incisive comments to things Stanton discussed. I envied her that knowledge and was inspired by it. We\u2019d have to talk about that when the time presented itself.</p><p>The plus side of being delayed for so long was that it gave time for the cars to be brought around. When we finally made it down to street level, Ra\u00fal informed us that the limo was only a block away. Clancy shot me a quick smile before he told my mom and Stanton their car was pulling up now.</p><p>Paparazzi waited outside. Not as many as before, but more than a dozen.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get together tomorrow,\u201d my mom said, giving me a hug in the lobby.</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d I pulled back. \u201cI could use a day at the spa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a lovely idea.\u201d Her smile was brilliant. \u201cI\u2019ll make the arrangements.\u201d</p><p>I hugged Stanton good-bye; Gideon shook his hand. We stepped outside and the camera flashes burst around us. The city welcomed us outdoors with the sounds of late-evening traffic and the gentle warmth of the evening. The humidity was slowly receding as summer gave way to fall and I looked forward to spending more time outdoors. Autumn in New York was a unique enchantment, something I\u2019d only enjoyed previously during short visits.</p> <p>Get down!</p><p>The shout barely registered before Gideon tackled me. A loud crack of sound jolted through me, reverberating off the brick and ringing in my ears. Deafeningly close ... Jesus. Right beside us.</p><p>We hit the carpeted pavement hard. Gideon rolled, covering me with his body. More weight as someone threw themselves over Gideon. Another bark of noise. Then another. Another ...</p><p>Crushed. Too heavy. Breathe. My lungs couldn\u2019t expand. My head pounded. Oxygen. God.</p><p>I struggled. Clawing at the red carpet. Gideon clutched me tighter. His voice was harsh in my ear, the words lost beneath the frantic buzzing in my head.</p><p>Air. Can\u2019t breathe ... The world went black.</p><p>14</p><p>\u201cChrist. Eva.\u201d I ran frantic hands over her limp form, searching for injury as the driver hit the gas pedal hard and the limo lurched forward, slamming me back into the seat.</p><p>My wife lay deathly still across my lap, unresponsive to my desperate examination. No blood on her gown or skin. A pulse, hard and quick. Her chest lifting and falling with each breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Relief hit me so hard I felt dizzy.

Clancy got him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas anyone hurt?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMonica Stanton went down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My slowing heartbeat lurched back into a pounding rhythm. I looked down at my wife as she slowly came to \u0327 her eyelids fluttering. \u201cJesus. How bad?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled harshly. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for word. It didn\u2019t look good. You grabbed Mrs. Cross and Mrs. Stanton moved into the way.\u201d</p><p>Eva.</p><p>I held my wife tighter, running my hand over her hair as we sped through the city.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Eva\u2019s soft question as we turned the corner that led to the garage knotted my stomach. Ra\u00fal looked at me, his face grim. Only moments before he\u2019d taken a call and met my gaze, confirming my worst fear with a shake of his head and a quietly voiced I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>My wife\u2019s mother was dead.</p><p>How was I supposed to tell Eva? And after I did, how could I keep her safe until we knew what the hell was going on?</p><p>In my jacket pocket, my phone buzzed constantly. Calls. Messages. I needed to get to them all, but my wife came first.</p><p>We pulled into the garage, driving past the guard in the glass cubicle. My foot tapped restlessly on the floorboard. I wanted out of the car. I needed my wife locked down.</p> <p>\u201cGideon?\u201d She clutched at my jacket. \u201cWhat happened? I heard gunshots\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalse alarm,\u201d I said gruffly, my grip on her too tight. \u201cA car backfired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Really?\u201d She blinked up at me, wincing as I pulled her even closer. \u201cOww.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I\u2019d taken her down hard, unable to break the fall for her without exposing her to danger. It had been instinctual, an abrupt response to the urgency in Ra\u00fal\u2019s voice. \u201cI overreacted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor real?\u201d She tried to sit up. \u201cI thought I heard multiple shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe death of a few cameras, maybe. A few people got startled, dropped their gear.\u201d</p><p>The car slowed to a halt and Ra\u00fal leapt out, extending his hand to Eva to help her. She climbed out slowly and I was directly behind her, scooping her up into my arms the moment I straightened.</p><p>I strode to the garage elevator, waited while Ra\u00fal typed in the code. One of his team stood behind us, facing the other direction, his hand in his jacket on his gun as he surveilled.</p> <p>Would he be enough if there was another shooter lying in wait?</p><p>\u201cHey, I can walk,\u201d Eva said, still punchy, her arms around my shoulders. \u201cAnd you need to answer your phone. That thing\u2019s going crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute.\u201d I stepped into the elevator. \u201cYou passed out. Scared the shit out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>Kissing her forehead, I apologized again. I wouldn\u2019t feel safe until we stepped into our living room. I glanced at Ra\u00fal. \u201cI\u2019ll be out shortly.\u201d</p><p>I took my wife directly to the bedroom, laying her down atop the comforter. Lucky barked in his crate, pawing at the door.</p><p>\u201cThat was so weird.\u201d Eva shook her head. \u201cWhere\u2019s my clutch? I want to call Mom. Did Clancy freak out, too?\u201d</p><p>My gut knotted. I\u2019d promised to never lie to my wife and I knew this lie was going to hurt her badly. Hurt us. But ... God. How the fuck did I tell her? And if I did, how could I keep her home when she\u2019d want to go out and see the truth for herself ?</p><p>Lucky\u2019s plaintive whines only ratcheted up my anxiety.</p><p>\u201cI think we left your purse in the car.\u201d I brushed the hair back from her forehead, fighting the tremor that wanted to rack my entire body. \u201cI\u2019ll have someone get it and bring it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Can I use your phone for now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you settled first. Are you hurting? Bruised?\u201d I shot a glare at Lucky, but that only made him paw the metal bars more furiously.</p><p>She poked at her hip and winced. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. We\u2019ll take care of that.\u201d</p><p>I went to the bathroom, pulling out my phone to turn it off. The screen was an endless scroll of missed calls and texts. I watched it go black, shoved it into my pants pocket, and then turned on the taps in the bathtub. Anyone I\u2019d want to hear from could reach Ra\u00fal or Angus.</p><p>I tossed a handful of Epsom salts into the steaming water; I knew a bath was a risk considering how rare it was for me to not join Eva when she took one. Still, hot soaks relaxed her, made her calm. I suspected she took naps during the day to make up for the hours our sex life took out of the nights, but she was running a sleep deficit after the weekend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If I could just get her to wind down and get in bed, she might drift off. It would buy me some time to figure out what had happened, what risk remained, talk to Dr. Petersen ...</p><p>Fuck. And Victor. I had to call Eva\u2019s dad. Get him on a flight to New York as soon as possible. Cary. He should be here, too. Once I had more facts and a support system for my wife, then I could tell her. Just a few hours. That was all I needed.</p><p>I struggled to ignore the sick fear that Eva wouldn\u2019t forgive me for the delay.</p><p>She was letting Lucky out when I stepped back into the bedroom. A laugh escaped her at the puppy\u2019s enthusiasm. The joyous sound, one I loved so much, pierced me like a knife in the chest.</p> <p>Kissing Lucky\u2019s head, she looked at me with bright eyes. \u201cYou should put him on his puppy pad. He\u2019s been locked up awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take him.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed Lucky\u2019s head before passing him over. \u201cI hear a bath running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA soak might do you good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLimber me up?\u201d she teased. The look in her eyes ... It killed me. I almost told her, but I couldn\u2019t get the words past the lump in my throat.</p> <p>Instead, I turned away and headed down the hallway to the half bath off the living room, where Lucky\u2019s patch of fake grass was. I set him down on it, ran my hands through my hair.</p><p>Think, damn it. God, I needed a drink.</p><p>Yes. A drink. Hard liquor.</p><p>I went to the kitchen, tried to think of something strong that Eva would actually drink. A digestif, maybe? The house phone. Shit. I went to turn off the ringer and saw that someone had already thought of it. Turning back around, I spotted the coffeemaker.</p><p>Something hot. Relaxing. No caffeine.</p><p>Tea. I went the pantry and searched, shoving around the items on the shelves looking for a box of tea Angus kept at the penthouse. Some herbal crap he said smoothed the rough edges. I found it and focused, filling a mug from the instant hot water tap. I dropped two tea bags into it, a liberal pour of rum, then a scoop of honey. I stirred, spilled onto the counter. More rum.</p> <p>Tossing the tea bags into the sink, I headed back to my wife.</p><p>For an instant, when I didn\u2019t find her in the bedroom, I panicked. Then I heard her in the closet and my breath left me in a rush. I set the mug down by the bath, turned the water off, and went to her. I found her sitting on the bench, taking off her shoes.</p><p>\u201cThe dress is ruined, I think,\u201d she said, as she stood in her bare feet, showing me the tear along the left side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you another.\u201d</p><p>She flashed me a big smile. \u201cYou\u2019re spoiling me.\u201d</p><p>It was fucking torture. Every second. Every lie I told. Every truth I left unsaid.</p><p>I was flayed by the love in her eyes. The utter trust. Sweat slid down my back. I yanked my jacket off and tossed it aside, clawing at my bow tie and collar until they both came apart and let me breathe.</p><p>\u201cHelp me out of this.\u201d She turned her back to me.</p> <p>I unfastened the gown and pushed it off her shoulders, letting it fall to a puddle on the floor. Then I unhooked her bra, hearing her sigh with pleasure as its constriction eased.</p><p>Looking her over, I cursed silently at the bruise already shadowing her hip and the abrasions on her arm from the red carpet.</p><p>She yawned. \u201cWow. I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>Thank God. \u201cYou should sleep, then.\u201d</p><p>She shot me a heated look over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m not that tired.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. Being gutted couldn\u2019t hurt worse. I couldn\u2019t touch her, make love to her ... not with my deceit between us.</p><p>I swallowed hard. \u201cAll right, then. I\u2019ve got to see to some business first. And get your purse. I made a hot toddy for you. It\u2019s by the bathtub. Just relax and I\u2019ll join you as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>Unable to lie any more than I already had, I told her an irrelevant truth. \u201cI\u2019ve missed a lot of work this week. Some pressing things need to be dealt with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I know that\u2019s my fault.\u201d She kissed my jaw. \u201cLove you, ace.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing a robe off the hooks, she slid into it and walked out. I stood there, surrounded by the smell of her, my hands still tingling from the feel of her, my heart pounding with fear and self-loathing.</p><p>Lucky raced in so fast, he ricocheted off the door before barreling into my feet. I picked him up, rubbing the top of his head.</p><p>This was one nightmare he couldn\u2019t wake me from.</p><p>Ra\u00fal waited in my home office, talking briskly on his phone. I joined him, closing the door behind me.</p><p>He ended the call and stood. \u201cThe police are on scene. The gunman\u2019s in custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonica?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re waiting for the medical examiner.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t imagine it.

Thank you.\u201d</p><p>There was a knock at the door. Tensing, I expected Eva to walk in. I exhaled in relief when it was Angus instead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to head back,\u201d Ra\u00fal said. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you posted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need Eva\u2019s purse from the car. And Cary. Get him here.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded and left.</p><p>Angus settled into the seat Ra\u00fal had just vacated. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, lad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have someone else I love in the line of fire?\u201d I pushed to my feet, too restless to sit. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing you were at the Lucases\u2019.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me a moment, and then his gaze dropped to his hands.</p> <p>It took me a second to realize what I\u2019d said. Another to know that I hadn\u2019t told him I loved him before now. I hoped he\u2019d known anyway.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, his chin lifted and he looked at me again. \u201cHow\u2019s Eva?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to check on her. She\u2019s taking a bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know.\u201d I rubbed the back of my neck. \u201cI haven\u2019t told her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d His eyes were wide with the same dismay I felt. \u201cYou cannae\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat good would it do?\u201d I snapped. \u201cWe don\u2019t have answers. Her mother\u2019s gone. I can\u2019t have her going back to the scene and seeing ... that. Why torture her or put her at risk? Christ, it could\u2019ve been her! It could still be her if we don\u2019t keep her safe.\u201d</p><p>He watched me pace, with eyes that had seen\u2014and still saw\u2014too much.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make some calls.\u201d I pulled out my phone. \u201cI need to get a handle on the situation before I tell her. Try to cushion the blow as much as I can. She\u2019s been through so much\u2014\u201d My voice broke. My eyes burned.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>I pulled myself together. \u201cI need a jet available for Eva\u2019s father. I\u2019m going to call him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to it.\u201d He stood.</p><p>\u201cGive me a few minutes to break the news to him, then text him the info when you have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon ... You should know my search of the Lucas residence was successful.\u201d Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out a flash drive no bigger than a dime. \u201cShe kept this in a bedroom safe, buried beneath her jewelry in a box. She scanned all his notes.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him blankly. Anne and Hugh were the least of my concerns at the moment.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all lies,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe mentioned nothing of what really went on. What you may find of interest, when the time comes, is what he had to say about Christopher.\u201d</p><p>Setting the drive on my desktop, Angus left the room.</p><p>I stared at it. Then I went to my desk, opened a drawer, and swept the drive into it with a brush of my hand.</p><p>Turning my phone back on, I saw that there were texts and voice mails from Cary, Magdalene, Clancy, Ireland, Chris ...</p><p>Overwhelmed, I went to the home screen.</p><p>I pulled up Dr. Petersen\u2019s office in my contacts and dialed. Going through the automated menu, I selected the after-hours emergency switchboard and told the answering operator that it was very much an emergency\u2014a death was involved and the doctor needed to call me back as soon as he could.</p><p>The entire interaction was cold and clinical, especially for something so desperately personal. The grim process seemed like a terrible insult to the vibrantly beautiful wife and mother who was no longer with us. And yet I found myself wishing the next call I had to make could be accomplished with so little emotion.</p><p>As the line rang on the other end, I sank into my chair. The last time I\u2019d talked to Victor had been the call I had placed from Rio de Janeiro, when I explained that the photo of me with two women was taken before I ever met his daughter. He had received that information with chilly reserve, letting me know without saying it that I wasn\u2019t good enough for Eva. I couldn\u2019t disagree. Now, I had to tell him that the other woman he cared for had been taken from him again\u2014this time, forever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eva believed her father was still in love with her mother. If so, the news would level him. I could still taste the bile at the back of my throat and feel the icy panic that had blanked my mind in those first few moments after the shooting. There would be nothing for me without Eva.</p><p>\u201cReyes,\u201d Victor answered, sounding cool and alert. There was noise in the background, traffic maybe. Distant music. I glanced at my watch, realized he might be on duty.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Cross. I need to tell you something. Are you alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d he demanded, picking up on the gravity of my tone. \u201cHas something happened to Eva?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not Eva.\u201d Just get it out. Blunt and quick. That\u2019s how I\u2019d want to be told that my life was over. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Monica was killed tonight.\u201d</p><p>There was a terrible pause. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>My head fell back against the chair. He\u2019d heard me the first time, I could tell by his voice. But he couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry, Victor. We don\u2019t know much more than that at this time.\u201d</p><p>From his side of the call, I heard a car door open, then slam shut. There was a brief spate of transmissions from a police scanner, then eerie quiet followed and stretched out for long minutes. Still, I knew he was there.</p><p>\u201cIt happened barely an hour ago,\u201d I explained quietly, trying to bridge that silence. \u201cWe were all leaving an event. A gunman in the crowd opened fire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But the shooter was apprehended. We should have more details soon.\u201d</p><p>His voice strengthened. \u201cWhere\u2019s my daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s home with me. She won\u2019t leave here until I\u2019m certain it\u2019s safe for her to do so. I\u2019m making flight arrangements for you now. Eva will need you, Victor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s resting. You\u2019ll get a text with the information for the flight as soon as it\u2019s confirmed. It\u2019ll be one of my jets. You can speak with her in the morning when you get here.\u201d</p> <p>Victor exhaled roughly. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you shortly.\u201d</p><p>Hanging up, I thought of the other man who was a father figure for Eva. I couldn\u2019t think about what Stanton was going through; it shattered my mind. But I felt for him and was deeply sorry that anything I could offer would be inadequate.</p><p>Still, I reached out, typing a quick text. If I can be of service in any way, please let me know.</p><p>I left my office and went to the master bathroom. I paused on the threshold, everything inside me raw and aching at the sight of Eva stretched out in the steaming water with her eyes closed. Her hair was clipped up in a sexy, wild mess. The diamonds glittered on the counter. Lucky pawed at my shins.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she murmured, her eyes still closed. \u201cYou take care of everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Right now, I need to take care of you.\u201d I went to her, saw the toddy was half gone. \u201cYou should finish your drink.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes opened slowly, dreamy and soft. \u201cIt\u2019s strong. I\u2019ve got a buzz.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. Now drink the rest.\u201d</p><p>She complied. Not out of obedience but in the way a woman with a hidden agenda pretended to follow an order: because it suited her.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming in?\u201d she asked, licking her lips.</p><p>I shook my head. She pouted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done then.\u201d She rose from the tub, rivulets of water sliding over her flushed curves. She gave me a seductive smile, knowing what she was doing to me. \u201cSure you won\u2019t change your mind?\u201d</p><p>My throat worked on a hard swallow. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>With weighted steps, I grabbed a towel and handed it to her. I turned away, tormented by the sight of her, and collected first-aid items, setting the tubes and packets on the counter.</p><p>She came to me, leaning into my side. \u201cAre you okay? Still thinking about your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No.\u201d I groaned, my head bowed. \u201cWhen you passed out ... Fuck. I\u2019ve never been so scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d She slid into me, hugging me. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I gave her a quick squeeze and let her go. It pained me too much to hold her, knowing what had been left unspoken. \u201cLet me take a look and make sure.\u201d</p><p>Lucky sat with his head to the side, watching me curiously as I inspected Eva\u2019s arm. I cleaned it with an antibiotic wipe before smoothing ointment over the angry red scrape. I taped gauze over it to keep it protected. The livid bruise on her hip got a generous application of arnica, my fingers lightly swirling over the darkening skin until the gel was fully absorbed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My touch and focus aroused her, despite my best efforts.

Very sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel ... You\u2019re shredding me.\u201d I caught her hands. \u201cI\u2019ve still got some things to handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll behave. For now.\u201d</p><p>With her hand in mine, I led her into the bedroom. She protested when I pulled out a Cross Industries T-shirt and slipped it over her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the diamonds?\u201d she asked.</p><p>She might never wear them again after this night. Where the fuck was Dr. Petersen? I needed his help to say the right things in the right way when the time came.</p><p>My fingers brushed her cheek, the only touch I would allow myself. \u201cThis will be more comfortable for now.\u201d</p><p>I tucked her into bed, smoothing her hair back from her cheeks. She was going to sleep believing her world still had her mother in it and that her husband would never lie to her.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d I pressed a kiss to her forehead, wanting those words to echo in her dreams.</p><p>It was all too possible that she wouldn\u2019t believe them once she was awake.</p><p>Leaving Eva to rest, I shut the bedroom door and headed to the kitchen for a drink, something strong and smooth that might ease the cold knot in my gut.</p><p>I found Cary in the living room, sitting on the sofa with his head in his hands. Angus sat at the far end of the dining table, talking quietly on his phone.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d I asked Cary, as I passed him.</p><p>His head came up and I saw the tears. The devastation. \u201cWhere\u2019s Eva?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s trying to sleep. It\u2019s best that she does.\u201d I entered the kitchen, grabbed two tumblers and a bottle of scotch, and poured two hefty rations. I slid one over when he joined me at the island.</p><p>I tossed mine back, gulping down the contents. Closing my eyes, I felt the burn. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay in the guest room.\u201d My voice was roughened by the liquor\u2019s bite. \u201cShe\u2019s going to need you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need each other.\u201d</p><p>I poured another glass for myself. \u201cVictor\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Cary swiped at his damp eyes. \u201cStanton, man ... He aged right in front of me. Like thirty years just ran through him while I was standing there.\u201d He lifted his tumbler to his lips with a violently shaking hand.</p><p>My phone buzzed in my pocket and I pulled it out, answering it even though I didn\u2019t recognize the number. \u201cCross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon. It\u2019s Dr. Petersen. I got your message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute.\u201d I pressed the phone to my chest and looked at Cary. \u201cI have to take this.\u201d</p> <p>He waved me off, his gaze locked into the amber liquid in his glass.</p><p>I went to the bedroom and cracked open the door, relieved to find Eva fast asleep with the dog curled up next to her. Backing out, I shut myself in my office. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I needed to step away for privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. What\u2019s happened, Gideon?\u201d</p><p>Sinking into my desk chair, I dropped my head into my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s Eva\u2019s mother. There was an incident tonight. She was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonica ...\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>I remembered then that Monica was\u2014had been\u2014a patient of Dr. Petersen, too. I relayed the same information I\u2019d passed to Victor. \u201cI need you to come to my home. I need your help. I don\u2019t know how to tell Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow to ...? I\u2019m sorry, Gideon. It\u2019s late and I\u2019m confused. I assumed she was with you when it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was right by my side, but I knocked her down to get her out of the way. Knocked the breath right out of her. She passed out and when she came to, I told her it was a false alarm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gideon.\u201d He sighed heavily. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t wise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the right decision. There\u2019s nothing she can do about what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t protect her from everything, and lying is never a solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can protect her from being a target!\u201d I surged to my feet, furious that his reaction and Angus\u2019s reflected my worst fears about how Eva would respond to the choice I\u2019d made. \u201cUntil I know what the threat is, I won\u2019t have her out in the open, which is exactly where she\u2019d want to be!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her choice to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be the wrong one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRegardless, it\u2019s a decision she has a right to come to on her own.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, even though he couldn\u2019t see it. \u201cHer safety is nonnegotiable. She worries about everyone else. It\u2019s my job to worry about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could tell her your concerns,\u201d Dr. Petersen said, his voice low and soothing. \u201cExplain them to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t put her safety first.

My stomach churned, revolting against the liquor I\u2019d poured into it. But I needed someone to grasp the full extent of the horror and understand why I\u2019d made my decision. To give me some hope that Eva would understand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what would be best for her right now,\u201d I said coldly. \u201cI won\u2019t let her go there. She would be haunted for the rest of her life if she saw ... that.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet. Then, \u201cThe longer you wait, the more difficult this will be for both of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell her as soon as she wakes up. You\u2019re going to come over here and help me do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve talked to her father in California. He\u2019ll be on his way soon. And Cary\u2019s here.\u201d I paced. \u201cThey\u2019ve got some time to deal with it, so when Eva sees them, they\u2019ll be able to give her the support she needs. You\u2019ll be able to help her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not seeing that Eva\u2019s biggest source of strength and comfort is you, Gideon. And by failing to disclose something of this magnitude and being dishonest about it initially, you\u2019ve put her most depended-upon foundation on shaky ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?!\u201d I stopped in my tracks, directly in front of the photo collage of my wife. \u201cI\u2019m ... Jesus. I\u2019m terrified she won\u2019t forgive me.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Petersen\u2019s silence allowed those words to hang in the air, mocking my helplessness.</p> <p>I looked away from the images of my wife. \u201cBut I would do it again. This situation, these stakes ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. You\u2019ll need to talk to her about all of this as soon as she wakes up. Be frank about what you\u2019re feeling, and focus on that rather than logic or your rationale. She may not agree with you or see your point, but understanding the emotional impetus behind your actions will help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d I challenged.</p><p>\u201cI do, yes. Which isn\u2019t to say I wouldn\u2019t have recommended a different course of action, but I understand. I\u2019m going to give you another number where you can reach me directly.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing a pen off my desk, I wrote it down.</p><p>\u201cTalk to Eva. Afterward, if you still want me there, I\u2019ll come by. I can\u2019t promise to respond immediately,\u201d he went on, \u201cbut I\u2019ll come as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I ended the call and took a seat at my desk. There was nothing more for me to do but wait. Wait for Eva to wake up. Wait for the police. Wait for the visitors who would come and call, friends and family who would be as ineffectual as I was.</p><p>I woke my computer and sent an e-mail to Scott, telling him to clear my calendar for the rest of the week and to get in touch with the wedding planner. Informing her and others was most likely moot, considering the paparazzi were already there at the time of the shooting. There was no way to have even a single day of private grieving.</p> <p>The thought of what had to have been posted online already filled me with helpless fury. Graphic crime-scene photos. Conspiracy theories and wild speculation. The world would be looking in our windows for months to come.</p><p>I pushed the thoughts aside.</p><p>I forced myself to think of the things that would alleviate Eva\u2019s stress. I already had plans to talk to Victor, and we would discuss his family then, since they were scheduled to arrive on Friday.</p><p>My phone was in my hand before I realized it. I checked my missed calls and scrolled through my texts. There was nothing from my mother, although I had to think Chris or Ireland would have said something to her by this point. Her silence didn\u2019t surprise me as much as the text from Christopher.</p><p>Please give my condolences to Eva.</p><p>I stared at the text for a long while, tapping the screen when it dimmed to keep it lit up and in front of me. It was the word please that struck me. Such an everyday courtesy, but not one Christopher used with me.</p><p>I thought of the people I\u2019d called on Eva\u2019s behalf. Cary, who was like a brother to her. Victor, her father. Who would Eva call if our situations were reversed? Chris? Certainly not my brother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why? All these years I\u2019d wondered about that. Christopher could have meant much more to me, a link to the new family my mother had created.</p><p>Opening the drawer, I stared at the tiny flash drive that Angus had retrieved from the Lucases\u2019 home. Did it hold the answer?</p><p>Would it matter now if it did?</p><p>The moment I dreaded came much too quickly. I lay on the bed with my eyes closed, feeling the bed shift as Eva turned over, hearing her soft sigh as she settled into the new position. She would drift back into sleep if I let her. I could give her a few more hours of peace.</p> <p>But Victor\u2019s flight was on the ground in New York. The police could arrive here at any moment. Reality was going to intrude no matter how badly I wanted to hold it at bay, which meant the time I had left to break the news to my wife was winding down.</p><p>I sat up and scrubbed a hand over my face, feeling the burn of the stubble that shadowed my jaw. Then I touched her shoulder, rousing her as gently as I could.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d She rolled toward me, her eyes slumberous. \u201cYou\u2019re still dressed. Did you work all night?\u201d</p><p>I stood and turned the bedside light on, unable to discuss the situation without being on my feet. \u201cEva. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Blinking at me, she pushed up onto her elbow. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSplash some water on your face while I fix you a cup of coffee, okay? And wait here in the bedroom until I bring it to you.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cYou sound serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. And you need to be awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Tossing back the comforter, Eva got out of bed.</p><p>I grabbed Lucky and shut the bedroom door behind me, dropping him off in the bathroom before I fixed coffee for both me and Eva. New day, same routine. A few more minutes of pretending nothing had changed amounted to a different kind of lie.</p><p>When I returned to the bedroom, I found Eva pulling on a pair of pajama pants. She\u2019d pulled her hair back in a short ponytail and there was a spot of toothpaste on her T-shirt. Normal. For the moment, she was the wife I loved beyond all reason.</p> <p>She took the mug from me and breathed in the aroma, her eyes closing in pure pleasure. It was so like her, so very Eva, that my chest hurt.</p><p>I set my coffee aside, my stomach suddenly too knotted to contemplate putting anything into it. \u201cSit in that chair over there, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re starting to freak me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I touched her cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to drag this out. If you sit down, I\u2019ll explain.\u201d</p><p>Eva settled into the reading chair beneath the arched windows. The sky was turning from night to bluish gray. I turned on the light beside her, then grabbed the other chair and placed it in front of her. Holding out my hand for hers, I sat, squeezing her fingers gently.</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cI lied to you. I\u2019m going to defend that decision when I\u2019m done, but for now ...\u201d</p><p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cSpit it out, ace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right about the gunshots you heard. One of the photographers opened fire on us last night. Your mother was hit.\u201d I paused, struggled to say the words. \u201cShe didn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p> <p>Eva stared at me, her eyes big and dark in her suddenly pale face. Her hand was trembling violently when she put her coffee on the end table. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was shot, Eva.\u201d I tightened my grip on her abruptly cold hands, sensing her panic. \u201cIt was fatal. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing picked up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any answers to give you right now. They have the shooter in custody and Ra\u00fal has told me that Detectives Graves and Michna were assigned to the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re homicide cops,\u201d she said, her voice flat.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d They\u2019d been the ones to investigate Nathan Barker\u2019s death. I knew them better than I wished.</p><p>\u201cWhy would someone want to kill my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Eva. It might have been random. Could be he missed his target. We could call Graves or Michna\u2014you still have their cards, right? They might not tell us anything, but I\u2019m expecting them to come by and take our statements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I don\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><p>The fear I\u2019d been fighting all night swamped me. I\u2019d expected anger and tears. A violent explosion of emotion. Instead, she seemed disoriented. Almost lifeless.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d I released one of her hands to cup her face. \u201cCary\u2019s here, in the guest room. Your father is en route from the airport. He\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d A lone tear slid down her face. \u201cDoes he know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I told him. Cary knows, too. He was there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI need to talk to him.

Finally, \u201cTo protect you.\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze left my face, drifted off to the side. \u201cI think I knew something bad happened. I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m not surprised. But when we left ... Was she ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was already gone, Eva. I won\u2019t lie to you again\u2014I didn\u2019t know whether anyone had been hit when I got you out of there. The most important thing was to get you somewhere safe. After that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>My chest expanded, my lungs shuddered. \u201cThere was nothing you could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter now anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re in shock, Eva. Look at me.\u201d When she didn\u2019t, I scooped her up and pulled her onto my lap. Her entire body was cold. I hugged her close, trying to warm her, and she shivered.</p><p>Standing, I took her to the bed and yanked the comforter back. I sat on the edge of the mattress and pulled the blankets around us, covering her from the shoulders down. Then I rocked her, my lips pressed to her forehead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, angel. I don\u2019t know what to do. Tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer me and she didn\u2019t cry.</p><p>\u201cHave you slept at all?\u201d Chris asked softly. \u201cMaybe you should lie down for an hour or so.\u201d</p><p>I looked across my desk, startled to see my stepfather standing in front of me. I hadn\u2019t heard him come in, my thoughts somewhere else as I stared sightlessly out the window.</p> <p>Victor and Cary were in the living room with Eva, the two men barely able to talk, stunned with grief. Angus was somewhere in the building, working with the lobby staff to manage the throng of photographers and reporters camped outside the main entrance.</p><p>\u201cDid you speak to Eva?\u201d I rubbed my stinging eyes. \u201cHer father and Cary are wrecks, and she\u2019s ...\u201d</p><p>Christ. What was she? I hadn\u2019t a clue. She seemed ... detached. As if she weren\u2019t connected at all with the anguish and powerless anger pouring from two people she loved deeply.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s numb.\u201d He took a seat. \u201cIt will hit her, eventually. For now, she\u2019s dealing with it the only way she knows how.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Eventually\u2019 isn\u2019t quantifiable! I just need to know when ... how ... what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you need to take care of yourself, Gideon.\u201d His soft gaze searched my face. \u201cSo you can be strong for her when she needs you to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t let me comfort her. She\u2019s too busy worrying about everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a distraction, I\u2019m sure,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cSomething to focus on besides her own loss. And if you\u2019ll take my advice, right now you need to focus on you. It\u2019s obvious you\u2019ve been up all night.\u201d</p> <p>I gave a humorless laugh. \u201cWhat gave me away? The tux?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bloodshot eyes, the morning stubble. You don\u2019t look like the husband Eva counts on to keep it together and do everything he can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d I stood. \u201cIt just seems ... wrong to act like nothing happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. But life has to go on. And for Eva\u2014that\u2019s going to happen with you. So be you. Right now, you look as shaky as they do out there.\u201d</p><p>I was. The fact that Eva wasn\u2019t turning to me for comfort ... It was everything I had been afraid of.</p><p>But I knew he was right. If I didn\u2019t look like I could support her, how could I expect her to lean on me?</p><p>Chris rose to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll make a pot of coffee while you\u2019re in the shower. I brought food, by the way. Some pastries and sandwiches from a bakery your brother recommended. It\u2019ll be lunchtime soon.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t imagine eating anything, but it was thoughtful of him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He walked with me to the door. \u201cI\u2019m staying in the city now, as you know. Christopher is going to manage things at work for the next few days so I can help you out here. If you need anything\u2014at any time, doesn\u2019t matter\u2014just call me.\u201d</p><p>I halted. My chest was too tight. I fought for every breath.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d Chris put his hand on my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re both going to get through this.

I didn\u2019t expect it, but I\u2019m glad ....\u201d</p><p>He pulled me into a firm embrace. \u201cThen learn to expect it,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not backing off this time, Gideon.

The past was behind me. I\u2019d left it back there, shoved in a box where it belonged. I had Eva now\u2014</p><p>Damn it. I hoped I still had Eva.</p><p>My wife had never pushed me to deal with Christopher, as she had with the rest of my family.

Maybe Eva wouldn\u2019t care if I resolved my relationship with Christopher ....</p><p>But maybe she\u2019d be proud of me for trying.</p><p>And if she was, if it proved to her that I was different, that I\u2019d changed in the way she needed me to ... Son of a bitch. I had just backtracked on all the progress we\u2019d made by not telling her about Monica\u2019s death the moment I knew. If mending things with my family now would somehow help her forgive me for the lie I\u2019d told, then it was worth whatever it cost me to make the effort.</p><p>I forced my hands to relax. When I spoke, my voice was low and even. \u201cI need to show you something.\u201d</p> <p>I gestured for my stepfather to sit at my desk. When he slid the chair forward, I shook the mouse to wake the monitor. Hugh\u2019s handwritten notes filled the screen.</p><p>Chris\u2019s eyes darted from side to side, quickly reading. I knew the moment he understood what he was looking at. His spine stiffened.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how much of this is true,\u201d I cautioned. \u201cHugh\u2019s notes about his sessions with me are all lies. This reads like he was building a profile of me to use as a defense, in case we ever filed charges against him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should have.\u201d The words were bitten out between clenched teeth. \u201cHow did you get these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. What\u2019s important is that he has notes from four different sessions with Christopher. One of them was supposedly a group session with me. Either that\u2019s a fabrication or I\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich do you think it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really can\u2019t say. There are ... chunks of my childhood I can\u2019t remember.\u201d I recalled more in dreams than I did when awake.</p><p>Chris swiveled in the chair to look at me. \u201cDo you think he molested your brother?\u201d</p> <p>It took a beat for me to shove the memories away and respond. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014you\u2019ll have to ask Christopher\u2014but I doubt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dates and times on Hugh\u2019s notes put Christopher\u2019s sessions directly following mine. If those time stamps are correct\u2014which would be wise if he was covering his tracks\u2014then he wouldn\u2019t have it in him.\u201d My arms crossed. Trying to explain brought back all the bitterness. And loathing\u2014for both Hugh and myself. \u201cHe was a sick piece of shit, but\u2014listen, there\u2019s no tidy way to say this. He never had anything left after he was done with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God ... Gideon.\u201d</p><p>I turned my gaze away from the shock and simmering fury in his eyes. \u201cHugh told Christopher he was seeing me because you and Mom were afraid I would kill him.\u201d</p><p>Thinking of the other people in the penthouse was the only thing that restrained me from punching a wall. God knew I\u2019d lashed out with my fists more than once as a kid. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Remembering what I could of that time, I could see how easily Hugh\u2019s brainwashing might have taken root in the mind of a small boy whose older brother frequently had fits of rage and destruction.</p><p>\u201cChristopher wouldn\u2019t believe that,\u201d he asserted.</p><p>My shoulders lifted in a weary shrug. \u201cChristopher told me once, recently, that I\u2019d wanted him dead since the day he was born. I had no idea what he was talking about, but now ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me read,\u201d he said grimly, turning back to the monitor. \u201cGo take that shower. We\u2019ll have some coffee when you get out. Or something stronger.\u201d</p> <p>I started to leave the room but paused before I opened the door. Looking back at Chris, I saw him focused tautly on the words in front of him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know Hugh like I did,\u201d I told him. \u201cHow he could twist things around ... make you believe things ...\u201d</p><p>Chris\u2019s gaze came up and held mine. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to convince me, Gideon. Your word is enough.\u201d</p><p>I glanced away quickly. Did he have any clue what those four words meant to me? I couldn\u2019t tell him; my throat was too raw.</p><p>With a nod, I left him.</p><p>It took longer than it should have to put some goddamned clothes on. I chose with Eva in mind. The gray slacks she loved. A black V-neck T-shirt. Done.</p> <p>There was a knock at the door. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Angus filled the frame. \u201cThe detectives are on their way up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d I walked with him down the hall to the living room.</p><p>My wife sat on the couch, bundled in sweatpants and a baggy sweater with socks on her feet. Her head rested on Victor\u2019s shoulder, his cheek against the crown of her head. Her fingers stroked through Cary\u2019s hair as he sat on a pillow by her knee. Couldn\u2019t get more connected than that. The television was on, tuned to a movie none of them were watching.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze slid slowly over to me.</p> <p>I held out my hand to her. \u201cThe police are here.\u201d</p><p>Victor straightened, jarring my wife into sitting up. A brisk rap on the foyer door had everyone on alert.</p><p>Stepping closer to the couch, I kept my arm extended. Eva slowly disentangled herself and stood, her face still far too pale. She put her hand in mine and I exhaled a sigh of relief. I pulled her close, draping my arm over her shoulders and pressing a kiss to her forehead.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I said softly, walking her toward the door.</p><p>Her arms came around my waist and she leaned into me. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I turned the knob. \u201cDetectives. Please, come in.\u201d</p><p>Graves entered first, her sharp blue eyes going immediately to Eva. Michna followed, his height advantage over his partner allowing him to lock eyes with me.</p><p>He gave me a brisk nod. \u201cMr. Cross.\u201d</p> <p>Eva stepped away from me as I closed the door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re very sorry for your loss, Mrs. Cross,\u201d Graves said, in that way cops had that told you they said those words too often.</p><p>\u201cYou may remember Eva\u2019s father, Victor Reyes,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd the tall Scotsman over there is Angus McLeod.\u201d</p><p>The detectives both nodded, but Graves took the lead, as usual. \u201cDetective Shelley Graves and my partner, Detective Richard Michna.\u201d She looked at Cary, whom she\u2019d spoken with just hours before. \u201cMr. Taylor.\u201d</p><p>I gestured toward the dining table. \u201cLet\u2019s have a seat.\u201d</p><p>My wife smoothed her hair back with unsteady hands. \u201cCan I get you both some coffee? Or water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee would be great,\u201d Michna said, pulling out a chair for himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Chris interjected, entering the room from the hallway. \u201cHello. I\u2019m Gideon\u2019s stepfather, Chris Vidal.\u201d</p><p>Acknowledged by the detectives, he passed through to the kitchen.</p><p>Graves took the seat beside her partner, setting a battered leather satchel on the table at her elbow. Where she was reed thin, he was portly. Her hair was brown and curly, held back in a ponytail as severe as her foxlike face. Michna\u2019s hair was both graying and thinning, bringing more focus to his dark eyes and rugged features.</p><p>Graves eyed me as I pulled a chair out for my wife. I met her look and held it, seeing the dark knowledge of my crime. In return, I let her see my resolve. Yes, I\u2019d done some immoral deeds for the sake of protecting my wife. I owned those decisions, even the ones I\u2019d take to my grave.</p><p>I sat next to Eva, pulling my chair close and taking her hand in my own. Victor settled on the other side, with Cary beside him. Angus stood behind me.</p><p>\u201cCan you both run through your evening, starting with when you arrived at the event?\u201d Michna asked.</p><p>I went first, painfully aware of Eva\u2019s attention to every word I said. Only the last few moments were lost to her, but I knew those minutes were vital. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see the shooter?\u201d Grave pressed.</p><p>\u201cNo. I heard Ra\u00fal shout and I got Eva on the ground. It\u2019s protocol for the security team to evacuate at the first sign of trouble. They escorted us away in the opposite direction and I didn\u2019t look back. My focus was on my wife, who was unconscious at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see Monica Stanton go down?\u201d</p><p>Eva\u2019s hand tightened on mine. I shook my head. \u201cNo. I had no idea anyone had been injured until several minutes after we left the scene.\u201d</p> <p>Michna looked at Eva. \u201cAt what point did you lose consciousness, Mrs. Cross?\u201d</p><p>She licked lips that were starting to crack. \u201cI hit the sidewalk pretty hard. Gideon rolled over me, holding me down. I couldn\u2019t breathe, and then someone covered Gideon. They were both so heavy ... I thought I heard two, maybe three shots. I\u2019m not sure. When I came to, I was in the limo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Michna nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Graves unzipped the satchel and pulled out a file folder. Opening it, she pulled out a mug shot and set it on the table facing us. \u201cDo either of you recognize this man?\u201d</p><p>I bent closer. Blond with green eyes. A trimmed beard. Average looking.</p> <p>\u201cAye,\u201d Angus said, drawing my head around to look at him. \u201cHe\u2019s the chap we ran off in Westport, the one who was taking pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need a statement from you, Mr. McLeod,\u201d Michna advised.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He straightened, his arms crossing. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who shot Mrs. Stanton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. His name is Roland Tyler Hall. Have you ever had contact with this man, Mr. Cross? Ever recall speaking with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I replied, searching my memory and coming up blank.</p><p>Eva leaned forward. \u201cWas he stalking her? Some kind of obsession?\u201d</p> <p>Her questions were softly voiced, her muted grief edged with an icy fury. It was the first spark I\u2019d seen in her since I broke the news. And it came at the moment that I remembered what else I was keeping from her: her mother\u2019s shadowy past. A tangled history that could be the reason Monica was dead now.</p><p>Graves began sliding out images, starting with the Westport photos. \u201cIt\u2019s not your mother Hall was fixated on.\u201d</p><p>What? The dread I felt reversed back into the fear that had plagued me all night.</p><p>There were so many images, it was hard to focus on any single one. Numerous pictures taken of us outside the Crossfire. Some from events, which looked like standard paparazzi shots. Others caught us out on the town.</p><p>Eva reached for the corner of one and slid it out, gasping at the image of me dipping her into a passionate kiss on a crowded city sidewalk outside a CrossTrainer gym.</p><p>The photo had been the first of us to go viral. I had responded to press inquiries with the confirmation that she was the significant woman in my life, and she\u2019d opened up to me about Nathan and her past.</p><p>There was another widely seen image of us, capturing us arguing in Bryant Park. Another picture of us in the park on a different day showed us embracing. I hadn\u2019t seen that one before.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t sell all of these,\u201d I said.</p> <p>Graves shook her head. \u201cMost of the photos Hall took for himself. When money ran low, he\u2019d sell a few. He hasn\u2019t worked in months and lives out of his car.\u201d</p><p>Sliding the top layer of pictures around to expose the ones underneath, I realized that many of the times Eva and I had spotted a photographer, it had been Hall holding the camera.</p><p>I sat back, releasing Eva\u2019s hand to put my arm around her and pull her close. Hall had been so near to my wife, and we hadn\u2019t even known it.</p><p>\u201cLet me see those,\u201d Victor said.</p><p>I pushed them down the table, the top layer sliding over first. The images left behind had me straightening in my chair. I pulled out the highly publicized picture of Magdalene and me that helped trigger the infamous fight with Eva in Bryant Park. And another of me and Corinne at the Kingsman Vodka party.</p><p>My breathing quickened. I released Eva, sliding to the edge of my chair to sift through the images with both hands.</p><p>Cary leaned forward to look over Victor\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWas this guy just a really bad shot? Or did he confuse Monica for Eva?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t stalking Eva,\u201d I said tightly, the horrific realization sinking in. I pulled out the photo from the nightclub of me and two women. Taken in May, it preceded Eva\u2019s arrival in New York.</p><p>Graves met my questioning gaze with a nod. \u201cHall is obsessed with you.\u201d</p><p>Which meant I hadn\u2019t just hidden what I knew of Monica\u2019s life, I was also indirectly responsible for her death. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>15</p><p>Moving closer to the table, I set my hand on Gideon\u2019s back and felt the tension there. His skin was so warm beneath the soft cotton of his T-shirt, the muscles stretched tight.</p><p>Chris came in from the kitchen with a tray bearing four steaming mugs of coffee, a small cup of half-and-half, and sugar in a bowl. He set it down near Michna, since the rest of the dining table was covered in pictures.</p><p>The detectives thanked him and each took a mug. Graves took her coffee black. Michna added a splash of cream and a sprinkling of sugar.</p> <p>I\u2019d only seen Michna in the course of the investigation into Nathan\u2019s death. I knew Graves more personally; I\u2019d sparred with her during Parker\u2019s Krav Maga classes. I believed Graves liked me or was at least sympathetic. And I was certain it was Gideon\u2019s love for me that swayed her into closing Nathan\u2019s case while she still had questions.</p><p>It comforted me to have them in charge.</p><p>\u201cI want to be sure I understand,\u201d I said, pushing through the grief that had fogged my mind all day. \u201cThis man was stalking Gideon?\u201d</p><p>My dad shoved the photos away. \u201cWas Hall targeting my daughter or Cross?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHall believes Cross betrayed him,\u201d Graves answered, \u201cby getting married.\u201d</p> <p>I stared at her. She wore no jewelry or makeup, yet she was fiercely compelling. Pummeled by the realities of her job, she still had a passion for justice\u2014even if it came outside the law. \u201cIf he couldn\u2019t have Gideon, no one could?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d She looked at Gideon. \u201cHall believes he has an \u2018entwined destiny\u2019 with you\u2014some kind of cosmic pact\u2014and that your marriage breaks this pact between you. Killing you is the only way to prevent his life from going in a direction he doesn\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to make sense?\u201d Cary asked, setting his elbows on the table and gripping his head in both hands.</p><p>\u201cHall\u2019s fixation isn\u2019t sexual,\u201d Michna elaborated, looking rumpled and tired from pulling an all-nighter. Still, he was keenly and disconcertingly observant. His partner zeroed in; he assessed the periphery. \u201cIt\u2019s not even romantic. He claims he\u2019s heterosexual.\u201d</p><p>Graves pulled another photo out of the file and set it atop the others. \u201cYou both know this woman.\u201d</p><p>Anne. My palms were suddenly damp. Gideon\u2019s body tautened like a bow.</p> <p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d Cary muttered, his fisted hands dropping to the table with a thud that made me jump.</p><p>\u201cI saw her last night,\u201d Chris said, taking a chair by Gideon. \u201cShe was at the dinner. Hard to miss that bright red hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d my dad asked, his voice firm and flat.</p><p>\u201cDr. Anne Leslie Lucas,\u201d Graves replied. \u201cShe\u2019s the psychiatrist who was treating Hall, although she met with him at a second office away from her primary practice, using the alias Dr. Aris Matevosian.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s breath hissed out between his teeth. \u201cI know that name.\u201d</p><p>Graves zeroed in, her gaze sharply focused. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a moment. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d He pushed back from the table and headed down the hallway.</p><p>I watched him go, saw Lucky scampering after him. The puppy had been sticking close to me for most of the morning, as if he thought I needed him more than Gideon did right now. Something had changed. And since Lucky\u2019s emotional barometer was more accurate than mine at the moment, I needed to pay attention to that.</p> <p>\u201cWill someone explain who Dr. Lucas is,\u201d my father demanded, \u201cand her relevance to Hall and Monica?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let Cross fill us all in on that,\u201d Michna said.</p><p>\u201cThey had a sexual relationship awhile back,\u201d I interjected, wanting to take the burden of telling the story off Gideon\u2019s shoulders. He was ashamed of what he\u2019d done, I knew that.</p><p>I pulled my knees up to my chest and wrapped my arms around them, trying to get warm. I knew I had to choose my words carefully. Telling the whole truth would be difficult, considering the unflattering picture of my husband my father would see.</p><p>\u201cShe got wrapped up in it,\u201d I went on, \u201cand wanted to leave her husband, so Gideon broke it off. She hasn\u2019t been able to move on or get past it. She showed up at my building once, and tried approaching Cary a couple times, wearing a wig, pretending to be someone else.\u201d</p><p>Graves watched me with a sharp, savvy gaze. \u201cWe reviewed her complaint. You and Cross confronted her, separately, on two different occasions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Eva.\u201d My dad glared at me, his eyes bloodshot and red rimmed. \u201cYou know better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d I shot back. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand what this all means. She was harassing my best friend and my husband. I told her to back off.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gideon returned and held out his phone, showing a picture he\u2019d taken.</p><p>Michna examined the image. \u201cA prescription for Corinne Giroux written by Dr. Aris Matevosian. Why do you have this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a time, a couple months ago,\u201d Gideon said tonelessly, resuming his seat beside me, \u201cwhen Corinne became erratic. I discovered she\u2019d been seeing a therapist who prescribed antidepressants, which were causing her mood swings. I took a picture of the label so I\u2019d know who to contact if she continued having problems.\u201d</p><p>Gideon put his arm around me, urging me to lean into him. The moment I was pressed against him, I felt him sag heavily into the chair, as if holding me was a major relief. I slid my arm around his waist, felt his lips press against my forehead.</p> <p>His chest rumbled beneath my ear as he spoke. \u201cSo Anne was Hall\u2019s therapist,\u201d he said, his voice rough with fatigue. \u201cWhy the alias?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thought she was smart,\u201d Grave said bluntly. \u201cWe\u2019re smarter. And we have Hall, who is very disturbed but also very cooperative. He confessed the minute we sat down with him. He was also clever\u2014or paranoid\u2014enough to secretly record all of his sessions with Dr. Lucas, which we recovered during a search of his vehicle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she put him up to this?\u201d I asked, wanting to be sure there was no misunderstanding.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Hall was ever playing with a full deck,\u201d Michna said, \u201cbut he used to have a job, a place to live, and no particular interest in Cross. Anne Lucas did a number on him.\u201d</p><p>Graves started gathering up the photos with the help of her partner. \u201cHe mentioned to her that he dropped out of school after the Cross Ponzi scheme wiped out his grandparents. It wasn\u2019t something he held a grudge over, but she got him thinking that his life and Cross\u2019s are paralleled in some way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan she go to jail for that?\u201d I hung on tighter to Gideon. \u201cWhat she did\u2014that\u2019s part of the reason my mom\u2019s ... gone. She can\u2019t just get away with that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe picked her up about an hour ago.\u201d Graves held my gaze and I saw her determination. \u201cWhen her lawyer shows up, we\u2019ll take a crack at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe DA\u2019s office will determine the full extent of the charges,\u201d Michna said, \u201cbut Hall\u2019s recordings, plus security footage of both Lucas and Hall entering and leaving her secondary office, gave us probable cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll keep us posted,\u201d my father said.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Graves tucked everything back in her satchel, then shot a look at Gideon. \u201cDid you see Dr. Lucas at the dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered, his hand stroking up and down my arm. \u201cEva pointed her out to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid either of you speak with her at all?\u201d Michna asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gideon looked down at me with a question in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI flipped her the bird from a distance,\u201d I confessed, the memory of her drifting through my blurry mind. \u201cShe had this smirk on her face. Maybe that\u2019s why she was there, so she could see what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d Gideon enfolded me, wrapping me into his warmth and the scent of his skin.</p><p>\u201cAll right. We\u2019ve got what we need for now,\u201d Graves said briskly. \u201cWe\u2019ll just take Mr. McLeod\u2019s statement regarding the Westport incident and be on our way. Thank you for your time.\u201d</p><p>Dismissed, we all pushed back from the table.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d Graves waited until our gazes met. For a moment, she wasn\u2019t just a cop. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for your loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Self-conscious, I looked away from Graves.</p> <p>Did she wonder at my dry eyes? God knew I did. As crazy as my mother drove me at times, I loved her. Didn\u2019t I? What kind of daughter didn\u2019t feel anything when her mom died?</p><p>Angus took Gideon\u2019s abandoned chair and began recounting what had happened in Westport.</p><p>Gideon took my hand and led me a few feet away. \u201cI need some time with you.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, I nodded. \u201cYeah, of course.\u201d</p><p>He drew me along with him toward our bedroom.</p><p>\u201cCross.\u201d</p><p>We both turned at the sound of my father\u2019s voice. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Dad stood by the living room, his face hard and his gaze heated. \u201cWe have to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Gideon said with a nod. \u201cJust give me five minutes with my wife.\u201d</p><p>He kept going, not giving my dad a chance to object. I followed along to our bedroom, Lucky racing ahead of us. I watched Gideon as he shut the door with the three of us inside. Then he faced me, his gaze searching. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou should take a nap,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou look tired.\u201d And that troubled me.

I looked him over from head to toe. Oh. He\u2019d dressed for me. Thinking of me. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and touched my face. His tormented gaze held mine. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m invisible to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ...\u201d He breathed hard, his chest working as if he\u2019d just run miles. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Eva. Sorry about Anne ... about last night ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Of course I knew that.</p><p>He was so upset. Much more than I was. Why? My self-control was never as good as his. Except for now. From the moment I learned the truth, I\u2019d felt an icy resolve form somewhere deep inside me. I didn\u2019t understand it, but I used it. To deal with the police. And my dad and Cary, who needed me to be strong for them.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d He came to me and cupped my face in his hands. \u201cYell at me. Hit me. For God\u2019s sake\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He stared at me as if I were crazy. \u201cBecause this is my fault! Anne was my problem and I didn\u2019t manage her. I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not responsible for her actions, Gideon,\u201d I said crossly, frustrated he would think that way. \u201cWhy would you believe you were? That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>His hands went to my shoulders and he gave me a little shake. \u201cYou\u2019re not making sense! Why aren\u2019t you mad that I didn\u2019t tell you about your mother? You lost it when I hired Mark and didn\u2019t tell you. You left me\u2014\u201d His voice broke. \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving me over this, Eva. We\u2019ll work through it ... we\u2019ll figure out how to get past it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d I touched his face. \u201cYou need to sleep, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d He caught me up and took my mouth, his lips slanting over mine. I put my arms around him, stroking his back to try to calm him down.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he muttered. \u201cCome back to me.\u201d</p><p>Cupping my jaw, he pressed gently with trembling fingers, urging my mouth to open. The moment it did, his tongue swept inside, licking desperately. With a groan, he pulled me up hard against him, urgently fucking his tongue into my mouth.</p><p>Heat bloomed inside me. The warmth of his feverishly hot skin penetrated my clothes, sinking into my flesh. Desperate for something to thaw me, I kissed him back, my tongue stroking his.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d Gideon released me, his hands moving over me, sliding over my back and arms.</p><p>I pushed up onto the tips of my toes, deepening the contact of our mouths. My hands slid beneath his shirt and he hissed, arching into me and away from the chill of my fingers. My touch followed, caressing his skin, seeking that warmth.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he gasped into my mouth. \u201cGod, Eva. I love you.\u201d</p><p>I licked across his lips, sucked his tongue when he licked me back. The sound he made was both pain and relief, his hands cupping my buttocks and pulling me up against him. I clung to him, lost in him. He was what I needed. I couldn\u2019t think about anything else when he was holding me.</p><p>\u201cTell me you love me,\u201d he breathed. \u201cThat you\u2019ll forgive me. Next week ... next year ... someday ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He tore his mouth away, hugging me so tightly it was hard to breathe. My feet dangled above the floor, my temple pressed to his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you,\u201d he vowed. \u201cI\u2019ll find a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh ...\u201d It was there, in the back of my mind, the dismay. The hurt. But I didn\u2019t know whether it was because of Gideon or my mom.</p><p>I closed my eyes. Focused on the adored, familiar scent of him. \u201cKiss me again.\u201d</p><p>Gideon turned his head, his lips finding mine. I craved deeper, harder, but he denied me. As ferociously passionate as his first kisses had been, this one was soft. Tender. I whimpered a protest, my hands pushing into his hair to pull him closer.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d He nuzzled against me. \u201cYour dad\u2019s waiting.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. I loved my dad, but his agony and helpless rage were pouring off him, battering me. I didn\u2019t know how to comfort or soothe. There was a void inside me, as if I had nothing left to give anyone. But everyone needed me.</p><p>Putting me back on my feet, Gideon searched my face again. \u201cLet me be here for you. Don\u2019t shut me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to.\u201d I looked away, toward the bathroom. There\u2019s a towel on the floor.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with you.\u201d He cupped my face again, brought it around.</p><p>\u201cYou nicked yourself.\u201d I touched the little spot of dried blood on his jaw. \u201cYou never do that, either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in that head of yours?\u201d He wrapped himself around me. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said again. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Gideon kept my hand in his as we returned to the living room.</p><p>My father looked over from where he sat on the couch, then stood. Worn jeans. A faded UCSD T-shirt. The shadow of stubble on his strong square jaw.</p><p>Gideon had shaved. Why hadn\u2019t I processed that when I noticed the cut from the razor? Why hadn\u2019t I noticed that he\u2019d changed out of his tux?</p><p>Some things came to me with strange clarity. Others were lost in the fog in my mind.</p> <p>The detectives were gone. Cary was curled up against the armrest of the couch, fast asleep, his mouth hanging partway open. I could hear him snoring softly.</p><p>\u201cWe can step into my office,\u201d Gideon said, releasing my hand to gesture down the hallway.</p><p>With a curt nod, my dad rounded the coffee table. \u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><p>Gideon started walking. I fell into step behind him.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d My dad\u2019s voice stopped me and I turned around. \u201cI need to speak to Cross alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got things to say that you don\u2019t need to hear.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head slowly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He made a frustrated noise. \u201cWe\u2019re not arguing about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019m not a child. Anything you have to say to my husband has something to do with me and I think I should be involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no objection,\u201d Gideon said, returning to my side.</p><p>My father\u2019s jaw tensed, his gaze darting back and forth between us. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>We all went to Gideon\u2019s office. Chris was sitting at Gideon\u2019s desk, talking on the phone. He pushed back and stood when we came in. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re done for the day,\u201d he said to whomever he was talking to. \u201cI\u2019ll explain when I see you. All right. Talk to you then, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need my office a minute,\u201d Gideon told him when he hung up.</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d His concerned gaze raked all three of us. \u201cI\u2019ll pull out some plates and things for lunch. We all need to eat something.\u201d</p><p>Chris left the room, which drew my eye to my dad, who was staring at the massive collage of photos on the wall. The one in the center was of me, sleeping. It was an intimate image; the kind of picture a man took to remember the things he had done with his lover before she\u2019d fallen asleep.</p><p>I looked at the other photos, noted one of me and Gideon at an event that I now knew had been captured by Hall. I turned my head away, feeling a prickle running down my spine.</p><p>Fear? Hall had taken my mother from me, but who he\u2019d really wanted was Gideon. I could be mourning my husband now. My stomach cramped at the thought, hunching me over.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d He was near me in an instant, urging me to sit in one of the two chairs facing his desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d My dad hovered, too, his eyes wild. I couldn\u2019t recognize my own feelings, but I saw his. He was frightened for me, more anxious than was warranted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I assured them, even as I reached for Gideon\u2019s hand and held on tight.</p><p>\u201cYou need to eat,\u201d Gideon said.</p><p>\u201cSo do you,\u201d I countered. \u201cThe sooner you two get done, the faster we can do that.\u201d</p><p>Just the thought of food made me queasy, but I didn\u2019t say that. They were both already too worried about me.</p><p>My dad straightened. \u201cI spoke to my family,\u201d he told Gideon. \u201cThey still want to come and be here for Eva. And me.\u201d</p><p>Gideon half-sat on the edge of his desk, one hand running through his hair. \u201cOkay. We were going to fly them direct to North Carolina. We\u2019ll have to adjust the flight plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would appreciate that,\u201d my dad said, grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you look worried?\u201d I said to Gideon, seeing his frown.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just ... It\u2019s a madhouse on the street right now. We can bring your family in through the garage, but if word gets out that they\u2019re in town, they may have to deal with media and photographers at their hotel or anywhere else they may go in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not coming to sightsee,\u201d my dad snapped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant, Victor.\u201d Gideon sighed wearily. \u201cI\u2019m just thinking out loud. I\u2019ll work it out. Consider it taken care of.\u201d</p><p>I pictured how it must be downstairs outside the lobby, imagined my grandmother and cousins wading through a gauntlet like that. I shook my head and had a moment of clarity. \u201cIf they want to come, we should go to the Outer Banks like we planned. We already have the rooms reserved for them. It\u2019ll be quiet and private.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, I longed to be at the beach. Feeling the wind in my hair, the surf lapping at my bare feet. I\u2019d felt alive there. I wanted to feel alive again. \u201cWe had catering arranged. We\u2019d have food and beverages for everyone.\u201d</p><p>Gideon looked at me. \u201cI had Scott talk to Kristine. We pulled out of everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt can\u2019t have been more than a few hours ago. The hotel probably hasn\u2019t filled the room block in that short of time. And the caterer already has the things well under way at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really want to go to the beach house?\u201d he asked me quietly.</p><p>I nodded. There were no memories of my mom there, as there were in the city. And if I wanted to step outside and take a walk, no one would bother me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>I looked at my dad, hoping that plan was good with him. He stood beside me, his arms crossed and his gaze on his feet.</p> <p>Finally, he said, \u201cWhat happened changes everything. For all of us. I want to move to New York.\u201d</p><p>Taken aback, I glanced at Gideon, then back at my dad. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time for me to deal with work and selling my house, but I\u2019m going to get the ball rolling.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cI need to be closer than the other side of the damn country. You\u2019re all I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Dad. You love your job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do for work?\u201d Gideon asked.</p> <p>There was something in his tone that drew my attention to him. He\u2019d twisted a bit to face us better, drawing one thigh up to the desktop and resting his crossed hands atop it. He watched my father avidly. There wasn\u2019t any of the surprise on his face that I felt.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to talk about,\u201d my father said, his handsome face grim.</p><p>\u201cEva needs a dedicated security chief,\u201d Gideon said preemptively. \u201cI\u2019ve got Angus and Ra\u00fal stretched to their limits and my wife needs her own security team.\u201d</p><p>My mouth fell open as I registered what my husband had said. \u201cWhat? No, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>His brows rose. \u201cWhy not? It would be ideal. There\u2019s no one I could trust more to protect you than your own father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s ... weird. Okay? Dad\u2019s his own man. It would be awkward to have my father on my husband\u2019s payroll. It\u2019s just ... not right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngus is the closest I\u2019ve had to a father,\u201d he pointed out, \u201cand he works the same job.\u201d His gaze lifted to my dad. \u201cI don\u2019t think any less of him. And Chris, as the head of a company in which I have controlling interest, also could be said to work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d I said stubbornly.</p> <p>\u201cEva.\u201d My dad set his hand on my shoulder. \u201cIf I can handle it, you should be able to.\u201d</p><p>I turned wide eyes to him. \u201cAre you serious? Were you thinking about this before he brought it up?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, still somber. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it since he called me about ... your mom. Cross is right: There\u2019s no one I trust more than myself to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe from what? What happened last night ... It\u2019s not an everyday thing.\u201d I couldn\u2019t think differently. Living with the fear that Gideon might be in danger at any given moment? It would drive me insane. I certainly couldn\u2019t live with putting my dad in the line of fire.</p><p>\u201cEva, I\u2019ve seen you more on television, the Internet, and in magazines than I have in person this entire last year and you were living in San Diego for most of that time.\u201d His face hardened. \u201cGod willing you\u2019ll never be at risk, but I can\u2019t take that chance. Besides, Cross is planning on hiring someone anyway. Might as well be me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you?\u201d I demanded, rounding on Gideon.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes. It\u2019s been on my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, angel.\u201d His tone of voice told me I\u2019d just have to suck it up.</p><p>My dad\u2019s arms crossed. \u201cI won\u2019t accept any perks or compensation outside the scope of what you\u2019re paying your other men.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gideon unfolded and rounded his desk, opening a drawer to withdraw a paper-clipped sheaf of paper. \u201cAngus and Ra\u00fal both agreed to let me share their salaries with you. I\u2019ve also laid out what you can expect, to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this,\u201d I complained. \u201cYou were this far along and didn\u2019t say anything to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worked on it earlier this morning. It hasn\u2019t come up before now and I wasn\u2019t going to say anything unless your father mentioned moving to the city.\u201d</p><p>And that was Gideon Cross: He never missed a trick.</p> <p>My dad took the papers, perused the top sheet, then looked at Gideon incredulously. \u201cIs this for real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider that Angus has been with me for more years of my life than not. He also has considerable covert and military training. In short, he\u2019s earned it.\u201d Gideon watched as my dad flipped the page. \u201cRa\u00fal has been with me a shorter amount of time, so he\u2019s not where Angus is\u2014yet. But he also has a broad range of training and skills.\u201d</p><p>My dad exhaled in a rush when he flipped to the next page. \u201cOkay. This is ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you were likely expecting, but that spreadsheet gives you the info you need to gauge the offered compensation compared to my other chiefs. You can see that it\u2019s fair. It\u2019s predicated on the expectation that you will consent to further training and attain the necessary permits, licenses, and registrations.\u201d</p><p>I watched my dad\u2019s shoulders go back and his chin lift, the stubborn line of his mouth softening. Whatever he saw, he was taking as a challenge. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll note that a housing allowance is included,\u201d Gideon continued, in full-on mogul mode despite his matter-of-fact tone. \u201cIf you would like, there\u2019s a unit next door to Eva\u2019s former apartment that\u2019s available and furnished.\u201d</p><p>I caught my lower lip between my teeth, knowing he was talking about the apartment he\u2019d kept while Nathan was a threat. We had met there clandestinely for weeks while keeping up the fa\u00e7ade that we were no longer together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d my dad said.</p><p>\u201cAnother thing to think about,\u201d Gideon began, \u201cis the reality of your daughter being my wife. Certainly we would be mindful of your personal role in Eva\u2019s life and be respectful of that. But respecting your place as her father means we won\u2019t be brazen. It doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t be intimate.\u201d</p><p>Oh my God. My shoulders hunched with embarrassment. I glared at Gideon. So did my dad.</p><p>It took my father a long minute to unclench his jaw and respond. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind while I\u2019m thinking things over.\u201d</p> <p>Gideon gave a brisk nod. \u201cAll right. Was there anything else we needed to cover?\u201d</p><p>My dad shook his head. \u201cNot right now.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms, knowing I\u2019d have more to say at some point.</p><p>\u201cYou know where to find me, angel, when you\u2019re ready to tear into me.\u201d My husband offered his hand to me. \u201cIn the meantime, let\u2019s get some food into you.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Petersen showed up around three, looking a little rattled. Getting through the throng on the sidewalk to enter the lobby had obviously been a trial. Gideon introduced him to everyone as I watched, trying to judge his reaction to meeting the people he\u2019d heard such intimate things about.</p><p>He spoke to me briefly, offering his condolences. He\u2019d liked my mother and often was somewhat indulgent about her neurotic behavior, to my frustration. I could tell he was affected by her loss, which made me wonder how I came across to him. Evidently, he couldn\u2019t quite tell. I struggled to answer his questions about how I was doing.</p><p>He talked with Gideon for a much longer time, retreating with my husband to the dining room, where they spoke in hushed tones.</p><p>But not for long. Gideon turned toward me and I understood their talk was over. I accompanied Dr. Petersen to the foyer and saw him out, but not before I spotted my clutch on an end table.</p> <p>When I retrieved my phone, I saw the dozens of missed calls and texts. Megumi, Will, Shawna, Dr. Travis ... even Brett. I opened my messages and started to send out replies when the phone vibrated in my hand with an incoming call. I saw the name of the caller, looked up at Cary and found him talking with my dad, then headed down the hall to the bedroom.</p><p>Through the slender windows, I could see how far the afternoon had progressed. It would be dark in a few hours and the first day without my mom would be over.</p><p>\u201cHi, Trey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva. I ... I probably shouldn\u2019t be intruding at a time like this, but I saw the news and I was calling you before I thought about it being a bad idea. I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I took a seat in one of the reading chairs, refusing to think about what the headlines might be shouting right now. \u201cI appreciate you thinking of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe what happened. If there\u2019s anything I can do, please let me know.\u201d</p><p>I let my heavy head fall back against the seat and closed my eyes. I recalled Trey\u2019s handsome face, his kind hazel eyes and the little bump on his nose that told me it\u2019d once been broken. \u201cLook, Trey, I don\u2019t want to lay a guilt trip on you, but you should know that my mother meant a lot to Cary. She was like a surrogate mom to him. He\u2019s really hurting a lot right now.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI meant to call you ... before.\u201d I curled my legs up beneath me. \u201cTo see how you\u2019re doing, but also\u2014well, there\u2019s more. I wanted to tell you that I know you have to do what\u2019s best for you. That said, if you\u2019re thinking at all that you might want something with Cary, you should make up your mind quickly. The door is closing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. He\u2019s seeing someone,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cNo, just the opposite. He\u2019s taking some time for himself and reevaluating what he wants. You know he broke it off with Tatiana, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t trust him to tell the truth, it\u2019s good you broke things off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He made a low frustrated noise. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCary\u2019s healing, Trey. Pretty soon, he\u2019s going to be ready to move on. It\u2019s just something you need to think about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019ve done is think about it. I still don\u2019t know what the answer is.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed the space between my brows. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re asking the wrong question. Are you happier with him or without him? Figure that out and I think the rest will become clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, you and I kinda took the same route. Gideon and I always said we were going to make it work, but that was ... I don\u2019t know ...\u201d I searched through my brain fog. \u201cBravado. Stubbornness. That was part of our problem, we knew it was a house of cards. We weren\u2019t taking the steps to make us solid. Does that make sense?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we both made big changes, just like Cary has for you. And big concessions.\u201d</p><p>I felt my husband enter the room and opened my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt was worth it, Trey,\u201d I said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s not wishful thinking anymore. We\u2019ll still hit bumps, people will throw us some curve balls, but when we say we\u2019re going to get through anything, it\u2019s nothing but the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me to give Cary another chance.\u201d</p><p>I reached out to Gideon, felt a soft stirring in my chest as he came to me. \u201cI\u2019m saying I think you\u2019ll like the changes he\u2019s made. And if you meet him halfway, you might find it\u2019s worth the trip.\u201d</p><p>Chris left for the evening shortly after six to have dinner with Christopher. For some reason, he and Gideon exchanged a long look as my husband showed him out. I let it go without asking for an explanation. Their relationship had shifted. The wariness they used to regard each other with was gone. There was no way I was going to question it or make Gideon think too hard about it. It was time for him to make some decisions with his heart.</p><p>My dad and Cary left around nine, heading back to my old apartment, since there was room for both of them there and not enough in the penthouse.</p> <p>Would my dad stay in the bedroom where he\u2019d last made love to my mother? How would he bear it, if he did? When Gideon and I had been apart, I\u2019d had to stay at Stanton\u2019s. My room had too many memories of Gideon and the last thing I needed was to be tormented with reminders of what I wanted more than anything, yet feared I couldn\u2019t have.</p><p>Gideon went around the penthouse, turning off lights, Lucky following him every step of the way. I watched my husband move, his tread heavier than usual. He was so tired. I had no idea how he\u2019d managed to get through the day, considering how busy he\u2019d been in the morning\u2019s aftermath\u2014coordinating with Kristine, answering the occasional call from Scott, and catching Arash up on the visit with the police.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d He held his hand out to me.</p><p>I stared at it a moment. All day long, he\u2019d offered me his hand. Such a simple thing, really, but it was powerful. I\u2019m here, it said. You\u2019re not alone. We can do this together.</p><p>Rising from my seat on the sofa, I linked my fingers with his and let him lead me to the bedroom and into the bathroom. There, I went through nearly the same routine as he did. Brushing my teeth, washing my face. He added the step of taking one of the pills Dr. Petersen had prescribed. Then I followed him into the bedroom and let him undress me, before sliding another T-shirt over my head. He tucked me in with a soft, slow kiss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I asked, when he walked away.</p><p>\u201cNowhere.\u201d He stripped with brusque efficiency, leaving his boxer briefs on. Then he joined me in bed, helped Lucky scramble up, then turned off the light.</p><p>Rolling toward me, he caught me around the waist and pulled me back against him, spooning behind me. I moaned softly at the heat of his body and shivered as it combated the chill in my bones.</p><p>I closed my eyes, focusing on the sound and feel of him breathing. Within a few moments, the tempo fell into the rhythmic evenness of sleep.</p> <p>The wind whips through my hair as I walk along the shore, my feet sinking into the sand as the surf erodes every step. Ahead of me, I see the weathered shingles of the beach house Gideon bought for us. It sits perched above the tide on tall stilts, its many windows gazing far out over the water. Gulls circle and cry out above me, their quick dips and arrested hovering like a dance in the salt-tinged breeze.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to miss the reception.\u201d</p><p>I turn my head and discover my mother walking beside me. She\u2019s wearing the same elegant formal gown I last saw her in. She\u2019s so beautiful. Truly breathtaking. My eyes burn to look at her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all going to miss it,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cI know. And I worked so hard on it.\u201d She glances at me, the ends of her hair fluttering along her cheek. \u201cI did manage to work some touches of red in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you?\u201d That makes me smile, despite my pain. She does love me the best way she knows how. Just because it\u2019s not always the way I want her to doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not precious for what it is.</p><p>\u201cIt really is a garish color for a wedding, though. It was difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kinda your fault, you know, for buying that red dress I wore the first night Gideon took me out as his date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what inspired you?\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cNext time, you should pick a softer accent color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be a next time. Gideon is it for me.\u201d I pick up a shell, then toss it back into the water it came from. \u201cThere were times I wasn\u2019t sure we\u2019d make it, but I don\u2019t worry about that anymore. We were our own worst enemy, but we let go of the baggage weighting us down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first few months are supposed to be the easy part.\u201d My mom dances a little ahead of me and gives a graceful twirl. \u201cThe courtship. Fabulous trips, sparkling jewels.\u201d</p> <p>I snort. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy for us. The beginning was the rockiest. But it gets smoother every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to help your father find someone,\u201d she says, the girlish delight faded from her voice. \u201cHe\u2019s been lonely for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hard act to follow. He still loves you.\u201d</p><p>She shoots me a sad smile, then looks out over the water. \u201cI had Richard ... He\u2019s such a good man. I wish he\u2019d be happy again.\u201d</p><p>I think of my stepfather and worry. My mother was everything to him. What will give him joy now that she\u2019s gone?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never be a grandmother,\u201d she says thoughtfully. \u201cI died young and in my prime. That\u2019s not so terrible, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you ask me that?\u201d I let the tears flow. I searched my soul all day because I couldn\u2019t cry. Now that they\u2019re here, I welcome them. It feels as if a dam has burst.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, honey.\u201d She stops and hugs me, filling the air I breathe with the scent of her perfume. \u201cYou\u2019ll see that\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I woke with a gasp, my body racked by a hard jerk of surprise. Lucky whimpered and pawed at me, kneading into my stomach. I stroked his velvety head with one hand and swiped at my eyes with the other, but they were dry. The pain of my dream was already fading into a distant memory.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Gideon murmured, his voice a rough warm beacon in our moonlit bedroom. His arms came around me, pulling me back against him.</p><p>Turning into him, I sought his mouth and found it, sinking into him with a lush, deep kiss. Surprise held him motionless a moment, and then his hand was cupping the back of my head, holding me in place as he took over.</p><p>I tangled my legs with his, feeling the coarse brush of hair, the deliciously warm skin, and the powerful muscles underneath. The soft, rhythmic stroking of his tongue soothed and aroused me. No one kissed like Gideon. The coaxing demand of his mouth was searingly sexual, yet it was also tender. Reverent. His lips were both firm and soft, and he used them to tease, to brush gently against my own.</p><p>Reaching between us, I cupped his penis in my hand, stroking with a demand that answered his. He swelled to my touch, lengthening until the broad head pushed up beneath the elastic of his waistband. He groaned, his hips thrusting into my caress. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEva.\u201d</p><p>I heard the question in the way he said my name.</p><p>\u201cMake me feel,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>His hand slid beneath my shirt, his fingers drifting feather-light across my belly until he palmed my breast. He squeezed, plumping the aching flesh before his clever fingers gripped my nipple. With a decadent knowledge of my body, Gideon rolled and tugged the hard, tight point of my breast, the relentless pressure and pulling sending pulses of need through my entire body.</p><p>I moaned, aroused. Desperate. My legs tightened around his so I could rub my damp sex against his thigh.</p><p>\u201cDoes your pretty cunt ache, angel?\u201d He nibbled at the corner of my lips, the words a seduction all their own. \u201cWhat does it need? My tongue ... my fingers ... my cock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d I whimpered shamelessly when he pulled away, my arms reaching for him as he rose above me. He hummed a soft sound of reassurance and dropped Lucky carefully to the floor. Then his hands were at my hips, pulling my underwear down to my knees.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t answered me, Eva. What do you want me to put into your greedy little cunt? All of the above?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I gasped. \u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>A moment later my legs were in the air and his dark head was lowering to the sensitized flesh between my thighs.</p><p>I held my breath, waiting. Folded as I was, I couldn\u2019t see ...</p><p>The hot, wet velvet of his tongue slid between the tender folds of my sex.</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d I arched into a rigid bow.</p><p>Gideon purred. I struggled, trying to lift my hips up to the ecstasy of his wicked mouth. Gripping my thighs, he held me in place, tasting me at the pace he wanted, licking over and around the slick opening ... taunting me with my hunger to feel his tongue inside me. His lips circled my throbbing clit, his mouth suckling, the flat of his tongue rubbing across that sensitive pleasure point.</p><p>\u201cPlease ...\u201d I didn\u2019t care that he made me beg. The more I gave him, the more he gave back to me.</p><p>But he made me wait as he savored me, his hair caressing the tender skin at the back of my thighs, his tongue massaging my clit with the faintest of pressures.</p><p>I pressed my hands to my face. \u201cThat feels so good ... Don\u2019t stop ...\u201d</p><p>My mouth fell open when he licked lower, dipping the merest fraction into the trembling clutch of my body ... then lower still, rimming the rosette that quivered beneath the silky caress.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I gasped, half mad with the barrage of sensation after hours of numbness.</p><p>His growl shivered through me. My body jerked as he finally gave me what I wanted, his stiffened tongue pushing into my slick heat with a slow, delicious thrust.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I gasped. \u201cFuck me.\u201d</p><p>His mouth was exquisite, the source of all pleasure and torment, his tongue wicked in its sensual assault, plunging between the clenching delicate muscles.</p><p>Gideon ate me with tautly driven focus, so avid and greedy that I writhed with the incredible ecstasy pulsing through my body. There was pressure, and then his thumb slid into my rear and began fucking the tender opening. The fullness there contrasted with the rhythmic thrusts of his tongue. My core tensed. I hovered tautly, on the precipice of orgasm ...</p> <p>I screamed his name, my body on fire, my skin hot and damp. I was alive with pleasure, burning with it. The climax shattered me, broke me into pieces. But Gideon wouldn\u2019t relent, his tongue sliding up to lash my clit. One orgasm rolled into the next.</p><p>Sobbing, coming hard and endlessly, I pressed my fists to my eyes. \u201cNo more,\u201d I pleaded hoarsely, my limbs trembling hard as my core spasmed with yet another rush. \u201cI can\u2019t take any more.\u201d</p><p>I felt the mattress dip as he moved, one hand holding my ankles. I heard the snap of his waistband as he shoved his boxer briefs down.</p><p>\u201cHow do you want it?\u201d he asked darkly. \u201cSlow and sweet? Fast and rough?\u201d</p><p>Oh God ...</p><p>I forced my answer past dry lips. \u201cDeep. Hard.\u201d</p><p>He came over me, pushing my legs back until I was bent in half.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he vowed fiercely, gruffly.</p><p>The lush crest of his thick cock surged into my sex, stroking over tissues already swollen and tender.</p><p>Folded as I was, my legs bound by my underwear around my knees, it was tight inside me and he was so big. I was stretched by his girth, my sensitive flesh stinging from the forcefulness of his possession. And he still had more to give.</p><p>Groaning my name, Gideon swiveled his hips, pulling out, pushing in, working the heavy shaft deeper. \u201cAre you feeling this, angel?\u201d he demanded, his voice gruff with desire.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all I feel,\u201d I moaned, needing to move, to take more. But he kept me restrained, his body fucking me with destructive expertise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The feel of him ... so hard ... the relentless, leisurely thrusts ...</p><p>My fingers grasped at the sheets.

Christ.\u201d</p><p>Gideon loomed over me in the moonlight, a darkly sexual fallen angel. His beautiful face was hard with lust as his eyes gleamed down at me. His arms strained with unappeased need, his torso chiseled by the tension in his muscles. \u201cYou keep sucking on my dick with that tight cunt of yours and you\u2019ll make me come. Is that what you want, angel? You want me to fill you up before you take it all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I exhaled in a rush, willing my core to relax its eager tightening.

Your cunt loves my cock.\u201d</p><p>Reaching for the headboard, Gideon stretched over me, my legs trapped between us. Fully exposed and tilted back for his pleasure, I was helpless to do more than watch as he straightened his hips and sank the last few inches of his penis into me.</p><p>The sound that left me was a harsh wail, the pleasure so intense it hurt. Distantly, I heard Gideon curse, felt his powerful body shudder.</p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d he bit out, his teeth grinding.</p><p>I tried to catch my breath, my lungs expanding as much as they were able.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d He growled my name. \u201cAre. You. Good?\u201d</p><p>Unable to speak, I reached for his hips, my fingers catching in his boxer briefs. I had a moment to think how hot that was, that he hadn\u2019t bothered to undress either one of us ...</p><p>Then he started fucking, his hips pistoning in a relentless tempo, his long thick cock plunging and withdrawing from root to tip in rapid-fire thrusts.

And the view ... un-fucking-believable.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight?\u201d I leaned my butt against the railing, facing the house. Through the wall of sliding glass doors, I watched the Reyes family swarm like bees around the kitchen and great room, with Gideon held captive by my grandmother and both of my aunts.</p><p>For me, the joyous mood was tinged with poignancy. My mother had never been a part of this extended group, and now she would never have a chance. But life went on.</p><p>Two of my younger cousins chased Lucky around the sofas, while the three older ones played video games with Chris. My uncle Tony and my dad were talking in the reading nook, while my dad bounced his fussy baby niece on his knee.</p><p>Gideon was a man who feared family in a way he feared little else, and his heartbreaker of a face reflected bemusement and dismay whenever he surveyed the chaos around him. Since I knew him well, I also saw the hint of panic in his eyes, but I couldn\u2019t save him. My grandmother wasn\u2019t letting him out of her sight.</p> <p>Cary looked over to see what had drawn my attention. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for your man to sneak out and run like hell.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s why I asked Chris to come, so Gideon could have some support.\u201d</p><p>Our group\u2014Gideon, me, Cary, my dad, and Chris\u2014had arrived at the beach around ten in the morning. It was a little after noon when my dad\u2019s family was brought over from their hotel with groceries in tow, so that my grandmother could whip up her famous posole. She said it was known to soothe even the most wounded souls. Whether that was true or not, I knew firsthand that her rendition of the classic Mexican soupy stew was delicious.</p><p>\u201cChris is leaving him to fend for himself,\u201d Cary drawled, \u201clike you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do? Oh my God.\u201d I grinned. \u201cMy nana just handed him an apron.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d been a little nervous when everyone showed up. I hadn\u2019t spent much time with my dad\u2019s family when I was little and had only made a couple trips out to Texas with him after I started at UCSD. Every time I visited with them, the Reyeses had been a bit reserved with me, which made me wonder if I looked too much like the woman they all knew had broken my dad\u2019s heart. They had met my mother once and hadn\u2019t approved, saying my dad was reaching too high and that his love for her wouldn\u2019t end well.</p><p>So when my grandmother had marched right up to Gideon the moment she arrived and cupped his face in her hands, I\u2019d held my breath right along with him.</p><p>My grandmother had brushed his hair back from his face, turned his head from side to side, and pronounced that she saw a lot of my father in him. Gideon had understood the Spanish and replied in her native tongue\u2014he took her statement as a high compliment. My grandmother had been delighted. She\u2019d been speaking to him in rapid-fire Spanish ever since.</p><p>\u201cTrey called me yesterday,\u201d Cary tossed out casually.</p><p>I looked at him. \u201cDid he? How\u2019d that go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say something to him, baby girl, to get him to reach out?\u201d</p> <p>Trying to look innocent, I asked, \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p><p>He shot me a knowing look, his mouth twisted wryly. \u201cSo you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just told him you\u2019re not going to wait around forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He tried looking innocent, too. I had to hope I pulled it off better than he did. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not above taking a pity fuck, right? So thanks for hooking me up.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a gentle shove on the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re full of shit.\u201d</p><p>Something had shifted for Cary in the last few weeks. He hadn\u2019t turned to his usual self-destructive coping mechanisms and since things were going good for him without them, I was holding out hope that he wouldn\u2019t backslide.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He flashed his brilliant grin and it was genuine, rather than the cocky fa\u00e7ade I knew too well. \u201cAlthough banging Trey is certainly something tempting to think about. Figure it\u2019s probably tempting for him, too, so I should use that to my advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to see each other?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s going to come with me to the memorial at Stanton\u2019s on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I sighed, hurting. Clancy had called Gideon and passed on that information earlier in the morning.</p><p>Should I have tried to handle the memorial myself and spare Stanton? I just didn\u2019t know. I was still trying to accept the fact that my mom was really gone. After I\u2019d cried for hours the night before, heavy guilt had settled in. There were so many things I\u2019d said to my mother that I regretted and could no longer take back, so many times I\u2019d thought of her with frustration and disrespect.</p><p>Ironic, in retrospect, that her chief fault was loving me too much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As my stepfather had loved her\u2014inordinately.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried calling Stanton,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I just get his voice mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Cary rubbed at his unshaven jaw. \u201cI hope he\u2019s okay, but I realize he\u2019s probably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it might be a while before any of us are okay.\u201d</p> <p>We settled into comfortable silence for a moment. Then Cary spoke. \u201cI was talking to your dad this morning, before we headed to the airport, about his plans to move to New York.\u201d</p><p>My nose wrinkled. \u201cI would love to have him near, but I can\u2019t help thinking how bizarre it would be if he worked for Gideon.\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly. \u201cYou have a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>He shifted his body to face me. \u201cWell, just the pregnancy part of having a kid has changed my life, right? So, multiply that by twenty-four years in your case, and I\u2019d say a loving parent would do just about anything to make things better for their child.\u201d</p> <p>Yep, something had definitely shifted for Cary. Sometimes, you just needed a hard jolt to bump you in the right direction. For Cary, that was the thought of being a father. For me, it had been meeting Gideon. And for Gideon, it had been the possibility of losing me.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Cary went on, \u201che was saying that Gideon offered him a housing allowance and he was thinking he\u2019d like to stay in the apartment with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Okay.\u201d There was a lot to process there. One, my dad was obviously taking the idea of working for Gideon in New York seriously. Two, my best friend was thinking about living separately from me. I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about that. \u201cI\u2019d been worried Dad would have a hard time using that room after him and my mom ... you know.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t think I could stay in the penthouse if I didn\u2019t have Gideon. Too much had happened between us there. I didn\u2019t know if I could handle remembering what I no longer had.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d wondered about that, too.\u201d Cary reached out and touched my shoulder, a simple comforting touch. \u201cBut you know, memories are all that Victor has ever really had of Monica.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. My dad had to have wondered more than once over the years if the love had always been one-sided. After that afternoon with my mom, maybe he realized that wasn\u2019t true. That\u2019d be a good memory to hold on to.</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re thinking about staying there,\u201d I said. \u201cMom told me she\u2019d offered you that option.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a smile tinged with melancholy. \u201cI\u2019m considering it, yes. Kinda makes it easier if your dad\u2019s going to be there, too. I warned him it was likely there\u2019d be a baby around now and then. I got the impression he might like that.\u201d</p><p>Looking back into the house, I saw my dad making silly faces to amuse my baby cousin. He was the only one of his siblings to have just one child, and I was an adult.</p><p>I frowned as I watched Gideon walk to the front entrance. Where was he going with an apron tied around his denim-clad hips? He opened the front door and stood unmoving for a long minute. I realized someone must have knocked, but I couldn\u2019t see because Gideon was blocking my view. Finally, he stepped aside.</p><p>Cary looked over to see where my attention was and scowled. \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing here?\u201d</p><p>As Gideon\u2019s brother walked in, I wondered the same thing. Then Ireland appeared behind him, holding a gift bag.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with the gift?\u201d Cary asked. \u201cAn unreturnable wedding present?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I noticed the design on the bag, which was definitely too colorful and festive for a wedding. \u201cIt\u2019s a birthday present.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Cary muttered. \u201cI totally forgot about that.\u201d</p><p>When Gideon closed the door without his mother making an appearance, I realized Elizabeth was a no-show on her firstborn\u2019s birthday. A potent mix of sympathy and pain swamped me and caused my fists to clench.</p><p>What the fuck was wrong with that woman? Gideon hadn\u2019t heard from his mother since confronting her in his office. Considering what the day was, I couldn\u2019t believe she could be so thoughtless.</p><p>It made me realize I wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d lost a mother in the past few days.</p><p>Chris stood and went to his children, hugging Christopher while Ireland hugged my husband. She smiled up at him, offering the bag. He took it and turned, gesturing toward where I stood on the deck.</p><p>Fresh and lovely in a delicately printed sundress, Ireland joined us outside. \u201cWow, Eva. This place is choice.\u201d</p><p>I hugged her. \u201cYou like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not to like?\u201d Ireland hugged Cary, and then her lovely face sobered. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about your mom, Eva.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The tears that were no longer very far away stung my eyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even imagine,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t even like my mom right now.\u201d</p><p>Reaching out, I touched her arm. Regardless of how I felt about Elizabeth, I wouldn\u2019t wish the regret I had on anyone, especially Ireland. \u201cI hope you work out whatever it is. If I had my mom back, I\u2019d take back a lot of the things I said and did.\u201d</p><p>And because saying that aloud made me feel like crying, I excused myself quickly and headed toward the stairs, running down them to the beach, then out to the water. I stopped when my ankles were submerged, letting the sea breeze blow the tears away.</p> <p>Closing my eyes, I willed the grief back into the box I\u2019d put it in for the day. It was Gideon\u2019s birthday, an occasion I wanted to celebrate because it\u2019d seen him enter the world and, eventually, my life.</p><p>I jumped when warm muscular arms slipped around my waist, gathering me back against a familiar hard body.</p><p>Gideon set his chin on the crown of my head. I felt his chest expand and contract on a deep sigh when I wrapped my arms over his.</p><p>When I pulled myself together enough to speak, I said, \u201cI\u2019m surprised my nana let you escape.\u201d</p><p>He gave a short laugh. \u201cShe says I remind her of your dad\u2014well, she reminds me of you.\u201d</p> <p>Which made it apt, I supposed, that I\u2019d been named after her. \u201cBecause I won\u2019t let you out of my greedy clutches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause even though she scares me, I can\u2019t seem to walk away.\u201d</p><p>Touched, I turned my head and rested my cheek against his heart, listening to its strong and steady beat. \u201cI didn\u2019t know your brother and sister were coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about Christopher being here?\u201d</p><p>I felt him shrug. \u201cIf he\u2019s not acting like a dick, I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d If his brother\u2019s unexpected appearance didn\u2019t trouble Gideon, I wouldn\u2019t let it bother me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some things to share with you,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout Christopher. But now\u2019s not the time.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to contradict that, but caught myself. Gideon was right. We should have renewed our vows today, surrounded by friends and family. We should be celebrating his birthday and being so joyful there wasn\u2019t any room for sorrows and regrets. Instead, the day was shadowed by sorrow we had to hide. Still, there was no point in adding any more unpleasantness.</p><p>\u201cI have something for you,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cUmm ... I\u2019m tempted, angel, but we have too many people here.\u201d</p><p>It took me a beat to understand he was teasing me. \u201cOh my God. You fiend.\u201d</p><p>I reached into my pocket and wrapped my fingers around his gift, which was safely shielded by a black velvet drawstring bag. It had a nice gift box, too, but I\u2019d elected to carry the present in my pocket, hoping to be spontaneous and give it to him when the moment was right. I didn\u2019t want to give it to him along with his other presents.</p><p>Turning to face him as I pulled the gift out, I offered it on both open palms. \u201cHappy birthday, ace.\u201d</p> <p>His gaze lifted from my hands to my face. There was a brightness to his eyes I saw only when I gave him something. It always made me want to give him more, give him everything. My husband so deserved to be happy. It was my life\u2019s mission to make sure he always was.</p><p>Gideon took the pouch and untied the drawstring.</p><p>\u201cI just want you to know,\u201d I began, trying to cover my nervousness, \u201cthat it\u2019s crazy difficult buying a gift for someone who has everything, including a good chunk of the island of Manhattan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting anything, but I always love what you give me.\u201d</p><p>I blew out my breath. \u201cWell, you may not want to use it, which is totally fine. I mean, don\u2019t feel obligated to\u2014\u201d</p><p>The platinum Vacheron Constantin pocket watch slid out into his waiting palm, the polished case twinkling when the sunlight hit it. Biting my lower lip, I waited for him to open it and look inside.</p><p>Gideon read the engraved words aloud. \u201cYours for all time, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can hold a little picture over the inscription. I\u2019d planned for that to be a photo from the renewal ceremony, but ...\u201d I cleared my throat when he looked at me with such love, it made everything flutter inside me. \u201cIt\u2019s old school, I know. I just thought, since you wear vests, that it might be something you could use. Although I know you wear a watch on your wrist, so probably not. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed me, shutting me up. \u201cI\u2019ll treasure this.

The caterer had stocked the outside kitchen with beverages and easy finger foods, and people were starting to poke through it all while the pork for the posole cooked in the oven.</p> <p>He held out his fist, then opened it to show me the gorgeous wedding band in his palm. Large round diamonds in a channel setting circled the entire band, shooting multi-hued sparks.</p><p>My fingers covered my mouth, my eyes watering all over again. The salt-flavored breeze danced around us, carrying the plaintive cries of seagulls soaring over the waves. The rhythmic surge of the tide against the shore lapped over my feet, anchoring me in the moment.</p><p>I reached for the ring with trembling fingers.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s hand closed up and he grinned. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I pushed at his shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t tease me!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, but I always deliver,\u201d he purred.</p><p>I glared at him. The wicked smirk faded.</p><p>His fingers brushed over my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m so proud to be your husband,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cIt\u2019s my greatest accomplishment to have been found worthy of that honor in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gideon.\u201d How he dazzled me. I was so overwhelmed by him, so filled by his love. \u201cI\u2019m the lucky one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve changed my life, Eva. And you did the impossible: you transformed me. I like who I am now. I never thought that would happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were always wonderful,\u201d I said fervently. \u201cI loved you when I saw you. I love you more now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t words to tell you what you mean to me.\u201d He opened his hand again. \u201cBut I hope that when you see this ring on your hand, you\u2019ll remember that you shine as brightly as diamonds in my life and you\u2019re infinitely more precious.\u201d</p><p>Pushing onto my toes, fighting the sinking of the wet sand, I sought out his mouth and nearly sobbed with joy when he kissed me. \u201cYou\u2019re the best thing that ever happened to me.\u201d</p><p>He was smiling as he took my hand and slid the ring on my finger, nestling it next to the beautiful Asscher diamond he\u2019d given me at our wedding.</p><p>Applause and cheers jolted both of us. We looked at the house and saw our families lined up along the railing, watching us. The children were already running down the stairs, chasing Lucky, who was eager to get to Gideon.</p><p>I understood that feeling all too well. For the rest of our lives, I would always run to him.</p><p>Taking a deep cleansing breath, I let the hope and the joy push the guilt and grief away, just for a moment.</p><p>\u201cThis is perfect,\u201d I murmured, the words lost in the wind. No dress, no flowers, no formality or ritual. Just Gideon and me, committed to each other, with those who loved us nearby.</p><p>Gideon caught me up and spun me, making me laugh with pure pleasure.</p> <p>\u201cI love you!\u201d I shouted, for all the world to hear.</p><p>My husband set me down and kissed me breathless. Then, with his lips to my ear, he whispered, \u201cCrossfire.\u201d</p><p>16</p><p>It was difficult to watch Eva trying to console Richard Stanton, who was a shell of the man we\u2019d spent the weekend with in Westport. He had been vibrantly alive then, seemingly younger than his years. Now, he looked frail and stooped, his broad shoulders weighted by grief.</p><p>A profusion of white flower arrangements covered every available surface in Stanton\u2019s sprawling penthouse living room, heavily perfuming the air. Photos of Monica were sprinkled liberally around the bouquets, showing Eva\u2019s mother in the best moments of her time with Stanton.</p><p>Victor sat with Cary and Trey in a smaller area tucked away from the main floor. When we first arrived, there had been a moment when Eva\u2019s father and Stanton stood frozen and staring at each other. I suspected each of them resented what the other man had possessed of Monica: Victor had her love, Stanton had the woman herself.</p><p>The doorbell rang. My gaze followed Eva and Martin as they walked together to answer it. Stanton didn\u2019t move from his wingback chair, his thoughts clearly turned inward. I\u2019d felt his pain when he first opened the door to us, his body visibly jerking at the sight of Eva.</p><p>It was good that my wife and I were leaving for the airport directly after. For a month, we\u2019d be away from the city and out of the spotlight. Hopefully, by the time we returned, Stanton could bear the sight of the daughter who looked so much like her mother, the woman he\u2019d loved. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCross.\u201d</p><p>Turning my head, I found Benjamin Clancy. Like Detective Graves, Clancy\u2019s eyes held the knowledge of what I\u2019d done to eliminate Nathan Barker as a threat to my wife. Unlike Graves, Clancy had helped cover up my involvement, staging the scene of the crime and another unrelated scene to cast blame onto a dead man who\u2019d paid for his own crimes with his life and wouldn\u2019t pay further for mine.</p><p>My brows rose in silent inquiry.</p><p>\u201cI need a minute.\u201d He gestured to the hallway beyond him without waiting for my agreement.</p> <p>\u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><p>I followed him to a library, taking in the shelves of books that lined the walls. The room smelled of leather and paper, the color palette a masculine blend of cognac and evergreen. Four distinct seating areas and a fully stocked bar invited guests to get comfortable and linger.</p><p>Clancy shut the door behind us and sat in one of the two club chairs facing the unlit fireplace. I took the other.</p><p>He got right to the point. \u201cMrs. Stanton left behind over twenty-five years\u2019 worth of handwritten journals and a backup computer drive with electronic journal entries. She asked that I pass them along to Eva in the event of her death.\u201d</p><p>Keeping my curiosity to myself, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure she gets them.\u201d</p> <p>He sat forward, setting his elbows on his knees. Ben Clancy was a big man, his biceps and thighs thick with muscle. He wore his dark blond hair in a severe military cut and his eyes had the flat, cold lethality of a great white shark\u2014but they warmed when he looked at Eva, like the loving glance of a very protective older brother.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to judge the best time to give them to her,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you may decide she should never see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d So I\u2019d have to go through them. It made me uncomfortable to think of doing so.</p><p>\u201cRegardless,\u201d Clancy went on, \u201cyou now have a new financial responsibility that you\u2019ll have to take over on Lauren\u2019s behalf. It\u2019s not inconsiderable, but you won\u2019t have any trouble managing it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d stiffened at the name he used, then grown more alert as he continued.</p><p>Nodding, he said, \u201cYou started researching her story after the Tramells died.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019d cleaned most of it up.\u201d Out of the entire conversation thus far, that was the one thing that made sense.</p><p>\u201cWhat I could. I dug into her past when Mr. Stanton became serious about their relationship. When I confronted her, she told me what I\u2019m about to tell you\u2014none of which is known to Mr. Stanton. I\u2019d like to keep it that way. He was happy. Who she was didn\u2019t affect him, so he doesn\u2019t need to know.\u201d</p><p>Whatever it was, Clancy had been swayed. Whether I would be, remained to be seen.</p><p>Clancy paused a moment. \u201cYou\u2019ll get more out of the journals. I haven\u2019t read them, but Lauren\u2019s story is certainly more compelling than the dry facts I\u2019ll give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. Go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLauren Kittrie was raised in a small town on the outskirts of Austin, Texas. Her family was poor. Her mother abandoned her and her twin sister with their father, who worked as a hand on a local ranch. He was a busy man, not much interested in or capable of raising two beautiful headstrong girls.\u201d</p><p>Sitting back, I took a page from Eva\u2019s book and tried to picture two teenage Monicas. The image was more than striking.</p><p>\u201cAs you can imagine,\u201d he continued, \u201cthey got noticed. Toward the end of high school, they\u2019d caught the attention of a group of wealthy college students from Austin. Punks, with a dangerous sense of entitlement. The leader was Jackson Tramell.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cShe married him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was later,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cLauren was savvy about men from the outset. She wanted out of the life her parents had, but she knew trouble when she saw it. She rebuffed him, many times. Her sister, Katherine, wasn\u2019t as smart. She thought Tramell could be her ticket out.\u201d</p><p>Unease caused me to sit back. \u201cHow much of this do I need to hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgainst Lauren\u2019s advice, Katherine went out with him. When she didn\u2019t come home either that night or the next day, Lauren called the police. Katherine was discovered by a local farmer in his field, barely conscious thanks to a toxic combination of street drugs and alcohol. She\u2019d been violently assaulted. Although it wasn\u2019t proven, it was suspected that multiple individuals were involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatherine was in bad shape,\u201d Clancy went on. \u201cThe hallucinogenic drugs in her system combined with the physical trauma of gang rape caused permanent brain damage. She needed round-the-clock care for an indefinite period of time, something their father couldn\u2019t afford.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Restless, I went to the bar, then realized a drink was the last thing I wanted.</p><p>\u201cLauren went to the Tramells, confronted them about their son and what she suspected he\u2019d done. He denied it and no one was able to prove a connection to him, owing to a lack of physical evidence at that time. But he saw an opportunity and took it. Lauren was the one he\u2019d wanted, so he got his parents to cover the expenses of basic care for Katherine in return for Lauren herself and her silence about the assault.\u201d</p><p>Turning to face him, I stared. Money could hide a multitude of sins. The fact that Stanton had effectively hidden Eva\u2019s past with sealed court files and nondisclosure agreements proved that. But Nathan Barker\u2019s father had let him pay for his crimes. The Tramells had gone out of their way to conceal their son\u2019s.</p><p>Clancy straightened in his chair. \u201cJackson wanted sex. Lauren negotiated with his parents to secure marriage, which she thought would provide some sort of guarantee that Katherine would always be looked after.\u201d</p> <p>I changed my mind about the drink and filled a tumbler to the halfway point with scotch.</p><p>\u201cFor a span of months, the situation between Lauren and Jackson was stable. They lived\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStable?\u201d A harsh laugh tore at my throat. \u201cShe just about sold herself to the man who orchestrated the gang rape of her twin sister. My God ...\u201d</p><p>I tossed back the liquor.</p><p>Monica\u2014or Lauren\u2014had been stronger than any of us had given her credit for. But was it worth it to Eva to learn that, considering the horror of the rest of it?</p> <p>\u201cThe situation was stable,\u201d Clancy reiterated, \u201cuntil she met Victor.\u201d</p><p>I caught his gaze. Just when you thought a situation was as bad as it could be, there was always worse.</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cShe became pregnant with Eva. When Jackson found out the baby wasn\u2019t his, he tried to take care of it\u2014with his fists. Although they lived in his parents\u2019 home, the older Tramells never interceded during arguments between the two. Lauren feared for the life of her child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe shot him.\u201d I ran my hands through my hair, wishing I could scrape the image out of my mind as easily. \u201cThe undetermined manner of death\u2014she killed him.\u201d</p><p>Clancy sat quietly, letting me absorb that revelation. I wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d killed to protect Eva.</p><p>I began to pace. \u201cThe Tramells helped Lauren get away with it. They had to. Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDuring the time Lauren was with Jackson, she quietly documented anything and everything she could use against him later. The Tramells valued their reputation\u2014and the reputation of their debutante daughter, Monica\u2014and they just wanted Lauren, and all the problems she\u2019d caused, gone. Lauren left with the clothes on her back and the understanding that, moving forward, Katherine\u2019s care was entirely her responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it was all for nothing,\u201d I muttered. \u201cShe was right where she started.\u201d</p><p>Then all the information clicked into place. \u201cKatherine\u2019s still alive.\u201d</p><p>Which explained Monica\u2019s marriages to wealthy men and her preoccupation with money. All these years, she had to know how shallow her daughter thought she was, but she\u2019d lived with it, instead of telling the truth.</p><p>Of course, I\u2019d hoped Eva would never learn what I had done to Nathan. I feared she would think I was a monster.</p><p>Clancy rose swiftly to his feet, despite his bulk. \u201cAnd as I mentioned at the outset, Katherine\u2019s care is now your financial responsibility. Whether you disclose any of this to Eva is something you\u2019ll have to weigh.\u201d</p><p>I studied him. \u201cWhy are you trusting me with this?\u201d</p><p>He straightened his jacket. \u201cI saw you throw yourself over Eva when Hall opened fire. That, along with how you dealt with Barker, tells me you\u2019ll do anything to protect her. If you think it\u2019s in her best interests to know, you\u2019ll tell her when the time is right.\u201d</p> <p>With a brusque nod of his head, he left the room.</p><p>I lingered, gathering my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Pivoting at the sound of Eva\u2019s voice, I faced the doorway and watched her come toward me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked, looking starkly beautiful in a simple black dress. \u201cI was looking all over for you. Clancy had to tell me where you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a drink,\u201d I told her, giving her a partial truth.</p><p>\u201cHow many drinks?\u201d The slight twinkle in her eye told me she wasn\u2019t upset about it. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in here awhile, ace. We have to take Dad to the airport.\u201d</p><p>Startled, I glanced at my watch, realized I\u2019d been lost in my own reflections for some time. It was an effort to come back to the present and stop mulling over Lauren\u2019s tragic history. I couldn\u2019t change the past. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But what I had to do was clear enough. I would see to her sister\u2019s welfare. I would take care of her beloved daughter. In those ways, I would honor the woman Monica had been. And one day, if it seemed like the right thing to do, I\u2019d introduce her to Eva.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I told my wife, taking her hand in mine.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked, knowing my moods so well.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I touched her cheek and gave her a soft smile. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cWhat an odd choice for a honeymoon hotel.\u201d</p><p>I turn my head to find my mom stretched out on the lounger beside me on the deck. She\u2019s wearing a purple bikini, her skin lightly tanned and firm, her nails painted an elegant nude.</p><p>Happiness fills me. I\u2019m so glad to see her again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a private joke,\u201d I explain, taking in the view of the Pacific Ocean glittering beyond the emerald ribbon of forest in front of us. \u201cI told Gideon I have a Tarzan fantasy, so he found us a luxury tree house.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d been delighted when I first saw the hotel suite suspended high above the ground in the arms of an ancient banyan tree. The panoramic views from its deck are indescribably beautiful, something Gideon and I enjoy whenever we step outside our leafy bower.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re Jane ...\u201d My mother shakes her head. \u201cI won\u2019t even comment.\u201d</p><p>I grin, glad I can still shock her speechless on occasion.</p><p>With a sigh, she leans her head back and closes her eyes, sunbathing. \u201cI\u2019m so glad your father has decided to move to New York. It gives me peace of mind to know he\u2019ll be there for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well ... I\u2019m getting used to the idea.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s harder accepting that my mom was a completely different person than who I\u2019d thought she was. I debate bringing all of that up. I don\u2019t want to mar the joy of spending time with her again. But her journal entries were written as letters to me and I can\u2019t help the need to respond.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been reading your diaries,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Her answer is casual. I feel anger and frustration but push them away. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you share any of your past with me before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant to.\u201d Her head turns toward me. \u201cWhen you were little, I planned to one day. Then Nathan ... happened, and you were recovering from that. And you met Gideon. I always thought there would be time.\u201d</p><p>I know that\u2019s not completely true. Life continues. Something would always serve as an excuse to wait longer. My mom hadn\u2019t held out for a time when I could accept all she\u2019d done for the sake of her sister; she\u2019d waited until she could.</p><p>It took a strong woman to make the choices and take the actions she had. It was good to know that about her, but more so to understand the source of her fragility. My mother had been a woman tormented by the path her life had taken. Killing Jackson had haunted her, because she\u2019d hated him so desperately and felt joy when he was dead, even as she felt horror for the murder itself.</p><p>Leaving my father behind had destroyed a vital part of her, as had living as if her sister, Katherine, didn\u2019t exist. My mother had been separated from two pieces of her heart yet somehow managed to go on. Her overprotectiveness made sense to me now\u2014she could not have imagined surviving if she lost me, too.</p><p>\u201cGideon says we\u2019ll go see Katherine when we get back,\u201d I tell her. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about moving her closer, so she can be part of our lives.\u201d I\u2019m bracing myself for that, knowing my aunt is my mother\u2019s twin.</p> <p>My mom looks at me with a sad smile. \u201cShe\u2019ll be happy to see you. She\u2019s been hearing about you for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I know from the journals that my mom could rarely see Katherine in person, since my mom\u2019s husbands preferred to keep their lovely wife close. She\u2019d had to settle for mailed letters and cards, since e-mails and calls left a trail.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I can\u2019t help but brag. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Tears fill my eyes.</p><p>She tilts her face up to the sun. \u201cFor so long, I was angry at the damage that had been done to Kathy\u2014I never got back the sister I knew. But then I realized her mind protected her from that one night of hell. She doesn\u2019t remember it. And as simple as her thoughts are now, she finds a childlike joy in everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of her,\u201d I promise.</p><p>My mom holds out her hand and I take it. \u201cDo tree houses have champagne?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I laugh and squeeze her fingers. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>I woke slowly, drifting lazily upward from the depths of sleep into full awareness. Dappled sunlight filtered through the mosquito netting cocooning the bed. I stretched, my arm sliding over to search for my husband, but he wasn\u2019t lying beside me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Instead, I found Gideon standing at the window in the rustic nook he was using as an office, talking on the phone. For a moment, I just soaked up the sight of him. Disheveled and unshaven, he was so totally sexy I could hardly stand it. The fact that Lucky sprawled at his feet only added to the yumminess.</p><p>Gideon was wearing nothing but shorts, with the zipper tugged up and the button undone so I could see that he was commando. It was about as far as he got when it came to dressing on our honeymoon. Some days, the only thing he wore was sweat, which looked and smelled so damn hot on him I made sure he worked up more of it.</p><p>As for me, I\u2019d been surprised to find my packing augmented with a lot of strapless tube dresses and a noticeable lack of underwear. At any moment, I could find myself bent over, my skirt flipped up, and some part of my husband\u2019s anatomy sliding into me. We\u2019d been on our honeymoon for two weeks and in that time, Gideon had trained my body to anticipate his lust. He could arouse me in moments, satisfy us both nearly as quickly.</p><p>It was deliciously, insatiably hedonistic.</p><p>In between bouts of crazed monkey sex, we\u2019d spent time talking and making plans for when we returned to the world. We watched movies and played card games, with Gideon teaching me how to play well. He did occasionally have to work and when he did, I read the diaries my mother left behind for me. It had taken him a couple of days to tell me about them, but when he did, it was the right time.</p><p>We talked about those a lot, too.</p><p>\u201cThe demand is unreasonable,\u201d Gideon said into his phone, eyeing me in my short silk robe. \u201cThere\u2019s wiggle room elsewhere. They need to be redirected to those fluid points.\u201d</p><p>Blowing him a kiss, I backed out and headed to the kitchen.</p><p>I looked out onto the deck while the coffee brewed, at the copse of trees beyond that, and the ocean beyond that. Maybe we\u2019d go to the beach today. We had a spot that was ours alone. For now, just being with each other was all we wanted.</p><p>A tingle raced down my spine as I heard Lucky\u2019s paws hurrying across the hardwood floors. He would be following alongside Gideon, whom he worshipped. My husband was more than a little fond of Lucky, too. The nightmares were coming less and less frequently, but when they did, Lucky was handy to have around.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Gideon murmured, his arms encircling me.</p><p>I leaned into him. \u201cI think it\u2019s technically afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could go back to bed until evening,\u201d he purred, nuzzling my neck.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t bored you yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel, if you\u2019re bored, I\u2019ll put more back into it.\u201d</p><p>I shivered at the image that came to mind with those words. Gideon was a vigorous lover on an average day. Since we\u2019d been on our honeymoon, he had been even more so. I could swear his body was even more lean and ripped now than before, just from the exercise he got making love to me. Certainly I was happier with my body than I\u2019d been in years.</p><p>\u201cWho was on the phone?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cMy brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Isn\u2019t that the third time in the last couple of weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be jealous. You\u2019re much sexier than he is.\u201d</p><p>I bumped him with my elbow.</p><p>Gideon had told me about Hugh\u2019s files and that Chris had talked to Christopher. What was said during that conversation, we didn\u2019t know. That was something private between father and son. But whatever it was, Christopher had e-mailed Gideon twice\u2014three times now\u2014asking for advice.</p><p>\u201cIs it always business he wants to talk about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but the stuff he\u2019s asking ... He already knows the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything personal?\u201d</p><p>Gideon had been assured by Chris that nothing of his abuse had been relayed to his brother, and my husband wasn\u2019t inclined to change that. Christopher had caused a lot of damage over the years, and without an apology, Gideon wasn\u2019t writing a blank check of forgiveness any time soon.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAre we having fun ... How\u2019s the weather ... That sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s reaching out in his own way, I guess.\u201d I shrugged it off, too. \u201cWanna head down to the beach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could ...\u201d</p><p>Turning in his arms, I looked up at him. \u201cSomething else on your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to run a couple of things by you before I put work aside for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let me caffeinate first.\u201d</p><p>I was smiling as we fixed our coffee. Once we reached his office, he woke up his laptop.</p><p>The image on the screen was self-explanatory. I pulled out the chair and sat. \u201cMore GenTen creative?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019d seen a dozen different ad concepts so far. Some of the messaging was clever, some was too clever, and some was just pedestrian.</p><p>\u201cRefinements to the last round,\u201d he explained, setting one hand on the back of the chair and the other on the desk, surrounding me with warm skin and delicious masculine scent. \u201cAnd some new directions.\u201d</p><p>Scrolling through the deck, I nodded at most, but one made me shake my head. \u201cThat\u2019s a no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it, either,\u201d Gideon agreed. \u201cBut why doesn\u2019t it work for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s sending the wrong message. You know, the overwhelmed wife/mother/businesswoman can only find quiet time by distracting the family with the GenTen.\u201d I looked at him. \u201cWomen are capable of wearing those various hats easily. Let\u2019s show her playing the games with the family or enjoying the GenTen for herself.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI said I wouldn\u2019t ask again, but since we\u2019re discussing women having it all ... Are you still feeling good about leaving your job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d There was no hesitation before answering. \u201cI still want to work,\u201d I qualified, \u201cand helping you with things you don\u2019t need help with isn\u2019t going to satisfy me for long. But we\u2019ll find a place where I fit.\u201d</p><p>His mouth quirked wryly. \u201cI do appreciate your take or I wouldn\u2019t ask for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d He swiped and tapped on the trackpad, bringing up a presentation. \u201cThese are a few of the projects currently taking priority. When you have time, look them over and let me know which ones interest you most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all interest you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I\u2019d make a few lists, order them by interest, and knowledge base, and skill set. Then cross-reference. Most important, I would discuss everything with Gideon. That was what I enjoyed most about sharing his work with him\u2014exploring that fascinating razor-sharp mind of his.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to tie you down,\u201d he said quietly, his hand moving to my shoulder and brushing down my arm. \u201cI want you to soar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby.\u201d I caught his caressing hand and kissed the back of it. The sky was the limit with a husband who loved you like that.</p> <p>The sun dipped below the edge of the horizon, setting fire to the ocean.</p><p>Gideon refilled our flutes with champagne, a small splash of the golden liquid escaping the rim as the yacht rocked gently on the waves.</p><p>\u201cThis is nice,\u201d he said, giving me a slow, easy smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d</p><p>It amazed me to see him so happy and relaxed. I\u2019d always thought of Gideon Cross as a tempest. Lightning and thunder, fiercely beautiful power that could be both dangerous and compelling. Barely contained, like the vortex of a tornado.</p><p>I would describe him as the calm after a storm now, which only made him an even greater force of nature. We were both ... centered now. Feeling confident and committed. Having each other made everything achievable.</p><p>All of which had led me to thinking about a dinner cruise.</p><p>\u201cCome here, angel.\u201d Standing, he held his hand out to me.</p> <p>We carried our champagne from the candlelit dining table to the luxurious chaise longue for two. We settled there, tangled with each other.</p><p>His hand stroked up and down my back. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of blue skies and smooth sailing.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. So often our thoughts followed similar paths.</p><p>Reaching up, I cupped his nape, running my fingers through the rough silk of his hair. \u201cWe\u2019re getting the hang of this.\u201d</p><p>Gideon dipped his head down to kiss me, his mouth moving gently, his tongue licking leisurely, reaffirming the bond between us that grew stronger every day. The ghosts of our pasts seemed like faint shadows now, beginning to dissolve even before we\u2019d renewed our vows.</p><p>One day, they would vanish forever. Until then, we had each other. And that was all we needed. </p> </body></html>"]
