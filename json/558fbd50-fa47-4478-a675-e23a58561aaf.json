Strut your stuff, baby!\u201d</p><p>Channing thrust out her enormous rack, hardened nipples leading the charge. She completely overshadowed the other contestants. She grinned saucily. It was the first time since her thirteenth birthday she hadn\u2019t been ashamed of her large breasts.</p> <p>Amidst catcalls and wolf whistles she sexed it up, shimmying her hips. Stretching on tiptoe to force the tight T-shirt higher up her flat belly. Widening her stance, she spun on her boot heels, bent over, and grabbed her ankles, jiggling her ass and her boobs.</p><p>The crowd of men went absolutely wild.</p><p>The tease paid off when Moose announced she\u2019d won the Golden Knockers trophy and one hundred bucks.</p><p>\u201cYee-haw!\u201d she yelled and jumped from the bar.</p><p>Never in a million years would anyone she grew up with believe Channing would enter a wet T-shirt contest, let alone win first place.</p> <p>A tiny chorus of Toby Keith\u2019s \u201cHow Do You Like Me Now?\u201d broke out inside her head and she smirked.</p><p>After receiving congratulations from admiring cowboys on the circuit and a few frat brats, she poured a fresh kamikaze in the trophy cup. She toasted herself in the cracked mirror behind the bar and liked what she saw.</p><p>She glanced around, half-afraid she\u2019d see Jared storming toward her, intent on spoiling her fun by dragging her off to celebrate her victory in private. The man was seriously antisocial. And dammit, she was having fun for a change.</p><p>The Western bar was jam-packed. Jared hated crowds, but he hated leaving her alone in a crowd\u2014especially a group of horny, drunken men.</p><p>Where could he have gone?</p><p>Did she really care?</p> <p>Sweet, warm breath tickled her ear. \u201cLookin\u2019 for someone, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Channing tilted her head. Colby McKay\u2014king of the rodeo circuit\u2014stared down at her. From far away he looked a total package. Up close he was simply stunning. Icy blue eyes, dark chestnut hair and chiseled features that weren\u2019t typical rugged cowboy, but rather, brought to mind the image of a brooding poet.</p><p>His toned body spoke of his athletic prowess with horses and bulls; his thickly muscled arms and big, callused hands spoke of his skill with ropes. Mmm. Mmm. He was yummy and he knew it. He also was aware he made her skittish as a new colt.</p><p>She flipped her hair over her shoulder, a nervous gesture she hoped he\u2019d misread as dismissive. \u201cHey, Colby. Have you seen Jared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on his cell phone over by the bathroom.\u201d The eye-catching cowboy flashed his dimples. \u201cWhich leaves you unattended. Which is a damn shame. Dance with me.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach jumped, a reaction she blamed on booze, and not the intensely sexy way Colby studied her.</p><p>Okay, that was a total lie. She always acted tongue-tied whenever she got within licking distance of Colby, and his equally sexy traveling buddy, Trevor Glanzer.</p><p>Jared had kept her sequestered so she hadn\u2019t put truth to the rumors Colby and Trevor were the bad boys of the circuit. She knew they were fierce competitors; they worked hard and played hard\u2014on and off the dirt. She\u2019d seen the buckle bunnies of all ages and sizes constantly vying for their attention.</p> <p>But she, little city-slicker nobody Channing Kinkaid, had captured Colby\u2019s interest.</p><p>So, for some unknown reason, Trevor and Colby courted her shamelessly at every opportunity. Sometimes separately. Sometimes double-teaming her with hefty doses of good ol\u2019 boy charm. It made her wonder what it\u2019d be like to have them double-teaming her in private.</p><p>Whoo-ee. With as hard as they rode livestock? They\u2019d probably break the damn bed frame. Or her.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Channing,\u201d Colby cajoled. \u201cOne dance.\u201d</p><p>Jarred from her fantasy of becoming a Colby/Trevor sandwich, she stammered, \u201cI-I\u2019m all wet. And I smell like beer.\u201d</p><p>Colby\u2019s hot gaze zoomed to her chest. \u201cI ain\u2019t complainin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be once I\u2019m plastered against you and getting you wet.\u201d</p><p>He bent to her ear and murmured, \u201cNuh-uh, shug. I like my women wet. Really wet. I like it when they get that wetness all over me. All over my fingers. All over my face. All over my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby McKay!\u201d Flustered by the image of his dark head burrowed between her legs, his mouth shiny-wet with her juices, she attempted to push him away. He didn\u2019t budge. The man redefined rock solid. No wonder bulls and broncs had a tough time tossing him off.</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t as indignant as you\u2019d like me to believe, Miz Channing. In fact\u2014\u201d he nipped her earlobe, sending tingles in an electric line directly to her nipples, \u201c\u2014I suspect a firecracker such as yourself prefers dirty talk.\u201d</p><p>The subtle pine scent of Colby\u2019s aftershave and the underlying hint of aroused male soaked into her skin more thoroughly than the beer. A purely sexual shiver worked loose from her head to the pointed toes of her cowgirl boots.</p><p>\u201cCome on and dance with me. Let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t spread that wetness around a little.\u201d Without waiting for her compliance, Colby tugged her toward the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cHonky Tonk Badonkadonk\u201d blasted from the speakers.</p><p>The second they were engulfed by the mass of dancers, Colby hauled her flush against his firm body. A big, strapping man, he was hard everywhere\u2014from his brawny chest to his powerfully built thighs. No two-stepping for them. He clasped her right hand in his left, nestling his right palm in the small of her back. That single touch seared her flesh like a red-hot brand.</p><p>Lord. And the long hard thing poking her belly sure as shooting wasn\u2019t his championship belt buckle.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Channing nodded, even when her head spun with the idea the hottest cowboy on the circuit had a massive hard-on for her\u2014right here in front of rodeo queens, stock contractors, old timers and everyone else.</p><p>\u201cSee? This ain\u2019t so bad, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Actually, it\u2019s really nice, Colby.\u201d She rested her cheek on his chest and sighed softly.</p><p>\u201cNice? I\u2019ll take that, though, I\u2019d prefer naughty.\u201d His hold on her tightened. \u201cBe nicer yet if we were naked,\u201d he whispered against her temple.</p><p>Naked line dancing. That might be interesting. Gave a new definition to the term swingers.</p><p>Booted feet shuffled and stomped in the sawdust. Men and women whirled in flashes of bright fringe and glittering rhinestones. Finally Colby spoke again. \u201cCan I ask you something, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you end up with Jared?\u201d</p><p>Because I didn\u2019t see you first.</p><p>Channing didn\u2019t look up; rather she studied the pearl studs on his plaid western shirt. \u201cWe met after he did a bull-riding exhibition. We got to talking and I told him I wanted an adventure. We hooked up and here I am. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you ain\u2019t goofy in love with him? Hopin\u2019 he\u2019ll put a ring on your finger at summer\u2019s end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Truth be told, she suspected she\u2019d made a mistake in choosing Jared. Beneath his enchanting Australian accent lurked a moody, possessive man with secrets. She had no idea what to do about it.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis don\u2019t seem like your thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Traveling on the rodeo circuit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that too. But mostly I was talkin\u2019 \u2018bout a classy broad like you shackin\u2019 up with that lyin\u2019 slimeball.\u201d</p><p>Channing glanced up. Instead of acting snappy and defensive, she batted her eyelashes and sweetened her tone. \u201cWhy, Colby McKay, I didn\u2019t realize you cared about my virtue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t your virtue I\u2019m concerned about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>His hungry gaze captured every nuance of her face, ultimately homing in on her mouth. Heat from his eyes raced down her spine, gathering in her core. She felt more exposed than if he\u2019d stripped her buck-naked.</p><p>\u201cJesus. Every time I look at you I lose my damn train of thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Cause you got the sweet face of an innocent and the body of a high-priced whore.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open.</p><p>Studying her eyes, Colby gave her a devilish smile and lowered his head. Taking advantage of her parted lips, his tongue darted inside her mouth. No hard, fast kiss. Just a fleeting brush of his soft lips. A lingering stroke of his velvety tongue. His heated breath mingled with hers and her pulse quickened. Everywhere.</p><p>Oh. As his talented tongue slid along hers, any pretense of her resistance fled. She savored his taste; a spicy tang of beer, Copenhagen and toothpaste. Another shudder ran through her and she moaned softly.</p><p>\u201cDoes that shock you, darlin\u2019?\u201d he murmured against the corner of her trembling mouth.</p><p>Channing forced her traitorous lips away from his lazy assault. \u201cDoes it shock me that you classify me as a whore, same as those buckle bunnies following you around? No.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flashed blue fire, as if she\u2019d somehow insulted him. \u201cI didn\u2019t call you a whore. I didn\u2019t call you an innocent, either, but I noticed you didn\u2019t focus on that portion of my remark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen explain yourself, Mr. McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spend way more time thinkin\u2019 \u2018bout you than I should, Miz Channing.\u201d Colby didn\u2019t miss a dance beat as he smoothly shoved a firm thigh between hers and waltzed her forward.</p><p>Startled by the searing friction of his leg grinding into her crotch, she blurted, \u201cWhat do you think about, when you\u2019re thinking about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I ain\u2019t fantasizin\u2019 \u2018bout holdin\u2019 your hand and takin\u2019 you to the Sunday church ice-cream social.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2019m. Though, my thoughts do tend to wander on how many ways I can take you nine-ways-til-Sunday.\u201d</p><p>A blush crawled up her neck. \u201cWhy do you do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTease me all the time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI ain\u2019t teasin\u2019 you. I just made my intentions clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you talked about your fantasies. Not your intentions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat mean you think I\u2019m all talk? I guarantee I\u2019m not foolin\u2019 around, Channing, darlin\u2019.\u201d He nuzzled her temple, tracking soft, moist kisses up her hairline and back down to her ear. He blew gently. Then he sucked all the air back out.</p> <p>Channing actually felt the sharp vibration in her pussy. This wild man could make her sopping wet with one well-placed whisper.</p><p>\u201cA little haughty, ain\u2019t ya?\u201d His fingers slipped under the hem of her shirt. Callused fingertips idly stroked the damp skin beneath the waistband of her jeans on her lower back. \u201cI like your fire. A woman like you could burn a man up. And I\u2019d enjoy every hot second as I went down in flames.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught at the eroticism in his simple words and teasing touch.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to see how far you can push me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect you\u2019re embarrassed to admit you\u2019d like to be pushed by me. Or tied up, trussed up, any way I want you. At my every wicked whim. And no doubt, shug, I know my way around wicked.\u201d</p> <p>Something about this straight-talking, sweet-talking man made her wild. And horny as hell.</p><p>\u201cColby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh. When you wise up to what Jared really is doin\u2019, come talk to me before you do anything rash, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me, Channing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Cause, sweetheart, I\u2019m dyin\u2019 to show you what you\u2019ve been missin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Another hot burst of moisture exploded in her panties. \u201cWhat about Jared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, what about me, mate?\u201d Jared said.</p><p>She wheeled around guiltily. Crap. Jared lurked less than two feet away, his hands rested accusingly on his lean hips, as he glared at them.</p><p>Colby released her and retreated. \u201cNothin\u2019. You\u2019re a lucky fella, that\u2019s all.\u201d He tipped his hat to Channing and winked. \u201cThanks for the dance.</p><p>See you around. Remember what I said.\u201d</p><p>Channing watched Colby until he disappeared out the side door, a predatory cowgirl hot on his boot heels.</p><p>Jared snagged her hand and jerked her into an awkward embrace.</p> <p>\u201cWhat were you and King Cheese yapping about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should watch out for him and his buddy, Trevor. Nasty pair, those two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>Jared tromped on her toe as he twirled her sideways. \u201cHaven\u2019t you seen the way the lasses gather around them? Not that I begrudge the blokes for taking their pick of pussy, but crikey. What they expect those chippies to do with not one, but both of them? At the same time?\u201d</p><p>What would it feel like, writhing between two hard male bodies? Two sets of rough-skinned hands touching her. Two hot, hungry mouths, kissing, tasting, licking, tormenting every bared inch of her quivering flesh. Two big cocks demanding entrance into her body.</p><p>\u201cYou listening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how have you seen them doing...things with one woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. They don\u2019t hide it. Ask anyone what they done last year behind the chutes in Cheyenne.\u201d He leaned in so she heard the full account. \u201cThey had this young chickie stretched out naked over a stack of saddles. Hands tied behind her back with a piggin\u2019 string. A bandana covering her eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she there willingly?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cThose kind of women always are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were they doing to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsing her like a blow-up toy. She was sucking Trevor\u2019s cock as Colby nailed her from behind. Then they\u2019d switch, like some kinda Chinese fire drill. Laughing, carrying on. They\u2019ve no shame, either of them. No respect for women either, if you ask me. Then joking afterwards about that being the proper way to \u2018break in a new saddle\u2019.\u201d His gaze narrowed. \u201cWhy? Did that cheese head proposition you?\u201d</p><p>I wish. \u201cUmm. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Stay away from their other traveling partner, Edgard.</p><p>Something about that bloke rubs me the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s foul mood required an abrupt switch in the conversation.</p><p>\u201cGuess what? I won the wet T-shirt contest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you bloody well should have. You\u2019ve got fantastic tits, love.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s hand snaked up her belly. He yanked up the damp shirt and cupped her bared left breast.</p><p>Channing squirmed. \u201cHello? We\u2019re in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if you want to maul me, let\u2019s go back to the room.\u201d She tugged the shirt down to cover her belly.</p><p>\u201cAh. I see. You can flash these titties to the whole bar, but the minute I want to touch them, they\u2019re off-limits? Crikey, I could\u2019ve stayed in the Outback and gotten that attitude.\u201d</p><p>An acute sense of unease built. \u201cWhat is wrong with you tonight? You eat a bad kiwi or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen knock it off.\u201d</p><p>He laughed harshly. Meanly. \u201cLittle Miss Prim and Proper, are we now, love?\u201d</p><p>Jared squeezed her nipple hard enough that it brought tears to her eyes. She slapped his hand.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t how you were last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much have you been drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot nearly enough.\u201d He puffed up with belligerence. \u201cI oughta be asking you that question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why. A little liquid courage is what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed for what, Jared?\u201d</p><p>Jared clamped his hands on her hips, spun her until they were back to front and he dry humped her. \u201cA few beers would loosen you up. When you gonna give up this tight ass? It\u2019s been a week and I\u2019m bloody well tired of waiting.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the burning in her cheeks, Channing twisted from his hold.</p><p>She latched on to his polyester shirt with both hands, hauling herself up until they were nose to nose. \u201cLower your voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bothers you? People hearing you love to do the nasty stuff? Or knowing you\u2019re a hypocrite for begging me to use my fingers on your tight little hole, and then pretending it disgusts you?\u201d</p><p>Infuriated, she released his lapels. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t disgust me. The way you\u2019re acting disgusts me.\u201d She wasn\u2019t ashamed of a thing they\u2019d done behind closed doors. But him talking about it as if it were some big joke made her feel used and cheap.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019matter? Truth sting a bit, love?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. Who was this cruel man? Something had set him off tonight. Before she could formulate a snappy response, Cash Big Crow sauntered up and tapped Jared on the shoulder.</p><p>Cash was another heart-stoppingly handsome cowboy on the rodeo circuit. Native American, short and stocky, with long dark hair he wore in a braid, he had a grin as wide as the brim of his black Stetson. Cash was a little older than the youngsters on the circuit, and bit bowlegged from years spent riding bulls, broncs and \u201canything that bucked\u201d.</p><p>\u201cHoka-hey. Hope I\u2019m not interruptin\u2019 a lovers\u2019 spat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d Jared snarled. \u201cWhat the bloody hell do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, hold on, partner. Just wanted to return this to the lady.\u201d He handed Channing her trophy. \u201cYou forgot it on the bar. Wouldn\u2019t want some other gal to steal it, seeings you worked so hard to win it.\u201d He winked.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and this.\u201d Cash held out a silver cell phone to Jared. \u201cYou left it in the can.\u201d</p><p>Jared snatched it. \u201cAppreciate it. Now move along, mate.\u201d</p><p>Channing had endured enough of Jared and was tempted to ask Cash to take her back to the motel. Let Jared sort out his fit of temper on his own. She wasn\u2019t his goddamn babysitter.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You waiting for a tip?\u201d Jared demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d Cash took a couple of steps, then turned back. He gave Channing a pitying look before addressing Jared. \u201cYour wife called your phone while I was in the bathroom, that\u2019s why I picked it up. She wants you to call her back right away.\u201d</p><p>Dead silence, ugly as the antelope-horn chandeliers hanging above them.</p><p>\u201cWife?\u201d Channing repeated.</p><p>When Jared\u2019s gaze zoomed to hers then flitted away, she knew the truth.</p><p>The bastard was married. He\u2019d lied to her. Guilt, shame and fury arose inside her.</p><p>Jared spun on Cash to chew him out.</p><p>Without thinking, Channing blindly swung the trophy and clocked Jared in the back of the head.</p><p>He crumpled to the floor.</p><p>She froze. Shit. What had she done? What if she\u2019d killed him?</p><p>Spending her life in a Southern prison wearing orange paper shoes wasn\u2019t part of her big adventure.</p><p>Clutching the trophy like a shield, she dropped to her knees and accidentally squashed Jared\u2019s hat. She gingerly touched his head. A big bump protruded from the back of his neck. No blood though. Good thing she had lousy aim. His chest rose and fell so she knew he wasn\u2019t dead.</p><p>A sick sort of relief swamped her.</p><p>\u201cHey, slugger, you okay?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at Cash. \u201cNo. Cash. Please. I didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you didn\u2019t, sweets. You don\u2019t seem the type to mess around with a married fella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d New experiences did not include becoming a home wrecker.</p><p>Her stomach churned. \u201cPlease get me out of here. I can\u2019t stay with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he can\u2019t stay here to get trampled. Grab his boots. Let\u2019s move him outta the way first before we figure out what to do with you.\u201d</p><p>After they\u2019d hauled Jared through the sawdust to a dark corner, he came around. He plopped his lopsided hat on and kept his face aimed at the floor.</p><p>She doubted the jerk felt any shame. Only anger that he\u2019d gotten caught.</p><p>Cash took her aside. \u201cYou stayin\u2019 at the Silver Spur tonight?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded and hugged her trophy.</p><p>\u201cGet your stuff and head over there.

Just sorry you found out the way you did.\u201d</p><p>Channing snuck out of the bar without talking to anyone else from the circuit. She unloaded her three pieces of luggage from Jared\u2019s truck\u2014and liberated his bottle of whiskey.</p><p>A six-foot neon sign shaped like a cowboy boot, announcing The Silver Spur Motor Inn, flashed \u201cNO VACANCY\u201d. Luckily she\u2019d already secured a room. She dragged her belongings across the highway and let herself into number 111.</p><p>Once locked inside, she panicked. What was she going to do? No way did she want to turn tail and run back to the tiresome life she\u2019d fled.</p><p>Served her right for trusting someone. It would\u2019ve been nice, for once in her life, not to have to be so damn self-reliant. Wrong again.</p><p>She should leave. Right away. Tonight.</p><p>Colby\u2019s words surfaced: Come talk to me before you do anything rash.</p><p>The scared part of her wanted to run to Colby right now. Demand to know why he hadn\u2019t told her Jared was married.</p><p>But in his own way, Colby had warned her.</p><p>Reality check: She doubted this one-stoplight town had a rental car agency or even a bus stop. Nothing she could do about her predicament tonight. She\u2019d deal with it all tomorrow.</p><p>A steaming hot shower and three generous slugs of whiskey later, Channing drifted off into an uneasy sleep.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The woman\u2019s lips left a bright red lipstick trail down Colby\u2019s blood-darkened shaft as she released his cock. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Open wider. Like that. Take it all.\u201d</p><p>The naked brunette bobbed her head. Her soft, hot mouth worked from the pulsing root to the throbbing tip of his cock. The wet sucking sounds coupled with her happy humming moans ricocheted in the tiny humid bathroom as an erotic echo.</p><p>Colby sighed and threaded one hand through her long hair, shivering at the sensation of the baby-soft strands teasing the inside of his thighs.</p><p>The pointed tips of her nipples stabbed his knee as her mouth rocked back and forth, making her big tits sway enticingly.</p><p>He slid his hands down her face and neck to roll those tightened nubs between his fingertips. Tugging. Pulling. Twisting. Making them harder. Redder. Wishing he hadn\u2019t left those nipple clamps back in Salt Lake. This woman seemed the adventurous type.</p><p>She rubbed her slender thighs together, arching into his rougher touch. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too.\u201d He shifted his ass forward on the counter and spread his knees. \u201cPlay with my balls, baby.\u201d He didn\u2019t call her by name because, frankly, he didn\u2019t remember her name.</p> <p>He\u2019d hooked up with her outside the Last Chance Saloon after he\u2019d left Channing with Jared. Frustrated, he\u2019d needed someone, anyone, to get him off. As quickly as possible. Sex always cooled his temper. And if he couldn\u2019t be with the one he wanted, he\u2019d be with someone who wanted him, even if for the wrong reasons.</p><p>This chick knew the score; one night, no promises, and bragging rights that she\u2019d blown the number two All-Around Cowboy on the Mountain and Plains Circuit. She\u2019d gotten right down to business the minute they\u2019d returned to the motel. Shedding her skintight clothes.</p><p>Fondling his buckle as she dropped to her knees, sucking his dick like a starving woman facing an opulent banquet. Hell, he hadn\u2019t even kissed her.</p><p>His thoughts traveled to Channing Kinkaid. Jesus. Why was he so obsessed with that little spitfire? She wasn\u2019t even his type. But one kiss from her and his cock had gotten hard as a railroad spike.</p><p>For a moment he let himself imagine it was Channing deep-throating him. Channing\u2019s moans of delight reverberating up his shaft. Channing\u2019s sweet-scented hair knotted in his hands. Channing\u2019s wanton tongue lapping the come out of the slit in his cock.</p><p>Oh hell yeah.</p><p>Then long fingernails scraped across his balls and he inhaled sharply, expecting pain. But the woman expertly rolled his sac, knowing exactly how much pressure to use for maximum pleasure. Never missing a lick or stroke with that marvelous suctioning mouth and wickedly skillful tongue.</p><p>Good as it felt, much as he loved a no-strings-attached blowjob, Colby just wanted her to finish him off so he could escape.</p><p>\u201cFaster,\u201d he panted. \u201cSuck harder. Yeah, like that. A few more strokes and you know I\u2019m gonna shoot my load. Then Trevor will take care of you. Got yourself a twofer tonight, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>The bathroom door opened. She never even lifted her head.</p><p>Colby glanced over at a grinning Trevor.</p><p>\u201cShe ready for me yet?\u201d Trevor asked.</p><p>\u201cClose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot damn!\u201d Trevor shucked off his Wranglers and T-shirt. His big belt buckle clunked on the tile. Colby didn\u2019t bother to gawk at his friend\u2019s naked form. Threesomes were nothing new.</p><p>The crackling of a condom package ripping open sounded beside him.</p><p>The woman gyrated her hips and moaned, \u201cYes. Oh please. Please fuck me. Now. From behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter Colby comes,\u201d Trevor said. \u201cDon\u2019t want you bitin\u2019 down on anything important. He\u2019s pretty fond of that big cock of his.\u201d</p><p>She whimpered. Realizing she wouldn\u2019t get off until Colby did, she switched tactics, moving her mouth and hand in tandem, faster and faster. Saliva ran down the length of his dick and coated his balls.</p><p>That was all it took.</p><p>Colby threw back his head. \u201cCome on, work those throat muscles and swallow it all. Ah. Shit yeah.\u201d</p><p>She gulped noisily. Colby felt her gag reflex kick in, but he was too far gone to care. He held her head tightly, keeping that delectable mouth in place until every last spurt burst from the end of his cock.</p><p>Spent, he sagged against the mirror. Breathing hard. \u201cDamn. That was good.\u201d</p><p>Colby caressed the woman\u2019s cheek as his dick slipped from between silky smooth lips. By the time he\u2019d opened his eyes, Trevor had already positioned her on the bathmat on all fours.</p><p>Her hand was on her dark muff, furiously rubbing her clit. Her sharp white teeth sank into her bottom lip; her eyes were squeezed shut in rapture. She\u2019d tilted her ass in the air for Trevor\u2019s use.</p><p>Trevor spread her cheeks wide and rammed into her cunt in one rapid stroke. \u201cChrist, woman,\u201d he growled, \u201cyou\u2019re wet. You must really like sucking cock.\u201d</p><p>A feminine grunt. \u201cStop talking and fuck me harder. I\u2019m close to coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy. I don\u2019t know if I like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPunish me then. God. Do anything. Just make me come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe this\u2019ll help you along.\u201d Trevor whacked her ass. Four sharp blows on each deeply tanned cheek.</p><p>The woman started to climax. Loudly. Shrieking like a wheezing donkey. Thrashing like she was having a seizure.</p><p>Colby wondered how much of her reaction was real. Talk about cynical.</p><p>Spurred on by her enthusiasm, Trevor fucked her with such ferocity the bathmat skidded sideways across the floor.</p><p>Colby watched the scene before him dispassionately. He should be raring to join in. He wasn\u2019t. In fact, his cock had already gone completely limp.</p><p>A sad situation at thirty-one; he was sick of trolling for pussy. Same old, same old. A quick fuck and suck, goodbye, then on to the next town.</p><p>He was getting old if he\u2019d been fantasizing about fucking the same woman a different way every night, rather than a different woman the same way every night.</p><p>Yeah, that one woman superstar in his lurid fantasies was none other than Channing Kinkaid. A temptress with her gold-flecked hazel eyes. A nymph with a riot of brown curls tumbling between her shoulder blades.</p><p>A witch\u2019s mouth, lush, ripe, the soft pink of peonies in spring. A curvy little body a man could sink his teeth and his cock into for weeks without surfacing.</p><p>Where the hell had that romantic nonsense come from?</p><p>Channing wasn\u2019t his. Although, he had been tempted to spill the beans about Jared\u2019s marital status tonight. But he\u2019d decided it wasn\u2019t his place. She\u2019d probably shoot the messenger rather than react how he\u2019d hoped\u2014running to him for protection, comfort and wickedly hot sex.</p><p>Right. Ignoring the thrashing twosome, he hopped off the counter and left them alone for the big finish.</p><p>In the cramped motel room, Edgard was stretched out on the double bed along the wall. He glanced up from watching the PBR Tour on VERSUS. \u201cDone already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You getting in on some action?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe later.\u201d</p><p>After Colby dressed he sat down on the opposite bed to pull on his boots.</p><p>\u201cWhere you going?\u201d Edgard asked.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s your turn, but I think I\u2019ll sleep in the horse trailer.</p><p>\u2018Night.\u201d</p><p>The next morning Channing leaned on the whitewashed split-rail fence and squinted at the fairgrounds.</p><p>What was she supposed to do now? Stuck high and dry in nowhere Oklahoma.</p><p>A few trucks and horse trailers remained in the parking lot. The arena was deserted. Most rodeo folk had already headed to the next event. Her stomach growled. She glanced at her watch. Noon.</p><p>The \u201cOpen\u201d sign blinked at the Last Chance Saloon. She shouldered her macram\u00e9 purse and trotted across the highway. Maybe they served food. Anything would be better than the vending machine selection of stale crackers and peanuts, or drowning her sorrows in chocolate.</p><p>Colby had finished loading hay for his horse when he heard voices approaching across the paddock. He snapped the locks on the trailer and leaned back against the metal gate bars to wait to see who was looking for him.</p><p>Cash and Trevor came around the rear end of the trailer, bickering like siblings.</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t my problem,\u201d Cash said. \u201cI\u2019m just glad to see that sumbitch gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he ain\u2019t gonna be happy she is. She\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s gone?\u201d Colby asked.</p><p>They both stopped. Trevor gave Cash an uneasy look. \u201cJared Connelly. He dropped out this morning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems his wife got wind of his female traveling partner and demanded he return to Australia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cServes that bastard right. Where\u2019s Channing now?\u201d</p> <p>Another nervous glance passed between Trevor and Cash.</p><p>Colby\u2019s stomach muscles tightened. \u201cI said: Where\u2019s Channing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing. We don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He counted to ten. \u201cDid she leave with him?\u201d</p><p>Cash snorted. \u201cNot after she smacked him upside the head with her trophy last night when she found out about his missus.\u201d</p> <p>Colby fought a smile. He would\u2019ve loved to\u2019ve seen that. \u201cWhere\u2019d she stay last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Silver Spur.\u201d</p><p>Damn. She could\u2019ve been in the room right next to him, listening to some strange chick suck him off. For the first time in a long time, his actions made him ashamed. \u201cWhat room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne eleven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you check on her this morning?\u201d</p><p>Trevor nodded. \u201cCash knocked. She didn\u2019t answer. So he came and got me and I tried. She wouldn\u2019t come to the door for me either. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s here. The maid wouldn\u2019t let us in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you ask the front desk if she\u2019d checked out?\u201d</p><p>Cash and Trevor exchanged a sheepish look.</p><p>Idiots.</p><p>Colby pushed away from the trailer and headed toward the motel office.</p><p>\u201cHey, Colby. Where you goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. He just kept walking. And tried like hell not to run.</p><p>Channing nursed a Bud Light in a corner booth. She picked at her second bowl of pretzels and listened to the jukebox wailing another sad song about love gone wrong. In her life even lust had gone wrong.</p><p>The cowbell on the front door clanked against the wood as the door opened again, then slammed shut. This was a busy place. Maybe if all else failed she could get hired to sling beer. Her focus strayed to the list of options she\u2019d jotted in her journal, none of which appealed to her.</p> <p>The bench seat across from her creaked. Thinking Moose had swung by to flirt, she smiled and looked up.</p><p>But Colby McKay grinned back at her. \u201cThought I might find you here, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Channing suppressed a feminine sigh. His dimples ought to be illegal. \u201cI figured you\u2019d already taken off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could say the same. I heard what happened last night.\u201d</p><p>She reached for her pencil. \u201cI\u2019m sure everyone has heard by now.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me Jared was married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019d be pissed off at me thinkin\u2019 I had some ulterior motive in tellin\u2019 you the truth.\u201d He spun her notebook around and studied it.</p><p>\u201cWhich is entirely true. But it don\u2019t matter now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ulterior motive why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Her heart thudded. She struggled to project an image of absolute calm. \u201cAs I\u2019m short on options, I\u2019m open to suggestions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Tell me something first, before we get into those options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you runnin\u2019 from?\u201d</p><p>It was tempting to hedge or flat out lie. She did neither. \u201cMy past. My future. Take your pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you oughta explain that confusin\u2019 comment to this dumb ol\u2019</p><p>country boy.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cDumb, yeah right. You don\u2019t fool me, Colby McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t fool me, Channing Kinkaid.\u201d</p><p>His meaning settled on her thick, sweet and sticky as wild honey.</p><p>\u201cMy story is not that interesting, actually. I\u2019ve followed the rules\u2014my parent\u2019s rules\u2014my whole life. Just like my older sister, I graduated from an Ivy League school of their choice. Got my Masters degree because that\u2019s what offspring of the people in their social circle do. My dad lined up a teaching job for me at a prestigious private prep school starting in the fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>She gripped the wooden pencil so tightly it cracked. \u201cAnd when Mom and Dad introduced me to a wimpy accountant who reeked of Old Spice and old money, and they encouraged me to accept his marriage proposal after one lousy date, I snapped. I realized I wasn\u2019t living my life; I was living theirs. I needed a break and ran away with the rodeo.\u201d</p><p>Colby smiled and gently removed the gnawed-on, broken pencil from her death grip. \u201cRegrets about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides my poor choice of a traveling partner? Strangely enough, no.\u201d</p><p>His thumb swept across the vein on the inside of her wrist, sending tingles up her forearm. \u201cWhat are your plans now that Jared is gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m sitting here trying to figure out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Colby angled across the narrow table and repeatedly brushed the back of his knuckles over her cheek. \u201cRun away with me, Channing.</p><p>At least until we get to Cheyenne next week.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d spoken the words she\u2019d wanted to hear. Yet, her sole focus was how the continual rasp of his rough skin on hers caused her insides to quake. Her blood to burn. Her sex to moisten.</p><p>Her breathing grew ragged when he trailed those callused fingertips down the gentle curve of her neck. He traced her collarbone with a touch as fleeting as the flutter of butterfly wings. Then he drew circles progressively lower on her chest. All while watching her reaction with his electric blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cNaturally, there\u2019d be conditions if I take you on.\u201d</p><p>Oh yeah. She\u2019d agree to any conditions as long as they included hot, wet, raunchy, shaking-the-rafters sex with him every single night. \u201cYou can be damn sure I\u2019ll know exactly what I\u2019m getting into this time before I go anywhere with you or anyone else like Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t like Jared at all,\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t smack you with my purse when you showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still scare you, though, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t. We\u2019re more alike than you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. You think that\u2019s why I kinda like you, cowboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And the feeling\u2019s mutual, shug.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cFirst things first. I can pay my own way to Cheyenne.\u201d</p><p>Annoyance flitted across his face. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a sweetie\u2014wife or girlfriend\u2014baking apple pies and waiting for you on the front porch back at home?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAfter this summer rodeo season ends, hopefully I\u2019ll have enough points accumulated to qualify me for the NFR in Vegas come December. If not, I oughta have enough to compete in the Dodge Circuit Finals in Pocatello in March. I\u2019ll keep up in the points standings by goin\u2019 to events closer to home. In the meantime I\u2019ll be back in Wyoming to help my dad and brothers run the ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd more likely than not I\u2019ll be teaching on the East Coast.\u201d</p><p>Something dark shifted in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThen we understand each other?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, not understanding his cryptic answer. \u201cSo, about these conditions.\u201d</p><p>Colby studied her carefully from beneath the brim of his hat. \u201cYou\u2019ll be in my bed.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse fluttered. \u201cI figured that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs well as Trevor and Edgard\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Channing\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cI\u2019d be sleeping with all three of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019d be fucking all three of us, ain\u2019t gonna be much sleepin\u2019</p><p>involved.\u201d Colby scooted forward, his handsome face serious, his blue eyes intent. \u201cForget about what other people might think, and consider what you want, Channing. What you\u2019ve always wanted but have been denied because it\u2019s been against those blasted rules you\u2019ve followed.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cI\u2019m still listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m used to havin\u2019 a different woman every night if I choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd these women you pick up have no problem being passed between the three of you?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cShockin\u2019, ain\u2019t it? What America\u2019s youth has come to?\u201d</p><p>Despite the surreal conversation, she smiled at his cheeky grin.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do with these willing women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck them. Sometimes one on one. More often than not, two on one.</p><p>The really darin\u2019 gals will take on all three of us at the same time.\u201d</p><p>How did that work? Which body parts went where? Don\u2019t ask. Act urbane. She murmured, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Colby reached over and twined a curly brown lock around his fingers.</p><p>He tugged her closer by that hank of hair until his warm breath flowed over her cheek.</p><p>\u201cDoes that fluster you? Thinkin\u2019 of some young, naked woman sandwiched between Trevor and me? With my cock deep in her ass and Trevor\u2019s cock in her cunt? And if Edgard\u2019s playin\u2019 with us, a cock in her mouth, too. Or does that make you wet with want?\u201d</p><p>Her vaginal walls throbbed and her clit spasmed, making her slit weep. Images of being pressed between all that hot, hard male flesh.</p><p>Being overfilled and stretched and used purely for pleasure? Hadn\u2019t she secretly fantasized about that very scenario? Giving up all control.</p><p>Being... taken.</p><p>A small helpless noise erupted from her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Colby asked and sat back. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t shock me.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared. \u201cIt excites you, don\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But, I\u2019ve never been with two guys at once or...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>Channing paused for him to fill in the blanks.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. Instead he swiped her beer and took a sip. \u201cSay it in plain English, darlin\u2019. You\u2019d better be able to say it if you want us to do it to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She knocked back a fortifying drink and muttered, \u201cI\u2019ve never tried anal sex.\u201d There.

I ain\u2019t being a jerk. I need to be perfectly clear on what you want.\u201d He licked the shell of her ear and blew softly. \u201cBesides. It\u2019s sexy as hell to hear those naughty words comin\u2019 out of such an angelic mouth.\u201d</p><p>Channing rubbed her face against the rough stubble on his cheek, lost in the sharp contrast of his male hardness to her female softness. He smelled heavenly. She whispered along his jaw, \u201cI want you to be the first man to take my ass, Colby McKay. I want to know what it\u2019s like to be with more than one man. Doing whatever you want to me.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a harsh breath. \u201cWhenever we want it?\u201d</p> <p>The outer door opened and a beam of light slanted across the bar, bouncing off the mirror and blinding her. She scooted away and nestled her spine against the Naugahyde booth. \u201cWithin reason,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not into exhibitionism. I\u2019ll do whatever you want as long as it\u2019s not in front of an audience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat constitutes as an audience? Because Edgard and Trevor and I share most everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn audience is any other cowboys on the circuit.\u201d She frowned, remembering Jared\u2019s description of Trevor and Colby\u2019s saddle-breaking exploits.</p><p>\u201cI know that look. What have you heard?\u201d</p><p>Channing told him.</p><p>Colby swore. \u201cThat\u2019s a damn lie. Jared and some fella from Canada did that, not me and Trev. We\u2019ve done some crazy things, but never nothin\u2019 like that. We\u2019d never disrespect a woman that way.\u201d</p> <p>Right then she realized Jared leaving her was a good thing.</p><p>He shifted uncomfortably on the creaky bench seat. She could see the outline of his cock through his tight jeans. She squirmed in her already wet panties, imagining all the delicious things he planned to do with it.</p><p>\u201cYou object to bringin\u2019 in another woman into our playtime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Not something I\u2019m interested in trying.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a dark brow. \u201cCan I ask why?\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow right back. \u201cBesides the fact three cocks will be more than enough to keep me occupied?\u201d</p><p>Colby grinned. \u201cHomophobic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Girl on girl is just not for me.\u201d She chomped a pretzel and pointed the jagged end at him. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to watch you fucking another woman either. Is that a problem?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d He brushed salt from her chin; his blunt fingertips leisurely traced the outline of her lips. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the prettiest mouth.\u201d</p><p>Everything inside her went hot and tight. \u201cThen kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute. Couple last things I need to know. You\u2019ll suck me off, jerk me off, anytime I demand it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithin reason. I\u2019m not going to get on my knees right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. But sex toys and domination games are okay? I\u2019m wicked good with ropes.\u201d</p><p>An image arose. Her arms tied helplessly above her head, her legs spread-eagled. A blindfold covering her eyes. A bandana plugging her mouth to stifle the screams of raw pleasure. Powerless and begging under Colby\u2019s towering body and punishing hands. She never would\u2019ve dreamed that scenario would make her absolutely dripping wet. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you let me spank you?\u201d</p><p>Holy shit. That suggestion caught her off guard. People really did that? And liked it? \u201cUmm. Would you hit me anywhere else?\u201d</p><p>Colby frowned. \u201cNo. I ain\u2019t that kind of man. But there is something about seein\u2019 a rosy red ass that appeals to me. And don\u2019t discount how sweet I can make punishments when you\u2019ve been bad, shug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is starting to scare me,\u201d Channing muttered.</p><p>\u201cNuh-uh. This is startin\u2019 to excite you. So do we have a deal?\u201d</p><p>She blurted, \u201cYes,\u201d before she second-guessed herself and said no.</p><p>\u201cGood. One more thing.\u201d</p><p>She held her breath. She had a feeling this last question would be the most important one of all.</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, pleased as I am that everything is up front with us, tell me why you\u2019ve agreed to all my conditions.\u201d</p><p>How did she explain without coming across as a desperate ho-bag?</p><p>But Colby wouldn\u2019t judge her. And hiding the truth because she should feel embarrassed wouldn\u2019t get her what she craved\u2014this man, in whatever capacity he wanted her\u2014if only for a week.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m sick of worrying if I tell a man what I really want out of a sexual relationship that he\u2019ll think I\u2019m some kind of deviant. I\u2019m tired of dating guys who see me as their mother, or the mother of their children. Or as a nice girl who\u2019s happy with plain-old vanilla sex once a week and doesn\u2019t want more. I want more. I want it all. I want to do things that I\u2019ve only read about. And I want you to teach me.\u201d</p><p>Colby\u2019s fingers stroked her chin, then his hand slid up her jawline to cradle her face. \u201cBelieve it or not, I understand wantin\u2019 to break free of expectations. I can be the lover who fulfills those desires, Channing. I can push you to the limit. But I\u2019ll warn you: I am demandin\u2019 and I like to be in control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to know you aren\u2019t just sayin\u2019 this. That you really mean it.</p><p>That you can handle what I\u2019ve got planned.\u201d</p><p>She angled her head and kissed the inside of his wrist. \u201cHow can I prove it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me right now. Don\u2019t ask questions and don\u2019t argue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you kiss me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you so intent on me kissin\u2019 you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, shug, when we were dancing you made me so wet and hot from that kiss I nearly came all over your leg.\u201d</p><p>Colby growled and enclosed his mouth over hers. His hot male taste filled her as he forced her lips open and thrust his slick tongue in and out. He gifted her with a grinding kiss that stole her breath and fogged her senses. He sucked her tongue, followed it up with erotic little bites of her lips. Then he retreated, making her chase his tongue back into his greedy mouth.</p><p>The kiss softened, sweetened. He explored her reactions, licking her teeth, teasing the roof of her mouth with a fleeting flick of the tip of his tongue. He slid that rough, wet velvet along the inside curve of her cheek and nibbled on her bottom lip. Pulling back to let his breath drift over the dampened spots he\u2019d created, as he brushed soft, yet insistent kisses on the corners of her trembling mouth.</p><p>Channing whimpered. Never in her life had she been kissed like that.</p><p>Her pussy flooded with cream, her nipples were hard as granite, her head spun like a tornado and he hadn\u2019t really touched her yet.</p><p>What would happen when he did? When they all did?</p><p>He stared in her dazed eyes with male heat and pride. \u201cI cannot wait to fuck you.\u201d His hungry gaze zeroed in on her cleavage. \u201cAnd those. But first, I\u2019ve got a little test for you to pass. Come on.\u201d Colby dropped ten bucks on the table to pay for the beer.</p><p>Holding his hand, she trailed behind him as they crossed the highway and into the arena parking lot. The rodeo grounds resembled an Old West ghost town. He led her to a dirty, white Dodge quad cab hooked to an enormous silver horse trailer.</p><p>Edgard and Trevor sauntered over from the corrals.</p><p>Her breath caught. Man, they were gorgeous. Edgard Mancuso, Trevor\u2019s roping partner, was a darkly handsome Brazilian with the face of a god and the body of a gladiator. And Trevor, an all-American god in his own right, wavy blond hair, rugged looks born of his Nordic ancestry.</p><p>Her nerves kicked in. What if they didn\u2019t want her?</p><p>\u201cChanning. You\u2019re lookin\u2019 mighty fine today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Trevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Colby?\u201d Trevor asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a bit of a situation. As you\u2019ve heard, Jared abandoned this little lady. She wants to stay on. I\u2019ve agreed she can travel with us until Cheyenne...on a few conditions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe becomes our personal buckle bunny.\u201d</p><p>Trevor grinned. \u201cSounds good so far.\u201d</p><p>Edgard scowled at him. \u201cWe can get any woman, any time we want.</p><p>Why do we need just one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s agreed to do whatever we want. And I know you guys have shied away from askin\u2019 some of the fillies warmin\u2019 our beds to do...certain things.\u201d</p><p>Edgard glanced away.</p><p>\u201cHow do we know she ain\u2019t just saying she\u2019ll do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question. I thought we could test her intentions. If she agrees, and if we\u2019re all satisfied, she\u2019ll be goin\u2019 with us today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll three of us? Right now?\u201d Edgard asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll start with something easy. She\u2019s new at this sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>Channing\u2019s blood began to race through her body with anticipation\u2014pounding and throbbing in some places more than others.</p><p>\u201cWhatcha got in mind, Colby?\u201d Trevor asked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s head into the horse trailer and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>Edgard shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll sit this one out.\u201d</p><p>The compartment in the horse trailer was bigger\u2014and cleaner\u2014than she\u2019d imagined. A small living area comprised of a two-burner cook top stove, a mini-fridge, a microwave, a sink, and a table and bench seat which sat four. A metal ladder led to an area with a low hanging ceiling and a king-sized mattress. An angular tiny bathroom with a shower, sink and toilet was crammed in the far corner. The space smelled like horseflesh and leather and men.</p><p>\u201cDo you live here?\u201d she asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe take turns stayin\u2019 in here. Too small for all of us.\u201d</p><p>Colby flicked on an overhead light. He faced Channing, his blue eyes gleaming. \u201cTake off your shirt, shug.\u201d</p><p>Did she have the guts to do this? Even when she so desperately wanted it?</p><p>Inhaling a slow, quiet breath, her fingers trembled as she unbuttoned the white eyelet blouse.</p><p>Colby stood close, Trevor leaned against the back wall, watching.</p><p>Down to her white lace bra, she awaited further instructions.</p><p>\u201cGood girl. Peel it off. Slowly. Tease me. Make me salivate to get my mouth on those big titties.\u201d</p><p>Channing reached behind her back and unhooked the clasps. The white satin contrasted against her tanned skin as the straps slithered down her arms. She held the cups in place until the last possible minute and then let the bra drop to the floor.</p><p>Silence except for the sounds of heavy male breathing.</p><p>\u201cTrevor?\u201d Colby said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever seen such a beautiful pair of tits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say as I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at those nipples. Big and red as cherries.\u201d</p><p>Unused to compliments on her body, Channing blushed.</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself. Show us what you like.\u201d</p><p>Channing closed her eyes. She skimmed her palms up her rounded belly, over her ribs, stopping to trace tiny circles around her nipples. She arched her back, lifting her breasts high, squeezing the soft flesh between her fingers. Plucking her nipples. Hard. Much harder than any man had been inclined to.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do first, Trev? Suck on them? Or slide your cock between them?\u201d</p><p>Trevor chuckled. \u201cSuck on them. Bite them. Make her squirm a bit.</p><p>Then I\u2019d wrap that creamy flesh around my cock and thrust high and hard until the tip reached those pouty lips.\u201d</p><p>Moisture gushed from her pussy like a water balloon had broken between her thighs. She\u2019d never been so hot, so ready to be touched in her life.</p><p>Colby sidled in front of her, cupping a big breast in each hand. He kneaded the mounds, whispered husky, sweet words against her quivering skin, dragging his open mouth across the tops of her breasts.</p> <p>He buried his face in the valley of her cleavage. Flattening his tongue, lapping at the bottom curves.</p><p>Locking his gaze to hers, he dipped his head and sucked her beaded right nipple into the wet heat of his mouth. He deftly twirled the left nipple between his fingers as if turning a dial. Hard. Like he noticed she liked it.</p><p>Channing clamped her thighs together. \u201cOh, man. Please don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she needs more. You wanna help me out here, Trev?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladly.\u201d Trevor latched onto her left nipple; Colby sucked on the right. She couldn\u2019t help the keening moan that escaped from the intense pressure. Colby\u2019s mouth was more aggressive. Trevor\u2019s mouth seemed hotter, his tongue softer as he suckled.</p><p>\u201cCan you come like this, darlin\u2019?\u201d Colby asked, his breath tickled her wet nipple making it harder. \u201cAre your tits sensitive enough we can get you off this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-it\u2019s never happened before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA theory we can test another time when you\u2019re properly trussed up.\u201d</p><p>He kissed a path up her neck, moving to the side of her body to allow Trevor access to both breasts.</p><p>Trevor crushed the globes closer, flicking his agile tongue back and forth between the tight, ruddy nipples.</p><p>Colby kissed her. She groaned against his lips. She loved kissing him. He twined their tongues together and lazily tasted the recesses of her mouth. His rough fingertips stroked her spine, sending goose bumps across her naked flesh. His lips slid to her ear and he whispered, \u201cAre you turned on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your cunt wet? Are you imaginin\u2019 me slurpin\u2019 all those sweet juices tricklin\u2019 between your thighs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-mmm, I can\u2019t wait. We\u2019ll take good care of you in a minute.</p><p>But for now, I\u2019m dyin\u2019 to see your lips wrapped around my cock. Unzip me, Channing.\u201d</p><p>His buckle clanked as she unhooked his belt. Then he placed her right hand on the placket of his jeans. She scraped her nails along the hardened length. A quick yank and the button popped loose. She slid the zipper down a tine at a time.</p><p>Colby groaned.</p><p>Using both hands, she peeled back the jeans, delving her fingers beneath the stretchy waistband of his boxers and through the nest of springy hair. The damp, velvety soft tip greeted her palm. She squeezed his cock, mentally cataloguing its size and thickness. A fission of fear appeared. Talk about well endowed.</p><p>He hissed. \u201cCome on, don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Trevor kept working her nipples. The soft kisses vanished as his teeth nipped the pebbled tips. She gasped at the spark of pain and sighed at the soothing lick of his warm tongue.</p><p>Channing arched toward Trevor, wanting to concentrate on the exquisite sensations of his talented mouth\u2014her former lovers never paid long, drawn-out attention to her breasts, but Colby elbowed him out of the way.</p><p>\u201cOn your knees, darlin\u2019.\u201d He put his hands on her shoulders and pushed her to the carpeted floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Trevor complained.</p><p>Colby caressed Channing\u2019s face with such genuine affection a lump rose in her throat. \u201cYou\u2019ll get yours. We\u2019re gonna see how good our girl is at multi-taskin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>A wave of heat rolled through her belly. Her thighs were drenched and clenched.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the plan. You\u2019re gonna blow me while you\u2019re givin\u2019 Trevor a hand job. Gotta get used to sharin\u2019, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl. Trev, help her out. Unbutton your own britches.\u201d</p><p>Colby had wiggled his Wranglers and boxers down to his knees.</p><p>Channing got her first peek at his cock. A little puddle of drool formed in her mouth. It was by far the biggest dick she\u2019d seen outside of Playgirl.</p><p>Long. And thick. It curved up slightly. Pre-come oozed from the wide purple head. An angry blue vein pulsed on the underside and disappeared between his balls, which hung low, flanked by muscular thighs dusted with dark hair.</p><p>Without waiting for permission, the very tip of her tongue circled the weeping tip. Mmm. Colby tasted clean. Musky. Hot and salty. His cock twitched and he sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>She turned and peered at Trevor.</p><p>Trevor gave her that killer bad-boy grin. He gently brushed a stray tendril from her damp forehead. \u201cI\u2019d never have pegged you as the kinda girl who\u2019d do this, Channing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is exactly why I\u2019m here.\u201d Her gaze dropped to his big hands, hesitating on his fly. Feeling bold, she challenged, \u201cYou shy, Trev? Or are you gonna show me what you\u2019ve got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got plenty to keep you satisfied.\u201d He shimmied his jeans over his narrow hips. No underwear. Grinning, he placed his hands behind his head and wagged his dick at her. \u201cLike whatcha see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d His cock actually looked longer than Colby\u2019s, but it wasn\u2019t as thick. The skin was paler, making the dark veins a bigger contrast against the lighter tone of his blond pubic hair. \u201cCome closer.\u201d</p><p>Trevor shuffled a couple of steps until he stood next to Colby.</p><p>Without preamble Channing sucked him into her mouth like she was slurping a noodle. Released him. Did it again.</p><p>\u201cHey! You\u2019re supposed to be suckin\u2019 me off,\u201d Colby reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI need some moisture so I can work him with my hand.\u201d She wrapped her fingers around Trevor\u2019s shaft and began to stroke. \u201cLike that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarder.\u201d</p><p>Channing increased her grip, the twisting sensation echoed in her own body from her nipples to her throbbing cunt.</p><p>\u201cShit yeah. Just like that.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and faced Colby.</p><p>He placed his palms on her cheeks, brushing the head of his cock across the seam of her lips. \u201cOpen up. Take me all the way in deep.</p><p>That\u2019s how I like it.\u201d</p><p>She parted her lips, opening her mouth wide. The broad tip passed over her teeth, rested on her tongue as he kept pushing into her mouth.</p><p>The cockhead hit the back of her throat and she gagged.</p><p>Colby held her in position. \u201cRelax, darlin\u2019, and breathe through your nose. You\u2019re not gonna choke.\u201d</p><p>She fought the urge to bite down. Instead, she let the saliva pool on her tongue and didn\u2019t swallow.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Don\u2019t arch your neck so much. You\u2019re doin\u2019 great. Oh, shug, you\u2019re sexy as hell.\u201d</p><p>The pumping action of her hand on Trevor\u2019s cock helped her focus beyond the need pulsing in her pussy. She hollowed her cheeks, and released Colby\u2019s dick an inch at a time.</p><p>\u201cJesus, that feels good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Trevor said with a groan. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna last long.\u201d</p><p>Channing sucked Colby to the root again, burying her nose in his pubic hair. Inhaling his scent. Several more times she deep-throated him. Then her hand circled the thick base of his shaft and she concentrated on the sensitive head, flicking her tongue on his glans on every upstroke.</p><p>Colby grunted. \u201cOh, yeah. Get me soppin\u2019 wet with that greedy mouth. It\u2019s a fucking turn-on that your mouth is waterin\u2019 for me, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>No man had ever talked dirty to her or told her exactly what he wanted without sugarcoating it. It didn\u2019t embarrass her; it inflamed her.</p><p>Her pussy was so wet her juices trickled down the inside of her thighs.</p><p>\u201cFaster,\u201d Trevor panted. \u201cHarder. Like that. Goddamn. Yes. More.</p><p>There it is. God. I\u2019m coming. Right...now. Ah. Shit!\u201d</p><p>Channing pulled her mouth from Colby, twisting to watch come jet out the end of Trevor\u2019s pulsating cock and splash on her breasts. She pumped him faster. More white spray arced through the air. The hot fluid dripped off her beaded nipples.</p><p>Trevor\u2019s legs shook, his back arched and his handsome face was lost in bliss as she stroked him to completion.</p><p>She\u2019d never had a man come on her. Not like that. A feeling of power built and her nervousness disappeared. She bent her head and suckled the reddened knob, relishing the different tastes of these two men. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJesus!\u201d Trevor said and jumped back.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Channing. I\u2019m so fucking close I can taste it,\u201d Colby growled. \u201cI want you to taste it, too. Trevor got his; now I want mine.\u201d</p><p>With both hands free, Channing, curled the fingers of her right hand around the thick root and rolled his lightly furred balls with her left. Her mouth glided up until it reached the barrier of her fingers. On every downstroke she increased her suction, building a steady rhythm and she used her teeth on his sweet spot.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop. When I tell you, drop your hand and take my cock all the way in your mouth. Oh yeah, here it comes.\u201d</p><p>His sac drew up; she unwrapped her hand and engulfed him completely, tightening her lips around the base of his shaft.</p><p>Colby growled, \u201cThat\u2019s it. Milk it. Suck every goddamn drop.\u201d</p><p>Breathing through her nose, she felt his cock twitching on her tongue as he emptied himself down the back of her throat. She swallowed the thick liquid as he kept coming and grinding harder into her mouth. Her eyes watered at the forceful grip he had on her hair, but his hold kept her gag reflex from kicking in. Finally, the pulsing stopped. She unlocked her jaw and released him slowly. And blew a stream of air over his shiny wet shaft.</p><p>Colby stumbled back.</p><p>Trevor laughed and steadied him. \u201cWhoa, buddy, you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no.\u201d</p><p>Channing smirked and wiped the back of her hand across her smooth lips. \u201cSo, boys...did I pass the test?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Channing watched shamelessly as Colby tugged his jeans to his hips and tucked his spent cock back inside his boxers before he zipped up.</p><p>Trevor helped her off her knees and gently wiped the stickiness from her chest with a frayed kitchen towel. He slanted his mouth over hers and kissed her, not sweetly, but with fresh hunger and pure male heat.</p><p>She rubbed the inside of her thighs together to assuage the throbbing ache and Trevor retreated.</p><p>She sensed Colby closing in behind her. He lifted her hair and trailed his lips along the curve of her neck. \u201cShug, that was amazing. We\u2019re definitely keepin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Trevor said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been a good girl. A very good girl.\u201d Colby\u2019s palms skated down the front of Channing\u2019s body, lingering to plump her breasts higher so Trevor could suckle the taut nipples. \u201cUndo her pants, Trev,\u201d Colby said gruffly.</p><p>Channing\u2019s belly jumped with anticipation as Trevor complied, lowering the zipper and shimmying her skintight jeans down her hips.</p><p>The roughened tips of Trevor\u2019s fingers followed the elastic band of her plain cotton panties. He seemed to want to dip his fingers into her aching sex, but he was waiting for something.</p><p>For a signal from Colby, apparently. It was obvious Colby was in charge.</p><p>Colby\u2019s right hand trailed over her abdomen, straight through the short curls covering her mound. His middle finger separated the fold of her pussy lips and stroked her distended clit.</p> <p>\u201cOh, God. Please. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh. We\u2019ll take care of you. This go-around will be pretty quick since we gotta get on the road, but tonight I promise we\u2019ll take our time with you. Spread your legs.\u201d In between peppering the sensitive slope of her shoulder with moist kisses, he said to Trevor, \u201cShe likes it when you suck her nipples hard.\u201d</p><p>Channing threaded the fingers of her left hand through Trevor\u2019s hair and let her head fall back when Colby\u2019s fingers penetrated her pussy. He thrust high, groaning in her ear when he found her absolutely dripping wet. Slow and easy he pumped in and out of her slick channel, sweeping his thumb side to side over her pouting clit. Trevor plucked her left nipple, pulling and twisting it as his mouth closed over the right one.</p><p>\u201cTell me what will make you come all over my hand, Channing,\u201d</p><p>Colby urged against her throat. \u201cI wanna smell that sweet cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPush your fingers in deeper. Faster on my clit. But, lightly. Yeah.</p><p>Like that. Oh, I\u2019m so close. Yes. Yes. Right there.\u201d Light and dark swirls of light exploded behind her lids as the orgasm burst between her thighs.</p><p>Colby murmured encouragement in her ear, his fingers continuing to plunge and Trevor\u2019s rapid sucks on her nipple were synchronized to the blood pulsing in her clit.</p><p>She thrashed and squirmed but Colby and Trevor held her tight, keeping their attention entirely focused on bringing her every ounce of pleasure at their command. Shaking and spent, she slumped against Colby\u2019s shoulder, breathing hard, dizzy, her body pliant with bone-deep satisfaction.</p><p>Trevor continued to lap at her pebbled nipples. Colby circled his fingers inside her, causing another set of tremors to trill through her internal muscles. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She managed to force her eyes open.</p><p>Colby slipped his hand from her sex. As he lifted up his hand, coated with her juices, Trevor snagged Colby\u2019s wrist and brought those glistening fingers to his lips, licking away every bit of her cream from his friend\u2019s hand.</p><p>Channing almost came again.</p><p>\u201cHow does she taste?\u201d Colby asked huskily.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me.\u201d Watching Channing\u2019s face, Trevor placed Colby\u2019s hand flat on her belly, then layered his own big hand over Colby\u2019s and slid both their hands down inside her damp panties, ramming four fingers deep into her wet pussy.</p><p>Her breath stalled as those slippery fingers twisted and plunged.</p><p>Colby brought his hand to his mouth and loudly sucked his fingers clean. Then he angled his head to capture Channing\u2019s lips as he kissed her hard, sharing her taste in the most hedonistic, consuming kiss of her life.</p><p>With Trevor\u2019s fingers still fucking her, and his teeth clamped on her nipple, another orgasm rocketed her body and she whimpered in Colby\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Finally, Colby broke the kiss and a huge grin spread across his gorgeous face. \u201cOh, yeah, this is definitely gonna be one fun week.\u201d</p><p>Colby loaded Channing\u2019s suitcases in the horse trailer as Trevor and Edgard performed last minute checks on the horses. He tamped down the strange need to hold Channing\u2019s hand or to constantly touch her in some manner. Talk about acting like a lovesick fool...but there was just something about the woman that brought out his protective instincts.</p><p>Edgard ambled to the truck cab. \u201cHorses are loaded. We\u2019re ready to roll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s drivin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevor. I\u2019ll navigate if that\u2019s okay. I figured you and Channing could sit in the back cab. If she\u2019s sharing responsibilities, you\u2019ll need to bring her up to speed on what she\u2019ll be doing besides warming your bed, amigo.\u201d</p><p>Colby nodded. \u201cWhat\u2019s our next stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLimon, Colorado. About six hundred miles. Good thing there ain\u2019t no rodeo tonight, or we\u2019d already be late for check-in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get on the road.\u201d Colby glanced over and saw Channing leaning her elbows on the wooden railing separating the parking lot from the exercise arena, wearing a dreamy expression. He shouted, \u201cHey, Chan, time to load up.\u201d</p><p>She turned and tucked the notebook in her hand into the gigantic camouflage messenger bag slung over her shoulder. Her turquoise boots kicked up dust as she hustled toward him, a secret smile tilting the corners of her full mouth.</p><p>Colby couldn\u2019t help but grin at her and offer his hand when she finally reached him. He brought her knuckles to his mouth and rubbed his lips over them. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He swept a tendril of hair from her cheek. \u201cYou sure about this, darlin\u2019 girl?\u201d</p><p>She stood on her tiptoes and kissed his chin. \u201cAs sure as I\u2019ve been about anything in my life. But one thing, Colby, I\u2019m not a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mistake. You sure enough proved you\u2019re all woman.\u201d</p><p>Channing blushed attractively, captivating Colby completely. \u201cLet\u2019s start this adventure, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>An enormous, beat-up, red Ford pickup pulled around the back end of the horse trailer and stopped parallel to the cab.</p><p>Colby smiled and tugged Channing closer to the rig.</p><p>The woman in the truck\u2014Gemma Jansen\u2014was a rough stock contractor from outside of Sheridan. Her husband had died a few years back and instead of selling off the livestock business, she\u2019d taken over and was trying her hand at becoming a rough stock contractor for the Mountain and Plains Rodeo circuit.</p><p>Gemma was a true Westerner, a fourth generation Wyomingite, tough, gruff and knowledgeable about everything from land to horse bloodlines. Beneath her salt-of-the-earth persona, sometimes it was easy to forget she wasn\u2019t an old grizzled woman. Somewhere in her forties, she was still a damn attractive woman. It was weird seeing her without her husband Steve. They\u2019d been married forever. For the first time, Colby wondered if she got as lonely on the road as the rest of them did.</p><p>Gemma leaned over and rolled down the dirt-covered passenger window. \u201cWhere you boys headed?\u201d</p><p>Edgard tipped back his hat and rested his forearm on the oversized mirror. \u201cLimon. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack home first. There\u2019s a shortage of bucking horse stock in Cody so I\u2019ve gotta get my foreman up there, see if they\u2019re willing to look at any of ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d be damn foolish not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said. My foreman ain\u2019t so sure. And I ain\u2019t so sure his reluctance ain\u2019t borne out of laziness. So I gotta make sure he ain\u2019t letting my business go to hell while I\u2019m out workin\u2019 this summer. He\u2019s the third foreman I\u2019ve been through in the last eighteen months.\u201d</p><p>Colby said, \u201cToo bad you can\u2019t take Cash with you. He\u2019d convince them guys in Cody to give you a shot. That man could sell wind in Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike we need more of that.\u201d She scowled. \u201cShoot. One of them crazy tourist traps would kidnap that blowhard Indian, color his face with war paint, put him in buckskin and a feather headdress, trying to pass him off as \u2018heap big chief\u2019. Cash would surely like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Gemma, that ain\u2019t fair. I know you and Cash have your differences, but you cain\u2019t argue that he don\u2019t know his stock.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A sly smile lit up her face. \u201cMy stock sure as shootin\u2019 tossed old Cash on his bony ass last night, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Colby laughed.</p><p>The driver\u2019s side door on Trevor\u2019s truck opened and Trevor hopped out. \u201cHey, my beautiful Gem-stone. How\u2019s tricks?\u201d</p> <p>She snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re as smooth as a baby\u2019s ass, ain\u2019t ya, Trev?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasted breath on me. I ain\u2019t nearly as tricky as I used to be in my younger years. But I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t tell you I had my fair share of lovesick cowboys trailing behind me.\u201d</p><p>Gemma focused on Colby. \u201cWhat\u2019d you think of that four-year-old bull, Big Time, last night? You looked damn good on him. Too good.</p><p>Makes me wonder if I oughta pull him out of rough stock rotation for a while.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s gotta good spin. He got all four legs off the ground right out of the chute so you\u2019re wrong if you think he\u2019s a gimme. He weren\u2019t easy at all. Shoot, it\u2019s not like I scored a ninety on him, Gem. A couple of the guys said they\u2019d like a chance to test him out. Where\u2019s the next place you\u2019re bringin\u2019 him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cValentine, probably.\u201d Gemma\u2019s shrewd gaze finally landed on Channing. \u201cSince these boys forgot their manners, I\u2019ll just go ahead and introduce myself. Gemma Jansen.\u201d</p><p>Channing thrust her hand through the open window and clasped Gemma\u2019s. \u201cChanning Kinkaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019re you here with?\u201d</p><p>Colby said, \u201cShe\u2019s with me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore I was traveling with Jared. It ended when I found out about Jared\u2019s marital status last night.\u201d</p> <p>A single blonde eyebrow lifted. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d She dropped her head, clearly embarrassed.</p><p>In a show of support, Colby squeezed the hand he\u2019d placed on Channing\u2019s hip.</p><p>Gemma gave her an approving look. \u201cGood to hear. Lots of the girls hitching a ride on the wild side don\u2019t give a rip about the sanctity of marriage. So if you need a break from the rodeo-injury war stories and the testosterone, come find me. We\u2019ll drink whiskey and tell these boys we\u2019re doin\u2019 each other\u2019s hair.\u201d</p><p>Channing grinned. \u201cWill do. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Gemma inclined her head and her straw cowboy hat shaded her face.</p><p>\u201cNice day to travel. Behave, boys. Good luck in Limon. See you in Nebraska in a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrive safe, senhora.\u201d Edgard thumped the side door and Gemma took off.</p> <p>Trevor and Edgard conversed in low tones, then Edgard popped the hood of the truck and they fiddled with the engine. Colby opened the rear cab door and gestured for Channing to hop in.</p><p>She lifted her satchel over her head, propping it in her lap as she scooted across the leather bench seat. \u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrev\u2019s gonna drive until he gets tired and then Edgard will take over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about us?\u201d</p><p>Colby kicked aside an empty carton of chocolate milk. \u201cWe\u2019ll be on tap for next time when we hit the road for Valentine. Today\u2019s one of our rare off days so enjoy it while it lasts. Usually, we\u2019re rippin\u2019 out of the arena the second we get the payouts and headin\u2019 to the next event.\u201d</p><p>Channing scowled at the trash scattered across the floor. \u201cThis place is a pigsty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it does me. While we\u2019re waiting on those two, we\u2019re going to pick this crap up and throw it out.\u201d</p><p>Colby\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou ain\u2019t our maid, Chan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need one. Besides, I said we, not me.\u201d Her crafty smile turned into a frown as she picked up a crusty, half-eaten cinnamon roll wedged under the muddy floor mat. \u201cUgh. Find me something to use as a garbage bag.\u201d</p><p>He rummaged under the seat until he found one. Shoving cellophane Twinkie wrappers, empty cans of Copenhagen and Skoal, half-full bottles of Gatorade in the clear plastic shopping bag, Colby couldn\u2019t recall the last time he\u2019d cared enough to clean up for a woman. Never maybe.</p><p>\u201cDo you guys really eat this kind of junk food all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sometimes we roll through the McDonald\u2019s drive-thru.\u201d</p><p>Channing chucked a gray athletic sock in the bag. \u201cHere\u2019s a warning, this stuff isn\u2019t real food. It\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Colby found the matching dirty sock and balled it up and threw it in the trash. \u201cWe do have a kitchen in the trailer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you use it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s stupid not to. When we get to Limon, we\u2019ll go to a real grocery store\u2014not a convenience store\u2014and stock up on real food.</p><p>Because I can\u2019t eat like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Ain\u2019t that part of the appeal of rodeo? Fried Twinkies, nachos, and cold beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me.\u201d Channing dangled a crumpled package of cheddar flavored Bugles in front of his face. \u201cI\u2019d be easier to jump over than walk around if I shoved this crap in my mouth every damn day.\u201d</p><p>When she finished tidying up he softly said, \u201cChanning.\u201d</p><p>Those gold-flecked eyes met his. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over here and kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. Now.\u201d Colby\u2019s strong fingers circled her upper arms and he hauled her across his lap. Before she opened her mouth to protest again, he swooped in for a hungry kiss.</p><p>Channing\u2019s objection lasted less than three seconds before her hands were gripping his neck and her lithe body was plastered against his. Her mouth was welcoming, hot as sin and sweet as candy.</p><p>Colby lifted her until she straddled his lap. His hands inched up the inside of her shirt, softly stroking the trembling muscles of her belly. He loved how quickly she reacted to his every touch. He pulled his lips away a fraction and nibbled her jaw. \u201cI wish you had on that flirty, little, yellow skirt you wore the first time I saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I could bunch it around your hips and pull aside your panties and stroke your sweet pussy without any barriers. I could get you off in less than two minutes. You\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t you, shug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. So confident. Why don\u2019t you see if you can\u2019t get me off in two minutes through my clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou challengin\u2019 me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet your tight cowboy ass I\u2019m challenging you. Stop talking, kiss me, and put your money where your mouth is.\u201d Channing circled her arms around his neck, balancing on her knees, giving him better access to the warm spot between her thighs. She bumped her hips against his stomach, while her eager kisses shattered his control.</p><p>This woman drove him insane with her sweetness and fire. Colby scraped his fingernail along the inside seam of her jeans, a lazy assault that made her squirm. He flicked his tongue over hers in the same languid manner, until she whimpered. When he kept his caresses simple and easy, she ripped her mouth away from his on a gasp.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? I think your two minutes are up.\u201d</p><p>Colby left damp, open-mouthed kisses down the bared column of her throat. God. She smelled like wildflowers. \u201cI\u2019ve decided since I\u2019m always tryin\u2019 to beat the clock on the dirt, I ain\u2019t gotta time myself now, or to give into your demands, greedy girl. See, now I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 I don\u2019t want to rush this. I want you to feel the anticipation, so when I finally slide my cock inside you later tonight, you\u2019ll remember how much you wanted it there.</p><p>How much you craved it.\u201d</p><p>She whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t you want it?\u201d</p><p>He tugged her face closer by a chunk of her hair until his hat brim shadowed her eyes. \u201cI can hardly see straight, from wantin\u2019 you, Channing. But I\u2019ll be goddamned if you\u2019ll take this from me because I can\u2019t keep my hands off your tempting body. This is my show. You wanted me to be in charge, so I\u2019m remindin\u2019 you we\u2019re doing this my way, understand?\u201d</p><p>The hood thunked back into place, shaking the truck frame, breaking the intense moment. The front cab doors slammed shut as Trevor and Edgard climbed in.</p><p>Edgard groaned. \u201cAre you guys going to be fucking around back there all day? Because if you are, ride in the horse trailer. It\u2019ll be damn distracting to hear your moans and smell sex as we\u2019re trying to keep us on the road and in one piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Trevor chimed in. \u201cI thought we were waitin\u2019 until tonight for any more action?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeeling left out?\u201d Edgard asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pout. It ain\u2019t my fault you didn\u2019t join in earlier,\u201d Trevor shot back.</p><p>Great. Colby was acting like a pussy-whipped greenhorn who couldn\u2019t think beyond getting in Channing\u2019s pants. No way in hell would he admit that weakness to his traveling partners. Instead, he returned Channing to her side of the truck.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Yeah, we got carried away. You sure you don\u2019t want me to drive? Because I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 me and Channing back here together, even with all our clothes on, is a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>She snickered.</p><p>Trevor gunned the engine. \u201cHang on, it\u2019s gonna be a tight turn to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Automatically, Colby and Edgard reached up for the handles hanging from the ceiling as Trevor whipped the big rig around.</p><p>Channing smoothed her hands down the outside of her thighs, then busied herself with compacting the trash. She leaned over the front seat.</p><p>\u201cYou guys have any junk up there that needs to be tossed out? It\u2019s all picked up back here.\u201d</p><p>Edgard glared at Colby. \u201cYou were making her clean up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no! I didn\u2019t make her do nothin\u2019. Must be a woman thing, it was something she did on her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, someone has to do it,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\u201cGracias,\u201d Edgard said. \u201cI promise we\u2019ll try a little harder to keep it tidy now that you\u2019re bunking with us, right, amigos?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d Trevor said.</p><p>Channing set her chin on her forearms, which were resting along the back edge of the front seat. \u201cHow are the sleeping arrangements going to work? There\u2019s hardly enough room in the horse trailer for two people, let alone four.\u201d</p><p>Trevor signaled and pulled onto the freeway. \u201cWe don\u2019t all stay in the trailer. We rent a motel room. It\u2019s easier to shower that way. Two of us stay in the room, and one of us sleeps out here. We rotate, so someone is always keeping an eye on the horses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomeone meaning me usually sleepin\u2019 with the damn horses,\u201d Colby grumbled.</p><p>\u201cBesides, sometimes we need privacy. A break from each other,\u201d</p><p>Edgard said.</p><p>Trevor shot Edgard a strange look.</p><p>Channing glanced at Colby over her shoulder. He shrugged at her puzzled expression. She\u2019d learn to deal with the two of them sniping at each other, or she wouldn\u2019t. He preferred to stay out of it.</p> <p>\u201cLike I told Colby, I can\u2019t eat fast food all the time. I don\u2019t mind cooking if I\u2019ve got the right supplies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd like I told you, we don\u2019t expect you to cook and clean for us, darlin\u2019,\u201d Colby said testily.</p><p>\u201cEspecially if you\u2019re gonna make us eat vegetables.\u201d Trevor shuddered. \u201cGive me jerky and chili dogs over any of that green shit any day.\u201d</p><p>Edgard nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t forget the Mexican delights of Taco Bell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr meat and potatoes,\u201d Colby added.</p><p>Channing rolled her eyes. She dug in her satchel and untangled her iPod. Once the earpieces were in place, she balled up her fleece-lined jacket to use for a pillow, rammed it in the corner, and closed her eyes.</p> <p>Instead of gawking at Channing, looking far too tempting, even in sleep, Colby dry-washed his face and stared out the window at the landscape, a flat blandness spreading as far as the eye could see. The dirt in Oklahoma was an odd shade of pinkish orange and the horizon never changed from a washed-out, dirty gray.</p><p>He missed the brilliant blue Wyoming sky, with snowcapped mountains teasing in the distance. The rolling hills and valleys dotted with clusters of cedar and sagebrush. Herds of antelope running free among the wide-open spaces.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye he saw Channing shifting to get comfortable. She might look little, sweet and innocent, but the woman definitely knew her own mind and didn\u2019t hesitate to speak it.</p><p>Colby tapped Edgard on the shoulder. \u201cWake me up when we gas up.\u201d He leaned his shoulders against the seat, tugged his battered Resistol over his eyes and drifted off to the familiar sound of the wheels clacking on the highway.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cChanning?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at the late afternoon sunlight streaming through the window and scrambled upright. \u201cWhat? Where are we?\u201d</p><p>Trevor grinned and traced his fingers over her sleep-creased cheek.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re about an hour outside Limon. Just wondered if you needed to use the bathroom before we get back on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. I slept for five hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour. I\u2019ve got a bit of a lead foot so we made good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so. Where are Colby and Edgard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInside. Why? Did you need them for something?\u201d Her skin was so smooth. How long had it been since he\u2019d paid attention to the supreme softness of the skin on a woman\u2019s face? Such a contrast from a man\u2019s rough skin and stubble.</p><p>\u201cNo. I was just curious.\u201d Channing smiled and angled her head more deeply into his touch. \u201cMmm. That feels nice. I probably should get out and stretch my legs and visit the little girl\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me help you.\u201d Trevor clamped his hands over her slim hips and scooted her from the cab. When her boots hit the ground, he slammed the door, and crowded her against the truck bed. \u201cBut first, how about one of them sweet kisses, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She rose to her tiptoes and gave him a loud smacking smooch on his Adam\u2019s apple. \u201cLike that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a mean streak, Chan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. How about if you show me how you want to be kissed, Trev, so next time I won\u2019t have to guess.\u201d</p><p>Trevor tilted his black Stetson further back on his head and lowered his face, keeping their eyes locked. When his mouth was close enough their breath mingled, he licked his lips and swept them across hers.</p><p>Lightly. Softly. Not applying pressure, not nibbling or teasing, not using his tongue, just feeling the warm fullness of her lips parting in expectation of his.</p><p>He brought his hand up to her shoulder and lazily rubbed his thumb over the pulse beating in the hollow of her throat. Then he rimmed the inside of her full lower lip with inside edge of his upper lip. Back and forth, creating friction and heat and moisture. Just that slick, barely-there slide of mouth on mouth made her whimper.</p><p>Taking pity on her and himself, he pinched her stubborn chin between his thumb and forefinger and unlocked her jaw to accept the invasion of his tongue.</p><p>She responded with such unrestrained passion Trevor knew it was a damn good thing they were in public. As it was he wanted nothing more than to drop his Wranglers to the top of her Tony Lamas and drive into her hot little pussy, right there, next to the gas pumps at the Flying J</p><p>Truck Plaza.</p><p>Trevor forced his mouth away, trying to level his ragged breathing and he rested his forehead to hers. Once he regained control, he stepped back.</p><p>Channing smiled and tugged his hat back in place. \u201cNow that\u2019s what I call a kiss.\u201d</p><p>Edgard said, \u201cIf you two are done sucking face, we need to get a move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit bein\u2019 an asshole, Ed. Give Channing time to use the can and get a snack.\u201d Trevor waited for him to snap off another smart retort.</p><p>Instead Edgard scowled and skirted the front of the truck and climbed in the passenger side.</p><p>As Trevor watched Channing saunter into the convenience store, he knew Edgard was going to be a problem where she was concerned.</p><p>Problem was, Trevor didn\u2019t know what to do about it.</p><p>Colby materialized from the shadows and leaned against the concrete pillar beside the pump. \u201cEverything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Trevor couldn\u2019t meet Colby\u2019s gaze. \u201cShe\u2019s something, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you like her way more than you\u2019re lettin\u2019 on. So does that mean you\u2019re gonna have a problem sharin\u2019 her with me, Colby? Actin\u2019 all pissed off if Chan and I spend time alone together? If you see me kissin\u2019</p><p>her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, buddy, there\u2019s enough of her to go around. This is what she wants and I think it\u2019ll work well for us. But we both know I ain\u2019t the one with the jealous streak.\u201d Colby pushed away and reached for the windshield cleaner, scrubbing away the bugs and grime with the spongy side, before using the squeegee to slick away the filthy water.</p><p>By the time the windshield was clean and Trevor had checked the horses, Channing had returned, looking as fresh as a daisy. She rubbed a shiny red apple across her chest before she took a big chomping bite.</p><p>Juice dribbled down her chin.</p><p>\u201cThat apple actually looks good,\u201d Trevor said.</p><p>\u201cWant a bite?\u201d</p><p>She held the fruit to his mouth. Instead of taking a bite, he leaned over and licked her sticky-sweet chin, then swept his tongue over her lips and dipped it into her mouth. \u201cMmm. I much prefer tasting the apple from you.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks were flushed from his attention, but Channing recovered and rolled her eyes before she jumped into the truck.</p><p>After they pulled into Limon, they found a cheap, slightly seedy motel close to the fairgrounds. Edgard and Trevor unloaded the horses, unhooked the trailer, and Colby drove Channing to the Hinky Dinky grocery store outside of town.</p><p>She loaded up on fresh fruit, a few veggies. Whole-grain cereal and bread. Lunch meat. Diet soda. And canned soup.</p><p>Colby\u2019s contribution to the cart was an extra large box of condoms, four cans of Skoal and a case of Bud Light.</p><p>Every time she added a new item, her gaze strayed to that box of condoms, extra large, extra ribbed for her pleasure, and she tried not to panic.</p><p>She browsed the butcher block and pointed to a chunk of beef. \u201cSee?</p><p>If I had a big crock pot I could toss meat and potatoes in it in the morning, and by the time we stopped, dinner would be done.\u201d</p><p>Colby brushed a kiss across her forehead. \u201cAs much as I\u2019ve said I don\u2019t want you goin\u2019 to no trouble for us, slow-cooked beef and potatoes does sound tasty. I miss home cookin\u2019. My ma is a helluva good cook.\u201d</p><p>Channing bit the inside of her lip. Did she confess to him she really wasn\u2019t much of a cook and have him compare her efforts to his mother\u2019s?</p><p>Colby loaded the grocery bags and talked on his cell phone. They picked up a bucket of fried chicken and all the trimmings and ate the meal in the picnic area outside the motel. It was a beautiful night, not a breath of wind, the humidity tolerable and a silver moon hung low in the sky.</p><p>Several other contestants, Brian, Jeff and JJ, all sometime roping partners with Edgard and Trevor, stopped by and the beer disappeared quickly. Just in that short amount of time she realized that these people traveling the circuit were like one big family. Fighting, laughing, fiercely loyal to one another. Not that she\u2019d experienced anything like that in her family life.</p><p>Trevor and Edgard returned to the arena to practice roping and Colby tagged along, needing to run his horse.</p><p>Channing stayed in the room and indulged in a shower. After she\u2019d shaved and coated her body with lotion, she wondered what would happen when her cowboys returned. Was she supposed to stay naked?</p><p>Would they prefer another strip tease?</p><p>Did she really know what she\u2019d gotten herself into?</p><p>The sound of a lock in the door sent her pulse tripping. She shoved the books in her satchel and flipped the page on her notebook.</p><p>Colby entered the room first, followed by Trevor. Edgard brought up the rear and he immediately went into the bathroom and the shower kicked on.</p><p>Trevor flopped on the queen bed against the wall. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Colby said. His gaze traveled from Channing\u2019s bare toes all the way up her legs to linger on her face. \u201cI\u2019m feelin\u2019 very energetic tonight.\u201d</p><p>Yowza.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s sleeping in the trailer?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cEdgard,\u201d Trevor said.</p><p>Did that mean he wouldn\u2019t be joining them again? Channing was almost afraid to ask. She was secretly worried Edgard regretted having her along, or worse, that he didn\u2019t find her attractive.</p><p>As soon as Edgard finished his shower, he bid them goodnight. After Colby cleaned up, he left the room for a time while Trevor took his turn in the bathroom. With every minute that clicked by, Channing became more and more nervous.</p><p>Especially when Colby returned to the room with a length of rope in one hand, a bandana in the other, and a wicked gleam in his eye. He said, \u201cStrip. I wanna see you bare-assed naked right now.\u201d</p><p>Channing nodded, doffed her clothes and stood before him, feeling shy and exposed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mighty fine, Chan. Come here and turn around.\u201d</p><p>She crossed the room. The folded red bandana flashed in front of her eyes before everything went dark. A quick pinch on the back of her head and she was blindfolded.</p><p>Colby made no move to touch her besides guiding her back to the bed. \u201cSit here and wait for further instructions. You\u2019ll do as you\u2019re told.</p><p>No questions. We clear on that, shug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He placed a soft kiss on the corners of her lips and whispered, \u201cGood girl. Don\u2019t be scared. We ain\u2019t gonna hurt you\u2014\u201d his teeth sank into her earlobe, \u201c\u2014much.\u201d</p><p>Channing shivered.</p><p>The door to the bathroom clicked open and shut. She heard Colby\u2019s and Trevor\u2019s voices, but she couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying. That was probably a good thing.</p><p>She swallowed to moisten her dry mouth. Her heart rate kicked up again when humid, soapy-scented air drifted out of the bathroom and she sensed Trevor and Colby standing in front of her.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the deal, darlin\u2019. We\u2019re gonna play a little game of blind man\u2019s bluff. You\u2019re gonna try to figure out who\u2019s touchin\u2019 you. If you guess right, you get a reward. If you guess wrong, well, let\u2019s just hope you don\u2019t have to find out.\u201d</p><p>Channing went absolutely motionless.</p><p>\u201cLay back on the bed and press your arms together above your head.</p><p>That\u2019s a girl.\u201d Scratchy twine wrapped around her wrists several times.</p><p>Colby whispered, \u201cIt ain\u2019t too tight, mostly it\u2019s to keep your hands out of our way. If you cooperate, we\u2019ll leave them loose. The second you try to touch either of us or those hands move? We\u2019ll fasten you to the bed frame. We clear on that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Trevor said, \u201cSpread your legs wide. I wanna see those heels hangin\u2019</p><p>off the side of the bed.\u201d</p><p>She complied.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Chan. No matter what we do to you, leave \u2018em like that until we say otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Channing had a flash of insight. If they talked, she\u2019d easily be able to figure out which one was doing what. Colby loved to talk dirty, so chances were good he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep his mouth shut. She withheld a grin.</p><p>Until the music turned on.</p><p>Before she could contemplate how she\u2019d differentiate one man from the other in the dark, a hot mouth closed over her left nipple and suckled strongly. Rough fingertips dragged up and down the center of her body.</p><p>Smoothing over her ribcage and the sensitive bend in her waist. A light stroking over the pulse pounding in the column of her neck.</p><p>A work-roughened palm traced her contours, from the arms displayed above her head, down her tensed shoulders. Over the soft curve of her belly, across her, hips and the roundness of her thighs. Past her quaking knees, down her calves to her ankles, ending at her ticklish feet. Those maddeningly thorough hands reversed the process with just as much sensual deliberation.</p><p>Channing began to shake with pure unadulterated need.</p><p>Then those eager hands palmed her breasts, bringing both nipples together to suck and lick and taste. Teeth nipped the tender tips, causing a pain-filled sound to escape from her throat.</p><p>The sting was soothed by pursed lips blowing a stream of cool air, followed by a warm, wet tongue lapping and curling around the abused flesh.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d a gruff male commanded.</p><p>Well, shoot. Her chances of guessing correctly were 50-50. \u201cTrevor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. Turn her over,\u201d Colby said.</p><p>A hard slap burned across her left butt cheek.</p><p>When she protested\u2014\u201cHey! That stings\u201d\u2014two more smacks landed in rapid succession.</p><p>\u201cKeep talkin\u2019 and I\u2019ll take great pleasure in turnin\u2019 this heart-shaped ass rosy red, shug.\u201d</p><p>Crap.</p><p>\u201cGot any other protests?\u201d Trevor asked.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cGood. Turn her the other way so I can get my licks in, too,\u201d Trevor said.</p><p>She was rolled to her left side and four solid smacks landed on her right buttock. \u201cNow we\u2019re even. Don\u2019t make us get out the bullrope, Chan.\u201d</p><p>The humiliation she thought she\u2019d feel never came. What did that say about her?</p><p>Nothing, besides she\u2019d never been wetter or more turned on in her life.</p><p>Strong hands gripped her ankles and jerked her body down until her stinging ass nearly hung off the end of the bed. Then a cool, wet tongue licked straight up the center of her pussy.</p><p>Her hips shot off the bed.</p><p>A warning growl sounded next to her ear.</p><p>Then the mouth on her sex began a full-out assault. That clever tongue wiggled deep inside her dripping cunt, licking her from the inside out. Then it zigzagged up to flick little whips of hot velvet across her distended clit. Her blood pulsed and gathered in that little nub, the orgasm danced close to the surface and then the possibility vanished as the teasing mouth trailed away.</p><p>Damn. She wanted to demand it return, but she wisely kept her lips pressed together.</p><p>Soft kisses circled her mound from the line of her pubic hair, to the crease of her thighs, back down to her vaginal opening. The circle of kisses became progressively smaller. Tighter. Wetter.</p><p>Channing tried not to writhe, or to grind her sex into that fleeting tongue. But when that hot, hungry mouth closed over her clit and her swollen pussy lips and began to suck them together, she flat out screamed.</p><p>Two thick fingers shot inside and stroked that magical spot as the soft suctioning grew stronger and sent her soaring over the edge of reason and into a climax so extreme she forgot to breathe. She nearly passed out from lack of oxygen to her sex-addled brain.</p><p>Once the blood quit rushing in her ears and slowed to a dull throb between her legs, she slumped against the mattress.</p><p>A gravelly voice demanded, \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>God. Was she really supposed to care who\u2019d brought her to such an intense orgasm? Channing licked her lips and willed her head to quit buzzing.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d the demand was voiced again.</p><p>\u201cUmm. Colby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, shug,\u201d he whispered against her throat.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re very good. That was the most\u2014\u201d</p><p>His mouth covered hers; she tasted the musky tang of her own juices on his tongue. Colby kissed her mouth, Trevor\u2019s hands roamed over her until she squirmed from the erotic motions. Once Colby released her tingling lips from his, she whispered, \u201cThat was...please. I want more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you supposed to be talkin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen hush up.\u201d</p><p>The bed dipped. Hands and mouths left her body, leaving her bereft.</p><p>Tears stung her eyes. \u201cAre you going to punish me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh. Darlin, you\u2019re fine. We planned on playin\u2019 with you a little more, but the truth is, you\u2019ve pushed us to the edge tonight and neither one of us is very good at waitin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want you bad, girl.\u201d</p><p>Channing smiled at the shaking note in Trevor\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>Trevor brushed his lips over hers. After twelve short hours she already knew the difference in their kisses, their individual tastes and shape of their mouths. \u201cNow you get your wish to be with us both at the same time.\u201d</p><p>Her satiation fled and her body seized up.</p><p>\u201cRelax. No double penetration tonight, we need to ease you into it.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s knees snugged against her armpits. He spread cool gel over her chest, then he pressed her breasts together tightly in his palms. \u201cI\u2019m dyin\u2019 to slide my cock between these glorious tits.\u201d</p><p>The slippery warmth of his hard shaft eased into the tight valley he created. With every glide, the tip of his cock bumped her chin.</p><p>He growled, \u201cAngle your neck and lick the head.\u201d</p><p>She complied, half-afraid she was doing it wrong, and wanting to do it right because she didn\u2019t know how she felt about him coming on her face. Her tongue shot out and curled around the tip. On his next stroke, she let her lips close around the whole head.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Like that. As soon as my balls are ready to explode, my cock is goin\u2019 all the way in this pretty mouth.\u201d</p><p>A fresh rush of moisture gushed between her legs.</p><p>Callused hands gripped her hips. \u201cI can smell you creaming, but hang tight, while I get some lube,\u201d Colby said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Two fingers twisted inside her, mixing the KY with her natural lubrication.</p><p>Channing tensed when she felt the head of Colby\u2019s cock poised at her entrance. He was a big man\u2014bigger than any she\u2019d ever been with\u2014and even though she couldn\u2019t wait to feel him stuffing her pussy full, part of her was a little scared.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tense up. Once I\u2019m in, it\u2019ll feel good. Real good, I promise.\u201d As Colby worked his dick in slowly, Trevor began thrusting harder, muttering. Channing wished she could see everything that was happening to her, but the blindfold remained on and her hands were still immobilized above her head.</p><p>\u201cFuck. Here it comes. Open up wide.\u201d Trevor released her breasts and cupped one hand under her neck, lifting her higher so his cock slid deeper into her mouth. At the same time, Colby rammed into her to the hilt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She moaned as hot bursts of come splashed against the back of her throat, a saltier, earthier taste than Colby\u2019s. As Trevor rocked against her face, his balls tickled her chin. She swallowed convulsively, feeling the heat and need spiraling through her as Colby slammed into her sopping wet cunt, his hips pistoning faster and faster like a runaway train.</p><p>Trevor rolled off her body and began to suck her nipples as Colby reamed her, harder and harder, pulling completely out, and ramming back in until he hit the top of her uterus.</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, I ain\u2019t gonna last,\u201d Colby grunted.</p><p>Channing arched, whimpering, \u201cYes, yes, yes,\u201d as Colby stroked her clit and she detonated like a nuclear reactor.</p><p>He followed right behind. Her strong interior muscles clutched his dick like teeth, keeping his pulsing shaft submerged inside her after he\u2019d shot his load.</p><p>Breathing as hard as she was, Colby crumpled against her.</p><p>He rested his head on her belly as Trevor untied her hands and rubbed her wrists to get the blood flowing again.</p><p>While she tried to assess the delicious damage the men\u2019s passion had inflicted upon her unsuspecting body, Trevor leaned over and kissed her, gently removing the blindfold.</p><p>\u201cThank you, darlin\u2019. Plenty more of where that came from. But get some sleep. I\u2019m gonna go check on Edgard and make sure he ain\u2019t getting shitfaced with the horses.\u201d Trevor slipped on his sweat bottoms, leaving his broad, sweaty chest bare, and exited the room before she caught her breath.</p><p>Colby eased his spent cock from her with painstaking slowness. He disposed of the condom and shut off the lights. He picked her limp body up and hugged her close as he flipped back the covers and then slid them between the cool sheets.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so tired,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He kissed the top of her head. \u201cSleep. You deserve it. You\u2019re gonna need your strength for tomorrow because I can\u2019t wait to have you again.</p><p>And again. You\u2019re gonna be as bowlegged as Cash by the time I get through with you.\u201d</p><p>Channing sighed dreamily. But she wasn\u2019t ready to drift off into la-la land yet. She wanted to know everything about Colby McKay. \u201cTell me about your life on your ranch in the wilds of Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>Colby dragged his fingers up and down her spine. \u201cIt\u2019s like heaven and hell rolled into one. Parts of the land are beautiful; parts are butt ugly and barren. But the whole shebang has been in the McKay family for one hundred and twenty years, so it\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever lived anyplace else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Never wanted to. I\u2019ve never wanted to do anything with my life besides work on the ranch and rodeo.\u201d</p><p>She listened to Colby extol the virtues of rural living and the frustrations. She wondered what it would be like to be so...connected. To the land. To your family. To your neighbors.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Colby prompted. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like livin\u2019 with a couple million people around you all the damn time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEven living in the least populated county in the least populated state I was never lonely growin\u2019 up. Too many brothers. Though I\u2019d like to have punched \u2018em most days, we get along great now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about them.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cAnother time, okay? You need to stop chatterin\u2019 and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease? I\u2019ve got my second wind.\u201d She yawned.</p><p>\u201cRight. You don\u2019t have to uncover all my secrets tonight. Go to sleep, Chan. I\u2019ll tell you anything you want to know tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m holding you to that, cowboy.\u201d She snuggled into him and conked out.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Warm, wet kisses started at her hairline and trailed down the inside curve of her neck to the slope of her shoulder and back up the other side. Stuttered breathing caused her pulse to flutter and the tiny hairs on her nape to stand at attention.</p><p>Channing tried to turn into Colby\u2019s embrace, but he held her in place.</p><p>\u201cMorning. You slept good. We plumb wore you out. I don\u2019t think you moved at all after we stopped talkin\u2019 last night.\u201d He lightly bit her biceps.</p><p>\u201cI never would\u2019ve dreamed you\u2019re so damn cuddly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize. I loved it. Especially those sweet snores comin\u2019 from your sinful mouth. Lord. I\u2019ve been watchin\u2019 you sleep for the last ten minutes, wishin\u2019 you\u2019d wake up. As you can tell, I kinda got tired of waitin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She blushed and attempted to roll over. \u201cColby\u2014\u201d</p><p>His big palm landed between her shoulder blades and he pushed her flat to her stomach. \u201cYou sore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll try to be gentle, but damn, I want you like this. All warm and sleepy and soft.\u201d Colby brushed his mouth over her ear. \u201cSometimes I wake up with morning wood, but never like this, like an iron bar. You do this to me, Channing. Only you.\u201d He ground his rock-hard cock into her hip. \u201cDon\u2019t move. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>No matter what he thought, in no way was Channing relaxed now.</p><p>She closed her eyes and inhaled. Colby\u2019s musk, the sweeter perfume of her arousal and the scent of last night\u2019s sexcapade lingered in the room and on the sheets and she was instantly aroused. She heard the crinkling of a condom package being ripped open.</p><p>The bed swayed and Colby slapped both her ass cheeks. Her immediate protest of \u201cHey!\u201d was lost as he tongued the hot marks, then dragged that wicked, wet tongue up her spine.</p><p>\u201cOn your knees, darlin\u2019. Stretch your arms above your head.\u201d</p><p>Channing kept her cheek pressed into the mattress as Colby hiked her hips higher and propped a folded pillow beneath her belly. He widened her base as his knees slid between her calves. His whole hand skated up and down her backbone in a sweetly soothing manner. Then she felt two fingers lightly stroking her pussy, from her clit to her vaginal opening before those slick digits slid in deep.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, just lubing you up. I know you\u2019re a little tender. This will help get you ready for me because I ain\u2019t gonna wait. I want you right now.\u201d</p><p>The fingers left briefly and returned, colder, and even slipperier than before. Her sex bloomed and opened for him like a flower.</p><p>\u201cGod, you look pretty, all those creamy pink curves stretched out for me to feast on. You\u2019re about the sexiest damn thing I\u2019ve ever seen, Chan.\u201d</p><p>This man redefined sweet talker.</p><p>Colby angled closer and kissed the sensitive spot her behind the ear.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His hipbones brushed her ass, and he spread her wide as the thick head of his cock poised at her entrance. Colby didn\u2019t ease in. He thrust to the hilt in one swift movement.</p><p>Channing gasped\u2014not so much at the glint of pain bordering on perverse pleasure, but at the male need pulsing from him and how her body immediately softened further, eager to answer the mating call of his.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go slow. This will be hard and fast. Jesus. This hot, tight pussy makes me fucking crazy.\u201d His hands curled over her hips and he slammed into her like a man possessed.</p><p>His heavy balls slapped her clit, his pubic hair tickled her ass and she lost her mind in the heady reaction of his absolute desperation for her. It humbled and amazed her how quickly he\u2019d amassed intimate knowledge of giving her exactly what she wanted without her having to play coy. Without her having to beg him. Without her having to worry about him saying no and thinking she was a perverted sex fiend.</p><p>Long, thorough stroke after long stroke of his rigid cock and her breathing became ragged. She teetered on the edge of climax, craving that rush as that elusive point dangled within reach. His right hand left her hip. She felt a coolness sweep over her rear hole and then a slight burning sensation as a thick finger breached the puckered opening.</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d His slick finger pumped in and out of her ass in time with his cock pounding into her cunt.</p><p>\u201cYes. I never thought this would feel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour body knows what it wants even if your brain is tellin\u2019 you it\u2019s wrong.\u201d A few more deft strokes then his finger slipped from that tight hole and she whimpered at the loss of fullness...until he returned with two fingers, stretching deep inside, teasing that hidden gland that made her muscles clamp down even harder around his marauding fingers.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to grind my cock in here. Jesus, you\u2019re so fucking tight.</p><p>So fucking silky and warm. So fucking...perfect . \u201d Colby grunted, and a hoarse shout echoed in the room.</p><p>She felt his balls draw up as he came. The twitching end of his cock coupled with the rhythmic stroking of his fingers in her ass sent her rocketing to an orgasm so intense, when she sagged against the pillow tucked under her belly, that accidental brush of the stiff fabric across her swollen clit increased the strength of her climax tenfold. She screamed until she ran out of air.</p><p>His fingers slipped from her darkest recess, yet his cock stayed buried to the root. Colby collapsed on her back, pushing them both flat to the mattress. The solid weight of him should have crushed her, but as she had no breath left in her body, it didn\u2019t matter. She reveled in the realization he was as bowled over by the passion between them as she was.</p><p>Eventually, tender kisses tracked her sweat-covered hairline. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Channing grunted but couldn\u2019t find the energy to move.</p><p>Colby chuckled. \u201cDarlin\u2019, you are amazingly sexy all the time, but in the morning especially. If we were home at the ranch I\u2019d never get up on time to get my chores done.\u201d</p><p>She grunted again.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry? You want me to rustle up something to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I ever remember how to work my body again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can work you over real good again\u2014\u201d his teeth sank into her shoulder blade, \u201c\u2014if you want.\u201d</p><p>That telltale twitching of his cock stirring within her spurred her to move. \u201cMaybe later. Get off me, cowboy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He placed a gentle kiss on the back of her head. \u201cThanks for lettin\u2019</p><p>me be rough and raunchy with you this morning. Most women hate it.\u201d</p><p>Immediate silence. \u201cShit. Sorry. I\u2019ve got a big mouth. Sometimes I\u2019m not tactful at all, talkin\u2019 to you about other women, right after we\u2019ve...never mind.\u201d He lifted his hips and pulled out of her body.</p> <p>The room reverberated with tension.</p><p>Channing rolled over. Colby had a sheepish expression on his face, like he expected her to chew him out for his overzealous amorous behavior. Feeling oddly protective of him because of the vulnerability she\u2019d glimpsed, she grabbed the back of his damp neck, bringing her mouth to his for a steamy kiss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like most women, Colby McKay. I like the raunchy side of you. I like the fact you don\u2019t treat me like a china doll and want me to show you my wild side, too.\u201d</p><p>He grinned shyly and smooched the tip of her nose. \u201cYou\u2019re sweeter\u2019n ten pounds of sugar. Get dressed or I won\u2019t be responsible for what happens next. We\u2019re already runnin\u2019 late.\u201d Whistling off-key, he disappeared into the bathroom.</p><p>Voices drifted out the back end of the horse trailer.</p> <p>\u201cNo. There ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 wrong with this rope. Leave it be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Edgard, it\u2019s a frayed piece of crap. Either you toss it in the garbage or I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis rope is not what\u2019s causing the problems, amigo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is that supposed to mean? You think it\u2019s my fault that you can\u2019t get a bead on anything that moves faster than my crippled-up grandma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make you pay for that, Trev. One way or another, easy or hard\u2014\u201d</p><p>Channing cleared her throat. \u201cKnock knock.\u201d</p> <p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI know you guys are in here, I heard you arguing. Hell, everyone in Limon heard you arguing. Am I interrupting something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Edgard said at the same time Trev said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well...I won\u2019t be long. I just need to eat some breakfast and then I\u2019ll get out of your hair and let you get back to it.\u201d</p><p>The trailer shook as Trevor stomped out. Another round of heated words was exchanged outside, followed by harsh silence.</p><p>Edgard climbed into the living quarters and watched Channing dump Raisin Bran into a bowl and pour milk over it.</p><p>She looked up at him and smiled warily. Good god. He was magnificent even when he scowled. \u201cWant some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. If it is no trouble.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d She slid the bowl at him and motioned for him to sit at the dinette. And she sat across from him and dug in.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear Trevor come back to the room last night. Were you guys beating the shit out of each other or something?\u201d</p><p>Edgard\u2019s spoon froze halfway to his mouth. \u201cNo. Why would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like you guys are always fighting.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and resumed eating. \u201cIt goes with the territory.</p><p>Especially when things aren\u2019t going well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve lost our rhythm and we\u2019ve dropped in the standings in the last two weeks. No money. Tempers are short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happens.\u201d</p><p>Channing stirred her cereal, half-tempted to abandon it and this awkward conversation.</p><p>Edgard sighed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She met his dark gaze. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me here, do you?\u201d</p><p>A heavy pause weighted the air as he considered his answer. \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides the fact I\u2019m a sure thing who\u2019s supposed to fill your every forbidden fantasy and you haven\u2019t so much as held my hand?\u201d</p><p>He smiled but it didn\u2019t reach his coal black eyes. \u201cNot exactly the shy, retiring type, are you, chica?\u201d</p><p>If he only knew she usually cowered in the corner. \u201cAm I too forward?</p><p>Is that why you don\u2019t like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanning, I like you fine. I\u2019ve just got a lot on my mind that has nothing to do with you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. So I don\u2019t disgust you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Colby said you three shared everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut even if I\u2019m...not your type and you\u2019re not attracted to me or whatever, I\u2019d...oh forget it.\u201d</p><p>He sighed again. \u201cNo. Spit it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d still like to be your friend, because like it or not, you\u2019re stuck with me for the next week.\u201d</p><p>A ghost of a gentle smile. \u201cYou clicked with Colby pretty fast, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She wanted to ask him why he didn\u2019t mention she\u2019d also clicked with Trevor\u2014with everyone besides him.</p><p>Edgard snagged her hand and gave her knuckles a quick kiss. \u201cNo wonder Colby calls you shug, you are very sweet.\u201d</p><p>She blushed.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming to the performances this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI planned to. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping that now that you\u2019re traveling with us, our luck will change.\u201d He stood, went to the sink and rinsed his bowl and spoon. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>Channing stared after him for the longest time, not entirely understanding what had happened, or if anything had changed.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>The afternoon was scorching hot in the rodeo stands. Channing had coated her bare arms with sunscreen and was glad her lightweight and light-colored cowboy hat deflected the worst of the sun\u2019s rays and allowed the slightest breeze through the finely woven straw to cool her head.</p><p>She sipped her iced tea and shifted, yanking down her yellow skirt.</p><p>Her legs stuck to the wool blanket she sat on, but it was better than the back of her thighs getting seared like raw steaks by the metal bleacher seats.</p><p>Edgard, Trevor and Colby had paid their entry fees, pinned their numbers to their backs and gone off to prepare to rodeo, leaving her free to explore the grounds before the action started. Since she didn\u2019t know any of the wives or girlfriends on the circuit, she had no choice but to sit by herself.</p><p>The rodeo announcer\u2019s voice boomed from the loudspeakers. \u201cNext up in saddle bronc riding is Colby McKay, the Wyoming cowboy from Sundance. Colby is currently ranked eighth in saddle bronc riding competition in the Mountain and Plains Circuit, with 8,712 cumulative points. He\u2019s also in the number two position this week in the All-Around standings. Ooh, and looky here, rodeo fans, Colby\u2019s draw today is the three-year-old named Elway, a bronc from the Sutliff Rodeo Stock Company out of Livingston, Colorado.\u201d</p><p>Channing focused the binoculars on the chutes across the arena. The gatekeeper waited in front of the metal gate, rope in hand, watching for Colby\u2019s signal. From this distance the only thing she could see was the top of Colby\u2019s brown cowboy hat. Then his free arm flew up, the gate opened and out he came, holding on for dear life as Elway tried like hell to buck him off.</p><p>But Colby was beautiful, sheer poetry in motion as he dipped and glided with every hop and bounce of the horse. His feet spurring, the red metallic fringe on his chaps fluttering. His counter movements were synchronized, almost as if he sensed what direction Elway planned to go before the horse himself even knew.</p><p>Colby stayed on the full eight seconds. He untied his hand and launched himself onto the pickup man\u2019s horse, just as smooth as if he\u2019d done it a million times.</p><p>Not a million, but thousands, and that probably wasn\u2019t much of an exaggeration. The crowd applauded. Colby waved his hat in acknowledgment as he sauntered back to the holding pens, squinting at the scoreboard, studying his ride on the big screen.</p><p>Channing held her breath and waited for the score\u2014half for the horse\u2019s performance, half for the rider\u2019s. Finally a red 78 flashed to another smattering of applause and the next rider was announced.</p><p>The score put Colby in second place. As he was the sixth rider out of twenty, there was a good chance he\u2019d get knocked down even farther in the standings. With this being a one-day rodeo, he had no chance to return tomorrow for a second go-round and the short go directly after that. Only the top five finished in the money.</p><p>She knew he wouldn\u2019t dwell on his performance. Unlike the other competitors, he wasn\u2019t finished with his events. He still had to compete in tie-down roping and bull riding. Trevor and Edgard both competed in tie-down roping but not bull riding.</p><p>Although bull riding tended to be the most exciting part of rodeo, it was also the most dangerous. And she remembered that like lots of other older competitors, Colby hadn\u2019t embraced the facemask equipment so many of the younger riders used. He wore the protective vest that would shield him from getting gored by the bull\u2019s horns, but he refused to put his face in a cage.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t the potential dangers bothered her when she watched Jared ride?</p><p>She dug out her notebook and jotted down her observations as she waited through the other events, bareback riding, steer wrestling\u2014also known as bulldogging\u2014and the event Trevor and Edgard were entered in, team roping.</p><p>Trevor was the header, which meant he was out of the gate first, and his job was to rope the steer either around the horns or around the neck.</p><p>While Edgard\u2019s job was to catch the steer\u2019s feet in his rope. If they were successful and caught the steer properly, then they had to face each other on their respective horses and the steer had to stay on the ground for the judge\u2019s call.</p><p>Team roping was tricky. If the horse took off before the steer broke the barrier, then they received no score. Not to mention the difficulties in the speed of the various steers and the ability to hook both horns and feet\u2014without missing.</p><p>Channing leaned forward when she saw Trevor and Edgard in the holding pens, working their ropes, circling the area on their individual quarter horses. Finally, it was their turn.</p><p>The rodeo announcer said, \u201cNext up, Edgard Mancuso and Trevor Glanzer. Trevor is currently twelfth in the standings, down from his high point of third last month. These guys have had a run of bad luck lately. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Let\u2019s hope this steer from Martinson Brothers out of Rapid City gives them an opportunity to win some money. Both these cowboys are the real deal folks. Edgard\u2019s family owns a large cattle operation in his native Brazil, and everyone recognizes the name Glanzer. Trevor\u2019s father, Tater, was world champion header twenty years ago. And...they\u2019re off!\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s horse, Chess, put on a burst of speed as the rope circled above Trevor\u2019s head. He hooked one horn and, lickety-split, Edgard caught the back legs and the steer went down. The crowd cheered.</p><p>But the scoreboard flashed NO SCORE because Trevor had broken the barrier. Channing saw the disappointment and frustration on both their faces as they waved stained work gloves to the crowd and followed the pickup men through the back gate and around the outside of the arena.</p> <p>Trevor and Edgard were out of the money again. It\u2019d be interesting to see what their mood would be like tonight. They were sniping at each other before they\u2019d lost.</p><p>Colby was first up in the tie-down roping.</p><p>Again the announcer rattled off Colby\u2019s stats. She wondered if he listened or if his focus was solely on the job at hand.</p><p>Channing remembered overhearing Colby being interviewed by a cub newspaper reporter in one of the first small towns they\u2019d visited on the circuit. How he\u2019d told the woman the reason he competed in three events, rather than two as most All-Around Cowboy contenders preferred, was because his real job\u2014ranching\u2014demanded he could accurately rope runaway steers and have no problems riding a variety of horses, which was why he picked saddle bronc and tie-down roping as his main events.</p><p>Then when she\u2019d asked why he\u2019d take a chance on bull riding, he\u2019d grinned and said bull riding was just for fun, because in real life on the ranch no one was stupid enough to tangle with a bull.</p> <p>Channing was closer to the action at this end of the arena and didn\u2019t need the binoculars. The black calf cleared the barrier and Colby\u2019s horse, King, hunkered down, dirt clods busting beneath the flying hooves. With his rope circling the air, Colby caught the calf. He launched himself off the horse with his piggin\u2019 string clamped between his teeth, knocked the calf to the ground, and flipped him on his side. The rope in his hands was a blur as he tied and then threw his hands in the air. The clock stopped.</p><p>King backed up, pulling the rope taut as Colby stood, and heaved himself back in the saddle, waiting the requisite six seconds so the judges could verify the tie held.</p><p>The calf squirmed but stayed down. The time read 4.7 seconds. The crowd whooped and hollered, and Colby waved as he reined King around and out of the arena.</p><p>Channing flipped open her program and wrote the times down next to the rest of the competitors. So far, Colby\u2019s time held the top spot. She knew that almost more important than the money were the points accumulation, which would keep his position in the All-Around race.</p><p>Edgard\u2019s time was 8.7 and Trevor ended up with no score.</p><p>Barrel racing was the next event. She recognized some of the women.</p> <p>Cowboys loved real cowgirls, especially when they looked like rodeo queens but could ride and rope as well as a man. Channing also knew that gossip about who was riding who outside the arena ran rampant on the circuit. Few of the participants in the \u201cwholesome family values\u201d</p><p>events of pro rodeo were squeaky clean. Musical horse trailers seemed to be the game of choice to stave off boredom.</p><p>As Tara Reynolds, reigning barrel racing circuit champ, cemented her first place in the standings by an 11.9 run, Channing tried to recall whether she\u2019d heard gossip about Colby or Trevor taking Tara and her tiara for a tumble.</p><p>Finally, the bull fighters came out and loud rock music blared from the speakers. The excitement of the crowd increased, beer vendors zipped through the stands more frequently. And from where she sat, it appeared more guys hung out by the chutes.</p><p>The bulls shut out the first ten competitors. Colby was up and he\u2019d drawn Black Bart, a nasty bull, who\u2019d gone unridden in the last seventeen outs. Channing remembered Jared getting tossed on his head right out of the gate when he\u2019d tried to ride Black Bart. She leaned closer, not realizing she was chewing her lip until she tasted blood.</p><p>She had to calm down. The rodeo season was long and injuries were plenty. She had to trust Colby knew what he was doing.</p><p>Trevor was behind the chute helping Colby get situated on the bull, holding the bullrope while Colby rosined up his glove. Trevor\u2019s foot came over the barrier and he pressed down on the bull\u2019s hind end in an effort to get him to stand up. It must\u2019ve worked because Colby\u2019s free arm gripped the metal bar. A couple of solid shifts on the bull\u2019s back, he nodded his head rapidly at the gate man and the gate flew open.</p><p>Man and bull burst out in a cloud of dust. Black Bart spun hard to the left, then countered with a spin to the right. Colby bumped along, his free arm high above him, but on the last switchback, Black Bart\u2019s hips canted to the right and Colby slid over sideways, catching air as he sailed from the bull\u2019s back.</p> <p>He hit the ground hard on his shoulder, spun around to his feet to see where the bull was, and raced pell-mell to the fence as Black Bart charged him, weaving around the bull fighters, horns down, aiming for Colby.</p><p>But realizing his prey was gone, Black Bart stopped abruptly. His balls and jowls shook with anger and long streams of white snot flew from his nose as he trotted over to the livestock pen.</p><p>Colby reached out for his bullrope and watched his ride on the big screen. The clock had stopped at 5.2 seconds. He climbed over the railing and disappeared.</p><p>She wondered if he was commiserating with other riders who\u2019d eaten dirt? Was he having his shoulder checked out in the medical tent?</p><p>Now they just had to wait for the payouts. Then they\u2019d be on the road headed to Greeley for the two-day event there.</p><p>Channing didn\u2019t know if she was supposed to head back to the horse trailer or wait in the stands. Jared had never wanted her around his rodeo pals or sponsors, now she knew why.</p><p>But things were different with Colby and Trevor at least. Except the devil on her shoulder whispered maybe they\u2019d prefer she\u2019d stay in the background, too. After all, she was scarcely above buckle-bunny status.</p><p>As she debated, Cash Big Crow spotted her and lumbered up to where she stood.</p><p>\u201cHoka hey. How come you\u2019re up here by yourself, pretty lady?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWhere else am I supposed to be? What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice ride, by the way. Did you finish in the money?\u201d</p><p>He scratched his head. \u201cI think so, that\u2019s why I\u2019m hangin\u2019 around.\u201d</p><p>He peered over her shoulder to the commotion in the parking lot behind her. \u201cYou know who Gemma Jansen is?\u201d Channing nodded. \u201cHave you seen her lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday. She was headed home.\u201d</p><p>Cash\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cHome? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said something about her foreman not doing his job at her place. Then I think she planned on taking bucking horses to Cody before she headed to Valentine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone? Goddamn her. That woman\u2019s got no business travelin\u2019 all over half the damn country by herself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlike you. You\u2019re perfectly entitled to do whatever the hell you want, right?\u201d</p><p>He grinned guiltily. \u201cSorry. I really ain\u2019t a chauvinist. It\u2019s just she\u2019s so damn stubborn she won\u2019t ask for help from nobody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanning!\u201d</p><p>She whirled around and saw Trevor hanging on the fence.</p><p>\u201cColby\u2019s been lookin\u2019 everywhere for you. Time to go, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe right there.\u201d She smiled at Cash. \u201cSee you in Greeley.\u201d</p><p>Colby paced back and forth. Grumbling to himself. Would it be too goddamn much for her to be around when he needed her?</p><p>\u201cColby? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He slowed his angry breathing as he stalked to where Channing had paused by the contestants\u2019 entry gate.</p><p>\u201cYou have a pained look on your face. Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Where the hell have you been?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cIn the stands watching the rodeo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust off enjoyin\u2019 yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Why? Isn\u2019t that what I\u2019m supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? What\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>Colby grabbed her arm and bent down until they were nose to nose.</p><p>\u201cWhy weren\u2019t you in the spectator stands with the other wives and girlfriends enjoyin\u2019 the rodeo from there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Because I-I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI searched for you after every goddammed event. You should\u2019ve been there. That\u2019s were I expect to see you from now on, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Channing threw off his hand. \u201cThen maybe you should\u2019ve given me a ticket, because I sat by myself on the other side of the arena like I always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, always. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe big deal is me wonderin\u2019 why don\u2019t you want to sit where you\u2019re supposed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSupposed to what?\u201d She speared a finger into his chest. \u201cYou took off and left me the minute we hit the check-in booth. I\u2019ve never been here. I\u2019ve never been to any rodeo with you, remember? What was I supposed to do? Stand around like some floozy and wait for you to make up your mind on whether I was good enough\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talkin\u2019 right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You don\u2019t get to order me around when you abandoned me. I don\u2019t know why the hell I\u2019m surprised that you don\u2019t want people to know you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>He was too pissed off to speak.</p><p>She blithely continued, \u201cI\u2019m used to being the cause of embarrassment. I am aware I rank well below the rest of the more knowledgeable buckle bunnies trailing after you like lovesick calves\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m warnin\u2019 you, Channing, stop chatterin\u2019 like a goddamn magpie and listen up right now.

So, despite your claims to the contrary, you\u2019re more alike than you know.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Colby stepped back and squeezed his eyes shut. He\u2019d forgotten Jared had kept Channing sequestered so no one blabbed to her about his wife. Therefore, Channing wouldn\u2019t have known a certain amount of seats were set aside at every performance for family and friends. When he reopened his eyes, she was stomping off.</p><p>\u201cChanning, come back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she tossed off over her shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m warnin\u2019 you, girl, you don\u2019t want to make me mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough shit, tough guy. Suck it up and walk it off.\u201d</p><p>People around them stopped and stared, nudged each other and chuckled, giving Colby a wide berth.</p><p>\u201cLast chance,\u201d he yelled.</p><p>Channing flipped him the bird without turning around. In fact, she ran away from him like her boot heels were smoking.</p> <p>He was going to paddle that sassy little ass but good.</p><p>\u201cToo bad you didn\u2019t bring your piggin\u2019 string. She sure is fit to be tied.</p><p>You tryin\u2019 to keep her on a short rope or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up, Cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your goddamn business.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrouble in paradise already? Is this about why you\u2019re makin\u2019 her sit by herself instead of in the VIP stand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t make her do nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I saw her up there, all alone, lookin\u2019 sad and lost, poor thing.\u201d</p><p>Colby clenched his teeth together.</p><p>\u201cI never pegged you for that kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kind who\u2019s afraid what snotty comments the other fellas\u2019</p><p>womenfolk might say to her about travelin\u2019 with all three of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell no, I could give a shit about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I do, or don\u2019t do, to her or for her, ain\u2019t your concern. She knows\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about behind-the-scenes rodeo protocol for contestants and their families, and that, my friend, is your fault. After being treated like Jared\u2019s dirty little secret, maybe you oughta make it clear you don\u2019t expect to treat her the same way, eh?\u201d Cash sauntered off as regal as a Lakota elder.</p><p>Shit. Colby kicked a clod of dirt. Hard.</p><p>Colby wended through the crowd, dodging kids, horseshit and the rhinestone sparkle of low-cut blouses as several buckle bunnies vied for his attention. A stolid woman and small boy all but tripped him to get him to stop. \u201cHey, are you Colby McKay?\u201d the youngster asked.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh wow, can I get your autograph? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d He hunkered down and snagged the program from the boy\u2019s grubby little hand along with the proffered pen. \u201cWho do I make this out to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMitchell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou a big rodeo fan, Mitchell?\u201d</p><p>He nodded somberly. \u201cSome day I\u2019m gonna be the number one All-Around Cowboy, too.\u201d</p><p>Colby didn\u2019t have the heart to tell the kid he was currently stuck in the number two position. Again. \u201cGood plan. Good luck. See you on the circuit someday.\u201d Colby smiled and patted him on the top of his blond head. When he looked around for Channing, he wasn\u2019t surprised she was long gone.</p><p>Damn fool woman.</p><p>Didn\u2019t want people to know they were together. Embarrassed by her.</p><p>Right. The little hellcat had even flipped him off! He seethed and knew there was only one way to handle this.</p><p>That woman was in a whole mess of trouble. He\u2019d show her exactly how he dealt with breaking in headstrong fillies.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Edgard was slumped against the wheel well on the right side of the horse trailer, eating sunflower seeds. He straightened up when he saw Colby barreling toward him.</p><p>\u201cIs she in there?\u201d Colby snapped.</p><p>\u201cYeah. So is Trevor. She seemed pretty upset. What did you do to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 compared to what I\u2019m gonna do to her.\u201d</p><p>Laconic Edgard vanished and he shifted lightning fast to block Colby\u2019s access to the living quarters.</p><p>\u201cMove it, Ed, unless you plan on helpin\u2019 with Channing\u2019s punishment.\u201d</p><p>His left eyebrow winged up at the word punishment. \u201cMaybe, amigo, you should walk it off and let Trevor calm her down first before you go busting in there like an angry bull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fuck I will. Move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re startin\u2019 to piss me off, Mancuso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, you know what? I don\u2019t like the look in your eye, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I think I will help you after all, just to make sure you don\u2019t get carried away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you. Miz Channing is a lot more delicate than you give her credit for and sometimes your punishments are just plain mean. And maybe she ain\u2019t the only one who oughta be reprimanded.\u201d Edgard spun and flung open the door.</p><p>Stung by the truth, Colby muttered, \u201cGreat,\u201d and followed Edgard inside the dark trailer.</p><p>Channing\u2019s arms were folded over her chest and her haughty little butt rested against the kitchen sink. She jumped when Colby slammed and locked the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Trevor asked.</p><p>\u201cStrip,\u201d Colby said to Channing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said strip. Now. Don\u2019t make me tell you again. You really don\u2019t want to add another punishment to the one you\u2019ve already earned, do you darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard but the look in her golden eyes was decidedly defiant. \u201cPunishment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell are you talkin\u2019 about, Colby?\u201d Trevor demanded.</p><p>Colby pointed at Channing. \u201cNot only does Little Miss think we\u2019re embarrassed to be seen with her, when I tried to talk to her outside the gates, she got smart with me and stormed off. So, since she don\u2019t want to talk, the time for talkin\u2019 is over. Start strippin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanning, girl, you didn\u2019t do that, did you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded warily at Trevor.</p><p>Trevor stood and stretched. \u201cAh, this is gonna be an interestin\u2019</p><p>afternoon. What do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind the ropes and that set of clamps.\u201d Colby flashed his teeth at her. \u201cLube would be good, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re helping him?\u201d Channing said to Trevor.</p><p>\u201cYep. We ain\u2019t gonna listen to nobody talkin\u2019 you down, least of all you doin\u2019 it to yourself. And when Colby or I or Edgard want to talk to you, it\u2019d be in your best interest to listen up. You\u2019ll learn there will be consequences. You heard him. Strip.\u201d Hiding the devilish twinkle in his eye, Trevor unlocked the door separating the living quarters from the horse stalls, and rummaged around in the tack closet.</p><p>She was frozen in place.</p><p>Colby watched and waited for her reaction.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. You said you\u2019d do whatever we wanted. That means you don\u2019t get to ask questions. Or argue, especially when you\u2019ve been bad.\u201d</p><p>Edgard sidled in front of her and gently stroked her cheek. \u201cListen to me and let me help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too? But I thought you didn\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not for you to question what I want. It is for you to do as you\u2019re told.\u201d</p><p>Colby frowned at Edgard\u2019s surprising response.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet thing, none of us would ever really hurt you. But you have to understand there is a price for insolence. No backtalk. Ever. That don\u2019t mean you can\u2019t speak your mind, but you don\u2019t get to dress us down in public. Ever.\u201d Edgard stroked her neck, sweetly, like they\u2019d been lovers for years, and nuzzled her temple. \u201cTake off your clothes, chica. I\u2019m sayin\u2019</p><p>this for your own good and as your friend.\u201d</p><p>Her shaking hands fumbled with the button before the swishy skirt fell to the floor. The T-shirt was next, leaving Channing clad only in a bra and panties.</p><p>Colby\u2019s cock grew impossibly harder at her exposed creamy skin and her hesitation. \u201cLeave the boots on,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cEverything else, off.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t meet his gaze as she shimmied the lemon yellow panties down her taut thighs and whisked off the matching bra.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful.\u201d Colby ambled to stand beside her, squeezing his hands in fists to keep from touching her. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna condition you. So you\u2019ll know why it pisses me off that you\u2019d ever be foolish enough to think you\u2019d embarrass me. Or any of us. Why you never, ever get to talk to me that way in public again.\u201d Even if I sort of deserved it. He called over his shoulder, \u201cTrev? Where are those goddamn ropes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here. We lost the last set of clamps, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like we\u2019ll be makin\u2019 a trip to the adult toy store soon.\u201d He withheld a wicked smile at Channing\u2019s wide-eyed stare. \u201cTie her hands behind her back with that one; give the other one to me.\u201d He smacked it on his palm twice and Channing jumped.</p><p>Trevor nodded and twirled her around. Once he finished securing her, Colby said, \u201cEd, grab the mirror out of the bathroom.\u201d He led Channing to the square dining table and stretched her across the surface, belly down.</p><p>\u201cThis is cold!\u201d</p><p>Colby couldn\u2019t help but shape his hands over her silky flesh, drawing a shudder and a fresh set of goose bumps across her soft skin. \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d</p><p>When Edgard returned with the mirror, Colby tilted it against the plaid seat cushion so Channing could see the smooth line of her back and the intriguing curve of her ass.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, or I\u2019ll gag you. Watch the mirror. If we see you lookin\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>anywhere else, the punishment starts over from the beginning, understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Using the soft, frayed end of the old cotton rope, Colby swished it across her shoulder blades. He flicked it over the top of her arms. The ticklish bend of her torso. Trailed it up and down her spine softly, like a feather. He crisscrossed it over her legs. He performed the caress a dozen times, watching her squirm more thoroughly with every pass. Smelling her excitement with each pass.</p> <p>Then he snapped his wrist and whipped the rope against her ass, each cheek, ten times in rapid succession.</p><p>Channing gasped.</p><p>He angled his face near her head. \u201cListen up. I\u2019m not embarrassed by you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Colby flicked the rope on each cheek again. \u201cRepeat it back to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not embarrassed by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He dragged the silky end of the rope down her butt crack.</p><p>\u201cSay: I want you around.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>Three whips this time. Her cheeks flexed. \u201cI want you around. Say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re learnin\u2019. Last thing. You wanna dress me down, do it in private.\u201d Four sharp cracks.</p><p>Channing groaned.</p><p>\u201cSay no backtalk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo backtalk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? That ain\u2019t so bad.\u201d Colby whispered in her ear, \u201cTell me the truth. Don\u2019t you like that little spark of pain with your pleasure?\u201d He added five more strokes to each cheek.</p><p>Her gaze darted to the mirror and the stripes that\u2019d bloomed on her flesh. Not ugly raised welts, just pink strips, which contrasted with her pearly white skin.</p><p>\u201cNow, isn\u2019t that pretty?\u201d he murmured, skimming his rough palm over the quivering globes of her butt. \u201cWarm. Soft.\u201d</p><p>She whimpered.</p> <p>\u201cAh, shug, I told you that you wouldn\u2019t be cold for long. You feelin\u2019</p><p>the heat yet?\u201d</p><p>A tiny nod.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been a good girl, takin\u2019 your licks with no complaints. Let me take the sting away.\u201d Colby slid her body down the table until the tips of her pointy-toed turquoise boots hit the carpet. \u201cSpread your legs wide. I wanna see if your pussy is the same color as those lovely stripes on your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d Trevor asked.</p><p>\u201cGet that mirror to the right angle and make sure she watches everything I\u2019m doing to her.\u201d Colby dropped to his knees. He cupped her butt cheeks and looked his fill. The blood-darkened pink of the hood covering her clit peeked out from between her ruby-red pussy lips. The lighter salmon color of the opening to her cunt gave way to mauve of her puckered rosette. He closed his eyes briefly and inhaled the heady aroma of her excitement.</p><p>Then Colby buried his face into the paradise between her soft thighs.</p><p>Licking her sweet syrup, sucking her inflamed clit, losing himself and his anger in her taste and her feminine heat. He made soft humming noises against that little throbbing nub until she began to grind that warm wetness to into his face.</p><p>When he sensed the change in her breathing and the sudden tension in her muscles, he removed his mouth and pulled back, leaving her panting for more, hanging on the cusp of an explosion.</p><p>Their eyes met in the mirror. \u201cI want you, Chan. I want you bad. I always want you. Say it back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me bad. Please\u2014\u201d</p><p>He growled and smacked her ass. \u201cSay it right this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me. You want me bad. You always want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn right. Don\u2019t forget it.\u201d Without looking away from her, he said, \u201cEdgard. Drop your pants and move to the head of the table.\u201d</p><p>Clank clank echoed as Edgard freed the metal catch on his big belt buckle. Then the tinny sound of a zipper releasing and the rustle of denim, followed by muffled footsteps filled the stillness.</p><p>To Edgard, Colby said, \u201cMake sure she knows you want her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Colby hissed. \u201cSuck him off, Channing. Make it good. Make me wish it was my dick deep in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him twice before focusing on Edgard.</p><p>Edgard rubbed the weeping end of his cock over her lips, murmuring to her, threading her curly hair through his fingers. She opened and swallowed him in increments. Finally, Edgard\u2019s rosy meat disappeared completely between Channing\u2019s full lips, a second later that wet cock slid back out.</p><p>She was so fucking sexy Colby found it hard to breathe.</p><p>Edgard\u2019s hips picked up a continual rhythm. He whispered foreign words to her, which heightened the intimacy of her moist sucking sounds and the stuttered male breathing clouding the small space.</p><p>Jesus. Colby didn\u2019t want to watch. He wanted to participate. More than anything he wanted to go back and fix things so they returned to the way they were this morning. He sensed Trevor behind him, waiting for further instructions. Trevor knew the score, knew it was Colby\u2019s show.</p><p>\u201cGive it to her however she wants it, Trev. Just make it good for her, okay?\u201d Colby adjusted his iron erection and turned for the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the horses ready to load. We need to leave soon.\u201d</p><p>Channing stopped and cranked her head around. \u201cColby?\u201d</p><p>Colby locked his gaze to hers. \u201cThis is my punishment, because I want you like crazy, darlin\u2019, and I\u2019m walkin\u2019 away with my cock tucked between my legs. I\u2019m sorry. I never should\u2019ve left you to fend for yourself, especially after the way Jared treated you. The last thing I am is embarrassed that you\u2019re with me. I promise it won\u2019t happen again. Have fun with these boys. Let them show you how worthy you are. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d The door clicked shut behind him.</p><p>Half an hour later his hard-on still hadn\u2019t deflated. It was going to be a long-ass drive to Greeley.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Colby drove. Trevor navigated. The traffic around Denver was a nasty snarl, so the mood inside the cab was subdued.</p><p>They pulled into another family-type \u201cmotor inn\u201d and, immediately, Colby hopped out to take care of the horses. Edgard helped, leaving Channing and Trevor to check in. As soon as they had the keys, Trevor left her, too.</p><p>Once she\u2019d unpacked, Channing realized all of her clothes were dirty and she set off in search of a laundry room. While the loads washed, she wrote in her journal, pouring out her frustration. With Colby. With Trevor. With Edgard. But mostly with Colby and his disappearing act today.</p><p>Yeah, she\u2019d been furious with him for getting pissed off at her for something that wasn\u2019t her fault. Then demanding her obedience. After he\u2019d had her submission and had spanked her ass, licked her sex like a starving man, consequently turning her into a trembling pile of fuck-me-now pleading whimpers, he\u2019d walked away. Walked away!</p><p>True, he hadn\u2019t exactly left her high and dry. Trevor had fucked her thoroughly, making sure she came twice before he gave into his own needs. But it\u2019d been just plain weird to give Edgard a blowjob. First off, he wasn\u2019t circumcised. Second, he didn\u2019t come in her mouth, but in his own hand. She got the feeling he was disappointed in her performance.</p><p>Like he expected...better. Like he couldn\u2019t wait for it to be over.</p><p>Yeah. That\u2019d give a girl a complex.</p><p>Oh sure, he\u2019d whispered sweet nothings in her ear in that sexy Portuguese accent while Trevor nailed her from behind. But Edgard hadn\u2019t kissed her. Or touched her body anywhere besides her face. Nor did he make a big deal about her breasts\u2014most men went crazy kissing and fondling, sucking and biting her nipples. Since her hands had been bound, why hadn\u2019t he helped Trevor get her off faster by rubbing her clit?</p><p>She knew if Colby had been in the room, his hands, his mouth, his cock\u2014his undivided attention would\u2019ve been all over her.</p><p>The rest of the interlude had scarcely lasted twenty minutes. Yeah, she\u2019d enjoyed herself, and Trevor was a caring lover. But the truth was, she\u2019d missed Colby.</p><p>What kind of idiot did that make her? They\u2019d only been together two days and she\u2019d already attached herself to him like one of those pesky sticky burrs that get caught up in horse\u2019s tails.</p><p>And yet, she knew in her heart Colby had been mortified by his own behavior. Not the little whipping he\u2019d given her, but letting her sit alone.</p><p>Not knowing that she hadn\u2019t known any better and blaming himself.</p><p>The man was unbelievably sweet when he wasn\u2019t being a pain in the ass.</p><p>The two loads spun and she tossed them in the dryer along with a perfumed dryer sheet. As she sat at the chipped Formica table, the words on the paper changed from angry to speculative\u2014instead of writing about herself, she wrote about him. Them. The folks she\u2019d come across in her travels, salt-of-the-earth types, so far removed from the salty-tongued people she\u2019d grown up around.</p><p>Her mind drifted to a series of vignettes she\u2019d tucked away in her subconscious. An older couple she\u2019d seen in the beer line sneaking foamy kisses. A cowgirl hiding her tears as she currycombed and talked to her horse. The bruises on a youngster\u2019s arm as he practiced bulldogging on his border collie. The broken look on a young cowboy\u2019s face as he looked longingly at the steel gate separating the contestants from the wannabes.</p><p>Real life. Real people. Channing realized this sabbatical wasn\u2019t about getting away from her parent\u2019s expectations, acting the rebel, hiding for a time and then (grudgingly) accepting her destiny. This trip would be the defining point in her life.</p><p>The dryer buzzed, jarring her from her reverie. She looked around and smiled. Never in a million years would she have believed she\u2019d experience a catharsis in a dingy laundry room in Colorado.</p><p>She folded her clothes and repacked them in her small rolling suitcase and dragged it back to the empty room. Ten minutes later she was still bored. No one told her she had to sit and wait for the trio to return. She was perfectly capable of finding her own entertainment.</p><p>After a quick fix of her hair and makeup, Channing ventured into the warm night. Traffic whooshed by. Instead of the heavy fumes of exhaust, she smelled pine. Muffled children\u2019s shrieks ricocheted from the outdoor pool behind the motel office. Up the road on the left she spied a couple of fast food places...and the neon sign of a bucking bronc boasting an honest-to-God, Western honky-tonk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yee-haw. No brainer which direction she headed.</p><p>George Strait blared from the speakers. Pitchers of beer were refilled almost as quickly as they\u2019d emptied. The bar was elbow to elbow with cowboys of all ages, shapes, and sizes. Hats of all colors. The cowgirls weren\u2019t as plentiful, so Channing had spent a goodly amount of time fending off advances. She began to question the wisdom in coming here alone.</p><p>She\u2019d managed to choke down a burger\u2014no fries\u2014in between sips of a Fat Tire beer. The music was good, people were dancing up a storm and she probably would\u2019ve been having a great time if she\u2019d known a single soul. Instead, she was an outsider.</p> <p>Alone again.</p><p>Channing crumpled her bar napkin and decided to call it a night. She spun her barstool around, right into Cash Big Crow.</p><p>His mouth creased into a grin that lit up his whole face. \u201cChanning. I wondered if that was you. Where are the guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They dumped me off at the room. When I became bored waiting for them I went looking for food and fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t imagine Colby\u2019s gonna be too thrilled when he finds out you\u2019ve been here alone.\u201d</p> <p>She leaned forward and whispered, \u201cSo don\u2019t tell him.\u201d</p><p>Cash chuckled. \u201cNo comment, but I ain\u2019t got a death wish for keepin\u2019</p><p>something from him that he\u2019s got a right to know.\u201d</p><p>A right to know. She scowled.</p><p>\u201cAny contests going on so\u2019s you can add to your trophy collection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. One trophy doesn\u2019t a collection make, Cash. Unlike you guys always chasing after that next shiny buckle and payout, I\u2019ll quit while I\u2019m ahead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood plan. So, you wanna take a spin on the dance floor? I promise I don\u2019t do none of that fancy footwork like you see at powwows.\u201d</p><p>Playfully, she tugged his braid. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Cash was an excellent dancer and they laughed and two-stepped through four fast songs. Needing to catch her breath, Channing led him off the dance floor and he disappeared to answer his cell phone.</p><p>She rested against a wooden pillar and observed the action on the dance floor. One couple in matching Western shirts had to be in their eighties. She wondered how long they\u2019d been together. If they had a big family, a ton of grandkids and great-grandkids. Or maybe they\u2019d been high school sweethearts and after spending their lives married to other people they\u2019d found each other again.</p><p>A scratchy male voice said, \u201cYou wanna dance?\u201d</p><p>Channing didn\u2019t turn around. \u201cNo. But thank you for asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>The boozy breath got a whole lot closer.</p> <p>\u201cI just don\u2019t.\u201d Take a hint, buddy.</p><p>\u201cThink you\u2019re too good for me? You can dance with that dirty injun, but not with me?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t rise to his taunts. Just ignore him.</p><p>A gummy hand circled her upper arm and jerked her sideways.</p><p>Channing tried to pull away but didn\u2019t have much leverage against his strength. Too bad she didn\u2019t have her trophy, she could just clock him a good one.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we oughta have our own private party. Outside. I got a big quad cab. The seats are plenty soft.\u201d</p><p>She fought the rising panic. There were lots of people in here.</p><p>Someone would notice this beast strong-arming her out the door, wouldn\u2019t they? Surely, Cash would be back soon. Channing forced herself to look at the asshole harassing her, rather than cowering.</p><p>The guy\u2019s smile was as greasy as his hair. His eyes were as hard and mean as his grip. \u201cMaybe I oughtn\u2019t ask. Maybe I oughta just take what I want.\u201d His grimy, crooked finger slid down the center of her body, between her breasts to her belly button. \u201cI think you\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered with revulsion.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe you oughta get your goddamn hand offa her before I rip it clean off your body.\u201d</p><p>The greasy guy tipped his head back and glared at Colby from beneath the rim of his filthy baseball cap. \u201cI saw her first. Find your own bunny, sheep boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your fucking hand off her right now. I ain\u2019t askin\u2019, I\u2019m tellin\u2019 you and I won\u2019t say it again.\u201d</p><p>Recognizing the menace in Colby\u2019s tone, the man\u2019s hand dropped like a rock. \u201cHave at her. We\u2019ll see how damn tough you are when her injun boyfriend comes back and gut stabs you.\u201d He sneered and staggered away.</p><p>Channing launched herself at Colby, hiding her face in the warm curve of his neck.</p><p>\u201cHey, now, darlin\u2019, what\u2019s this? You okay?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>He sucked in a harsh breath. \u201cWhere did that slimy fucker touch you? I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>Again she shook her head.</p><p>He cupped her face in his hands and tilted her face toward his. \u201cWhat then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here. It was stupid of me to come by myself but I was bored and lonely and hungry and you were mad at me and I know I\u2019m supposed to be a tough and independent woman\u2014\u201d</p><p>Instantly, Colby\u2019s mouth covered hers. His kiss was a mixture of comfort and sweetness and protection. When he broke away, Channing felt tears pooling in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for today. I just don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing half the time.</p><p>I\u2019m just not a very good cowgirl. I didn\u2019t mean to make you mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh. We\u2019ll figure it out. Come on. Let me hold you until you calm down some.\u201d He maneuvered her onto the dance floor, twined her body around his to his liking and they swayed to the strains of \u201cLove Can Build a Bridge\u201d.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cMuch. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I\u2019m sorry about today too, shug.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and snuggled closer.</p><p>When the song ended he whispered, \u201cAm I gonna have to kick someone else\u2019s ass tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Grabby said something about your injun boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. He meant Cash. He was hanging out with me for awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me to buy him a beer to thank him for lookin\u2019 out for my best girl.\u201d</p><p>Channing slanted back and studied Colby\u2019s face, hidden in the shadow of his cowboy hat and the dimness of the bar. \u201cAm I really your best girl, Colby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn right you are. You\u2019re my only girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like fighting with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Relief made her reckless and she ground her pelvis against his and discovered he was already hard. \u201cMmm. Maybe I need a refresher on the responsibilities of being your best girl. You can leave out the ass whooping this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanning\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hated the way you left me today, and we didn\u2019t get anything resolved, especially after the way you put your mouth on me, I was so close to coming\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colby growled and clamped his hands on her gyrating hips. \u201cUnless you want me to fuck you right here on the dance floor, knock it off, Chan. I\u2019m not kiddin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not either. I missed you. Let me show you how much.\u201d She stretched to her tiptoes and brushed her lips across the pulse thrumming in his throat.</p><p>Tonight he was clean-shaven. A subtle piney scent teased her from beneath his starched shirt collar. She loved his smooth, square jaw and the way he considered her from beneath his ridiculously long dark eyelashes. She loved how his nostrils flared when he was aroused and the determined set to his mouth just before he kissed her. Everything about this sturdy, sexy, sweet man intoxicated her.</p><p>In between nibbling bites on his neck, she whispered, \u201cI want to be with you, Colby. Running my hands over your skin as your rough flesh rubs against mine. Digging my heels into your tight little cowboy butt as you slide in and out of me. Looking in your gorgeous blue eyes as we\u2019re barely a breath apart. Tasting your kisses. Seeing those dimples wink at me when I do something that turns you on. Your sweat mingling with mine, how it lets our bodies slide together perfectly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cJesus, I only got so much willpower where you\u2019re concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s bad because?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I gotta cool down or it\u2019ll be over before it even starts. Damn, girl, I need a diversion.\u201d</p><p>Rather than towing her from the dance floor like a man on a mission to get her naked, he sauntered to the back corner of the bar by the dartboards and introduced her to some of the other guys she\u2019d recognized from the circuit.</p><p>Normally she wasn\u2019t tongue-tied in social situations but tonight she felt shy. Especially when Colby plopped down and rather than finding her another chair, he pulled her on his lap. Her butt straddled his thigh, high, near his groin.</p><p>A beer bottle dangled from his fingers and if she wanted a drink, he held it up for her to sip. She swore the heat from his lips left an impression on the glass, and her own lips fit that dent perfectly.</p><p>His insistence on catering to her and showing every one of his pals they were together didn\u2019t make her feel like a piece of property. It made her feel special. Like she belonged.</p><p>Colby and the guys talked specifics on their rides and times and pros and cons of certain rough stock. Channing paid close attention because it fascinated her. The other women didn\u2019t seem to care. Because they\u2019d heard the stories a million times? Or because the dirt on rodeoing full time was old hat to them?</p><p>Cash swung by to make sure she was all right before he bid the crew goodnight. The hardcore partiers\u2014young, fresh-faced cowboys barely old enough to shave\u2014gave Cash a rash of crap for being an old timer. Cash winked at her and took it in stride. Channing noticed Cash politely excused himself from the clutches of several buckle bunnies and left alone. What was up with that? Very few cowboys opted to say no to willing female flesh. Ever.</p><p>During the latter part of the conversation with a group of tie-down ropers, Colby started lightly stroking the exposed skin on her lower back where her shirt gapped from her skirt. An idle, fleeting touch, which should\u2019ve been comforting but packed a powerful punch of sexual promise. Every lingering caress of his blunt, rough finger felt like he was stroking her pussy. Didn\u2019t take long for her panties to become soaked through. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sighing, she wiggled closer to his chest.</p><p>He subtly inched away, only to continue battering her senses with the lazy assault.</p><p>Two can play this game, Channing thought. When she rhythmically clenched her butt cheeks together on Colby\u2019s thigh, he stood so quickly he almost knocked her on her ass.</p> <p>Amidst catcalls and high-fives and suggestions for positions (spread-eagled across the horse trailer hitch?) they exited the rowdy bar.</p><p>Outside in the chilly mountain air, she shivered in her thin T-shirt.</p><p>Colby didn\u2019t notice. They didn\u2019t talk at all until they cleared the main thoroughfare and were hidden in the shadows of the motel outbuildings.</p><p>Pine trees towered above them. Moonlight was conspicuously absent.</p><p>Colby twirled Channing around, pressing her back against a metal shed as he devoured her with his lips, teeth, and tongue. His hands squeezed her breasts, his thumbs rasped over her hardened nipples, his knee separated her legs and he ground his brawny thigh into her crotch.</p> <p>His lips slid to her ear. \u201cI can\u2019t wait. I\u2019ve wanted you all goddamn day.</p><p>\u2018Bout killed me to walk away from you earlier, leavin\u2019 you with them. I can\u2019t think but for wantin\u2019 you. Right here, right now, Chan. Darlin\u2019, say yes. I\u2019m dyin\u2019 to feel you around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes. Please, Colby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrap your legs over my hips.\u201d He lifted her off the ground. \u201cHave I told you how much I love this naughty little skirt? Mmm-mmm. Gotta</p><p>\u2019preciate this easy access.\u201d His thumb swept the damp cotton of her panties, and then wiggled under the elastic leg band. Finding her already hot and slick, he groaned. \u201cShug, you heat up as fast as my woodstove.</p><p>Makes me a crazy man that my touch makes you so wet.\u201d</p> <p>Frantic from his sexy admission, Channing tugged on his championship belt buckle. The zipper slid down fine, but the skintight Wranglers were a problem. \u201cMaybe you should start wearing skirts too, cowboy, because there ain\u2019t nothing easy about getting these jeans off.</p><p>Did you borrow a pair from Dwight Yoakam? Damn, these things are really snug.\u201d</p><p>Colby laughed. \u201cMore snug in some places than others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny! Help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d He set her down, hooked his thumbs in the belt loops and yanked. Stiff denim and the soft flannel boxers slid down to his knees.</p><p>He picked her back up and practically threw her against the building.</p><p>That supremely hot, long male flesh teased her belly, trailing a bead of pre-come above her navel. She arched, wanting that hardness buried deep in her molten core. Now.</p><p>\u201cStop bouncin\u2019 around.\u201d Colby peeled her T-shirt and bra up and feasted on her nipples. \u201cGod, I love your tits.\u201d He sucked powerfully enough to leave a mark. \u201cI want to spend hours\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot hours and especially not now. Geez, afterward you can play with them until they fall off, but right now, fuck me, Colby. Just bend your knees and slide it in deep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure have a dirty mouth. It\u2019s one of the things I like best about you. Well, besides this.\u201d</p><p>He shifted his hips, hunkered down to a shallow squat, and just like that, he filled her in one mighty stroke. He caught her whimper in a tongue-tangling kiss.</p><p>The potent sensation of his cock thrusting inside her, sleek and thick and hot, made her forget her first foray into exhibitionism and everything besides satiating her sexual greed for this man.</p><p>He fucked her slowly, steadily and seamlessly. The jagged line of pubic hair above his cock abraded her clit, creating friction so profoundly delicious she couldn\u2019t concentrate on their kiss and she had to break it off.</p><p>Channing gasped for breath. Her mind spun and her head fell back against the cool metal, giving Colby total access to her neck. Like a heat-seeking missile, he zeroed in on the sweet spot; his moist lips left a tingle on her skin that burned hotter with every flicker of his scorching tongue.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, like that, don\u2019t change a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even like this?\u201d On the upstroke he canted his pelvis slightly and that extra concentrated pressure did the trick.</p><p>Her pussy clenched, that liquid pulsing began slowly, picked up speed like a runaway semi-truck, faster and faster and faster and then roared through her as she shattered.</p><p>Colby shifted again, grinding side to side as his teeth nipped the cord straining in her arched neck. \u201cCome on, darlin\u2019, take me with you this time. Bear down, bring me deep as you can.\u201d As he pressed her knees out, she countered by squeezing her interior muscles.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn. Yeah. That\u2019s it, Chan, hang tight.\u201d He didn\u2019t plunge faster, he just let her pulsing body coax the orgasm from him, pulling him deeper as they rocked together with sweet intensity.</p><p>Spent, a single satisfied shiver traveled through him and she felt it as deeply as if her own body had generated it. With his face nestled against her collarbone, his labored exhalations cooled her dampened skin.</p><p>He muttered, \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo condom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He angled back to look at her, apparently not caring that his hat was completely cockeyed. \u201cBad timing, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not.\u201d She dipped her head and studied the alabaster snaps on his shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He tipped her chin back up. \u201cDarlin\u2019, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, really. Okay, I mean, there is something, it\u2019s not wrong per se. I have a confession to make and I don\u2019t want you to get mad at me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She blurted, \u201cI\u2019m on the pill. You probably figured out I don\u2019t have much sexual experience and I\u2019ve heard such horror stories about the STDs floating around out there that I wanted to make sure that I was always protected on all fronts. And damn. I\u2019m sorry. After what happened with Jared, it just seemed safer to keep that information to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh, darlin\u2019, stop babblin\u2019. You don\u2019t have to be defensive with me, all right? Believe it or not, I understand. And if it\u2019ll ease your mind, I ain\u2019t 98</p><p>been with a woman without wearing a condom since I was a green lad of about sixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no.\u201d</p><p>Channing closed her eyes. \u201cGood. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He shifted his hips, and a stream of moisture trickled down as he eased his spent cock out of her tender body. \u201cWhen it\u2019s just you and me, can we skip the rubbers? \u2018Cause I sure like really feelin\u2019 you\u2014just you\u2014bare against me. There ain\u2019t nothing like it in the world.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her cheek along his. \u201cSure. Speaking of you and me...where am I sleeping tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the question oughta be where do you want to sleep tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you.\u201d She felt him smile against her cheek.</p><p>\u201cGood answer. We\u2019re bunkin\u2019 in the horse trailer. You need anything from the motel room before we hit the hay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust my toothbrush now that we\u2019ve got that pesky condom issue cleared up.\u201d</p><p>Colby chuckled and pressed a soft kiss on her forehead. \u201cYou sore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Have we really only been together a coupla days?\u201d</p><p>She stiffened up. \u201cYes. Why? Is time dragging?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. On the road, time usually drags like an old dog. But it seems like you\u2019ve always been around. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Probably not the first time he\u2019d said such sugared words, but she\u2019d take it since it was the first time anyone had ever uttered them to her.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cMe too, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Colby was up early the next morning. As much as he wanted to start his day off with a bang and loll in bed with Channing, he knew she was sore. With good reason. He couldn\u2019t get enough of her.</p><p>He kissed her exposed nipple, grinning when she purred and snuggled into him. Damn distracting woman.</p><p>Fortified with free coffee from the motel lobby, he knocked on the door to the room. \u201cIt\u2019s Colby. Open the damn door.\u201d</p><p>A click of the slide latch moving and then Trevor swung open the door. \u201cHey. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Colby peered over Trevor\u2019s bare shoulder at the rumpled bed.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Edgard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShower. He\u2019ll be out in a minute. Before you ask, he\u2019s already checked on the horses this morning.\u201d Trevor yawned. \u201cWhere\u2019s Channing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleepin\u2019 in the horse trailer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is now.\u201d Colby sipped his coffee and flopped in the chair by the windows. He told Trevor what\u2019d gone down the previous night. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t want her goin\u2019 nowhere alone. She snuck off for that rowdy bar down the street and some greasy trucker was sniffin\u2019 around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou set him straight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get everything straightened out with her?\u201d</p><p>Colby grinned. \u201cDamn right. Why you think she\u2019s sleepin\u2019 like a baby?\u201d</p><p>Trevor high-fived him. \u201cGoddamn, Colby. If there was a woman alive who could change my wicked ways and make me want to settle down, it\u2019d be her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen, brother. But you\u2019d have to fight me for her. So you understand why I want us all to keep a better eye on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on who?\u201d Edgard said as he cracked open the bathroom door.</p><p>Colby relayed the scene from the bar.</p><p>It was a typical morning. They talked rodeo. Advice was offered and taken. Aches and pains were detailed. When Trevor and Edgard began to argue strategy, Colby made his getaway. He refilled his coffee and stopped to chat with a couple of young bull riders from Utah before he went to check on Channing.</p><p>In the horse trailer, Channing sat slumped over the table, naked, listlessly stirring her half-eaten bowl of Raisin Bran. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He ran a hand down her bare back. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked as he sprawled in the chair next to her.</p><p>\u201cTired.

We don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Channing groaned.</p> <p>\u201cBut I will let you have some of my coffee.\u201d He grabbed a Styrofoam cup and poured half his lukewarm coffee into it. Then he slid it next to her cereal bowl.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She downed it in one swallow. \u201cThe next time we pass a Wal-Mart I\u2019m jumping out. I don\u2019t care if we\u2019ve got the horse trailer fully loaded and the governor aboard. I\u2019m buying a coffee pot and a jumbo can of coffee. I\u2019m not fit for human company without my daily infusion of vitamin caffeine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissin\u2019 Starbucks, are you?\u201d</p><p>She shot him a dirty look. \u201cAre you serious? Their coffee tastes like strained dog shit. Plus, who\u2019s dumb enough to pay four bucks for a cup of burned coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of folks, apparently. Them damn stores are everywhere. You\u2019d think those people were drinkin\u2019 liquid gold, they\u2019re so obsessed with havin\u2019 that same brand every morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me. They\u2019re a bunch of sheep. Give me a plain old cup of joe\u2014black\u2014and I\u2019m a happy camper.\u201d Channing snickered. \u201cOr I\u2019d be happy if this camper had a Mr. Coffee.\u201d</p> <p>Colby smoothed a wayward curl behind her ear. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you fixed up. I can\u2019t have my best girl cranky at the crack of dawn, now can I? You comin\u2019 to watch us today, Chan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Provided you show me where I\u2019m supposed to be sitting.\u201d</p><p>A sneaky smile curled the corners of her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m not up for another round of punishment. My ass is still a little tender from that whippin\u2019</p><p>yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cToo bad what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat your ass is tender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>He stared at her from beneath lowered lashes. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that a hint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very broad one.\u201d He stood, sorry he\u2019d initiated the conversation so early. \u201cYour ticket will be under my name at the box office. I\u2019ve got to get goin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you eating anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never eat before I compete.\u201d</p><p>Channing smiled again. \u201cPity.\u201d</p><p>By the calculating look on her face, he knew she hadn\u2019t been thinking about him eating food. \u201cYou are one naughty girl, ain\u2019t ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bring out the worst in me, but you don\u2019t think I\u2019m nearly naughty enough.\u201d</p><p>An awkward moment filled the air.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna explain that, Chan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>He growled. \u201cYou\u2019re mighty close to earnin\u2019 another punishment. I think you liked gettin\u2019 your sweet butt whipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. Well, sort of. But I tell you what, cowboy, I\u2019ll make you a real sweet deal.\u201d</p><p>Colby had to remind himself that she was still pretty shy about telling him what she wanted in bed. \u201cI\u2019m listenin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll forget all about my sore ass, and let you have your wicked way with it tonight...if I see a ninety-point bull ride out of you today.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit. So much for her supposed shyness. \u201cNo foolin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. But if you get anything less than a ninety, you have to trot your tight little cowboy behind right over to Wal-Mart, still wearing your sexy chaps, your back number and arena dirt, and buy me a coffee pot.</p><p>A nice one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got yourself a deal, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne other thing.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed. It figured there\u2019d be conditions.</p><p>\u201cIf this does come to pass tonight, for my first time, so to speak, I\u2019d rather not bring in Trevor and Edgard. I\u2019d rather this stayed...between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy just us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I feel safe with you.\u201d</p><p>Colby cupped her face in his hands and kissed her soundly. The woman constantly surprised him. \u201cOkay. But there\u2019s one thing you need to do for me when I nail that ninety-point score.\u201d</p><p>Her teasing smile froze. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring lots of lube. \u2018Cause it probably ain\u2019t gonna be no easy ride.\u201d He grinned and scooted from the trailer before she smacked him.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t his mama be scandalized by his raunchy behavior and dirty talk?</p><p>Almost on cue, his cell phone rang. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that any way to greet your mother, Colby West McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Hey, Ma, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to double-check on you since I never hear from you.</p><p>Make sure you weren\u2019t lying in a ditch someplace in some godforsaken redneck state.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes, knowing he wouldn\u2019t dare do that in front of her.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Don\u2019t take it personal. I\u2019m either too busy or too damn tired. I ain\u2019t callin\u2019 nobody lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a valid excuse and it makes me worry. Seems nobody\u2019s calling me. I haven\u2019t heard from Cam either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut him a break, Ma. He is in Iraq,\u201d Colby said dryly.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll cut him one, but not you. Got new injuries I should know about, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She switched tactics and chatted about his baby sister Keely\u2019s latest wild exploits. How his older brother Cord and his nephew Ky were faring in the wake of Cord\u2019s recent divorce. Seems his brother Colton had purchased another couple thousand acres of grazing land directly west of their ranch. Then she admitted she hadn\u2019t heard from his youngest brother Carter recently and she was feeling left out of her sons\u2019 lives.</p><p>\u201cMa. You\u2019re gonna see me in Cheyenne in a few days to see that I\u2019m just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. So, what happened in Limon?\u201d</p><p>Colby told her the nitty-gritty details about the events he\u2019d lost and placed in, how those wins and losses affected his overall standings. He touched on Trevor and Edgar\u2019s professional troubles\u2014but he didn\u2019t mention Channing at all.</p><p>After he\u2019d hung up he wondered why. Because this thing with Channing was new? Because it wasn\u2019t permanent? Or because he was a chickenshit because it was special and he didn\u2019t want to jinx it?</p><p>His mother knew him better than anyone. She was pretty much in the dark about his on-the-road, wild exploits and former sexual hi-jinks, but she\u2019d always seemed to read between the lines. She had a better understanding that \u201cboys will be boys\u201d than his more traditional father did. The fact that he\u2019d hooked up with a woman would be big news to his family. And at this point he didn\u2019t want his mama zeroing in on what was happening between him and Channing.</p><p>Don\u2019t you mean, between you and Channing, and Trevor and Channing, and Edgard and Channing?</p><p>He told that smarmy little voice to shut up.</p><p>Sure, he was sharing her with them, but when it came right down to it Channing preferred him. He knew it. She\u2019d admitted it and neither Trevor nor Edgard would be surprised by it. But the bottom line didn\u2019t change. They\u2019 d part ways at Cheyenne.</p><p>Colby didn\u2019t have time to dwell on future events. He had a competition to prepare for. Tonight, the reward would be sweet indeed.</p><p>He packed his gear bag, grabbed his saddle and hitched a ride with Cash to the rodeo grounds.</p><p>Trevor paced in front of the motel room, seething. How dare that know-it-all asshole continue to insist the problems dogging them in the arena were somehow his fault? So maybe he was a little tense, but who wouldn\u2019t be after a losing streak that now reached into double digits? The fact Edgard continually pointed it out and suggested maybe it was time for them to consider other options, flat out pissed him off.</p><p>Trevor didn\u2019t have any other options. Like Colby, this was his last shot at making the National Finals Rodeo. Trevor\u2019s father, the infamous Tater Glanzer, was sorely disappointed in his son\u2019s lack of a NFR title, despite the fact Trevor had won five circuit titles. And good old dad had been insistent that this be Trevor\u2019s last year\u2014mostly because Trevor\u2019s younger brother, Tanner, had a much better shot at bringing home that all-important national tie-down roping title.</p><p>Then Trevor would be stuck working with the old man all the time.</p><p>The thought of continually hearing his father berate him, the expectation that Trevor would permanently give up the rodeo lifestyle and his freedom made Trevor sick to his stomach. His family had never paid much attention to him besides to instill the obsession with rodeo within another member of the Glanzer clan. They sure didn\u2019t understand him.</p><p>There were things about him that would cause a rift between them that could never be repaired if they found out.</p><p>So even if he and Edgard were losing ground in the individual standings, he\u2019d rather stay on the circuit, rather than head home and deal with the questions and comments from his family on his future plans.</p><p>Edgard didn\u2019t understand his dilemma. Neither did Colby. They both had utter acceptance from their families. Once again, he felt completely alone. Scared that somehow the choices he\u2019d made would come back to bite him on the ass.</p><p>The door to the room opened and Edgard glared at him from inside the doorway. \u201cYou ready to walk over to the arena?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t need you to hold my goddamn hand. Trevor smiled tightly.</p><p>\u201cYou go ahead. I\u2019ve got to get something out of the horse trailer first.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for Edgard to protest, he stalked off across the motel parking lot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Trevor barged in the horse trailer it never occurred to him to knock.</p><p>Channing sat buck-ass naked at the little dinette table.</p><p>She gasped. It was cute how she tried to tug the sheet from the bed around her nakedness. \u201cTrevor! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my horse trailer. Maybe I oughta ask you what you\u2019re doin\u2019</p><p>eatin\u2019 breakfast naked as a jaybird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I just woke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. So Colby already took off to check in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>He waggled his eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019ve got you all to myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would appear so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot damn. I knew there was a reason I came here.\u201d His gaze made a slow sweep from her pink toenails to her tangled mane, sticking out of her head at all angles. Finally his eyes zeroed in on the short dark curls peeking between her thighs. \u201cAnd now I know exactly what I want for breakfast.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. Since Colby ain\u2019t here, I\u2019m callin\u2019 the shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But I do want to be honest and let you know I\u2019m a little sore from yesterday. I\u2014I\u2019m not used to that. Any of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I best kiss it and make it all better, huh?\u201d</p><p>Channing swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cDo I make you nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if I see a rope in your hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this morning.\u201d Trevor pointed to the bed. \u201cGet up there and let your legs dangle off the edge. And spread em\u2019 nice and wide. I like to play with my breakfast before I eat it.\u201d</p><p>Channing blushed about ten shades of pink. But she didn\u2019t argue with him at all. Her heart-shaped butt wiggled enticingly as she crawled into the sleeper compartment.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d she said.</p><p>Trevor noticed she had a foothold on either side of the wall. Her legs were braced far apart, as if she\u2019d put herself on display for a man hundreds of times. But he knew better. It made her immediate surrender to him so much sweeter. \u201cThat\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p> <p>He knelt on the dinette bench against the wall. His mouth was at exactly the right angle to dive deep into her pussy. He flattened his tongue and licked her from her little rosette to her clit. Up and down without stopping. Then he blew a stream of air across the wetness.</p><p>\u201cOmigod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou come pretty fast like this, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll just have to make you come twice\u2014once fast, once slow.\u201d</p><p>Trevor bent his head and began to work her just with his tongue, lips and teeth. Sucking. Biting. Bestowing little teasing flicks over her clit, then he\u2019d jam his tongue into her opening, licking her from the inside out.</p><p>Damn. Something about a woman\u2019s morning musk tasted different.</p><p>Spicier. Warmer. Going down on her was a dirtier act in the daylight, rather than a lover\u2019s secret, hidden under the covers and the cover of night.</p><p>\u201cYou taste like sweet cream and honey. I could come just from eating you.\u201d His hands gripped her legs on the top near her hips. He let his thumbs lazily stroke the crease of her thighs, heightening the tactile pleasure, but never actually connecting with any part of her weeping sex.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can definitely come like this.\u201d Channing pumped her hips into his face. \u201cI\u2019m already close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. You don\u2019t say.\u201d Trevor rolled her pussy lips around inside his mouth, sucking delicately. He focused his efforts on the button pouting for direct stimulation. First he suckled strongly and followed with quick bites from his firmed lips.</p><p>The combination set her off. Her clit throbbed beneath his tongue and he continued to use his mouth like he was devouring an ice cream cone\u2014slurping, followed by precise short licks.</p><p>She came with a gasp, her back arched off the mattress, her ass clenched and she kept repeating, \u201cOh God, oh God, oh God, oh God.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and the intimate vibration against her sensitive flesh made her cry out again.</p><p>Trevor wiped her juices from his face. His cock was twitching to get out and get some action, but he wouldn\u2019t presume Channing would be up for it, as she\u2019d already claimed some soreness from their previous go arounds.</p><p>After Channing\u2019s legs stopped quaking, she propped herself up on her elbows and smiled at him shyly. \u201cGet your fill?\u201d</p><p>He licked his lips. \u201cBreakfast of Champions, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze dropped to the obvious bulge in his jeans. She bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cTrev, can I tell you a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sort of embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Chan, we\u2019re friends, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me.\u201d</p><p>Channing blurted, \u201cI\u2019ve never done sixty-nine.\u201d</p><p>Not what he\u2019d expected at all. \u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want to try it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She fidgeted. \u201cSo, I was wondering if you\u2019ve got time...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re up for it? I thought you were a little sore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so much anymore. Besides, it\u2019d be a pity to waste a good hard-on.\u201d</p><p>Trevor figured she wanted some sixty-nine practice before she tried it with Colby. He thought it was incredibly sweet and he doffed his clothes immediately.</p><p>Channing laughed. \u201cYou would have won the gold buckle if there was a contest for fastest clothing removal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mama didn\u2019t raise no idiots, darlin\u2019, you don\u2019t have to ask me twice.\u201d He crawled up in the sleeping area. \u201cThis is gonna be fun.\u201d Trevor kissed her slowly in a drawn out seduction of mouth on mouth. He spent extra time suckling and touching her breasts, giving her time to recover from her first orgasm from him. When she started rubbing her legs together, and a soft mewl rumbled from her throat, he knew she was ready for the short go.</p><p>He smoothed her wild hair from her strangely timid face. \u201cIt\u2019s no different than givin\u2019 me a blowjob, Chan. Curl on your side, and slide my dick in deep, but don\u2019t arch your neck. And for God\u2019s sake, when you start to come, don\u2019t bite down.\u201d</p><p>She giggled and it eased some of her tension.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and rolled to her left side, Trevor settled on his right.</p><p>Huskily, he said, \u201cLift your top leg. That\u2019s it.\u201d He swooped down and took her swollen sex in his mouth again.</p><p>Channing shifted and licked the head of his cock as delicately as a cat. Gradually, she brought him deeper, her mouth made little happy humming noises and she used her hand to stroke his shaft while her fingers fondled his balls.</p><p>For being a novice, her mouth and her touch were sheer heaven.</p><p>Trevor knew he wouldn\u2019t last. He focused all his attention on Channing\u2019s clit, knowing she probably wouldn\u2019t last long either.</p><p>She didn\u2019t. She came with a gasp and the intake of air around his dick made his balls tighten up.</p><p>He was so close. He rose to his knees so she could deep throat him, as he continued to tongue her softly, bringing her down from her juicy climax.</p><p>All of a sudden heat shot down his spine, a hot poker between his legs and he waited for that pulsing rush to start.</p><p>The door clicked open. Trevor looked up from between Channing\u2019s thighs into Edgard\u2019s face. In that split second, his orgasm hit, semen rocketed out the end of his cock and Channing sucked him dry while Edgard watched.</p><p>Trevor closed his eyes, threw back his head and enjoyed the hell out of it\u2014the thundering climax and the exhibitionism.</p><p>After the blood quit rushing in his ears and his cock went half-limp, his gaze caught Edgard\u2019s again.</p><p>\u201cI wondered if you were in here fucking off,\u201d Edgard said softly, \u201cbut I hadn\u2019t thought you were literally fucking off. Time to go, amigo. We\u2019re late.\u201d He turned and left without looking back.</p><p>Trevor fell on his side. He muttered, \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Channing scooted around. \u201cTrev? Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to get in the middle of this. He forced a smile. \u201cJust great, darlin\u2019. Just catchin\u2019 my breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, as Edgard pointed out, I am runnin\u2019 late. No regrets over our sexy interlude, but can you get to the rodeo grounds all right?</p><p>Or do you want me to wait for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You go on. I still need to shower.\u201d</p><p>Trevor kissed her thoroughly, surprised by how much he enjoyed his taste and her taste mingling on his tongue. \u201cA sixty-nine virgin no more.</p><p>You rocked my world and the horse trailer this morning, hot girl.\u201d</p><p>She blushed. \u201cSame goes.\u201d</p><p>As he dressed he knew next time he\u2019d remember to lock the damn door.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Channing to get ready and she eagerly left the cramped motel room for fresh air and blue skies. In this higher elevation, the sun had burned away the cool morning air quickly. It was warm, but the lack of humidity made it bearable.</p><p>Her ticket was at the box office, as promised. She scanned the arena and spied the bleachers beside the chutes. Before she wandered over to her seat, she watched the action unfold in the arena.</p><p>The team penning competition was nearly over. This event fascinated her because it seemed the teams with the best times were the most experienced, unlike most of the rodeo events where youth had an edge.</p><p>The two men and one woman sorting the cattle were in their late fifties.</p><p>They\u2019d separated the three calves wearing the number four into the pens faster than the next closest team by a good fifteen seconds.</p><p>So did that mean that Colby could compete in rodeo for another twenty years? Wouldn\u2019t he get tired of it? Or was this a lifelong obsession like other sports?</p><p>Channing bought a couple bottles of water. Rummaging in her bag for her notebook, her cell phone rang. She answered it absentmindedly without checking the caller ID. \u201cHello?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cChanning?

And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust great.\u201d Come on. Get to it. The only good thing about her mother\u2019s phone calls was that she didn\u2019t drag them out with inane chitchat.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Well, the reason I called is because I\u2019ve received some interesting news.\u201d Pause. \u201cYour friend Melinda Baxter? She and her delightful fianc\u00e9 Robert ran off to Aruba and were married last weekend.</p><p>Isn\u2019t that marvelous?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSplendid,\u201d she said sweetly.</p><p>\u201cI tell you, Melinda\u2019s mother was shocked as they\u2019d already booked the cathedral months ago. Anyway, since Melinda and Robert skipped the formal wedding ceremony, they\u2019ve rented the Gregory Art Museum and are hosting an enormous reception next weekend. Naturally, I assured Melinda you\u2019d be in attendance.\u201d</p><p>Channing seethed. She was twenty-five years old. Her mother had no right to speak for her. But it was nothing new in her life, which was the biggest reason why she\u2019d run away from that life. She wondered if she\u2019d ever be able to return to it.</p><p>\u201cYou will be finished with this little...rebellion of yours by then, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>When she said rebellion it sounded quaint, less ominous than run away with the rodeo. \u201cMaybe. We\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Dead silence.</p> <p>\u201cI certainly hope even if you don\u2019t return to help your friend celebrate the beginning of her new life, that you will be back here in time to prepare for your move to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Another disapproving pause. \u201cChanning, your father went to a lot of trouble to secure the teaching position for you at Palmer. You do realize how it would look if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mother, I\u2019m aware of how it would look. And God knows I would never do anything to besmirch the almighty Kinkaid name.\u201d</p><p>Her mother sniffed. \u201cNot only do I not like your tone, you are not acting at all like the responsible child I raised. I don\u2019t understand what has happened to you.\u201d</p><p>I grew up, wised up, and realized how screwed up everything is in your little world and how I don\u2019t want any part of it.</p><p>A cloud of dust heavily laced with the scent of horseshit wafted past.</p><p>It amazed her how rapidly the pungent aroma had become familiar and calmed her. Not that she could share that tidbit with her mother.</p> <p>Jacqueline Moore Kinkaid would be appalled.</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to fight with you, Mother. When you talk to Melinda give her my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll talk to you soon. Bye.\u201d</p><p>Channing clicked the phone shut. Nothing had changed. She didn\u2019t fit in with her parent\u2019s social circle. Would she ever find a place where she belonged? Her gaze swept the ranch families and rodeo enthusiasts clogging the aisles and racing for the grandstand. As much as she hoped for it, she didn\u2019t really fit here, either.</p><p>Her cell phone rang again. This time she checked the caller ID. She smiled. Colby. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, shug, I just wanted to make sure you got the ticket and you know where you\u2019re supposed to be sittin\u2019 today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here on the backside of the arena. I just got off the phone with my mother so I\u2019m contemplating grabbing a beer or ten before I sit down.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and the sound warmed that cold spot within her. \u201cMust be the day. My mom called earlier, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet your conversation went better than mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. Although I doubt you got grilled on your injuries. How your horse was handlin\u2019 the travelin\u2019. If you were eatin\u2019 right. If you were drinkin\u2019 too much. And if you were wearin\u2019 clean underwear.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cAre you really okay, darlin\u2019? She didn\u2019t say nothin\u2019 to upset you?\u201d</p><p>How had he picked up on that so fast? \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m ready to rodeo.</p><p>Good luck, cowboy. I\u2019ll be cheering you on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how glad I am to hear that. I probably won\u2019t get much of a break, so I\u2019ll see you after that ninety-point ride.\u201d</p><p>Channing was smiling as she hung up.</p><p>Colby squeaked by in the tie-down roping competition with a top-five finish. As did Trevor. Edgard got shut out.</p><p>While other events were held and Colby and Trevor and Edgard weren\u2019t competing, Channing jotted observations in her notebook. It was a good excuse not to have to talk to people. Again, she had a sudden burst of shyness.</p><p>The other wives and girlfriends looked at her a little strangely, but so far none had ventured over and introduced themselves. And she worried it\u2019d smack of desperation if she made the first move. It wasn\u2019t like she hadn\u2019t suffered enough rejection in her life.</p><p>Colby managed to cover his bronc for a seventy-seven-point ride. The rest of the contestants didn\u2019t fare so well, which left Colby at the top of the standings and a guaranteed spot in the second round.</p><p>Likewise Trevor and Edgard had a good run and landed in the top five, also guaranteeing them a return trip the following day. Cash and Brian wound up in first place in the team roping.</p><p>The food in the concession stand was pure grease and Channing wished she\u2019d packed a healthy lunch. Her stomach rumbled loudly.</p><p>A pigtailed girl of about four looked up from beneath the brim of her pink cowgirl hat. \u201cYour tummy sounded like a bear growling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe that\u2019s because I\u2019m as hungry as a bear.\u201d</p><p>The girl considered her, sidled closer and then dug in her package of animal crackers, slyly passing over a circus bear. \u201cYa\u2019are what you eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Channing crunched the cookie. She debated on asking the girl her name but she figured the girl would clam up, lectures of not talking to strangers dancing in her cute little head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why my daddy don\u2019t never eat chicken. \u2018Cause he ain\u2019t no chicken.\u201d</p><p>Interesting. She\u2019d have to ask Colby and Trevor and Edgard if that superstition held true with all rodeo contestants all the time.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d the girl asked out of the blue.</p><p>\u201cChanning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChina? Like a doll?\u201d</p><p>She repeated her name and the girl stared at her with enormous blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou shore do talk funny, lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? So do you, cowgirl. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalliope Jane. \u2018Cept nobody calls me that unless I\u2019m in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do they call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie. My daddy sometimes calls me Calamity Jane.\u201d She pointed at the chutes. \u201cMy daddy is bulldoggin\u2019 today.\u201d Then those blue eyes lasered into her. \u201cWhat\u2019s your daddy doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Most likely his secretary, but not information she could share with anyone, let alone a sweet little girl.</p><p>\u201cCallie!\u201d</p><p>Both Channing and Callie whirled around to look at the harried brunette hustling toward them, her purple ropers clomping across the metal bench seats.</p><p>\u201cCallie, hon, you need to leave this poor lady alone, can\u2019t you see she\u2019s busy?\u201d Callie\u2019s mother gestured to the open notebook and pen perched on Channing\u2019s lap. \u201cSorry. She\u2019s just a chatterbox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s nice to have someone to talk to for a change. I don\u2019t know many people here.\u201d There. That wasn\u2019t so hard.</p><p>The brunette studied her with the same intensity as her daughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Have we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Channing stuck out her hand and the woman shook it heartily.</p><p>\u201cChanning Kinkaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary Morgan. Haven\u2019t seen you in the family bleachers before.</p><p>Who\u2019re you here with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe ain\u2019t gonna tell you her daddy\u2019s name, Momma, \u2018cause she didn\u2019t tell me,\u201d Callie said with a pout.</p><p>\u201cProbably because she ain\u2019t here with her daddy, Cal.\u201d</p><p>Her rosebud lips made an \u201cO\u201d of understanding.</p><p>Channing hid a smile. \u201cI\u2019m here with Colby McKay.\u201d</p><p>Mary\u2019s eyebrows winged up clear into her straw hat. \u201cSo you\u2019re the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one all them women are gossiping about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Her heart knocked against her chest. \u201cBad or good gossip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on who you\u2019re talking to.\u201d Mary snorted. \u201cNo skin off my nose, what\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander, know what I mean? Besides, near as I can tell you\u2019re free, white and eighteen. Do what you want to and ignore all them self-righteous old biddies and cowpokes.\u201d</p><p>Channing opened her mouth but Mary wasn\u2019t close to finished.</p><p>\u201cLike none of this stuff happened when they were rodeoin\u2019 years ago?</p><p>Wrong. We\u2019ve all heard the stories. And it ain\u2019t like they wouldn\u2019t jump at the chance to act young and carefree and hook themselves a hot studly cowboy if they could. I say, flip \u2018em the bird\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat bird, Momma?\u201d</p><p>Mary smiled indulgently and tugged Callie\u2019s pigtails. \u201cDon\u2019t you never mind, girlie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Callie told me her daddy is a steer wrestler.\u201d Steer wrestling or bulldogging, was another timed event where the cowboy chased down a steer. But instead of using ropes to catch the animal, the bulldogger launched himself off his horse, right at the steer as his hazer made sure the steer ran in a straight line. Once the bulldogger had a hold of the animal, he picked him up, cranked his head around and flipped him on his side. Steer wrestlers usually only competed in one event, because the money was so good\u2014but so was the injury potential.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Mike Morgan. Currently ranked second. We\u2019re hopin\u2019 for a big win here and in Valentine. Then we\u2019ll go back home for about twenty minutes before we hit the Days of 76 in Deadwood. After that we\u2019ll head to Cheyenne. Last year Mike did well in both places and we drove between Deadwood and Cheyenne five times in one week. Seems once I do get back to the ranch I\u2019ll never catch up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou must travel a lot, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. It\u2019s fun at first. Rodeo folks are the best in the world. It\u2019s like a big ol\u2019 family reunion. Then about halfway through the summer season we just wanna get back home, have a normal life, if that\u2019s possible with a kid and a ranch to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBuffalo Gap, South Dakota. What about you?\u201d</p><p>Channing tensed up. \u201cOutside of Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mary frowned. \u201cWhoa. How did you hook up with Colby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPure luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d She clapped her hands over Callie\u2019s ears and said in a low voice, \u201cHe\u2019s a wily one, but man, I\u2019d take him for a test ride any time.\u201d</p> <p>Channing didn\u2019t know whether to be jealous or flattered.</p><p>\u201cNot that he\u2019d pick me without me twisting his arm. Despite gossip to the contrary, the real word is he\u2019s very choosy. He don\u2019t usually bring a woman along in his travels. Ever.\u201d She winked. \u201cYou plan on sticking around the circuit for awhile then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil Cheyenne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good. I guess we\u2019ll be seeing you at the dances and whatever.</p><p>You going to the Wild Bronc tonight? We could toss back a couple of shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Depends on how Colby does today.\u201d</p> <p>Mary rolled her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t I know how men\u2019s attitudes depend on how they done in the arena. Pray you don\u2019t have to know how Colby reacts when he gets hurt. But at some point they always get hurt.</p><p>Always. \u201d She shivered. \u201cCome on Callie, let\u2019s get you washed up before it\u2019s Daddy\u2019s turn in the box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye-bye, China bear.\u201d She giggled and raced off.</p><p>Channing smiled. Well, at least she wasn\u2019t a total pariah.</p><p>She sat impatiently through the steer wrestling\u2014Mike Morgan had the fastest time\u2014and barrel racing. She was as curious to see how Colby would do in the bull riding as she was nervous.</p><p>What had possessed her to strike such a deal with him? Had she been delirious, still giddy from the amazing sex the previous night?</p><p>No, you made the deal because you want this. Even though it makes you edgy, it keys you up. And you do feel safe with him.</p><p>She snuck out and drank a beer before the last event began, convincing herself it was not liquid courage.</p> <p>The family section wasn\u2019t covered with a canopy. The sun beat down on the metal and concrete making it as constricting as a sardine can. Not a breath of wind stirred. Sweat coated her skin and plastered her hair to her head beneath her hat. Most other supporters of the contestants had already left for cooler pastures.</p><p>Through a quirk of fate, Colby was the last bull rider. He\u2019d drawn One-eyed Jack, another rank bull that\u2019d been unridden in two dozen outs, according to Cash. But the last time he had been ridden, the rider had scored a record ninety-two.</p><p>At Colby\u2019s request Cash had ventured into the stands to share the information about what Channing might expect\u2014although in Channing\u2019s mind it was Colby\u2019s way of gloating.</p><p>However, One-eyed Jack was also a notorious chute fighter\u2014which posed a danger for the rider.</p><p>Channing cringed as the twenty-five contestants struggled to cover their bulls. The buck-off rate was damn near one hundred percent.</p><p>Finally, Colby\u2019s name and stats were announced along with the bull\u2019s owner and rating. She moved down from the bleachers and hung over the railing, trying to get a better view on what was going on inside the chutes.</p><p>As usual Trevor was helping Colby get ready, standing behind him, holding the rope straight, parallel to Colby\u2019s body while Colby rosined up the rope in long pulls. It didn\u2019t look like the bull was putting up much of a fight. Because of the heat? Channing\u2019s hope that the two-thousand pound animal was lethargic had nothing to do with the bet and everything with keeping Colby safe.</p><p>Colby\u2019s free arm was wrapped around the metal gate. He scooted side to side, bobbed his hat at the gate master, and man and beast rolled out.</p><p>Evidently One-eyed Jack had saved his antics for the arena, not the chutes. All four black legs were out of the dirt from the get-go, then a quick switchback and the animal was nearly vertical. Colby hung on.</p><p>Another hard spin to the right, right into Colby\u2019s riding hand, but he stuck tight, even as his hips tilted sideways. Three more vertical high jumps, another lopsided spin, followed by a fast reversal, four quick spins, one last perpendicular kick and the buzzer sounded.</p><p>He\u2019d made it all eight seconds.</p><p>Colby did a quick release with his rope, liberating his hand, and hit the dirt ass first. The bull made a play for him, but the bull fighter distracted ol\u2019 One-Eyed Jack, allowing Colby to run to safety. Even before he squinted at the screen to watch his performance, by Colby\u2019s expression, he knew he\u2019d ridden well.</p><p>When a score of ninety-one was announced, confetti flew in the grandstand, the crowd roared approval and he tossed his hat high in the air with a loud whoop and grabbed his bullrope.</p><p>Then he made a beeline for her.</p><p>Channing\u2019s breath stalled in her lungs as Colby clambered up the fence, the metallic fringe on his chaps fluttering behind him. He hadn\u2019t even taken off his riding glove. With one hand secured on the railing, he used his free hand to jerk her close and he planted a wet kiss on her.</p><p>Right in front of everyone. He did it again, with a little more flair, amidst the wolf whistles and another round of clapping.</p><p>He grinned and pressed his lips to her ear. \u201cTime to pay up, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Rather than dragging Channing through the muck behind the chutes, Colby sent his saddle with Cash, grabbed his equipment bag and met her out front by the contestants\u2019 gate.</p><p>She smiled. Nervously?</p><p>He knew his answering grin was just a shade shy of wickedly smug.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. Yeah. How about if we have a beer first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirsty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be nice to suck down something cold and wet. You look hot. I thought you might want one to celebrate. I\u2019ll even buy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMighty thoughtful of you, Chan.\u201d When he placed his hand in the small of her back she jumped. He whispered, \u201cRelax. I ain\u2019t gonna bend you over the picnic table right now.\u201d</p><p>Channing rubbed her lips along his jaw. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you were. I just really want a beer. Don\u2019t you usually kick back after a performance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>She sauntered up to the beer stand. The minute he was alone he was swarmed. Buckle bunnies. Kids. Rodeo enthusiasts eager to offer congrats on his ride. He dropped his equipment bag and signed programs and anything else that was shoved in his face, including a pair of tits popping out of a neon pink tube top.</p><p>It looked like Channing planned to wait for the crowd to disperse before interrupting him. Hell, the beer would be warm by the time that happened.</p><p>Colby motioned her over. The second she stood beside him, he draped his arm around her neck. A couple of disgruntled bunnies got the hint and went looking for action elsewhere. After taking a long pull off the cold brew, he sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about. Thanks for wettin\u2019 my whistle, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, sugar.\u201d</p><p>He nearly choked at the sarcasm in her tone.</p><p>One brassy-haired buckle bunny bulled her way forward and demanded, \u201cAre you two together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d he said dismissively. He chatted for a few more minutes as he finished his beer. \u201cWell, I appreciate ya\u2019ll comin\u2019 out today. I\u2019ve gotta get a move on. Hopefully, I\u2019ll see ya\u2019ll tomorrow.\u201d He hefted his bag over his shoulder and kept Channing close as they exited the grounds.</p><p>\u201cSee? As much as I appreciate the fans, I\u2019d be stuck there all damn day, which is why I usually kick back elsewhere after I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re interested in going to the Wild Bronc tonight to kick back and relax with your buddies?\u201d</p><p>Colby frowned. He didn\u2019t like it that she acted afraid to be alone with him. \u201cMaybe. Why? Do you want to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly. I met a woman in the stands today and she asked if I\u2019d be there later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d you meet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary Morgan. And her daughter Callie. Do you know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little. Her husband Mike is a nice guy. He made it in the top twelve last year at the NFR. Damn good bulldogger.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d reached the horse trailer. No sign of Trevor, Edgard or the horses. He unlocked the back and threw his bag in the small tack area, and motioned for Channing to precede him into the living area.</p><p>Channing immediately tensed up as she passed by him.</p><p>He seized her around the waist, spun her about and pressed her against the wall. Then he dropped his mouth over hers and kissed the living shit out of her. After he\u2019d had his fill of her sweet lips, he pulled back and stared into her face.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna start nothin\u2019 with you until I know we can finish it without gettin' interrupted. So lose the deer-in-the-headlights look. This ass is mighty fine, but I can wait a few hours yet before I make it mine.\u201d</p><p>Channing swatted him on the butt. \u201cYou sweet talker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight. I need to shower. After that you want to grab a bite to eat before we go honky-tonkin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. I saw a steakhouse up the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hearty helpin\u2019 of meat and potatoes. You\u2019re a woman after my own heart.\u201d</p><p>Something liquid and sweet, like pleasure sparked the gold in her eyes. \u201cShould we wait to see if Trevor and Edgard want to come along?\u201d</p><p>He almost said \u201cWhy?\u201d but caught himself. For the briefest minute, he hated his traveling partners and he hated that he\u2019d agreed\u2014hell, he\u2019d suggested they share this woman. But after four days, he wanted Channing all to himself.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t what Channing had signed on for. She wanted the wild adventure of multiple partners. Even though it\u2019d like to kill him, Colby would give her that. He suspected he\u2019d give her damn near anything she wanted. After that, maybe he could convince her he was all she needed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiled tightly. \u201cSure. As long as we don\u2019t have to wait around for them because I\u2019m starvin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty hungry, too.\u201d</p><p>His gaze landed on the parcel centered on the mattress in the sleeping compartment. \u201cClose your eyes, and hold out your hands\u2014I\u2019ve got a surprise for you.\u201d</p> <p>For a second it seemed as if she\u2019d argue, but she complied, although the pulse in her throat jumped. He was beginning to recognize all of her nervous quirks.</p><p>Colby reached up for the package and slid it out of the plastic bag.</p><p>Feeling a little silly, he hesitated. Maybe this hadn\u2019t been the best idea.</p><p>\u201cColby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Here.\u201d He pressed the box against her chest until her arms wrapped around it and he stepped back, ready to make a run for it if need be.</p> <p>She opened her eyes and looked down at the object she held. Her startled gaze zoomed to his. \u201cA coffee pot? You bought me a coffee pot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Yeah. There should be coffee and filters and junk in the bag on the bed, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cB-b-but why? You won. You scored a ninety-point ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I could\u2019ve just as easily lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this was just hedging your bet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might say that.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cWhen did you buy it? Maybe I should ask, when did you have time to buy it? Weren\u2019t you behind the chutes all day getting ready to dethrone Jace Bailey as the number one All-Around Cowboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And I didn\u2019t actually buy it. I gave Cash some cash and sent him to Wal-Mart after my ride with instructions for him to buy the nicest one they had for you.\u201d He frowned. \u201cIs it okay? You don\u2019t hate it or nothin\u2019, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOmigod, it\u2019s perfect!\u201d Channing hugged it once more and then set it on the table before she threw herself into his arms, peppering his face with kisses. \u201cColby McKay, you are the sweetest man on the planet. I-I\u2014I can\u2019t believe it. You bought me a coffee pot! You didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, darlin\u2019. But I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\u201d Her eyes swam with tears.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me in my whole life.\u201d She kissed him with so much heart and sweetness, Colby felt himself getting choked up. If he weren\u2019t careful, he\u2019d find himself falling head over heels for this precious woman.</p><p>Trying to keep it casual, he nipped the end of her pert nose and retreated. \u201cPlay with your new coffee maker, darlin\u2019. I\u2019ll be right back to take you out for supper.\u201d</p><p>They ended up eating dinner by themselves, a nice candlelight romantic dinner for two. Then they headed to the Wild Bronc. Colby didn\u2019t protest when Channing danced with Cash and Trevor\u2014as long as she danced every slow tune with him.</p> <p>Edgard had opted to catch up on his sleep in the horse trailer rather than partake in the celebration, which wasn\u2019t anything new.</p><p>Colby was having a good time drinking beer and shooting the shit with his friends. Although he was happy Channing had made new pals among the wives of the rodeo crowd regulars, he was restless.</p><p>As the night wore on he found himself getting more and more anxious. It seemed as if it\u2019d been days since he and Channing had been alone, naked and sweaty, wrapped up together in an intimate lovers\u2019</p><p>embrace, when in reality it\u2019d been half a day since he\u2019d woken up beside her.</p><p>Damn. He glanced at the horseshoe-shaped clock above the bar for the fourth time in so many minutes. Channing and Mary laughed hysterically at something and knocked back another round of kamikazes.</p><p>Cash chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s havin\u2019 a good time. But you got someplace you\u2019d rather be, kola?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could be a total asshole and point out that where I\u2019d rather be tonight is an option that an old timer like you don\u2019t have with a hot young thang like her. But I\u2019m feelin\u2019 sociable, so I\u2019ll let it slide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenerous of you, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Colby tipped his bottle at Cash in a mock toast. \u201cI thought so.\u201d</p><p>A few more minutes passed and Cash sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t like you. Usually you see something you want and you take it\u2014be it bulls, broncs, calves or women. Whatcha waitin\u2019 for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sign that my travelin\u2019 partner is gonna be occupied elsewhere so he won\u2019t see us sneakin\u2019 away and follow us, hopin\u2019 we\u2019ll entertain him until the wee hours.\u201d Colby had promised Channing he wouldn\u2019t share her with Trevor tonight, but the logistics of getting alone time with her were making him crazy.</p><p>\u201cShoot, that\u2019s easy enough. Leave him here. He\u2019s half-drunk anyway.</p><p>He can bunk with me tonight. I got an extra bed in my room. If he acts like a jerk to me, he can sleep it off with the horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. And like you pointed out, it ain\u2019t like I\u2019ll be doin\u2019 no mattress dancin\u2019 myself tonight.\u201d He gestured with his head. \u201cGo on, take her and get out of here before I change my mind.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and gave Cash a friendly whack on the back. \u201cI owe you one, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I won\u2019t collect one of these days.\u201d</p><p>Colby drained his beer and stared at Channing until she glanced up at him. Their gazes locked. Heated.</p><p>He mouthed the word \u201cnow\u201d and her face flushed prettily.</p><p>She sucked down the rest of her drink as he ambled toward her, a man on a mission, not bothering to hide his intentions from her or anyone else in the bar.</p><p>By the time he\u2019d reached the table, his dick was hard as concrete.</p><p>Channing scrambled to her feet and stammered as she said good night. Colby didn\u2019t hear the lewd suggestions from his friends. He didn\u2019t see the knowing looks, the winks and nudges. Everything swam out of focus but her. Channing.</p><p>He sensed her nervousness, yet surprisingly, she didn\u2019t jabber mindlessly as they walked back to the motel side by side. Not touching.</p><p>Her womanly fragrance enveloped him like a drug so invigorating he didn\u2019t trust himself to even hold her hand.</p><p>Colby unlocked the motel room door and shut it behind them, sliding the deadbolt and the chain into place. When he wheeled around to look at her and saw that her yearning matched his, he had to take a moment to regain his control, lest he tackle her to the bed and rut on her like a stag in season.</p><p>He flipped on the lamp on the table by the windows. The low wattage and the burgundy lampshade sent a soft pink glow across the room. It wasn\u2019t candlelight, but it was better than the screaming white fluorescent tubes shining down like a spotlight from the ceiling.</p><p>Finally, he found his voice, though it didn\u2019t sound like his voice at all, but a low and husky rumble. \u201cDarlin\u2019, take off them clothes before I tear</p><p>\u2018em off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was your second warnin\u2019. There won\u2019t be a third.\u201d</p><p>Keeping her hot gaze focused on his eyes, she shimmied her orange tank top over her head and flung it in his face.</p><p>He brought the soft cotton to his nose and inhaled until her perfume filled his lungs to bursting. Then he tossed it over his shoulder. \u201cKeep goin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>The sassy, little \u201cfuck me\u201d heels with yellow flowers on the pointed toes were kicked off, and kicked over, right on top of his shitkickers planted in the shag carpeting.</p><p>And still Colby didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Then the skintight, rainbow-striped capris were peeled down her slim thighs and pooled at her feet. One loud click of the front clasp and her sheer bra was gone. And as the sexy, defiant\u2014yet strangely shy\u2014woman stood before him in just a tiny wisp of lace panties, he lost it.</p><p>Colby scooped her up and tumbled her on the closest bed.</p><p>Her startled girlish shriek vanished in his hungry mouth as he clamped his lips to hers.</p><p>Channing was as ravenous as he was. She tugged and pulled at his clothing\u2014vest, Western shirt, Wranglers, boxers, sock and boots\u2014until the pieces ringed the floor around the bed and he was bare-ass naked.</p><p>As he kissed her, he realized tonight she tasted different, darker, a heady sexual cocktail of tequila and a smoky hint of fear.</p><p>With one shaking hand he stripped the polyester comforter from the bed and spread her out across the plain white cotton sheets. She writhed and twisted beneath him as he glided his legs over hers, knowing the contrast of the coarse hair on his thighs rubbing against the satiny smooth flesh of hers made her crazy with want. Made her mad with lust.</p><p>Colby pinned her arms above her head. Instead of letting fast tongues and deep wet kisses escalate their mutual passion to a frenzied rush, he slowed down and nuzzled every naked, delicious, utterly bare section of skin she\u2019d presented to him. And some areas she hadn\u2019t offered up he decided he\u2019d take on his own.</p><p>His lips brushed the crown of her head. The desire-warmed angle of her cheekbone. Her elfin chin and her damp neck. The tasty sweep of her slender shoulders. The sinew and softness of her arms. The tempting pillow of her breasts. Her dainty ribcage that he could nearly span with his wide hands. The cute belly button, peeking out from her flat abdomen, above her line of dark pubic hair.</p><p>When he purposely ignored her pussy, already wet and fragrant and eager, she made a frustrated noise in the back of her throat.</p><p>Without missing a beat, he dragged his parted lips along the tender inside of each thigh and zigzagged a moist trail over the tops of her legs, down to her small, perfect feet. He relentlessly tongued her anklebone and she nearly shot off the bed.</p><p>\u201cColby!\u201d</p><p>He growled and flipped her on her belly, keeping his palm in the small of her back as a signal for her not to move. Then he repeated his mouth-watering exploration of her oh-so-feminine dips and valleys, heedless of the quaking in her limbs and the way she tilted her ass toward him like a mare waiting to be mounted.</p><p>Since Channing couldn\u2019t see his face, he didn\u2019t hide his grin as he tasted the dimples above her butt before he licked a slow path up her spine. He nibbled on her shoulder blades, then he let his breath drift across the nape of her neck. Not kissing her, not teasing those downy soft hairs hiding beneath her tousled mane, not even touching her. He stayed still, just letting her sense his primitive need to take her, to make her his, by showing her the changes her nearness had wrought upon his breathing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In that heightened moment, he swore he felt her heart beat faster in the air pulsing between them. His blood pounded in perfect cadence to that sensuous tempo.</p><p>No words were needed.</p><p>Colby tapped the inside of her thighs and she stretched them wider.</p><p>While bestowing open-mouthed, nuzzling kisses on the back of her head and inhaling the flowery aroma of her shampoo, he speared the entrance to her pussy with two fingers. He rocked those fingers in and out of her wetness, rotating his hand to brush the callused pad of his thumb over her bottom hole. Lightly. A barely-there sweep across that extremely sensitive knot of nerves.</p><p>Channing wiggled and panted, bumping her hips, trying to wrest control from him, frantic for deeper contact.</p><p>A quick slap on her heart-shaped ass and she gasped.</p><p>He reached for the lube on the nightstand and tugged her closer to him so she was perched up high on her knees; her arms were in a \u201cV\u201d above her head. Her hands were fisted into the sheets. Tilting the lower half of her body to his liking, he removed his fingers from her pussy and parted her ass cheeks. Goddamn, she was gorgeous here, too. He ran his wet tongue in an extended line from her clit over her slippery slit, to circle that secret portal with the very tip of his tongue.</p><p>She whimpered a strangled sound of need.</p><p>Several times he followed that same pathway and with each thorough, more intimate pass, Channing\u2019s body softened, preparing for the invasion into that place no man\u2019s cock had ever breached.</p><p>Mine. Possession rolled through his blood. No matter what happened in the future, tonight she\u2019d be his in a way she\u2019d never be to any other man and she\u2019d damn well remember it forever.</p><p>He squirted lube on his palm, working his cock in long twisting pulls.</p><p>After he was sufficiently greased up, he coated his fingers and pressed them both deep inside her ass.</p><p>She moaned softy, thrusting her butt back.</p><p>He scissored his fingers in that dark recess, then pumped, stretching the untried muscles. His breathing was labored, as was hers, the desperate sounds the only noises in the concentrated silence as he prepared her. He saw no reason to give her a blow by blow on what he planned to do to her. No more sweet, coaxing kisses. Lingering touches.</p><p>She was fully aware of what was happening. With the spicy scent of her arousal, he was fully aware of how badly she wanted it.</p><p>Colby inserted the end of the lube tube in her ass and squeezed.</p><p>Channing shuddered. He knew the clear gel was cold, but he also knew it wouldn\u2019t stay cold for long once he started ramming his cock in and out, creating friction that would be a combination of pleasure and pain.</p><p>With one hand he pushed her shoulders down on the bed, until the side of her face rested against the mattress. Then holding her cheeks apart with his hands, he placed the thick crown of his shaft on that puckered rosette and pushed in.</p><p>Channing clenched.</p><p>He growled and probed harder, and little by little she relaxed the rigid ring of muscles.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t delay any longer and he popped the blood-engorged tip in that tight opening. Somehow he managed to stop and let her body adjust to the intrusion before he went further.</p><p>The pressure was intense enough to make her gasp.</p> <p>Colby gritted his teeth. She was so fucking tight. So fucking perfect.</p><p>Goddamn, he wanted to ream her. Just ram the remaining length of his dick into her impossibly tight channel until his hips were nestled between those softly rounded cheeks. Until she felt every damn inch of his hard cock impaling her virgin ass and his balls slapping her clit.</p><p>Feeling every bit of his invasion so she\u2019d never forget who\u2019d initiated her into these dark desires she\u2019d been begging him to satisfy.</p><p>As he imagined reaming her, he didn\u2019t envision an easy, gentle retreat as he pulled out. No. He\u2019d plow in, deeper with every hard thrust. He\u2019d let those supremely snug muscles grip the head of his cock before plunging past them right back in to the hilt. Over and over until that moment he exploded, shooting streams of come high and deep into her.</p><p>But he did none of that for her first time.</p><p>Colby held off on the aggressive male need to claim her, to mark her there as his alone. The yowling in his head had lessened and he eased into her rectum inch by inch, not stopping, not worrying whether his actions hurt her. Because he knew it did. He knew that it didn\u2019t matter because he couldn\u2019t stop from fucking her ass right now if the goddamn building would\u2019ve caught fire.</p><p>When Colby was buried as far in as he could go, he expelled a quiet breath. He felt his blood pounding in his head, in his neck, in his arms, in his cock, all pulses like insistent sticky whispers urging him to move.</p><p>Hard. Fast. Now. Prove to her who this ass and everything else belonged to.</p><p>Channing clenched and released, grinding back into him, a clear sign she was ready for more.</p><p>That was all it took. Colby slid halfway out and slammed back in.</p><p>Twice. Three times. Four. This wouldn\u2019t last long. He couldn\u2019t hold out against the breath-stealing sensation of that tighter clasp milking him on every upstroke. He pumped faster, his left hand gripped her hip, holding her in place while his right hand snaked between her drenched thighs and plumped her clit.</p><p>She wailed and bucked.</p><p>The bed frame banged into the wall as he banged her with little finesse. Just raw, dirty sex. His cock tunneling in and out of that tight portal was the hottest thing he\u2019d ever seen. His thrusts rivaled the power of a rocket booster and he was damn close to detonation.</p><p>Sweat dripped down his spine. He rubbed her swollen clit persistently. It throbbed beneath his fingers and she screamed as the orgasm burst across her wet sex in juicy ripples.</p><p>Her internal muscles clamped around his cock as her climax continued to spasm, reverberating through him. His balls drew up. He came so fast and so hard he nearly passed out as spurt after spurt of come jetted against those amazingly snug walls, until he was depleted and mindless and weak.</p><p>When Colby\u2019s eyes finally opened from near darkness behind his lids\u2014his damn eyeballs had rolled clean back in his head, a case of vertigo tipped him sideways. He swayed and almost collapsed on top of her. When he steadied himself by running a trembling hand up her sweaty back, her whole body shuddered. Her chest heaved and masses of curly hair covered her beautiful face.</p><p>Shit. She wasn\u2019t crying, was she?</p><p>No kidding, asshole. Would you blame her?</p><p>Jesus. He\u2019d acted like an absolute brute. Shame bloomed across his cheeks. \u201cChan? Shug, you okay?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Channing sucked in a harsh breath as he slowly removed his softened cock and her whole body flopped to the bed.</p><p>In the tiny bathroom Colby cleaned himself up and brought a warm washcloth with him to do the same for Channing. Gently, he smoothed her hair while he wiped the warmth over her tender flesh. When he finished, he tossed the washcloth away and crawled in, spooning behind her.</p><p>Luckily, she didn\u2019t squirm away from his touch.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say a single word, either.</p><p>He held her in silence for the longest time. Wanting to demand answers, needing reassurance he hadn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>She stayed uncharacteristically quiet.</p><p>Colby pressed his lips to the back of her head. \u201cYou ever gonna talk to me again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m just a little stunned right now, to tell you the truth.\u201d</p><p>A long sigh escaped from him, ruffling her hair. \u201cIn a good way or a bad way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>His patience snapped. He rolled on top of her, pinning her hands near the headboard as he stared into her face. \u201cWhat the hell does that mean, Channing?\u201d</p><p>A beat passed. \u201cIt means I never thought I\u2019d get to experience the passion that you\u2019ve shown me. I\u2019ve never had a man look at me the way you did tonight, Colby. Like I was...everything,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve never been utterly incapable of speech because I couldn\u2019t think beyond how you felt on me. In me. My world has never been distilled down to such an elemental need. It scares me to death.\u201d</p><p>Now he was absolutely stunned. And scared shitless. He\u2019d never been more in tune with a woman\u2014a woman who was guaranteed to leave him.</p><p>And as each day with her progressed, he suspected she\u2019d mostly likely leave him a broken man.</p><p>Instead of trying to come up with flowery love words or a sly retort, he kissed her. Pouring his heart and soul into that sweet, steady mating of mouths, hoping she understood all he couldn\u2019t say.</p><p>Exhausted, for the first time in three nights they didn\u2019t share lovers\u2019</p><p>pillow talk, or dissect how things had changed between them\u2014even when it was obvious it had.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Early the next morning Colby brought her new coffee pot into the motel room before he headed out to watch the morning \u201cslack\u201d</p><p>competition. He urged her to stay in bed and rest until check-out time.</p><p>Channing didn\u2019t argue. She was wiped out. Too much tension. Too much sun. Too much booze. Too much sex.</p><p>She groaned and rolled over. Her whole body ached. Talk about sore.</p><p>She\u2019d had sex with Colby twice early yesterday morning. Oral and sixty-nine with Trevor mid-morning, and then last night...</p><p>Wowza. Hot flash. Last night had been the most erotic night of her life. Not only because she\u2019d been initiated into the pain/pleasure of anal sex, but because she\u2019d been initiated into dark, possessive side of consuming lust. Hers. His. The scary beauty of it when they came together in unrestrained passion.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019d been foolish in the aftermath of such a scintillating episode, but Channing couldn\u2019t stop from telling Colby how she\u2019d felt last night. No. How he\u2019d made her feel. Sensual. Beautiful. Desired. And he couldn\u2019t have marked her as his any more clearly than if he\u2019d whipped out a branding iron and burned his initials into her ass.</p><p>Oh, it would be easier if she could be blas\u00e9 about it. Chalk up the experience to another rocking sexual encounter and move on. Problem was, she couldn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t want to. And she didn\u2019t want to analyze why things had changed last night.</p><p>She\u2019d rather curl up in a ball, comforted by the scent of sex lingering on the sheets as she napped. Naturally her brain wouldn\u2019t stop spinning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After fifteen minutes of tossing and turning, drifting off into blessed slumber wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>Rather than taking a shower, Channing indulged in an hour-long bath. The heat leached out some of the soreness, but it might be a few days before her butt quit hurting. She snickered. Now she totally understood the phrase hurt so good.</p><p>She dressed in loose-fitting jeans, a lightweight, long-sleeved white cotton shirt, hoping it\u2019d reflect the sun\u2019s brutal rays. Even after slathering on sunscreen yesterday, her skin had turned crimson from a day in the stands. Good thing she\u2019d kept her hat on and saved her scalp from frying. Instead of boots she wore strappy sandals. Cool head and cool feet meant a cooler core temperature.</p> <p>With her bags packed and lined up by Colby\u2019s by the door, she slurped the last of the coffee. Then she lovingly cleaned the carafe and packed it back in the box. It would probably sound silly to Colby, but she knew it would become one of her most treasured possessions.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a stranger to gifts. Mostly big, expensive ones. Her parents had given her a BMW for her sixteenth birthday. When she\u2019d turned twenty-one, a flawless string of pearls. But they\u2019d never given her a gift from the heart or paid much attention to her sentimental yearning for something unique and well thought out. Like a handmade scarf. Or pair of skates and a promise to take her to the rink for an afternoon of frolicking on the ice. They\u2019d never really listened to her.</p><p>In a few short days Colby knew her better than either of her parents.</p><p>She suspected the shrewd cowboy might know her better than she knew herself.</p><p>A sharp knock echoed in the quiet room. The maid kicking her out already? Channing lifted to her tiptoes and checked the peephole.</p> <p>Edgard. She opened the door. \u201cHey. I thought you\u2019d be at the rodeo grounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my way, chica. I just need to load yours and Colby\u2019s stuff in the horse trailer. Do you want to ride over there with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She touched his arm. And she thought she\u2019d looked wiped out. She could\u2019ve packed her stuff in the luggage under Edgard\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cEd, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Just worried about the events. Trev and I could sure stand to win some money today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cheer you on, amigo. Although I guess I\u2019m not bringing you as much luck as you\u2019d believed?\u201d</p> <p>Surprisingly, Edgard grinned, leaning over to buss her cheek. \u201cYou bring me something better than luck, Channing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope. Come on. Colby forgot his saddle and he\u2019s waiting, probably pacing behind the chutes.\u201d</p><p>Channing wondered. Had Colby been thinking about her and their erotic interlude last night that he\u2019d waltzed off and left his saddle behind? Maybe he was as bowled over by what was happening between them as she was because he was meticulous about his equipment.</p><p>At the rodeo grounds Edgard had parked the rig at the far end of the lot, near the back entrance. He handed her a key to the horse trailer.</p><p>\u201cCan you lock up? I gotta get this saddle over to him before he starts freaking out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. See you. Tell him I said good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you wanna give me a kiss that I can pass along to him, too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know, that\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve offered to kiss me. You feeling okay, Ed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling great. Later.\u201d He flashed her a bone-melting smile, hefted the saddle over his broad shoulder and sauntered off.</p><p>At the box office a ticket was held in her name. And it really brightened her day when several of the women from the Wild Bronc came over to chat, to tease her about her abrupt departure with Colby the previous night. The bolder ones even confided about the early days in their relationships with their cowboys and how they remembered\u2014and missed\u2014that urgency.</p><p>But mostly these trash-talking women wanted to tempt her into placing small stakes bets with them. A time-honored tradition, they swore. The only rule was you couldn\u2019t bet against your man.</p><p>Channing knew it was a test. And she soon discovered very few bet against Colby McKay. So she prepared to clean them out of their pocket money and she\u2019d enjoy every minute of it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s rodeo!\u201d the announcement boomed.</p><p>During the bareback competition Channing won twenty-five bucks.</p><p>Then the saddle bronc event started.</p><p>Oh mama. The second Colby\u2019s name was announced, her whole body flushed with desire and pride.</p><p>Colby looked powerful and in command and supremely sexy as he rode his bronc to a seventy-five. He finished third overall and won a decent amount of money.</p><p>With it being the last day of the rodeo, the events were longer, because the short go was held right after the individual competitions ended.</p><p>The betting became sporadic as contestants\u2019 significant others left the stands. It\u2019d be a long day for her. Suddenly alone, Channing regretted she\u2019d forgotten her notebook in the horse trailer.</p><p>Two tugs on her hair. Before she could turn to see who it was, Callie hopped down in front of her. \u201cHey, China bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Calamity Jane.\u201d</p><p>She clapped her hand over her mouth and giggled.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelpin\u2019 the hazer wrap up the back legs on his horse before Daddy goes bulldoggin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>With her soft Midwestern accent, bordering on a twang, and big eyes, the kid was cute as bug. \u201cIs the horse okay?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cSo\u2019s your stomach and your head hurt as bad as Momma\u2019s does this mornin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Channing choked on her iced tea. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad, because she is the one who\u2019s a bear today, not you,\u201d she confided with a serious face.</p><p>Beat-up brown boots covered in dirt slid into view. \u201cI heard that Calliope Jane Morgan.\u201d A sluggish Mary eased next to Channing. \u201cI\u2019d like to say she\u2019s full of it, but the truth is, my head is pounding and I feel like I could barf. Been that way since the moment I got up.\u201d</p><p>She could tell Mary was scrutinizing her from beneath oversized pink sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cHere I was hopin\u2019 my partner in crime from last night felt just as poorly as I do. But damn, you look positively chipper today.\u201d</p><p>Channing chuckled. \u201cRemind me why you were drinking last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShowing you how to celebrate Colby\u2019s big ride. It just didn\u2019t seem like I drank that much to feel this bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMomma. You always say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPipe down, pipsqueak. You\u2019re giving Channing a bad impression of me.\u201d</p><p>Channing hid a smile as she sipped her tea. \u201cSo are you guys going to Valentine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. We\u2019re off to love city as soon as Mike\u2019s event ends. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re heading that way, too.\u201d</p><p>Callie skipped across the seats to check out the vendors hawking their wares.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d Mary said. Channing nodded. \u201cAin\u2019t it kinda awkward travelin\u2019 with Colby and Trevor and Edgard? I mean, Mike and me saw you and Colby take off last night. And Trev was so wasted Cash had to help him out of the bar at closing time. But this morning Cash said Trev wouldn\u2019t stay in his room and he must\u2019ve slept in the horse trailer.\u201d</p><p>Channing tried to act nonchalant, dreading the remainder of the question.</p><p>\u201cSo how does that work when you and Colby want alone time? Do you guys gotta sneak off and git \u2018er done before Trevor or Edgard bust in on you?\u201d</p><p>Channing blushed. No doubt her new friend would be scandalized if she admitted the sleeping arrangements. But when she really thought about it, she literally had slept only with Colby in all the nights the four of them had been together.</p><p>\u201cWell, Trevor and Edgard make themselves pretty scarce. We switch off and take turns\u2014\u201d somehow she managed not to wince \u201c\u2014one night we\u2019re in the horse trailer, the next we\u2019re in the motel room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mary seemed about to say something else but Callie interrupted.</p><p>\u201cMomma, I\u2019m hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby. We\u2019ll be out of the sun soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo can I have one of them little fans to cool off?\u201d She pointed to the vendor wandering through the stands selling souvenirs.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a necklace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen can I have a whistle? They ain\u2019t very expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Callie. Lord, stop beggin\u2019 me for every damn thing you see.\u201d</p><p>Callie sighed. \u201cSo can I at least have a snow cone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Mary dug out a couple of bucks and slapped it in Callie\u2019s outstretched hand. \u201cBut come right back here, no fooling around.\u201d</p><p>Talk about diversionary tactics. Callie shot Channing a triumphant look that said she\u2019d wanted a snow cone all along.</p><p>Cheeky little thing.</p><p>The steer wrestling started. Bets were placed. Channing lost ten bucks because Mike won not only the second round, but also the final go-around. Mary and Callie took off and promised they\u2019d see her in Valentine.</p><p>Next up was team roping. Trevor and Edgard were the second competitors. The steer raced out and Trevor\u2019s rope came up short. They ended up with no time. They were out of the money except for the modest amount they\u2019d won the previous day.</p><p>Channing squinted, but from where she sat she couldn\u2019t gauge their individual expressions. Their body language didn\u2019t lie; they were both stiff, coiling their ropes in angry, jerking motions. Ignoring the announcer\u2019s run down of their bad run of luck again. Ignoring each other. She wondered if Colby was waiting for them back in the chutes to talk to them or if he\u2019d leave them to misery. Their moods would be sour tonight.</p><p>After another half an hour of sitting by herself, she was hungry and needed a break from the sun. She wolfed down a hot dog from the concession stand and sucked down an icy-cold beer. Ooh. That made her woozy. She glanced at the clock. It would be at least an hour before the bull riding started, plenty of time for her to grab her notebook and jot down a few observations. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The dusty parking lot was mostly empty of the usual line of horse trailers and campers. The timed events were nearly over and the contestants had already packed up and moved on to the next town. It was weird to see Trevor\u2019s trailer parked so far away. The horses weren\u2019t tied to the sides. They were probably still in the paddock waiting to be loaded until after Colby\u2019s last event.</p><p>A hot wind swirled the trash littering the grounds. Channing dug out the key from her front jeans pocket and slid it in the lock. As she stood below the pop-out metal step, she heard a loud thump inside the living area of the trailer. She waited and heard it again, but this time a grunt, another thump and loud male cursing followed it.</p><p>Crap. Were Edgard and Trevor in there beating the hell out of each other for their poor showing? She didn\u2019t have time to track down Colby; she\u2019d have to handle this herself. Channing quickly twisted the key and quietly slunk inside, softly clicking the door shut behind her.</p> <p>What she saw froze her to the spot. Edgard and Trevor weren\u2019t fighting. Rather, Trevor was naked, splayed along the back wall, beating his fists into the cheap paneling as Edgard, on his knees before Trevor\u2019s widespread legs, was noisily sucking Trevor\u2019s cock.</p><p>Holy shit. This wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d expected at all.</p><p>Edgard raked his fingers down Trevor\u2019s rippled abs and gripped his hips. \u201cFuck my mouth. Hard. You want to. Do it.\u201d Then he bent his head and swallowed Trevor\u2019s cock again.</p><p>\u201cJesus, I can\u2019t get enough of\u2014\u201d Trevor\u2019s gaze caught hers. \u201cChanning?</p><p>What the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>Edgard scrambled back so fast he fell on his naked ass, looking up at Channing with the most horrified, embarrassed expression distorting his striking face.</p><p>Trevor stayed pressed against the wall almost as if he wanted to melt into it.</p><p>No one uttered a sound.</p><p>And suddenly, things made sense. Edgard\u2019s reluctance to have her travel along with them or to join in their sexcapade. The constant tension between Trevor and Edgard. The sniping that was clearly a lovers\u2019 spat.</p><p>The truth of why Trevor disappeared every night and where he went, leaving her and Colby alone.</p><p>Oddly enough, it didn\u2019t freak her out. In fact, it was a relief. No wonder Edgard wasn\u2019t attracted to her; he was attracted to Trevor.</p> <p>Trevor said, \u201cChanning, it\u2019s not what you think.\u201d</p><p>Then another strange thought sneaked in and she blurted out, \u201cIs Colby gay, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gay,\u201d Trevor said.</p><p>Edgard shot him a dark look.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Bi at least. Then is Colby bisexual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know that you guys are...together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t mind?\u201d Most straight guys she knew were extremely homophobic. Brokeback Mountain notwithstanding, she suspected rough and tumble cowboys, schooled in the traditional conduct of the Old West would be even more set in their ways of thinking than the male urbanites she knew.</p><p>\u201cColby is of the \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 policy,\u201d Edgard said dryly. \u201cAs long as he doesn\u2019t see us\u2014everything is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She absolutely did not know what to say.</p><p>Trevor said, \u201cObviously, we\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t go blabbin\u2019 about this.</p><p>It\u2019d make life a mite difficult for us not only on the circuit, but everywhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine.\u201d</p><p>Edgard scowled, stood and threaded his hand through his hair. He reached for his rumpled clothes. \u201cI\u2019ll go get the horses.\u201d</p><p>She could\u2019ve let him go. Instead, Channing stepped in front of him and placed her hand on his cheek. \u201cNo. Go ahead and finish. I interrupted your private time together. If anyone should leave it should be me, Edgard.\u201d</p><p>Her words sent shock waves through the small space.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not disgusted by what you\u2019ve seen, chica?\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cOn the contrary.\u201d</p><p>Edgard and Trevor exchanged a look. \u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I see are two of the sexiest men I\u2019ve ever met, giving in to passion that I never believed existed until I experienced it myself.\u201d She felt a hot blush steal up her neck. \u201cHow can that be wrong? I\u2019m beginning to understand it\u2019s powerfully addicting. And...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Edgard brought her hand to his mouth. \u201cTell us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt turns me on. I\u2019ve always wondered what it would be like to watch two guys going at it. I mean, face it, you\u2019re both gorgeous. You\u2019ve both got incredibly beautiful, incredibly strong bodies. All those bulging muscles, rock-hard abs, broad shoulders. Big, rough hands and tight cowboy asses.\u201d Her gaze dipped to Edgard\u2019s crotch. \u201cNot to mention those.\u201d</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>Trevor stepped forward and curled his hand on Edgard\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you sayin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Channing looked from one man to the next. \u201cI\u2019m saying, part of the reason I\u2019m here is to experience all sorts of different sexual scenarios, right? This is one. So, I want you to finish what you started. Pretend I\u2019m not here. I\u2019ll just be sitting over there in the corner. Watching.\u201d</p><p>Edgard didn\u2019t look convinced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so wet thinking about seeing you guys fuck I hope you don\u2019t mind if when I can\u2019t stand it anymore, I take care of matters myself?\u201d</p><p>Trevor leaned over to kiss her forehead. \u201cDo what you gotta do, darlin\u2019. Don\u2019t mind us, \u2018cause we probably won\u2019t mind you.\u201d</p><p>Channing picked up the chair and slid it next to the door, out of the way and sat back to enjoy the show.</p><p>With renewed fervor, Trevor spun Edgard sideways and clamped his mouth to Edgard\u2019s. His callused hands cradled Edgard\u2019s face and he gradually slipped his fingers over Edgard\u2019s thick neck, his delineated pecs, until his thumbs brushed Edgard\u2019s small pebbled nipples. Over and over. A softer touch than Channing expected, but without pause.</p><p>Edgard groaned.</p><p>The contrast of Trevor\u2019s light-colored hands skimming across Edgar\u2019s darker-hued skin was a stunning visual. The strength of these men, square jaws covered in razor stubble, thick tongues flashing as they kissed hungrily, their sinewy bodies swaying closer until they were pressed together. Smooth, rock-hard chest against another equally firm torso dusted with dark hair. Muscled thigh to muscled thigh, cock straining against cock, made her heart pound and her pussy dripping wet.</p><p>Edgard broke the kiss and dragged his mouth down the center of Trevor\u2019s body. Trevor widened his stance, planted his palms on Edgard\u2019s shoulders and pushed him to his knees.</p><p>But Edgard wouldn\u2019t be rushed. He licked a line from Trevor\u2019s navel to the edge of his blond pubic hair, nuzzling the skin around Trevor\u2019s twitching cock. Edgard smoothed his hands over Trevor\u2019s hips to cup his butt cheeks.</p><p>Channing squirmed as she noticed one of Edgard\u2019s hands dipped lower, tracing the crack of Trevor\u2019s ass down between his balls.</p><p>Trevor shuddered and bumped his crotch forward. \u201cCome on. I was close before. Suck it deep.\u201d</p><p>Edgard lapped the crease between Trevor\u2019s hip and thigh, before turning to look at Channing. \u201cHe likes to come on my face, but we\u2019ll skip that today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll swallow every fucking drop I pump into this mouth, you cock tease.\u201d Trevor fastened his hands on Edgard\u2019s head and maneuvered Edgard\u2019s mouth to his groin. \u201cOpen up and say ah, baby.\u201d</p><p>Edgard took Trevor\u2019s cock deep in his throat on the first insistent stroke.</p><p>Trevor hissed. \u201cJesus, I love fucking this hot mouth.\u201d He thrust his hips harder, pulling out until Channing saw the mushroom-shaped head trail pre-come over Edgard\u2019s lips, then he\u2019d ram back in Edgard\u2019s eager maw. Time after time.</p><p>Edgard made wet, suckling noises like a man facing a sumptuous, succulent banquet. He tipped his head slightly and permitted his jaw to go slack when Trevor\u2019s cock was buried balls deep in his mouth. Saliva dripped down his chin and neck.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You are all pro at sucking cock. You fucking love it that you can get me off so quickly, don\u2019t you? Baby, hold on. Here it comes.\u201d</p><p>Trevor grabbed Edgard\u2019s hair, keeping his head in position, ramming his cock in with a grunt and holding it there. \u201cSwallow hard. Work me with your tongue and throat muscles. Oh. Shit. Yeah, like that.\u201d</p><p>Apparently, Trevor was the dominant partner in this sexual relationship.</p><p>Channing\u2019s clit throbbed. Her hand snaked between her thighs and she rubbed the hard seam of her jeans, aligned perfectly over her swollen tissue, as Trevor bucked, groaned and emptied himself down the back of Edgard\u2019s throat.</p><p>She was so hot, so ready to burst, four fast strokes and a small orgasm pulsed like a flash of lightning. It wasn\u2019t nearly enough, but it\u2019d do for now. She knew Trevor and Edgard weren\u2019t done. She squirmed in anticipation.</p><p>Gently stroking Edgard\u2019s cheek, Trevor tugged his semi-erect cock from between Edgard\u2019s rosy lips. He helped Edgard to his feet and kissed him in an erotic, open-mouthed tangling of tongues. Strong male hands smoothed rough male skin. The scent of musky male sweat and the heat of their bodies created a sultry humidity in the small space that reeked of sex and passion.</p><p>Trevor curled his fingers around Edgard\u2019s fully erect cock. Squeezing and twisting with more force than Channing had dared use on any man.</p><p>But who better to know how much pressure a man could take on that rigid appendage than another man?</p><p>Again, Edgard broke the kiss. His lips journeyed over Trevor\u2019s jaw to Trevor\u2019s throat. He didn\u2019t bother to lower his voice. \u201cYou know what I want, Trev. What I always want. Now.\u201d</p><p>Trevor nodded and leaned over to snag his jeans, removing a condom from the front pocket. He ripped open the package with his teeth. Staring into Edgard\u2019s eyes, he rolled the rubber down Edgard\u2019s long shaft, slanting forward to nibble and lick Edgard\u2019s shiny smooth lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Edgard wrapped his own fingers around the thick girth of his cock, stroking their hands in tandem as he said to Trevor, \u201cBend over the table, grab onto the edge and stick that ass in the air.\u201d</p><p>Trevor moaned, angling for another heated kiss before he readily complied, holding Edgard\u2019s hand as he turned, letting his belly drape over the flat surface.</p><p>Edgard flicked his tongue down Trevor\u2019s spine as positioned himself behind Trevor. He kicked Trevor\u2019s ankles until Trevor broadened his stance.</p> <p>Trevor looked over his shoulder at his lover, his eyes bright with desire as he tilted his butt higher in invitation.</p><p>Channing watched as Edgard dropped to his knees and ran his tongue down the crack of Trevor\u2019s ass. His hands spread those cheeks wide and he rimmed Trevor\u2019s asshole with the tip of his tongue. Around and around that puckered opening, blowing on it gently and then he jammed his tongue inside.</p><p>Jesus. That was one of the hottest things she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Her cunt spasmed as she remembered when Colby had done that to her last night. How the kinky, totally debauched behavior had turned her on to epic proportions.</p><p>Edgard\u2019s tickling tongue had the same effect on Trevor. Trevor whimpered and bumped his ass into Edgard\u2019s face. \u201cChrist, baby. That feels so fucking good. You know how much I love it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d Edgard stood. \u201cWhich is why I\u2019m not gonna let you come this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still pissed off at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Be glad I ain\u2019t tying you up and whipping the shit out of this ass before I fuck it. But then again, I know how much you love that.</p><p>Brace yourself.\u201d</p><p>Trevor said, \u201cYou want some lube?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo lube,\u201d Edgard said and pressed the head of his cock against Trevor\u2019s asshole. \u201cI want it to hurt.\u201d He plunged in, in one fast stroke.</p> <p>\u201cAh, fuck,\u201d Trevor said on a long groan.</p><p>Edgard reamed Trevor hard enough the table and the horse trailer shook.</p><p>Trevor\u2019s hands were wrapped around the edge so tightly his knuckles were white. Edgard muttered in Portuguese, his hips pistoning like mad as the muscles on his ass flexed.</p><p>After one particularly intense thrust, Edgard stopped with his cock buried in Trevor\u2019s ass. He layered his sweat-covered chest over Trevor\u2019s arched back. Edgard didn\u2019t move, he appeared to be waiting for something from Trevor.</p><p>Trevor wiggled, humping the table as he moaned, \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Edgard\u2019s silky voice inquired, \u201cWho is fucking you, Trevor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho am I?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cEdgard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it ever feel this good when you\u2019re fucking a woman?\u201d</p><p>Trevor turned his face away.</p><p>Edgard withdrew completely out and rammed back in to the hilt.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me, goddammit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever beg a woman to fuck you in the ass? With a synthetic excuse for a cock? Or with her fingers? Or with her tongue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to pull out my big cock and stop stuffing it into this hole as hard and deep as I can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Edgard. Please.\u201d</p><p>Edgard licked the back of Trevor\u2019s neck, trilling his lips over the sensitive bend in his shoulder until Trevor trembled. \u201cYou want what only I can give you? You don\u2019t care if she knows how much you love my cock? Shoved in your ass? Shoved in your mouth?\u201d</p><p>Right then, Channing knew she\u2019d been wrong. Trevor wasn\u2019t the dominant in this sexual relationship, Edgard was.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t care if she knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeg me to finish it. Beg me to show her what I do to you. What I give to you that no one else ever has, amigo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdgard. Please, fuck me. I\u2019ll do anything you want, just don\u2019t stop\u2014\u201d</p><p>Edgard growled his approval and rocked into Trevor with such force the base of the table cracked.</p><p>She\u2019d never seen such a brutal show of censure.</p><p>\u201cJack off right now,\u201d Edgard hissed. \u201cI want to see your come spewing all over your stomach.\u201d</p><p>Trevor reached between his legs, his arm pumping as his hand furiously worked his cock. He came with an extended groan that bordered on a scream.</p><p>Edgard roared, arched, his ass cheeks clenched and he pounded his meat into Trevor\u2019s up-thrust ass harder and harder until he shouted out his release. Still giving Trevor short, pulsing strokes, Edgard bowed over Trevor\u2019s back. Breathing hard. Licking. Biting. Sucking Trevor\u2019s passion dampened skin.</p><p>Channing came in a wet gush without even touching herself, just by squeezing her thighs together. As much as she\u2019d been unbelievably turned on by this voyeuristic episode, she knew something had happened between Trevor and Edgard in that interlude.</p><p>As they started to murmur to each other in that low lover\u2019s crooning tone, she snuck out, locking the door behind her.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Channing returned to the rodeo grounds in a daze. She smiled politely at the other women who were also waiting for the bull riding to begin. They were all at the point of the day\u2014the breaking point\u2014that they wished for the event to be over because they had miles of blacktop stretching ahead of them.</p><p>When it was Colby\u2019s turn to ride, she was surprised to see Trevor helping him prepare. Had Trevor told Colby that she knew about him and Edgard? She hoped not. Colby needed to concentrate on his riding, not whether she was weirded out by what she\u2019d discovered an hour ago about his traveling partners.</p><p>Colby had a decent ride, an eighty-four, but his hand had gotten caught up in his bullrope. He took a couple of slow spins with the bull before the bull fighter freed him. Colby hit the ground hard and the bull had rushed him. A big gasp echoed in the arena as it appeared the bull\u2019s hooves had connected with his upper torso twice before the bull fighter chased the bull off.</p><p>Her belly muscles knotted as she observed him limping from the arena. His score was good enough to get him in the short go, but she wondered how badly he\u2019d been hurt.</p><p>Usually, Channing loved bull riding; it was her favorite part of the rodeo. But today she could scarcely watch, as the bulls so far had been some of the nastiest she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Colby didn\u2019t stay on his last bull. It jerked hard and yanked the rope right out of Colby\u2019s hand, tossing him headfirst into the gate. Colby managed to tuck and take the brunt of the impact on his right side. It took a minute before he got up again.</p><p>Even after he\u2019d gotten ejected in the short go, Colby ended up in fifth.</p><p>Good enough to finish in the money, but not enough points to move him up in the standings. He was still ranked second.</p><p>Oddly enough, Cash had won the final round of bull riding. The minute the engraved gold belt buckle had passed into Cash\u2019s hands, she made tracks to the contestants\u2019 entrance. Heedless of what his friends or others might think, when Channing caught sight of Colby, she practically ran to him.</p><p>He gave her that charming boyish grin, complete with devilish dimples, but his smile didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes. \u201cHey, darlin\u2019. Didja see that ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one where you got hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell. I ain\u2019t hurt. Just got my bell rung a little, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Chan, I\u2019m okay. I got my payout, so I\u2019m actually a lot better than okay. I\u2019m ready to hit the road.\u201d He gestured with his head toward the parking lot. \u201cTrev and Edgard loaded up the horses and we\u2019re ready to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to rest in the truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m on tap to drive to Valentine.\u201d</p><p>Channing reached for his hand and he winced and jerked it back.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t want to hold my hand now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just a little sore. Forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Let me see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t nothin\u2019. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She stepped in front of him, bumped her sandals into his boots and rose to her tiptoes to get in his face. \u201cLet me see it or I\u2019m dragging you back to sports medicine for them to take a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m serious, Colby McKay, so don\u2019t think you can sweet talk your way around this one. Let me see it right now.\u201d</p><p>He glared at her. Then he slowly brought up his riding hand. \u201cFine.</p><p>See? It\u2019s a little beat up, but it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>Channing glanced down and her stomach churned. His hand looked like he was wearing a baseball glove, as it was swollen to twice its normal size. Red and puffy with dark crisscrosses around the wrist. The knuckles were scuffed, rubbed raw and scabbed over. Without thinking she placed her lips on the worst scrapes. \u201cOh, Colby. Oh, honey, oh, baby, it\u2019s not fine. That has to hurt something fierce. You need\u2014\u201d</p><p>With his good hand Colby tipped her face to his and kissed her.</p><p>Deeply. Thoroughly enough to make her feel dizzy.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d She blinked up at him. \u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining, but what was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor carin\u2019 about me. It\u2019s the first time since I was about ten years old that I\u2019ve had someone give me a kiss on a rodeo boo-boo to make it feel better.\u201d A wicked grin flashed. \u201cCome to think of it, shug, when I was on that bull, on that last spin, he also gave me a real serious slam to my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are such a... man, using my concern for you against me for sexual favors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t blame me for tryin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I will tell you that no way in hell are you driving to Valentine.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cIt don\u2019t work like that. It\u2019s my turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr mine. I\u2019ve haven\u2019t taken my turn churning up the pavement yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever driven a 350 diesel pickup haulin\u2019 a horse trailer loaded down with three horses?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. But that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. And as much as I \u2018preciate you wantin\u2019 to help out, I\u2019m fine.</p><p>This ain\u2019t the worst hand injury I\u2019ve ever had. Hell, it\u2019s not even the worst one I\u2019ve suffered through this year. I\u2019ll put ice on it when we get settled in Nebraska, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNice try, but you\u2019ll take care of it now. Neither Trevor nor Edgard competed in six events today, Colby. They sure as shit can drive while you rest.\u201d He opened his mouth but she made it snap back shut with a fiery look. \u201cDon\u2019t push me on this issue.\u201d</p><p>From behind her Edgard said, \u201cShe\u2019s right. You can\u2019t drive with that hand. Besides, it ain\u2019t no big deal. I\u2019ll drive. Trevor can navigate. You might as well crawl in the horse trailer and sleep it off. You look dead beat, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Channing watched as a sense of relief crossed Colby\u2019s face. No one else probably caught it, but she did.</p><p>\u201cFine. I ain\u2019t gonna argue when it\u2019s two against one.\u201d He cradled his sore hand to his waist and moved to block their conversation from Edgard. In a low tone he said, \u201cSince I\u2019m not drivin\u2019, you gonna keep me company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you promise you\u2019ll actually rest instead of expecting me to fool around with you for the next few hours.\u201d</p> <p>He bent down and whispered, \u201cAw, darlin\u2019, that ain\u2019t no fun at all.\u201d</p><p>She readjusted his hat so she could peer in his eyes. \u201cI can guarantee you won\u2019t have any fun with me at all for days if you don\u2019t rest up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou threatenin\u2019 to hold out on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d</p><p>Colby sighed. \u201cYou ain\u2019t a pushover, Miz Channing, but neither am I so I\u2019ll make you a deal.\u201d</p><p>Her heart rate increased, thinking about the last \u201cdeal\u201d they\u2019d struck.</p> <p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I promise to get a little shuteye, will you promise to mess around with me later? After I get my strength back.\u201d He rubbed his cheek against hers and murmured, \u201cDamn, but I missed you today, Chan. The day seems like it\u2019s been a week long. Seems like it\u2019s been forever since I held you in my arms. Kissed that mouth until kisses are no longer enough and clothes start flyin\u2019 and we\u2019re rollin\u2019 around between the sheets.\u201d</p><p>Channing refused to get distracted by his sweet-talking. \u201cI know. I missed you too, cowboy. Now get your ass up in that bed. I\u2019ll be right there to tuck you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. Don\u2019t make me break out the ropes.\u201d</p><p>Colby lifted a dark brow. \u201cNow that could be downright interestin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>He ambled off, his gait more measured than usual.</p><p>Channing watched him until he disappeared inside the horse trailer and then she blew out a frustrated sigh.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Edgard said.</p><p>No. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m going to get him some ice and then we can take off.\u201d</p><p>Edgard snagged her hand and turned her around. \u201cTrev and I are concerned about what happened a while ago\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. My only concern right now is making sure Colby gets ice on his hand and that he gets some rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really do care about him, don\u2019t you, chica?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She studied Edgard\u2019s face. He seemed just as tense around her as he had been this morning. She\u2019d hoped maybe things would be a bit easier between them now. \u201cAre you surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m happy. And truth be told, I\u2019m a little jealous.\u201d He brushed his lips over her knuckles. \u201cYou are good for him. Take care of him and we\u2019ll take care of the driving and everything else.\u201d</p><p>Channing managed to track down some gel-pack cold compresses from the first-aid tent, as well as a big bag of ice. The door was open when she returned to the trailer. With her hands full, she tripped over Colby\u2019s rigging bag, which was plopped in the middle of the floor.</p><p>Trevor caught her. \u201cWhoa, there. Let me help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She tossed everything on the table and looked at Colby sitting rigidly in the chair by the bathroom door. His eyes were squeezed shut, his mouth was a flat line and it was obvious he was in pain. He still wore his hat, his chaps, his jeans, his boots, and his vest. Her anger surfaced. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you undressed and in bed, Colby McKay?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Trevor said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he can get undressed by himself.\u201d</p><p>She whirled on Trevor. \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you help him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want his help,\u201d Colby snapped.</p><p>Trevor shrugged.</p><p>Take a deep breath, don\u2019t yell at him. He\u2019s hurting and he doesn\u2019t want you to know it. And he doesn\u2019t want to look weak in front of his friend.</p><p>In a breezy tone, she said, \u201cTouched as I am that you want me to undress you personally, I\u2019m not exactly well-versed on how to get you out of those sexy chaps.\u201d She paused and walked to him to touch the pulse throbbing in his neck, then skimmed her hand up to rest on his cheek.</p><p>His face was clammy. \u201cSo, will you let Trevor help me do that much and then I\u2019ll take care of the rest of your pesky clothes all by my little lonesome?\u201d</p><p>Heavy silence.</p><p>Finally, Colby nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood. Boots off first.\u201d</p><p>Between them, they unhooked Colby\u2019s spurs, yanked off his boots, unbuckled Colby\u2019s chaps and peeled them down his legs. Trevor took the dirty, sweat-dampened chaps and hung them in the tack room before he said goodbye and returned to the truck cab.</p><p>Channing had noticed Colby wincing when they\u2019d jerked on the strap between his hips. She unzipped his vest and eased him out of it, an arm at a time. Then she unbuttoned his soggy cotton shirt, keeping her eyes on his until she had to strip the material down his riding arm.</p><p>Once he stood bare-chested in front of her, she saw the bruises on his ribcage, under his ribs and everywhere across his upper torso. Purple and black splotches that looked like smears of dirt, but she knew were smudges of blood and broken tissue\u2014a \u201crodeo tattoo\u201d courtesy of rough stock.</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t as bad as it looks,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t say a word, lest she start bawling. As she rolled down his jeans, Colby sucked in another harsh breath. She realized he had another half-moon-shaped bruise the size of a softball on his inner left thigh. And a contusion by his knee.</p><p>\u201cChanning, darlin\u2019\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am trying very hard not to yell at you, so don\u2019t you Channing darlin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>Colby pointed to the bag on the table. \u201cIf you\u2019re determined to fix me up, there\u2019s liniment and wraps in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Channing rummaged around until she found the half-empty tube. \u201cSo, stubborn man, can you crawl up in bed by yourself, or do I need to get Edgard and Trevor back here to give you a boost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t a cripple,\u201d he grumbled. With painstaking weariness he shuffled up the ladder, his boxers hanging low off his slim hips and perfectly round little ass. Besides his underwear, he wore only his grungy gray athletic socks and his dusty cowboy hat. At any other time she might\u2019ve snickered at the funny picture he made, but at that moment laughter was the furthest thing from her mind.</p><p>A loud male grunt and he stretched himself flat on his back and didn\u2019t budge again.</p><p>Channing busied herself getting an icepack ready for his hand, knowing she\u2019d need to use the compresses for his ribs\u2014whether he liked it or not. She rummaged in her bag until she found a bottle of Tylenol with codeine. Then she climbed up beside him. Her stomach roiled to see such a virile man so vulnerable.</p><p>Sweat coated his skin, yet he was shivering like a naked baby. His mouth was set, like that tough, determined action alone could drive away the pain.</p><p>Right. Maybe it had worked in the past, but she wasn\u2019t going to let it slide on her watch.</p><p>\u201cListen up, McKay. You\u2019re taking these pain pills. Then I\u2019m icing up your poor hand and your ribs and spread this stinky junk all over you.</p><p>Once I\u2019ve got you doctored up, you\u2019re going to sleep. And you\u2019ll stay up here, resting up and healing up until I say otherwise, understand?\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly enough, he didn\u2019t argue. He merely nodded and winced when she removed his hat. Lord. If just taking off his hat hurt him, how would she get through the rest of this?</p><p>Only after she\u2019d finished carefully tending his injuries, did she allow herself to give him the type of lover\u2019s comfort she sensed he needed from her. Her fingertips swept the damp hair from his brow. Repeatedly, she smoothed the back of her hand over the five-o\u2019clock shadow on his rigidly set jaw. \u201cAre you comfy enough so you can rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Is there anything else I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Kiss me, darlin\u2019. When you\u2019re kissin\u2019 me I forget about everything else but how good your sweet mouth feels on mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hit your head hard enough to injure that silver tongue of yours, did you, cowboy?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cNot hard enough to knock any sense into my fool head, either.\u201d He looked at her; his blue eyes were stark and needy. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say no if it weren\u2019t for the fact you can still charm the hell out of me while you\u2019re flat on your back and frozen in pain.\u201d She ran her thumb over the dark circles under his eye, noticing a mouse high on his cheekbone. \u201cBut I\u2019m finding I can\u2019t deny you a damn thing, Colby McKay.</p><p>So c\u2019mere and let me lay a big, sloppy, wet kiss on you.\u201d</p><p>Channing rubbed her lips over Colby\u2019s, infusing him with all the sweetness and joy and heat he usually gave her. He melted deeper into the mattress, and let her have total control of the kiss. Of him. His surrender was as rewarding as it was arousing.</p><p>It was a long time before either one of them could speak after their mouths reluctantly parted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStay with me?\u201d he asked gruffly.</p><p>\u201cFor as long as you want,\u201d she whispered. She pulled the flannel sleeping bag over them and rested her head beside his chest, drifting off to the solid, steady beat of his heart next to her ear.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p> <p>A loud clank woke her from a light sleep. Channing opened her eyes and realized the trailer was bumping up and down like a logging truck, which meant they were still tooling down the highway.</p><p>She lifted her head from where it\u2019d been resting beside Colby\u2019s bare chest. She looked up, expecting to see him sleeping, but his eyes were open and he was staring at her.</p><p>He smiled gently. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey yourself. How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019ve been run over by a buckin\u2019 bull and a wild bronc.\u201d</p> <p>Channing kissed his left pec. \u201cYou were run over by a bull and a bronc today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no wonder I\u2019m feelin\u2019 it.\u201d Colby absentmindedly twisted a section of hair around his finger. \u201cThanks for stickin\u2019 around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d She pushed up. \u201cI probably need to get some more ice for your hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hand is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pulled her back down. \u201cI need you to stay snuggled up to me like this. It\u2019s makin\u2019 me feel much better, shug.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019d feel even more like my old self if you took off the rest of your clothes.\u201d</p><p>Channing rolled her eyes. \u201cOne thing at a time, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Scoot closer. I like havin\u2019 your softness and warmth wrapped around me. It\u2019s like heaven, bein\u2019 with you.\u201d</p><p>They stayed cocooned together in companionable silence. Colby dragged the fingers of his left hand up and down her spine.</p><p>Finally, he said, \u201cI guess you found out about Trevor and Edgard, huh?\u201d</p><p>Her stomach did a little flip. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinda shockin\u2019 to see them like that, ain\u2019t it? That\u2019s how I found out.</p> <p>I walked in on them. Wanted to gouge my eyes out with a hot poker afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t bother you? I mean, you\u2019re still traveling with them.</p><p>You haven\u2019t gotten them blackballed to the \u2018gay\u2019 rodeo circuit or anything. Especially if people do find out, they might assume you\u2019re just like them.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI ain\u2019t gay. Or bi. I gotta be honest, I don\u2019t understand it, wantin\u2019 to be with another guy.\u201d A small shiver worked through him.</p><p>\u201cTrevor never once made advances toward me like that or I\u2019da busted him in the chops\u2014and he and I have had our share of threesomes so there\u2019s been ample opportunities. Damn. It\u2019s just plain weird. I think it must be something about Edgard alone that he\u2019s attracted to. Trev and I have been friends for our whole lives. We\u2019ve been damn near as close as brothers. I always jokingly said that he\u2019d fuck anything that walked, only I didn\u2019t know how true that actually was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t most cowboys highly homophobic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncluding you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. If it would\u2019ve been somebody else I\u2019d seen doin\u2019 that...I might not have been so understandin\u2019. Then I think about if someone else would\u2019ve discovered them before I knew about it. How they might\u2019ve started vicious rumors to get them blackballed from the circuit. Bugs me because I ain\u2019t like that.</p><p>\u201cWhat they do is their business. Besides, Trev is with women just as often as I am. Or as I was before you. I don\u2019t think many people\u2014even folks who know them well\u2014would believe that he and Edgard are more than ropin\u2019 partners.\u201d</p><p>For the first time she thought there might be another reason why Colby had been eager to have her ride the circuit with them. \u201cSo having me traveling with you guys is good for everybody? A cover story for them, so to speak? The girl willing to do all three cowboys, when in fact, two of the cowboys are content just to do each other?\u201d</p><p>Colby didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Channing raised her head and looked at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to come along for them, Channing. I asked you to come along for me. I want you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause something about your fire and sweetness called out to me.</p><p>From the first time I saw you, Chan, I knew you were just as lonely as I was. Stubborn about it, too.\u201d He closed his eyes. \u201cCan we talk about this later, darlin\u2019? I\u2019m getting tired again.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to demand they finish the conversation now. Instead, she waited until he was dozing and untangled from his embrace. No way could she go back to sleep after that.</p><p>Colby was still out by the time they reached Valentine. The motels were full, so it appeared they\u2019d all be sleeping in the horse trailer at the rodeo grounds for at least a night.</p><p>While Trevor took care of the horses, Channing and Edgard made a run for food. They didn\u2019t talk, letting the country music on the radio fill the void in the truck.</p><p>But Channing couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. She\u2019d keep the conversation neutral, but dammit, they were going to talk to each other and stop playing this avoidance game. She said, \u201cTell me how a Brazilian ended up team roping and tie-down roping on the American rodeo circuit.\u201d</p><p>Edgard turned down Reba McIntyre\u2019s \u201cFancy\u201d . \u201cMy mother came to America as a foreign exchange student when she was in high school. She met my father at a rodeo when she was seventeen. She ended up pregnant and they got married. About a year after I was born, my birth father died in a car accident.</p><p>\u201cMy mother was only eighteen, a widow, a foreigner with a baby and no way to support herself. So she returned to her family in Brazil. A couple of years later she married the man I consider my real father. But she kept in touch with my birth father\u2019s parents. After I graduated from high school, I came to the US for a few months to meet them. I\u2019ve been coming here on and off for about ten years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do they live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutside of Laramie, which is where I met Trevor. Anyway, because I was raised on a ranch in Brazil, I realized I could make big money here on the rodeo circuit.\u201d Edgard shot her a dark look. \u201cHere\u2019s where you could point out I\u2019m not making big money now, chica.\u201d</p><p>She scowled. \u201cBut I\u2019m not like that, Edgard. I\u2019ve got enough things in my own life that need fixed before I\u2019ll pass judgment on other people\u2019s problems, financial or otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. That was a cheap shot.\u201d He sighed. \u201cAt one time I did earn money through bull riding and bulldogging, enough that I bought a ranch in Brazil about an hour away from my parents. It is so beautiful.</p><p>Lush and green and secluded. I miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how come you\u2019re not there?\u201d</p><p>Edgard tapped his fingers on the steering wheel as he brooded out the window. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to wonder that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevor doesn\u2019t know what to do about you being in love with him, does he?\u201d</p><p>He whipped toward her, his mouth open. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guessed.\u201d Channing held up a hand at his immediate protest. \u201cIt\u2019s not obvious to other people. But because our circumstances\u2014you know, the supposed free-for-all sex, and you not really being into it at all, and then seeing you guys together today...\u201d</p><p>Edgard brooded some more. \u201cHave you talked to Trevor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I won\u2019t either. You can trust me. But I want to ask you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevor doesn\u2019t consider himself gay. So there\u2019s no way he\u2019ll let you two be together, as a real couple, \u2018out\u2019 in a relationship, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are you still here in the US? Following him and the rodeo circuit instead of being at the ranch you love so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I love him more. Or at least I thought I did.\u201d Edgard parked the truck and leaned his head back into the headrest. \u201cAt the beginning of the year, Trevor hinted around he might be interested in coming to Brazil. Permanently. Living with me. Helping me raise cattle on the ranch. And he made it sound like he wouldn\u2019t keep pretending we were just roping partners. That maybe we could be partners in the truest sense of the word. No more hiding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut first he wanted to spend another year trying to get to the NFR in the team roping. Trying to make his father proud. Trying to prove himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sense another \u2018but\u2019 coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut as I\u2019m here, spending another summer with him, chasing his dream, getting our asses beat on the circuit every damn day, I\u2019ve begun to realize he is too afraid to be with me the way I need him to be. That my dreams don\u2019t matter to him, maybe they never have.\u201d He laughed bitterly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even mind the women. I\u2019ve known since the first time we were together that he really is bisexual. I\u2019m not. I never can be. I\u2019ve never wanted to be.\u201d Edgard gave her an embarrassed smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize for being who you are, Edgard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for that. Trevor\u2019s family is very traditional. He\u2019d be disowned if his family knew about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy family knows I\u2019m gay. They\u2019ve accepted it and accepted me. So when I\u2019m there, I have a hard time understanding why Trevor can\u2019t just be what he is and not care what other people think. When I\u2019m here, in the US, I have to pretend to be something I\u2019m not. And Trevor can\u2019t seem to make up his mind what he wants either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it worth it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Being with him is like a drug. When we\u2019re competing together, it\u2019s like we\u2019re really a team. When we\u2019re fucking it\u2019s like we\u2019re really in love. Every other time it sucks, like coming down off a really great high. And lately, the highs have been few and far between.\u201d His body went rigid for a second. \u201cShit. Sorry. Probably more than you wanted to know, eh?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. Thanks for being honest with me. I\u2019ve spent my whole life with people pretending to be who they\u2019re not and expecting me to be the same shallow person. That\u2019s why I ran away with the rodeo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you finding people are more real here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome more than others.\u201d Channing reached for his hand. \u201cLike I told you the other day. I\u2019d like for us to be friends, because the truth is, I could use one.\u201d</p> <p>Edgard squeezed her hand. \u201cAnytime, chica.\u201d</p><p>By the time they unwrapped the sandwiches and set out the rest of the food, Trevor was back from exercising the horses and Colby had shambled down from the sleeping area. He looked like hell. Channing had to bite her tongue against demanding he go back to bed.</p><p>The meal was sort of strange, in that with all the sexual things the four of them had done together, it was the first time they\u2019d eaten a meal in the same place.</p><p>Colby wasn\u2019t a good dinner companion. He complained about the onions on the sandwiches. The lack of beer. He grumbled about having to clean himself up in the tiny shower. When his cell phone rang, Channing was grateful for the chance to escape.</p><p>She wandered through the grounds. It was a lovely night, the humidity softened the air so it seemed to soothe her and caress her skin like warm velvet. Lots of folks were sitting outside enjoying the evening, drinking beer. Some kids were practicing throwing ropes. She really didn\u2019t have any idea where she was headed until she saw the glare of the arena lights and the empty bleachers.</p> <p>A couple of gals were taking turns running the barrels.</p><p>Channing stayed there, hanging on the fence, on the outside looking in\u2014again\u2014and wondered if she\u2019d ever find a place in her life where she fit in.</p><p>She fit with Colby. How he\u2019d recognized her loneliness the first time he\u2019d seen her blew her away. She thought she\u2019d kept that secret well hidden. But she\u2019d noticed things about him too that he\u2019d shrugged off as no big deal.</p><p>The soft clip-clop of horse\u2019s hooves sounded behind her. She spun and saw Gemma astride a bay mare.</p><p>\u201cChanning! Girl, what\u2019re you doin\u2019 out here all by yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting some fresh air. What are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLetting Daisy here stretch her legs.\u201d Gemma patted the horse\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a social butterfly. She wants to see who\u2019s hanging around the paddock. Mostly I think she\u2019s got her eye on cozying up to one of them cutting horse studs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to ride her? She\u2019s really gentle.\u201d</p><p>Channing laughed. \u201cCan I tell you something completely embarrassing?\u201d</p><p>Gemma grinned. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to ride a horse, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Not the first thing about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, lucky you\u2019ve got me to teach you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe teacher being taught, that has a nice ring to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a teacher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s great. What age group?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to teach high school in the fall. But my real love would be elementary kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you switch and do that?\u201d</p><p>Channing sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got time. Come on, help me bed Daisy down for the night and we\u2019ll talk about making you into a real horsewoman.\u201d</p><p>Channing wished she would\u2019ve brought her notebook. There was so much more to taking care of a horse than she\u2019d ever dreamed. Gemma chatted as she performed the tasks she\u2019d done a million times. When she finished she said, \u201cEarly tomorrow we\u2019ll get saddled up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun, I promise.\u201d She wiped a gloved hand across her forehead, leaving a smear of dirt. \u201cI got beer in the trailer if you want one.\u201d</p><p>Channing thought it\u2019d be rude to point out the smudge so she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Let\u2019s sit outside, soak in the night. I hate being cooped up all day in the damn truck.\u201d</p><p>At her campsite, Gemma pulled out two lawn chairs and a six-pack of Bud Light. She popped the tops on two cans, handed one to Channing and toasted her. \u201cCheers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheers.\u201d</p><p>After a long pull of beer, Gemma sighed and propped her booted feet on the cooler. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about. This is getting to be my favorite time of day.\u201d She grinned. \u201cBeer o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>Channing laughed.</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me, Channing Kinkaid, who you are, and why you\u2019re running with the rodeo and a buncha cowboys. You look smarter than that.\u201d</p><p>Again, Channing laughed and gave Gemma the long version of her life, the run down of her crises and conflicts and the temporary escape from it.</p><p>Gemma looked thoughtful for a minute as she finished her second beer. Then she said, \u201cSounds like you got out in the nick of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do have to go back,\u201d Channing pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t gotta do nothin\u2019 you don\u2019t want to. That\u2019s the beauty of being young and where you\u2019re at in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy blowing off my obligations?\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cOnly person you\u2019re obligated to make happy is yourself. Is Colby McKay helpin\u2019 you blow off some steam and taking some of the starch out of your spine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd since I\u2019ve got no life and no shame, my next question...is he any good?\u201d</p><p>Channing sipped her beer before she let a slow smile tilt the corners of her mouth. \u201cOh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, girl. Details. Vivid details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen him on broncs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, rough stock ain\u2019t the only thing he can ride like a wild man.</p><p>And he can ride long and ride hard, all night.\u201d</p><p>Gemma hooted. \u201cKeep goin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the phrase \u2018hung like a bull\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Channing leaned forward. \u201cBulls ain\u2019t got nothin\u2019 on him. And believe me, when he\u2019s riding, bucking him off is the last thing on my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God. I need another goddamn beer. Better yet, give me some ice out of that cooler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Gemma. This isn\u2019t anything you haven\u2019t heard before, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Colby? Or men in particular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat your way of fishin\u2019 for information on Colby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t put anything over on you, huh, Gem?\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m gonna admit that I know Colby\u2019s folks a little better than I know him. Our ranches are only about two hours apart.</p><p>\u201cSo, here\u2019s what I know about your rough rider. He likes \u2018em young.</p><p>He likes \u2018em once and then he likes \u2018em gone.\u201d Gemma tipped her can toward Channing. \u201cSo as I see it, from my years of wisdom, you\u2019ve clean busted out of all three molds he likes to put his women in. Just maybe there\u2019s more to what\u2019s goin\u2019 on with you two than a short summer fling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d Channing chalked up the increased beat of her heart to beer, not hope. \u201cWhat about you? How long have you been a widow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo and a half, long, lonely years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in that time...\u201d Channing trailed off expectantly.</p><p>Gemma sank a little lower in her lawn chair. \u201cIn that time I haven\u2019t done the mattress mambo. Not once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You\u2019re pretty, you\u2019re fun, you\u2019re bright, you\u2019re respected, you know everything about rodeo stock\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m old, Channing.\u201d</p><p>Channing frowned. \u201cOld. Right. What ancient age are you? Thirty-five? Thirty-six?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither you are my new best friend for saying that or Colby\u2019s gift for charm is wearing off on you.\u201d Gemma smiled briefly before she fiddled with the pop-top on her beer can. \u201cI\u2019m forty-seven.\u201d</p><p>Channing whistled. \u201cWow. You don\u2019t look it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel it. Lord. I see those young thangs\u2014\u201d she gestured with her can,</p><p>\u201c\u2014like you and those eighteen-year-olds with the perky tits, and the pert asses and the pierced belly buttons...and hell, they are something to behold. Sleek and slick and sexy and can perform more fancy moves in public than a trick rider. No wonder no man my age looks at me twice.\u201d</p><p>Channing wondered if Gemma had noticed that Cash Big Crow always looked at her\u2014way more than twice. Surely Gemma couldn\u2019t be that blind?</p><p>\u201cYou know how they say what goes around comes around? Well, must be karma biting me on the ass.\u201d Gemma tossed her beer can in the pile on the ground. \u201cBelieve it or not, I was one of those hot little numbers when I was eighteen. Looking at older widowed women with contempt. Thinking they were ancient. They ought to just go back home, take up knitting and leave the wild living to the good-time girls like me.</p><p>\u201cIronically enough, I didn\u2019t end up with one of those dreamy young cowboys my age who circled me like studs around a mare in season. I married a man old enough to be my daddy.\u201d</p><p>Crickets chirped in the immediate silence.</p><p>Channing crushed her beer can under her heel. \u201cOh, come on, Gemma. You can\u2019t start a story like that and then expect me to fill in the blanks or to sit here politely and not demand to know what happened.</p><p>Spill it.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cShort version: I had a terrible home life growing up. We were poor, lived in rural Wyoming, my father was abusive, my mother just took his mean mouth and his flying fists by drinkin\u2019 herself into oblivion. I wanted better. After I graduated from high school, I moved to Sheridan and worked as a waitress.</p><p>\u201cBright lights, big city, right? I lived in a shitty trailer with two other waitresses and worked my ass off, still going nowhere fast. And to top it off, even though I couldn\u2019t wait to get away from my family I was so damn lonely.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Channing froze. Hadn\u2019t she and Colby talked about loneliness earlier?</p><p>\u201cAbout that same time, this older rancher\u2014he was all of forty-one\u2014would come in and sit in my section. He came in every single day, sometimes twice a day, for four months. A real gentleman cowboy. He was quiet. Polite. A great listener. Generous. Sweet.\u201d She closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLord, he was so damn sweet. Totally the opposite of any man I\u2019d ever known.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou fell for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at first. I wanted me a flashy guy. I started hanging out at rodeos. Figuring a big buckle meant a big man. Hearing promises that turned out to be lies. Then one night, while I was whooping it up, not having nearly as much fun as I thought I should\u2019ve been, I saw that quiet rancher from the diner. On his horse. Getting ready to compete in the bulldogging event.</p><p>\u201cIt kinda threw me for a loop because I never expected him to be the type of guy who\u2019d take dangerous risks. He always seemed...solid.</p><p>Boring. So I left my friends and snuck closer to the chutes so I could watch him compete.</p><p>\u201cHe burst out of that gate, all strength and poise and agility. Not showing an ounce of fear as he launched himself off his horse and at that steer. Flipping three hundred pounds of animal into submission in the dirt like it was nothin\u2019. Then he calmly stood up and checked his time.</p> <p>For some reason he spun my direction and saw me hanging on the railing, my jaw practically dragging on the ground from shock.</p><p>\u201cHe brushed the dirt from his jeans as he moseyed toward me. The whole time he kept coming at me, taking those slowly measured steps; his eyes never left my face. It was like I was the only one in the arena.</p><p>Like I was the only one in the world. And then I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you loved him?\u201d</p><p>She smiled again, but it was wistful, slightly sad. \u201cThat came later, but not much later. No. I knew then that quiet power and understated grace were the true measure of a good man, not the size of his belt buckle or his intentions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe stopped in front of me. He reached out and tucked a piece of hair behind my ear. Then he ran his rough fingers down the line of my jaw. It was the first time he\u2019d ever touched me. So softly, yet, so...confidently.</p><p>Like he knew just what I needed. He said, \u2018Gemma Mae, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time you quit foolin\u2019 yourself and come on home with me where you belong?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Tears pricked Channing\u2019s eyes and she swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cI went home with him that night and never looked back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOmigod. I think I\u2019m gonna cry. That is the most beautiful, romantic story I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is. Come to think of it, you\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve ever told that to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m really gonna start bawling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can understand why I\u2019ve been a little reluctant to bring another man into my life and into my bed.\u201d She grinned saucily.</p> <p>\u201cEspecially when gentleman Steve Jansen had moves between the sheets, in the barn, on the kitchen table and anywhere else the mood struck him that\u2019d probably give your Colby a run for his money for inventiveness.</p><p>The last thing Steve ever was, in or out of bed, was boring. God, he was good. With one look he could heat me up like fire and melt me like butter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry that\u2019s he\u2019s gone, Gemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Not only do I miss Steve every goddamn day, I miss that daily physical connection. I miss sex. But when you\u2019ve had twenty-five years of bust-the-bed-frame-scream-out-loud-raw-and-sweet-and-raunchy sex, I\u2019m afraid anything else would be a let down. But what I wouldn\u2019t give for a second chance to have it again.\u201d</p><p>Channing wasn\u2019t the least bit embarrassed by Gemma\u2019s brutal honesty. The answering silence between them wasn\u2019t clumsy, just thoughtful.</p><p>The grass crunched behind them and Gemma craned her neck.</p><p>Cash Big Crow stepped around the heap of beer cans and leaned his shoulder into the side of the horse trailer. \u201cEvenin\u2019, ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash, were you using your Indian stealth again to sneak up on us and listen to our private conversation?\u201d Gemma demanded.</p><p>\u201cGemma!\u201d Channing said, appalled.</p><p>Cash didn\u2019t smile. In fact, he had the oddest expression on his face.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at Channing either, but at Gemma, even as he addressed his comments to Channing. \u201cDon\u2019t mind Gem. She knows I wouldn\u2019t show her my secret Indian tricks unless she asked me nice. Real nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep dreaming,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI will. Channing, I tracked you down to tell you Colby is lookin\u2019 for you. You want me to walk you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine. I can find my way.\u201d She stood and stretched. \u201cThanks for the beer and the girl talk, Gemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime. See you bright and early, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019ll be here with bells on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a good night. Ride \u2018em hard, girl.\u201d</p><p>Channing snickered and gave Gemma a high-five.</p><p>Cash cocked his head and looked from Channing to Gemma. \u201cI\u2019m afraid to ask what that meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be.\u201d Gemma sailed to her feet. \u201cThen again, it\u2019s more of a</p><p>\u2018hands on\u2019 thing anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, luckily I ain\u2019t got nowhere to be right now. You could demonstrate by puttin\u2019 your hands on me all you want.\u201d</p><p>Gemma laughed, a trifle nervously.</p><p>Cash took another step closer and frowned. He lifted his hand and rubbed his fingertips across Gemma\u2019s forehead. Gently. Three times.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a smudge of dirt right there, and a piece of grass stuck in your hair. You been rollin\u2019 around in the hay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ve been no rolls in the hay for me for a long time,\u201d Gemma retorted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a damn cryin\u2019 shame,\u201d Cash said softly.</p><p>The air thickened. Channing held her breath, feeling like an interloper.</p><p>\u201cAh. Well, good night, Cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night, Gem. Sweet dreams, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Cash turned to Channing. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll walk you over anyway.\u201d</p><p>After they\u2019d reached the horse trailer, Channing said, \u201cYou know, Cash, you really should take a more direct approach with Gemma. The Indian stealth stuff isn\u2019t working. She doesn\u2019t have a clue that you\u2019re so crazy about her.\u201d</p><p>Before his face could turn any redder, Channing blew him a kiss and closed the door in his face.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>The lights were off inside. Neither Trevor nor Edgard were stretched out on the floor. Where were they? She peered at the sleeping area.</p><p>Chances were slim Colby was asleep if he\u2019d sent Cash looking for her.</p><p>\u201cColby?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Bout damn time you came back. Where\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking to Gemma. Why? Did you miss me?\u201d</p><p>Pause. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think if you\u2019re gonna be a jerk to me I\u2019ll turn around and leave and go back to drinking beer with Gemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m just bored. A bit lonesome. And yeah, I missed you, okay?\u201d</p><p>She smiled in the darkness. \u201cOkay. You need anything before I come up there? Ice for your hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Channing climbed up and flicked on the wall lamp at the head of the bed.</p><p>Immediately, his left bicep covered his face. \u201cOw. My eyes. Shut that damn thing off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor baby.\u201d Click. Back into shadows. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly? My hand hurts. My ribs are tender. And I\u2019m so goddamned horny I\u2019ve been layin\u2019 here, thinkin\u2019 about whackin\u2019 off for some quick relief. Except my right hand is all bandaged up and I ain\u2019t so good at goin\u2019 lefty.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and leaned over to nuzzle his neck. \u201cHow about if I offer you some relief? I ain\u2019t so good at going lefty either. Maybe it\u2019d be better for both of us if I used my mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Yeah. Your mouth. Uh. Yeah. That\u2019d be good.\u201d</p><p>Colby? Tongue-tied? She didn\u2019t know whether to be touched or nervous. \u201cSince it\u2019s dark in here and I don\u2019t want to hurt you, guide me to where you want me.\u201d She placed her fingers on his lips, tracing the warm fullness.</p><p>He kissed them, briefly sucked her index and middle finger into his mouth, then he wrapped his hand around hers and shifted the covers back to set her palm on his erect penis. At some point he\u2019d taken off his boxers so she just felt him. Long. Thick. Hard. Hot. Ready.</p><p>Channing scooted down Colby\u2019s body, avoiding bumping his upper torso. She\u2019d rather take a shortcut and trail soft healing kisses and touches over his bruised ribs. But she knew he\u2019d rather have a trail of hot, hungry kisses down his cock. A couple of quick hard strokes and she brought him into her wet mouth.</p><p>Colby groaned and arched, trying to shove his dick in deeper. Which lasted about a second because he winced in pain and dropped back to the mattress, letting his cock slip free from between her lips.</p><p>Channing knew Mr. Take Charge preferred to grab her hair and direct her mouth to where he wanted it. But since Colby was banged up, he didn\u2019t get to be in charge. His immobility would give her a chance to decide on the level of participation she\u2019d allow him. For once, this was all her show.</p><p>Heh heh. This was going to be so fun.</p><p>\u201cChanning, darlin\u2019, I can\u2019t move much, so you\u2019re gonna hafta\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo whatever I want. My, my. Isn\u2019t this a turn of the tables?\u201d She flicked the stiff tip of her tongue back and forth over the magic spot under the cockhead. Then she retreated to blow a stream of cool breath on the moist area.</p><p>He hissed.</p><p>She played with him. Sucking him deep into the slippery recess of her mouth until her lips brushed the base of his cock. She built a seductive, calculating rhythm with firm strokes of her hand and teasing tugs of her wet mouth that almost sent him soaring over that dark edge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Twice. But she stopped both times to nuzzle his balls. Lapping at the tight sacs like a cat. She\u2019d roll them in her mouth like she was sucking a lollipop.</p><p>When his whole body started to shake she knew it wasn\u2019t from a fever. Powerful stuff, being in charge. She\u2019d have to try it more often.</p><p>Her firm lips nibbled up and down the sides of that straining length of rigid flesh until it quivered against his belly. A little lick here, a little lick there. She avoided the tip weeping for her attention.</p><p>Colby groaned and shifted his hips slightly. \u201cNow you\u2019re just bein\u2019</p><p>mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019d be mean if I stopped entirely. And if you complain again, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Channing made as if to leave.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay! I believe you. Jesus. Don\u2019t go, darlin\u2019. I\u2019ll behave.\u201d</p><p>She smirked and let her hair drift up his battered body, over and over\u2014a thousand little lashes of pleasure on his sensitized skin.</p><p>He shuddered and said, \u201cThat feels so good. Everything you do to me feels good.\u201d</p><p>She licked his neck, much like she\u2019d licked his cock and he moaned.</p><p>After toying with his earlobe with her tongue and teeth and breath\u2014which drove him crazy\u2014she whispered, \u201cWhere\u2019s the lube?\u201d</p><p>One-handed, Colby frantically patted the area beside him and then pressed a cold metal tube against her arm.</p><p>She drew back. \u201cYou already had the KY up here? Pretty confident, aren\u2019t you, cowboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just hopeful. I\u2019m an optimistic sort of guy; I think you forgot that about me, shug.\u201d</p><p>Optimistic. Right. The man was just plain cocky. Channing flipped the cap open on the lube. Instead of warming the gel in her hand first, she squirted a cold line of it straight down his dick.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d He shot up and froze at the sudden pain the movement caused before he flopped back down. \u201cShit. That\u2019s cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it,\u201d she murmured and began to work him methodically with the slippery friction of her palm.</p><p>\u201cI deserved that, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. But you deserve this, too.\u201d Channing kissed the blunt end of his cock, opened her lips wide and slid that glorious smooth male skin past her teeth, over her tongue until his shaft was buried as deep as possible in her mouth.</p><p>With one hand she feathered her fingers over his balls as her hungry mouth pumped him faster and faster, letting the lube and saliva mix together until he was sopping wet everywhere, as she knew he liked it.</p> <p>She liked it, too. God. She loved going down on him, as evidenced by her own thighs, sticky from arousal.</p><p>Colby began to pant and grind his hips into her face, whispering,</p><p>\u201cPlease, please, yes, God, don\u2019t stop, yes, ah, like that, more, oh, baby. I fucking love this. Goddamn you\u2019re good at that. YES.\u201d</p><p>The second his balls lifted, she swirled her middle finger around the wetness coating him between the legs and slid it into his anus.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d He sat up, grabbed her hair and held her in place as he started to come.</p><p>She kept her lips wrapped around his cock as he pulsed and exploded in her mouth. She hollowed her cheeks and sucked, swallowing every hot spurt, losing herself in his taste. In the power of making this strong man relinquish control. To her.</p><p>\u201cChanning, my God what are you doin\u2019...\u201d</p><p>She lovingly lapped the tip of his semi-erect cock and wiggled and thrust that digit harder, deeper inside his tight back channel. Colby went utterly still, then he clenched his muscles, bore down hard, grinding his ass into her hand and he came again around her pumping finger.</p><p>Colby grunted but stayed upright as she pulled back completely.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna fuckin\u2019 kill me. That was so goddamn good that if I died tomorrow, I\u2019d die a happy man.\u201d</p><p>It hit her then. Colby really could die tomorrow. Something could go wrong with the broncs or the bulls or even his horse and he could be dead in a matter of less than eight seconds.</p><p>Oh God. The thought of this resilient man being a bag of broken bones. The thought not seeing him ever again. The thought of him cold, dead and buried. She remembered the sad look in Gemma\u2019s eye when she talked about losing the love of her life. And the fact that Channing felt exactly the same way meant...</p><p>She was in love with Colby McKay.</p><p>She scrambled back on her knees.</p><p>Of course Colby sensed her distress. \u201cChan? Darlin\u2019, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm nothing. You should lie down and rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until you tell me why the sudden change from red hot to icy cold.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou aren\u2019t ashamed of anything we\u2019ve done, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no. It\u2019s just...you\u2019re hurting and you should be resting not wasting time screwing around with me.\u201d</p><p>Colby snagged her by the shirt and hauled her up short until they were nose to nose. \u201cThat\u2019s about the dumbest, goddamn thing I\u2019ve ever heard you say. Nothin\u2019 we do when we\u2019re alone together is a waste of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Channing jerked away, and Colby winced, but he gritted his teeth and held on to her.</p><p>\u201cSee? You\u2019re hurt and you\u2019re in pain and I can\u2019t stand it. And what\u2019s worse is I can\u2019t stand the thought that this will keep happening to you.</p><p>Next time maybe something even worse\u2014\u201d Her voice broke.</p><p>\u201cSsh. Take a deep breath.\u201d He brought her forehead to his lips.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what this is about? Me gettin\u2019 hurt today?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, too much of a chicken to tell him the rest of her revelation. Who\u2019d believe a person could fall in love in four days anyway?</p><p>Romantic nonsense.</p><p>Yet it didn\u2019t feel like only four days. It didn\u2019t feel like nonsense. It felt...right.</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 I say will convince you that I\u2019m fine, will it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanning. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>She angled back. He kissed her with tenderness. She melted into the kiss, letting him think he\u2019d reassured her when she wondered if anything would ever soothe her again.</p><p>Colby smoothed his hand over her scalp, intertwining his fingers in her hair. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He eased onto his back and sighed. \u201cNow then. Why don\u2019t you strip off them britches and come up here and sit on my face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. I can\u2019t use my hands but I\u2019m better with my tongue any way.\u201d He grinned and his teeth shone brightly in the dimness. A little wolflike, she thought.</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s such a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. I can smell that sweet cream gathered between your thighs and I\u2019ve got a mind to taste you, darlin\u2019. Long and slow and deep.</p><p>With the way I have doin\u2019 that in mind, you can\u2019t hurt me. You\u2019ll be in total control. You seemed to really like it. Hell, I\u2019m a modern guy. I don\u2019t mind you bein\u2019 in control once in a while.\u201d</p><p>Channing felt the warmth between her legs begin to pulse with renewed interest. She stripped. \u201cHow\u2019s this gonna work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrow your leg over my chest like you were mountin\u2019 a horse. Then stay on all fours with your knees by my ears and back that pussy right into my face.\u201d He smacked his lips like she was offering him a gourmet meal.</p><p>The old Channing would\u2019ve been mortified exposing so much of her less-than-perfect body to a man, her private parts especially, in such an intimate manner. But Colby wasn\u2019t just any man. He was her man, her lover. He found her sexy and hot and he wanted her as she was, flaws, fat ass and all.</p><p>\u201cHang on, cowboy, I\u2019m mounting up.\u201d She kissed his belly and chest and she reversed into him, finding herself even more aroused as she dangled above him upside down.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Gimme some of this sweetness. Scoot back, shug. Just like that.\u201d Colby buried his face in her cunt.</p><p>\u201cOmigod.\u201d At this angle the sensations were completely different.</p><p>Cooler, as her hot tingly parts were riding high in the air. Wetter, as his cheeks and tongue spread the moisture from his mouth and her sex up the inside of her thighs and higher, through her muff and back to her ass. Sharper. Or it could\u2019ve just been the nip of Colby\u2019s teeth. Or the constant hard flicker of his tongue.</p><p>\u201cLike that do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The inside of her legs began to vibrate. Every bit of her skin pulsed. Channing rocked into him, whimpering as her orgasm hovered on the edges. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be pretty quick on the trigger this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Let\u2019s see if this won\u2019t spur you along.\u201d He licked and sucked and bit her clit, making little mmm-mmm noises in between slurping her juices, jamming his tongue deeply inside her pussy, fucking her with his mouth until she ground her wet sex down and came all over his face.</p><p>Afterward she fell beside him in a quivering heap, breathing hard, stunned yet again by how in tune this man was with her every unspoken need.</p><p>\u201cDamn. I was gonna put some ice up that pretty snatch and suck it out to see how you liked that, but I plumb forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. You might\u2019ve killed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome up here and give me that mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure wanna play kissy face with me a lot today, Colby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNuh-uh. Not just today. Everyday.\u201d</p><p>As Channing teasingly brushed her lips over his, the trailer door banged open. They both froze, midkiss.</p><p>Trevor laughed. \u201cIt smells like sex in here. What\u2019s a guy got to do to get an invite to the fun and games? Or am I excluded these days?\u201d</p><p>Colby\u2019s hand stroked her face. He whispered, \u201cYour call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know part of the reason you\u2019re travelin\u2019 with us is to fulfill your fantasies of fucking two guys at the same time. We\u2019re both here. We\u2019re both willin\u2019. You have to do whatever makes you happy, Chan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That wasn\u2019t the answer she wanted, but maybe it was the one she needed to put things back in perspective. This was a sexual adventure. A temporary sexual adventure, nothing more. In the heat of the moment she\u2019d just confused lust and love. She smiled and pushed back on her heels. \u201cWe\u2019re up here, Trev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot damn. Give me a second to catch up.\u201d</p><p>Colby\u2019s face was unreadable in the dark. Was he turned on by the idea of a threesome? She knew this situation wasn\u2019t anything new for him and Trevor.</p><p>But it surprised her that even with all she\u2019d done and seen today, the idea of being fucked by Colby and Trevor at the same time kicked her lust back into high gear.</p><p>The mattress shifted as Trevor scrambled up. \u201cColby, you feelin\u2019</p><p>better, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. My girl Channing kissed it and made it all better, didn\u2019t you, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d She faced Trevor and crawled to him like a slinky cat. \u201cSince Colby is flat on his back, looks like he\u2019s a bottom. We know what I am.</p><p>So guess what that makes you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery lucky.\u201d Trevor snagged her around the waist, tugged her to his naked chest and crushed his mouth to hers. His kiss was a show of aggression.</p><p>Channing gave him that aggression right back. Raking her nails over his smooth chest, digging her fingers into his slim hipbones. Wrapping her hand around his cock and jacking up and down vigorously, remembering how much he\u2019d loved it hard and fast when Edgard had done it.</p><p>Trevor plumped her breasts and lowered his head, sucking her nipples, his teeth nipping to that point of pain and backing off when she whimpered. Using the moisture from his mouth, his middle finger drew a straight line down her belly to her clit.</p><p>The air grew heavy with the sounds of labored breathing, and the dark, heady scent of sex.</p><p>Colby said, \u201cChanning. Come here. Now.\u201d</p><p>His voice dripped authority and...jealousy? She laid her hand on Trevor\u2019s face as he flicked his tongue over her nipple in time to his finger working her clit. She didn\u2019t want him to stop. She arched into him for more. \u201cGod. That\u2019s so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heat up in a hurry, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanning.\u201d Colby\u2019s voice was sharper.</p><p>\u201cIn a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Now.\u201d</p><p>Trevor released her nipple with a loud pop, looked up and smiled.</p> <p>\u201cSounds like someone\u2019s ready. Are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. Do you have condoms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here.\u201d</p><p>Channing turned and scuttled back to Colby.</p><p>He\u2019d grabbed his cock with his left hand and was idly stroking himself. His eyes glittered challenge. \u201cYou prepared to get fucked? By both of us? My cock in your pussy and Trevor\u2019s dick rammin\u2019 into your ass?\u201d</p><p>For a second she froze. She looked over her shoulder at Trevor. \u201cI know it might seem a little late to ask this, but should we be chatting about STDs? Especially since...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I\u2019m bi? Edgard is the only man I\u2019ve ever been with, Channing. I don\u2019t have AIDS or anything else. Neither does Edgard, okay? We always use condoms. You\u2019re safe. We\u2019re safe. I swear. I wouldn\u2019t be doin\u2019 this otherwise.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Colby said, \u201cPut the condom on me. I can\u2019t wait to see the look on your face when we\u2019re both inside you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart seemed to be pounding a mile a minute as she rolled on the condom. Excitement, fear, curiosity\u2014all danced in her head and fired her blood. She straddled Colby\u2019s pelvis, planting her palms flat on the mattress next to his shoulders. \u201cAre you sure this isn\u2019t going to hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and hurt me. It\u2019s the kind of hurt I like.\u201d Colby kissed her with a warm deluge of passion.</p><p>Trevor traced the crack of her ass to the rosette hidden between her cheeks. A cool gel brushed over the tight spot before a thick finger worked up inside her.</p><p>Colby said, \u201cWhile he\u2019s doin\u2019 that, slide my cock in that wet pussy.</p><p>Take it all in one stroke.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hips and reached back for him to guide it in. It was unbearably erotic, the way their hands touched and twined around his rigid sex together as they stared into each other\u2019s eyes and their ragged breath mingled. One downward push and all that male hardness glided right in, eased by the liquid excitement leaking from her drenched cunt.</p><p>\u201cBend over,\u201d Trevor urged. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to crush his ribs, balance on your knees. Oh yeah. Like that. Come on. Give me this ass.</p><p>It\u2019s gonna feel so fucking good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Colby warned Trevor. \u201cShe\u2019s new to this. Go slow and don\u2019t hurt her or I\u2019ll kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>Touched by Colby\u2019s concern, she smashed her lips to his as Trevor pressed the head of his cock into her ass and then drove straight in.</p><p>She whimpered in Colby\u2019s mouth. \u201cOh God. That hurts.\u201d</p><p>Colby moved his lips to her ear. \u201cSsh. Come on. It\u2019s okay. We\u2019ve done this before. We don\u2019t have to go fast. Let your body adjust to us, darlin\u2019.</p><p>You set the pace. We can go as slowly as you want.\u201d</p><p>For a second, she wanted to stop.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready, push down on me and Trev will pull out.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s rough fingertips scraped down her spine. \u201cChan? You okay?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>A second later Trevor\u2019s cock slipped out until only the head remained inside her back channel.</p><p>Channing hadn\u2019t moved on Colby\u2019s cock at all. She was afraid to. The fullness...burned. She held her breath until she was light-headed.</p><p>\u201cTrev. This ain\u2019t workin\u2019. She\u2019s completely tensed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a second.\u201d He murmured, \u201cShug? What do you need?\u201d</p><p>Someone to distract me. \u201cSomeone to touch my clit.\u201d</p><p>Colby said to Trevor, \u201cCan you reach her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. If I slide back in all the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered when Trevor\u2019s hips were once again plastered to her backside.</p><p>Trevor reached around and traced circles around her slippery clit, seeming careful not to accidentally touch Colby\u2019s cock embedded inside her. \u201cTell me what\u2019ll do it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp and down. Not your thumb. Your finger. Press right there.\u201d Ooh.</p><p>That felt good. She relaxed a tiny bit.</p><p>Colby said, \u201cPut your hands by my head and dangle them luscious tits closer to my mouth, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Channing shifted and Colby\u2019s mouth latched onto her nipple. He focused on her aching breasts, switching back and forth, gently licking, then sucking forcefully, blowing across the tips, dragging open-mouthed kisses across the tops and nuzzling the ultra-sensitive bottom curves, whispering nonsensical lover\u2019s words, which calmed her.</p><p>Then between Colby\u2019s concentration on her breasts and Trevor\u2019s patient attention to her clit, she was awash in pure pleasure. Pain subsided. And before she knew it she started bumping back into Trevor\u2019s cock, hinting for a deeper thrust.</p><p>He forged forward, and then pulled back. During his slow retreat, Channing wiggled down on Colby\u2019s shaft and raised up as Trevor eased in. They built a steady rhythm and the intense burning feeling took a different, pleasurable turn. When the head of Trevor\u2019s cock brushed against Colby\u2019s through the thin tissue separating them, the pace slowed.</p><p>She arched at the response of her body, tingles chased by an intimate throbbing deep within those tissues. She groaned out loud.</p><p>Trevor said, \u201cDoes that feel good? You ready for more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse my cock to fuck yourself however you want,\u201d Colby said against the hollow of her throat, the tease of his urgent whisper turned her skin into a mass of goose bumps. \u201cShow me what you like. Show me how I can fuck you next time, when it\u2019s just us.\u201d</p><p>Channing lifted her head and closed her eyes, giving herself to the moment, as Trevor picked up the pace and hit that secret gland on every hard forward thrust. Colby suckled her nipples until she thought his undivided, unrelenting attention to her breasts alone would set her off.</p><p>Plunge. Retreat. A back-and-forth play of peek-a-boo of two hard cocks. The strokes became shorter. Faster. Harder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close, Chan. Are you?\u201d Trevor asked.</p><p>\u201cMe too, darlin\u2019. Grind down into me,\u201d Colby panted. \u201cThen when I tell you, squeeze me hard.\u201d</p><p>Trevor slammed in one last time, his hands like steel bands around her hips as he came. Grunting. Holding perfectly still as her tight anal muscles milked him. She felt the pulse of his cock, but with the condom, not that hot burst of moisture.</p><p>Colby angled his hips and winced. \u201cFaster. Hell yeah. Fucking you is a dream. Bear down.\u201d</p><p>The second she did, her orgasm blindsided her. The muscles in her anus contracted around Trevor\u2019s cock, still jammed high in her ass. As Colby\u2019s orgasm rocketed through him, she swore she felt the throbbing tip of his cock in the back of her throat. Tasted it actually. Then the rasp of his pubic hair over her clit triggered another, stronger pulsating peak and she screamed from the most overpowering, debilitating, mind-blowing orgasm of her life.</p><p>At the last minute, when she\u2019d fallen from that hazy place of sheer bliss, she remembered not to crumple onto Colby\u2019s chest. She stayed stiff, her head hanging low, her hair pooling on the bed above Colby\u2019s head.</p><p>Trevor pulled out first. He sank his teeth into the curve where her shoulder met her neck and trailed kisses along the slope until she shivered.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I hope it was all you wanted it to be. It sure was all that for me. You are one sexy, fine woman.\u201d He staggered from the sleeping compartment and out of the trailer.</p><p>Channing sucked in another ragged breath, not able to think beyond the tremors still wracking her body.</p><p>\u201cChanning? Darlin\u2019?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her head snapped up at the sliver of pain in Colby\u2019s voice. \u201cOh crap.</p><p>Sorry. I\u2019m probably hurting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>She pushed her hair out of her face and angled her upper body back, keeping him fully seated inside her. The man was still hard.</p> <p>Something indefinable lurked in Colby\u2019s intense gaze. \u201cDid that fulfill your wildest fantasies, shug? Being with two guys?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t speak, she merely nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood. Because it ain\u2019t ever gonna happen again.\u201d His free hand knotted in her hair and he brought her face in line with his. His blue eyes flashed heat. \u201cYou\u2019re mine. And the thing you need to learn about me is that I don\u2019t share what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour little sexual adventure is done. You understand me? Anything you need in bed you\u2019ll get from me. I\u2019ll give it to you any way you want, whenever you want it, but I\u2019ll be the only one fucking you, is that clear?\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him.</p><p>Colby sat up abruptly and jerked her legs around until her ankles were crossed at the small of his back. Plastered belly to belly and chest to chest wasn\u2019t enough for him. His left hand circled her nape and he brought them nose to nose, so their lips were only a breath apart. He pumped his hips, driving his cock hard and high.</p><p>\u201cStop. You\u2019re hurt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m gonna hurt, it\u2019s gonna be from fucking you until neither of us can walk. If I\u2019m gonna pass out, it\u2019s gonna be from comin\u2019 so goddamn hard the top of my goddamn head blew off. If it takes all night, darlin\u2019, I\u2019m gonna prove that you\u2019ve moved into the number one spot of being the single thing in my life that has the power to hurt me the most.\u201d</p><p>Tears sparked her eyes and she surrendered to his need, allowing this tough but tender man to demonstrate it in the only way he knew how\u2014with his body.</p><p>He ate at her mouth with hungry kisses. He licked her neck. Marking her skin everywhere with wet sucking kisses. Marking her with his teeth.</p> <p>Marking her with the scrape of his beard on her sensitive flesh. Marking her with his scent.</p><p>It was a prolonged, raw mating. Heated. Elemental. Powerful. During her first orgasm she clutched his hair and rode it out. During the second orgasm she dug her nails into his flexing ass cheeks and shuddered against his heaving chest. During the third climax she scratched his back hard enough to draw blood as she ground her pelvis to his.</p><p>Drenched in sweat, breathless, it wasn\u2019t enough. For either of them.</p><p>After Colby had come again, he withdrew his still hard cock from her swollen pussy. He pressed his mouth to her throat. \u201cTake the condom off.\u201d</p><p>Once Channing had removed it, he used his powerful thighs to change the angle of her hips.</p><p>\u201cI want your ass, Channing. I want to look in your eyes as I\u2019m fucking you there. I want to suck your tits as you come. As you feel me coming and those tight muscles milking every hot burst. And if that\u2019s not enough for you. I\u2019ll do it again.\u201d He panted against her neck, sending shivers through her. \u201cI\u2019ll fuck this sweet ass with my cock as my fingers fuck your pussy. I\u2019ll keep at it until you know I\u2019m the only man you\u2019ll ever need.\u201d</p><p>His words, his resolve stole her reason. \u201cColby, please. Enough. I know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. God. You don\u2019t have a clue what I need from you.</p> <p>What I can give you. But I\u2019ve got a mind to show you.\u201d</p><p>As she tipped his face toward hers and stared into his eyes, she saw pain. Emotional pain. Real physical pain. This...possession was taking its toll on him. Channing lifted up, and guided his cock to her rear entrance. Slowly she sank down on him, reveling in how she could change his pain and his fit of temper into bliss.</p><p>And it was bliss, an unhurried surrender as she gave him every part of her body. As he climaxed, she followed right behind him, lost in the cosseted way he made her feel. Almost like love.</p><p>Colby was wrung out and crashed with utter exhaustion. Channing studied the multitude of old white scars covering most every section of his body, wanting to heal those old wounds, touching him without restriction as she watched him sleep.</p><p>But sleep was a long time in coming for her.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Colby wasn\u2019t particularly surprised when he woke alone the next morning. He\u2019d been hard on Channing. More demanding, more needy, more domineering than he\u2019d ever been with any woman.</p><p>More of a total asshole, too.</p><p>Talk about trying to fuck her into submission.</p><p>He sighed and tried to move. He winced and groaned at the lingering body aches. From his tumble off the bulls and broncs. Oh, and his tumble straight into love with Channing Kinkaid.</p><p>Damn. He had not handled that well. He needed to clean up and come clean with her before they both did something stupid and ran away from yet another set of problems. Namely how they felt so strongly about each other in such a short time. He rolled to his side and pain shot up his arm.</p><p>\u201cJesus fucking Christ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. It lives. You need help getting down?\u201d Edgard said from the bottom of the ladder.</p><p>Colby froze. He\u2019d thought he was alone. Actually, he\u2019d hoped Channing was sitting at the table, enjoying her morning coffee. Waiting for him to grovel. \u201cNah. I wouldn\u2019t mind if you\u2019d toss me a bottle of aspirin and a bottle of water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>The little fridge snicked open and shut. Edgard\u2019s head popped up and the pain pills rattled in the plastic as they landed on the sleeping bag.</p><p>\u201cThanks, man,\u201d Colby said as he reached for the proffered water bottle. \u201cI feel like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still gonna ride today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so. Trevor\u2019s out exercising King. You\u2019d better get moving.</p><p>It\u2019s nearly eight.\u201d</p><p>Last call for check-in time was nine. It\u2019d probably take him at least that long to work the kinks out of his aching body, and get a fresh coat of ointment slathered on his aches and pains and wrap up his ribcage in bandages. \u201cIs there any hot water left to shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould be. No one else has used it this morning.\u201d</p><p>Colby flopped back down, a bad feeling churning in his gut.</p><p>Edgard sighed. \u201cHow long\u2019s it gonna take before you ask where she is, McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gathered her stuff early this morning and headed to Gemma\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer duffel bag. Some clothes.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Stay cool. \u201cWhat\u2019d she say before she left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said to tell you she\u2019d see you later.\u201d Edgard poked his head over the edge of the bed again and studied him.</p><p>Colby snapped, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened last night besides the threesome, amigo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew about it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cTrevor came looking for me after. He knew something was up with you two. He said it felt like jealousy. You wanna talk about it?\u201d</p><p>If Colby had a problem he needed to hash out, he usually talked to Trevor, not Edgard. But as Colby had an insanely crazy jealous streak thinking about Trevor and Channing together\u2014when Trevor was, oh, fucking gay\u2014maybe it was obvious he was going off the deep end where that little spitfire was concerned.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened was I was a total dickhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo apologize to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that will be enough. Fuck. I\u2019m not good at this kind of shit. I never know what the hell I\u2019m supposed to do. Or say. No wonder I\u2019m still single.\u201d Gritting his teeth against the pain, he sat up. Talking it out never solved a goddamned thing. He changed the subject. \u201cWhere were you last night anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the phone. My mother called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Brazil? Something serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Evidently, there are some problems at my ranch in the last month. The foreman wouldn\u2019t let her in when she drove up there to check on things. When he finally granted her access, she said at least fifty people are living around the main ranch house. They\u2019ve butchered my cattle for food. Chopped down trees for firewood. Built some shanties...it\u2019s a big mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, man. I\u2019m sorry. What are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo home. I should leave today.\u201d Edgard hopped down from the bench seat and began to pace. \u201cTrevor has his heart set on competing in Cheyenne at Frontier Days. I can\u2019t just leave him high and dry. He needs me.\u201d He expelled a bitter laugh. \u201cThat might be a first for him.\u201d</p><p>Colby swung his legs to the ladder. \u201cThe preliminaries are in two days. There are at least four other heelers who could work with him, Ed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he\u2019s superstitious. He wants me as his heeler because we did so well in Cheyenne last year. Problem is we suck right now. So, as soon as we\u2019re out of the race for the buckle and the money, I\u2019ll be on a plane for Brazil.\u201d</p><p>Colby opened his mouth. Closed it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Trevor know you\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. What he doesn\u2019t know is once I\u2019m back home, I ain\u2019t comin\u2019</p><p>back here. He\u2019s welcome to come with me. Or he can stay here. His choice.\u201d Edgard looked at Colby. \u201cAll I know is I can\u2019t do this anymore.</p><p>Trevor can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d</p><p>A heavy silence weighted the air.</p><p>Colby scratched his chin. \u201cI wish I knew what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 to say. Love sucks all around, amigo.\u201d On his way out, Edgard stopped at the door and turned back. \u201cPiece of advice. Don\u2019t blow this thing with Channing. Don\u2019t hide how you feel about her.</p><p>Because some of us don\u2019t get that choice.\u201d</p><p>Colby had nothing to say to that either. And he only had half an hour before he had to show up, pretend he wasn\u2019t beat to shit, confused as hell, and act ready to rodeo.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Gemma, I\u2019m never gonna get this!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh hush, Channing. You\u2019re doing fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did it take you to learn to tie quick release knots?\u201d</p><p>Gemma grinned. \u201cI learned when I was five, so I\u2019ve been doing it a long time. Come on. Let\u2019s get this tack hung up. I need to check on my stock before the rodeo starts.\u201d</p> <p>Channing looped the nylon rope over her shoulder, picked up the saddle and blanket and followed Gemma into the back of the horse trailer. \u201cThanks for letting me shower here this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle cramped in Trevor\u2019s rig with you and them three big cowboys, huh?\u201d</p><p>No, it was a little uncomfortable after what\u2019d happened last night\u2014whatever the hell it\u2019d been. She wasn\u2019t exactly sure. And she\u2019d had no desire to face Colby this morning, at least until she had her wits about her. Or if she figured out what\u2019d gone on. She sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna tell me what\u2019s eating at you, girl?\u201d</p><p>Channing didn\u2019t answer.</p> <p>\u201cWell, something\u2019s literally been eating at you. Does Colby know he left them big hickeys all over your neck? And streaks of razor burn? Did he try to bite your lips off, too? Cause your mouth is swollen.\u201d Gemma placed a hand on Channing\u2019s arm. \u201cOh, honey. How rough did he get on you last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for your concern, Gem, but it was entirely mutual.\u201d She sighed again. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later. Not right now. I need to think on it for a while longer, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing. You know where to find me.\u201d</p><p>Channing threaded the rope over the metal holders, keeping her eyes focused on her task. \u201cThank you for the riding lessons and...\u201d Just say it.</p><p>\u201cFor hanging out with me. I guess it\u2019s obvious I don\u2019t have many friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere or at home?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She traced the frayed end of the cotton flank strap with her fingertip.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019d rather be alone and be happy with my own company than be somebody I\u2019m not so I can fit in with people whose company I despise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis a realization you\u2019ve come to recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. Well, that\u2019s not true. I\u2019ve felt that way from the time I was old enough to realize I never fit in any place my parents took me. Or sent me. My sister always stood out so I just stayed in the background. I tried to blend so no one noticed how out of place I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen like me, you\u2019re better off alone. If them kinda folks you were living around can\u2019t see you\u2019re the genuine article, then screw \u2018em. The way I see it, at least horses and cows appreciate all you do for them everyday. And they sure as shit don\u2019t talk about you behind your back.\u201d</p><p>Channing laughed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a quart low on girlfriends myself, Channing. Steve\u2019s friends\u2019</p><p>wives were way older than me. He and I weren\u2019t blessed with kids. I basically disowned my family. Frankly, since Steve was my best friend practically all my life I didn\u2019t need anyone else.\u201d</p><p>The clank of D-rings against the metal barrier filled the silence.</p><p>Gemma grunted and slapped her hands on her jeans. A cloud of dust rose up. \u201cWell, that was downright sappy. And we ain\u2019t even drinkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Channing, lifted her brows and smirked. \u201cYet.\u201d</p><p>They parted ways. Gemma went to check on her small group of steers and her stock foreman behind the chutes and Channing headed to the main entrance to pick up her a ticket at the box office.</p><p>In the family area, Callie stood and waved her over. It made her feel ridiculously happy they\u2019d saved her a seat.</p><p>Channing hefted her bag and slid across the wooden bench, already feeling her muscles getting sore from the horse ride. And from Colby\u2019s hard riding last night. \u201cMorning. How are you guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Callie smiled brightly. \u201cBut momma ain\u2019t feelin\u2019 so good this morning.\u201d</p><p>Mary scowled at her can of 7-Up. \u201cThanks for sharing that with the world, Cal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou whooping it up again last night, Mary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was tucked in bed and sound asleep by nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. That\u2019s too bad. Maybe you\u2019ve got the flu or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr something.\u201d Mary dug out five bucks from the front pocket of her Rockies and passed it to Callie. \u201cSee that lady selling drinks?\u201d Mary pointed to the vendor loitering at the top of the staircase. \u201cPlease get me another soda, and some juice for yourself. But don\u2019t buy nothin\u2019 else, Callie. And come right back here when you\u2019re done. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Momma.\u201d</p><p>The second Callie disappeared Mary leaned closer. \u201cIt\u2019s not the flu.</p><p>I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Channing didn\u2019t know what else to say. Was Mary was thrilled about the pregnancy?</p><p>\u201cMe and Mike have been trying to have another baby for a while. A couple of years actually. It just didn\u2019t seem like it ever was gonna happen. Looks like it did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations. Does Mike know?\u201d</p><p>Mary smiled. \u201cI told him right after I barfed up breakfast again and decided to pee on the stick. That man\u2019s got a shit-eatin\u2019 grin on his face a mile wide. We haven\u2019t told Callie yet. The girl can\u2019t keep a secret to save her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is only four, Mary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>The saddle bronc competition started. Channing held her breath when Colby\u2019s name was called. He bucked off within three seconds. She scrutinized him as he sauntered off the dirt, putting on a macho show for everyone, acting like he was just fine.</p><p>Damn foolish man.</p><p>An hour later Cash and Edgard posted good times in the calf roping.</p><p>Colby didn\u2019t fare so well. He ended up with no time. He hadn\u2019t even made it off his horse.</p><p>A sick feeling settled in the pit of Channing\u2019s stomach. Colby wasn\u2019t fine. She had no choice but to sit in the stands for a few more hours, fretting. Luckily, Callie\u2019s constant chatter distracted her.</p><p>The steer wrestling competition began. Mike Morgan was scheduled second. Mary and Callie yelled advice from the stands as the steer raced out.</p><p>It happened so fast Channing nearly missed it. Mike threw himself at the steer as the animal reversed direction and came right at him. Man and beast ended up in a dusty pile in the middle of the arena with Mike on the bottom. Dazed, the steer wobbled to its hooves and bounced toward the gate. The bulldogger didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Mary stood up. \u201cOmigod. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMomma? Why\u2019s Daddy layin\u2019 on the ground?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh, baby. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Two officials trotted out and crouched down beside Mike. After a discussion, one of the guys gestured for another official. Another discussion. He in turn signaled for the sports medicine team.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell is taking so long?\u201d Mary said.</p><p>They all watched in horror as a stretcher was hauled out.</p><p>Mary swayed forward over the railing and Channing caught her.</p><p>\u201cHey. Take a deep breath, Mary. Don\u2019t pass out on me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and breathed deeply, squeezing Channing\u2019s hand until Channing lost all feeling in it.</p><p>They carried Mike away to a smattering of applause and the announcer\u2019s assurance that updates on Mike Morgan\u2019s condition would be made available as soon as possible.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d Mary said. \u201cI have to see if he\u2019s okay. Oh God. What if he\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMomma?\u201d</p><p>Mary looked at her daughter, torn in two directions. \u201cMaybe it\u2019d be best if she didn\u2019t come with until I know more\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go on, Mary. Callie and I will stay right here. Hanging out.</p><p>Eating junk food. Checking out all the vendors to see what new trinkets they\u2019re selling today, won\u2019t we, Cal? You go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>Mary sprinted up the stairs two at a time.</p><p>The minute her mother was gone stoic Callie started to cry.</p><p>Channing pulled the little girl on her lap and let her bawl. Several of the other wives and girlfriends came over to offer help, but Callie wanted nothing to do with any of them.</p><p>Not once during the hour that passed did Callie beg for cheap toys.</p><p>Or sugar-laden snacks. Nor did she demand to know where her mother was. Or if her father was all right. Or why they couldn\u2019t leave. She just curled into Channing and clung to her like a scared monkey.</p><p>\u201cChanning!\u201d</p><p>She spun around to see Colby limping down the bleacher stairs.</p><p>\u201cColby? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary Morgan sent me.\u201d</p><p>Channing couldn\u2019t read in his eyes whether it was good or bad news.</p><p>\u201cShe wants you to bring Callie to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She looked down in Callie\u2019s frightened eyes and tried to gently pry her arms from around her neck. \u201cHey, Calamity Jane. Gather up your stuff. Let\u2019s go see your mom.\u201d</p><p>But Callie wouldn\u2019t let go. Finally, Channing just carried her out.</p><p>Colby led them through a cordoned-off area to a small, airless room underneath the main grandstand. Inside, Mary hovered next to Mike, who was awake but on a stretcher with his knee heavily bandaged and his wrist in a sling.</p><p>Callie squirmed out of Channing\u2019s arms and launched herself at Mary, sobbing, \u201cMomma you didn\u2019t come back and didn\u2019t come back and I thought my daddy was dead!\u201d</p><p>Channing felt like she\u2019d been kicked in the solar plexus. That poor little girl. Acting so brave when she\u2019d been torn up inside. How many other rodeo kids went through this on a regular basis? How many wives and girlfriends and mothers and fathers? How did they deal with it, day in, day out? Year after year?</p><p>\u201cOh, baby. It\u2019s okay. See? He\u2019s not dead. Just banged up.\u201d</p><p>Groggily, Mike Morgan said, \u201cHiya, punkin. Didja see me wreck? I think we oughta buy that steer and grind him into hamburger, huh?\u201d</p><p>Mary stepped around the end of the stretcher. \u201cChanning. Thank you so much for watching Callie.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo problem. Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll know more tomorrow. As it sits now, Mike has a torn ACL</p><p>that\u2019s gonna require surgery. We\u2019re heading off to Omaha in a little bit for X-rays and tests. And probably a trip to the operating room.\u201d</p> <p>It sounded so serious. So permanent. Everyone knew\u2014but nobody said out loud, that this could be a career-ending injury for Mike Morgan.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>Mary bit her lip. \u201cI haven\u2019t really thought it through until now, but it\u2019s occurred to me we can\u2019t take the horse and the horse trailer along with us to Omaha.\u201d</p><p>Colby moved in behind Channing. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Mary. Take care of your family. We\u2019ll get your horse and trailer back to your ranch somehow.\u201d</p><p>Relief crossed her face and she hugged Colby. \u201cOh thank you. You guys are our family, too. I\u2019ll get the truck unhitched and get the trailer keys. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She leaned over to whisper to Mike before she and Callie hustled out.</p> <p>Channing whirled around right into Colby, hovering behind her. She frowned. \u201cWhy are you still here? Aren\u2019t you going to help Mary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019d just get in the way. Besides, Mary has hitched up that trailer more times than any guy on the circuit.\u201d</p><p>She rocked to her tiptoes and got right in his face. \u201cYeah, but unlike most guys, she is pregnant. And I don\u2019t think hefting that hitch in her condition is the best idea, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d He vanished.</p><p>Outside the contestants\u2019 gate she heard the announcement for the start of the barrel racing and saw Gemma and Cash arguing.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and I\u2019m tellin\u2019 you, it ain\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow so? That was my bum steer, Cash. And I\u2019ll be goddamned if I\u2019ll sit here and do nothin\u2019 when I could be helping them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, guys,\u201d Channing interrupted. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Cash\u2019s handsome face was distorted into a full scowl. \u201cThe problem is that Wonder Woman here feels guilty and thinks she needs to take the Morgan\u2019s horse and trailer back to South Dakota. By herself.\u201d</p><p>A heated pause sparked the air like fireworks.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re just worried about her going alone, I could go with her,\u201d</p><p>Channing offered.</p><p>Gemma awarded Cash a smug smile. \u201cSee? Problem solved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for one tiny detail. You don\u2019t have your big horse haulin\u2019</p> <p>truck here, Gem. Your foreman needs the big diesel to pull the trailer for the stock. There\u2019s no way you can pull that monster rig of Morgan\u2019s with your small block Ford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have a big enough one?\u201d</p><p>Cash grinned slowly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll knock that grin clean off your face, Cash Big Crow, if you don\u2019t get rid of it right now.\u201d</p><p>His smile didn\u2019t dim one iota.</p><p>\u201cFine. Yours is bigger. I doubt you\u2019ll let me touch it. So are you volunteering to drive your big, bad machine to Buffalo Gap? That mean you\u2019re just gonna abandon your horse and trailer here? For at least a day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I hadn\u2019t thought it through that far.\u201d</p><p>Trevor sauntered over. \u201cWhat\u2019s the commotion?\u201d</p><p>While Cash and Gemma stared at each other, Channing gave Trevor a brief rundown.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. Hook up Cash\u2019s truck to the Morgan\u2019s trailer and take Mike\u2019s horses to their ranch. Then you two will turn around, come back here and pick up Cash\u2019s empty horse trailer on your way to Cheyenne. Because I will have driven Gemma\u2019s rig, loaded with both of your horses to Cheyenne.\u201d</p><p>They looked at each other. Cash shrugged. \u201cWorks for me.\u201d</p><p>Gemma snapped off, \u201cFine. But if you wreck my truck, Trevor Glanzer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ride along with him and make sure he obeys all traffic laws,\u201d</p><p>Channing said. \u201cThen I\u2019ll watch your trailer until you get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Let\u2019s get everything loaded up.\u201d</p><p>Trevor caught Channing\u2019s arm. \u201cWhy are you doin\u2019 this? Wouldn\u2019t you rather ride with Colby in my truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetween you and me? No. I need some time to clear my head.\u201d When Trevor balked, she added, \u201cYour part in last night\u2019s festivities had nothing to do with it, okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI sure understand needin\u2019 some time to clear away the cobwebs. I\u2019ll pass the information on the change in plans to Edgard. He can help Colby with our horses. Unless you\u2019d rather tell Colby yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I know he still has the bull-riding event to get through. But I\u2019d like to get out of here as soon as possible because he\u2019s liable to make a big scene.\u201d</p><p>Or worse, Colby might not care at all that she was gone.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Cheyenne, Wyoming, was all abuzz for Frontier Days, for the \u201cDaddy of \u2018em All\u201d, one of the oldest rodeos in the country. During the ten-day run, four hundred thousand people visited the town, which had a population of fifty thousand on a good day.</p><p>For the first time on this journey, Channing had time to gaze out the window and take in the scenery. As she and Trevor drove across the Sandhills of Nebraska, she marveled at the endless space of the Wild West. Big, blue sky. Sagebrush and groves of squat, twisted trees. The rocky buttes and the clean, dry air. Wyoming was just as rugged as she\u2019d imagined. She wondered if Colby\u2019s ranch looked anything like this slice of heaven.</p><p>Trevor checked them into Gemma\u2019s assigned spot and began the feeding and exercising process for the horses. He didn\u2019t turn down Channing\u2019s offer of help. She was pleased about how much she\u2019d remembered from following Gemma around while she\u2019d done chores.</p><p>Even Trevor didn\u2019t tease her too much about being a greenhorn.</p><p>Gemma\u2019s campsite was on the other end of town from where Trevor and Colby had reservations. Channing was beginning to think she should crash with Gemma. Motel rooms were booked solid around Cheyenne for fifty miles. All four of them bunking in the horse trailer would be just a little too close for comfort on more levels than she could name.</p><p>Plus, she liked Gemma. Not only did they have fun together, Channing knew she could talk to Gemma about anything and Gemma wouldn\u2019t pass judgment. It was heartening because she\u2019d never connected with anyone so quickly.</p><p>Except for Colby.</p><p>Damn. Why did everything always come back around to that man?</p><p>Because you\u2019re crazy in love him.</p><p>No. That wasn\u2019t it. What she felt for Colby was lust, plain and simple.</p><p>Maybe a little trust. So he made her feel safe. He made her laugh. He made her twist and writhe with pleasure. He also made her mad enough to spit nails. Still, he had a silly, sweet side as well as a domineering side that was hot as hell.</p><p>Before Channing began checking off his fabulous physical attributes, she had to face facts: she\u2019d fallen for the cowboy.</p><p>So the question was, what did she do about it? They\u2019d started this... thing with a clear end in sight. She\u2019d known from day one it\u2019d never work out and they\u2019d part company\u2014not only because of the clich\u00e9d differences between a country boy and a city girl.</p><p>Besides, she\u2019d never fantasized that Colby was going to slip a ring on her finger and promise his everlasting devotion. The only thing he was devoted to, near as she could tell, was the rodeo.</p><p>Which brought up another issue. After seeing Colby\u2019s injuries, and then Mike\u2019s arena crash, she didn\u2019t know if she could stomach Colby getting beat to crap on a regular basis. Year in, year out. He might not keep aiming for the upper tier in the NFR, but she suspected he\u2019d never give up rodeo for good.</p><p>A soft rap sounded on the door. Her stupid heart skipped. Too soon for Colby to have made it to Cheyenne. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Trevor stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to let you know I got the all clear from Gemma to take her truck tonight. So you\u2019ll be without wheels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo meet my family. They\u2019ve taken some time off from the ranch and they\u2019re in town for a couple of days to watch me compete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. That sounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>His thoughtful gaze caught hers. \u201cDo you want to come along? You could pretend to be my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I want to do that?\u201d Other than fact Trevor wouldn\u2019t want his family to know about his boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cIf it comes up, it\u2019d explain why you\u2019re traveling with us. Rodeo is a small world, Chan.\u201d He looked away, a bit sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Colby\u2019s family is gonna be around, too?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, not entirely sure she wanted to hear what he was about to tell her.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll warn you not to get your hopes up that he\u2019s gonna introduce you to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d slipped out before she could bite it back.</p><p>He rubbed the furrow between his eyebrows. \u201cHonestly? Because you ain\u2019t the type of girl that Carson McKay wants his son to get involved with. He\u2019s already havin\u2019 to deal with Colby\u2019s older brother, Cord, and that mess. He\u2019d hit the barn roof if he found out Colby was doin\u2019 the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t Colby mentioned his family problems to her? They\u2019d only talked in generalities. Now that she thought about it, she\u2019d mostly talked about her life. \u201cWhat mess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCord married a gal from Seattle. Marla, his ex-wife now, thought she wanted to be married to a real rancher. Live out west. When she found out bein\u2019 a rancher\u2019s wife was lots of hard work and not horse rides at sunset like in them romance novels, she kept threatening to return to the big city. She lasted two years. About six months ago she followed through with the threats and left Cord with their year-old son, Ky. Cord\u2019s been pretty messed up by the whole situation, which is why this is Colby\u2019s last chance on the circuit.</p><p>\u201cSo, we all know this gig with Colby is temporary, Chan. Colby ain\u2019t gonna risk upsettin\u2019 his dad by introducin\u2019 you, when not only are you a city girl, you won\u2019t be around much longer anyway.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trevor knocked any hope right out of her. \u201cWell, that puts things in perspective. I appreciate you telling me the truth. But I\u2019ll still pass on acting the part of your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. I\u2019ll hold down the fort until Gemma shows up. And if I get bored with my own company, I\u2019ll wander around. You don\u2019t have to baby-sit me.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled sadly and chucked her under the chin. \u201cYou make it sound like bein\u2019 with you is a chore, Channing.\u201d</p><p>They looked at each other for the longest time before Trevor slanted his mouth over hers and kissed her. Sweetly. It was probably meant to be a friendly peck. A show of comfort. Immediately, it morphed into heat and need.</p><p>Amidst twisting tongues and relaxed touches, the greedy part of her brain reminded her that this is what she signed on for\u2014mindless, down and dirty sex, not love. Or the illusion of love.</p><p>Unlike Colby, Trevor hadn\u2019t alluded to the idea there was more between them than a hot, uninhibited coupling whenever the mood struck them.</p><p>While Channing kissed Trevor, she unbuckled his belt, then loosened his Wranglers. Sliding her hand inside that tight denim she found him firm and ready.</p> <p>\u201cHang on.\u201d Trevor edged back and toed off his boots. He shucked his jeans and the rest of his clothes.</p><p>Channing marveled at his nude body. Ripped muscles. Smooth skin punctuated in spots by white and pink scars, large and small. She trailed her fingers over his defined pecs then to the little strip of hair arrowing the center of his torso, watching his cock jump when she lightly drew her fingertips from hipbone to hipbone. \u201cYou are a beautiful man, Trevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, darlin\u2019, but as I\u2019m standin\u2019 here buck-ass naked except for my hat, we gotta do something about all them clothes you\u2019re wearin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Trevor unbuttoned Channing\u2019s shirt, leaving kisses along every inch of skin he exposed an inch at a time. Her blouse fluttered to the floor.</p><p>He cupped both big breasts in his hands and suckled her nipples through her sheer bra. The combination of his wet, hot mouth on the silky material and his razor-stubbled cheek rubbing on the upper swell of her breast dampened her thighs with want.</p><p>And made her feel unbelievably guilty. She arched away from him.</p> <p>\u201cTrevor. Stop. I-I can\u2019t... We can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Neither of them said anything as they dressed in awkward silence.</p><p>She knew she\u2019d never be with Trevor again, and the relief she felt surprised her.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he murmured finally.</p><p>\u201cNo. Why do I feel like I was about to cheat on Colby?\u201d</p><p>Trevor sighed. \u201cI suspect for the same reason Edgard makes me feel like that after he knows I\u2019ve been with a woman. Guilt is something new to me. It ain\u2019t like I haven\u2019t ever hid that from him I still like women. Nor did I promise that I\u2019d quit fucking them.\u201d</p><p>They hadn\u2019t talked about Edgard at all on the trip from Valentine.</p><p>\u201cHow did you end up with Edgard?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFunny thing is, I heard that phrase turned gay and never understood what it meant. My whole life I never looked at another man that way. Touched a man that way. Wanted a man to do the same to me.</p><p>Doing things to me I\u2019d thought were wrong.\u201d His hand stopped. \u201cLord.</p><p>Then I met Edgard and shit. Something about him turned me upside down. Turned me loose and turned me on.</p><p>\u201cAt first he was reluctant to be with me because I wasn\u2019t gay. I\u2019d never been with a man. But after we were together a couple of times, I couldn\u2019t stay away from him. I couldn\u2019t get enough. It\u2019s like he\u2019s a goddamn drug. I ain\u2019t been with no other guys. It wasn\u2019t like he flipped a switch in me or anything. It\u2019s just him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t matter if I do or not. Kinda like you and Colby. Things you can\u2019t control will keep you from bein\u2019 together. Makes me sick to my stomach. I guess that\u2019s why they call it lovesick, huh?\u201d</p><p>She knew what it felt like to be a lovesick fool, too.</p><p>He tipped her chin up, cradling her face in his hands. \u201cThank you, Channing. Not only for...everything we\u2019ve done, but for bein\u2019 a friend. It means a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything call my cell.\u201d Trevor peered at her. \u201cYou do realize that Colby and Edgard will roll into Cheyenne late tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why it\u2019ll be better for me to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Her fake cheer disappeared the second the door closed.</p><p>Channing\u2019s sexual fling was over. Time to quit running from her problems. If she\u2019d learned nothing else on this trip, she\u2019d discovered she did have a backbone. From now on she\u2019d live her life on her own terms and woe to anyone who tried to stop her.</p><p>She flipped open her cell phone. Scrolled down until she found the number she wanted and hit dial. Seven rings later the answering machine kicked on.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom. Hi, Dad. I just wanted to let you know to go ahead and RSVP yes to Melinda\u2019s wedding reception invitation. I\u2019ll be back in town soon. I\u2019ll call when I have more details as to when. Good-bye.\u201d</p><p>Channing slept surprisingly well for being in another strange town and at a strange new place in her life.</p><p>When Gemma returned the next afternoon, after she checked on Daisy, she stalked into the living quarters in the horse trailer and went straight for the booze. She flopped in the small easy chair, knocked back a can of beer and sighed. She seemed to notice Channing for the first time. \u201cOh. Hey.\u201d</p><p>Channing said, \u201cHey yourself. Bad day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything went okay getting the Morgans\u2019 horses back?\u201d</p><p>Gemma scowled. \u201cUnloading the horses and the trailer was the easiest part. It was the drive that was the worst. I\u2019m tired and strung as tight as a new barbwire fence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Didn\u2019t you and Cash trade off driving duties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But that ain\u2019t what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d She pointed a finger at Channing. \u201cDon\u2019t get me started on that man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Gemma took a big swig of beer and blurted out, \u201cHe made a pass at me! He waited until I had my hands full of blankets and tack and then he pushed me against the trailer and kissed me like a crazy man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Channing hid a smile. \u201cSo it was that bad, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no. That man surely knows how to kiss. His mouth is like\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her embarrassed gaze connected with Channing\u2019s. \u201cIt just shocked the hell out of me. And instead of chalking it up to a fluke or a mistake, he kept jabbering his whole life story to me because I \u2018needed to know about him\u2019 if he and I were gonna get involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him yours?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and snagged two more brews, tossing one to Channing. \u201cNo. It gets worse. Because I told him there was no way he and I would ever get involved. When I pretended I wasn\u2019t listening to him? Then Mr. Smooth started describing all the sexy things he planned to do to me once he got me naked. In detail. In glorious, Technicolor detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn man.\u201d Gemma slurped the beer. \u201cMade me so twitchy when he ran his finger up the outside seam of my jeans, I jerked the steering wheel and we skidded to the shoulder. Before I could catch my breath and chew his ass, he hauled me across his lap, and...\u201d She gazed off into space.</p><p>Channing kicked Gemma\u2019s shin lightly. \u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t. Details, now, Gemma. Vivid details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord. I\u2019m forty-seven years old. This is so embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Spill it.\u201d</p><p>Gemma\u2019s eyes were unfocused. \u201cHe pulled me into his lap and kissed me until I couldn\u2019t breathe. Then we started messing around, touching, more like frantic groping, and things turned really hot and we both got off...with all our clothes on. That hasn\u2019t happened to me since I was seventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying he makes you feel young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying he makes me feel like an old fool, Channing. He also makes me feel guilty as hell.\u201d She rolled the beer can over her forehead.</p><p>\u201cIt felt like I was cheating on my husband.\u201d</p><p>Channing let Gemma regain her composure before she said, \u201cYou can only do what you feel is right, Gem. But you\u2019re neither a fool nor are you old. Didn\u2019t you tell me if you were offered a second chance, you\u2019d take it?\u201d She hesitated. Screw politeness, Gemma would just ask her the question outright. \u201cAre you resisting Cash because he\u2019s Indian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no. That don\u2019t matter a lick to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides the fact I\u2019m a good ten years older than him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t Steve older than you? Why does age matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. Damn. It\u2019s just...scary, okay? I\u2019m set in my ways and I don\u2019t know if I can change. What man wants to deal with that kinda stubborn woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash does, apparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it would appear.\u201d Gemma kicked Channing\u2019s foot. \u201cWhen\u2019d you get so smart, girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not feeling so smart. And let me tell you, I can totally relate to the guilt thing.\u201d Before she chickened out, she blurted out everything that had gone on with her, Colby, Trevor and Edgard, only leaving out Trevor and Edgard\u2019s secret, since it wasn\u2019t hers to tell. She also puzzled out loud on why she felt like she\u2019d been cheating on Colby with Trevor when she\u2019d just kissed Trevor.</p><p>Gemma wasn\u2019t as shocked as Channing thought she would be. \u201cYou know, I kinda wondered if that wasn\u2019t the case with them suddenly picking you up as a new traveling partner. Those boys have a wild reputation.\u201d She waggled her eyebrows. \u201cSo, two men at once, eh? I\u2019ve always wanted to try that.\u201d</p><p>Channing choked and barely stopped beer from coming out her nose. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course, I never could share that little secret fantasy with Steve. To be the focus of the attention of two men? Yeah, sign me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Cash said through the screen door. \u201cI hear voices, you guys in here?\u201d</p><p>Gemma froze. Her panicked gaze flew to Channing\u2019s. Had he been eavesdropping on their conversation?</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Come on in, Cash,\u201d Channing said.</p><p>He sidled in, pausing just inside the door, practically wringing his black Stetson in his rough-skinned hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wonderin\u2019 if you gals were thinkin\u2019 about goin\u2019 to the opening dance tonight?\u201d</p><p>Gemma opened her mouth to object but Channing shot her an arch look. \u201cYes, we are. Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cColby had two tickets and he sent me over here to give \u2018em to you.\u201d</p><p>Channing bit back the urge to ask if Colby had given Cash the two tickets because he didn\u2019t plan on attending tonight with her. \u201cThanks.</p><p>Are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI reckon I\u2019ll pop in for a bit.\u201d Cash stared hard at Gemma. \u201cYou will be dancin\u2019 with me, Gem. Don\u2019t try to hide because I\u2019ll track you down.\u201d</p><p>And he disappeared.</p><p>Gemma said, \u201cShit,\u201d and drained her beer.</p> <p>\u201cWell, looks like our night just got a whole lot more exciting.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Live country music twanged through the speakers. Hundreds of people were talking at once. Four fights had already broken out and he\u2019d spent the last thirty minutes fending off the most persistent buckle bunnies he\u2019d ever met.</p><p>It was only eight o\u2019clock and Colby considered getting really drunk.</p><p>Especially when he looked over at the table where his family held court and the \u201csurprise\u201d his father had brought along.</p><p>A surprise by the name of Amy Jo Foster. The young woman whose family had been neighbors of the McKays for forty years. The young girl his father had stupidly decided might be a good candidate as Colby\u2019s future wife.</p><p>Lord. And Amy Jo was just a girl of nineteen. She\u2019d actually blushed when they\u2019d been talking and his arm had accidentally brushed her breast.</p><p>His little sister Keely didn\u2019t seem too thrilled Amy Jo had been invited to Frontier Days either. Even though Keely and Amy Jo were the same age and lived five miles apart, they\u2019d never been best friends. Keely claimed Amy Jo was a goody-goody\u2014the worst kind of insult hell-on-wheels Keely McKay could level on another person.</p> <p>Colby studied his mother\u2019s face from beneath his hat brim. Had Carolyn McKay been in on this surprise, too? Probably not. His dad had been browbeating him, claiming Colby needed a good woman to settle him down. His mother had assured Colby he\u2019d want to settle down when he met the right woman.</p><p>His gaze strayed to Amy Jo. It wasn\u2019t like she was ugly as a mud fence. She was pretty in a coltish way. Reed thin, all long arms and legs.</p><p>Long white-blonde hair and a pink complexion, near as he could figure because she blushed all the damn time. Enormous blue eyes the vivid color of the Wyoming sky. When she wore her hair in a pair of pigtail braids, she reminded him of the Swiss Miss Instant Cocoa girl. Or more accurately, her younger sister. Much younger sister.</p><p>Colby sighed and glanced at the clock again. He missed Channing.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t had a chance to talk about his stellar asshole performance from the other night. He\u2019d been too much of a chickenshit to call her cell phone as he\u2019d driven Trevor\u2019s rig to Cheyenne last night. Some things had to be done in person. Especially apologies. Then last night after they\u2019d pulled into the campground at the opposite end of town from Frontier Park, they had to set up, take care of the horses and, by the time he and Edgard finished, it\u2019d been damn near two in the morning.</p><p>Too late to call her. This morning he had to register for his events, pay his fees and he\u2019d spent the afternoon with his family, leaving no time for him to wander over to Gemma\u2019s campsite.</p><p>So...maybe if he played his cards right tonight, they could sneak outside and kiss and make up. Then he could get up the gumption to tell her all the things that\u2019d been weighing on him before she left him for good.</p><p>\u201cHey, cowboy. Buy me a drink?\u201d</p><p>Colby turned slightly. Yep. Another buckle bunny trying her luck. He shrugged and didn\u2019t respond, hoping she\u2019d get the hint.</p><p>She didn\u2019t. Long scarlet nails inched up his shirt. She crowded in so he was enveloped in silicone, rhinestones and a cloud of perfume.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019d rather dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019d like to get your paw offa him or I\u2019ll bust it off, starting with those ugly fake claws,\u201d a striking brunette said as she wrapped her arm around Colby\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cRun along, little girl,\u201d the bunny hissed.</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019,\u201d she cooed sweetly to Colby, \u201cyou want this washed up old hag, or would you rather have a young hottie like me rockin\u2019 your horse trailer?\u201d</p><p>Colby tried not to laugh as he dropped a kiss on her temple. \u201cI\u2019ll take you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>The buckle bunny spun on her ugly high-heeled boots the color of raspberry Kool-Aid and disappeared into the crowd.</p><p>Colby looked down at his sister and grinned. \u201cThanks, Keely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Although it totally creeps me out to have to ask you this. Are they always all over you like flies on shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice visual,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cBut yeah, pretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude. That sucks.\u201d Her face brightened. \u201cHey, maybe there\u2019s a way you could keep them away tonight. Pretend you\u2019re madly in love with Amy Jo. Dance with her. Sit with her. Hold her hand and stare into her eyes. Normal nice, boring courtin\u2019 shit that\u2019d make me gag. But I know she\u2019d totally go for it.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s steely blue eyes were a bit too gleeful. \u201cAnd this would be solely for my benefit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d She ducked out of his embrace. \u201cOoh. I\u2019m bailing before that hot bull fighter I\u2019m chasing thinks I really am with you.\u201d Keely shuddered. \u201cLater, bro.\u201d</p><p>Colby watched his sister saunter off and the trail of young bucks hot on her heels. Keely McKay was smart as a whip, as beautiful and unrefined as a wild horse, and held a razor sharp tongue that\u2019d stripped the skin off of more than one unlucky cowboy. With an independent streak as wide as her stubborn streak, she considered raisin\u2019 hell her God-given right. Woe to the man who wound up trying to tame her and win her heart.</p><p>What would Channing\u2019s family say about their daughter? Did they even know her heart? Her wild streak? Her secret desire to be tamed and inflamed?</p><p>As Colby made his way back to his family table, he ran into Trevor, who appeared eager to get away from his own family. \u201cWhere you goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the bar. And if I don\u2019t come back, don\u2019t tell them where I went, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Have you seen Channing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. No.\u201d</p><p>Panicked, he grabbed Trevor\u2019s arm. \u201cSomething happened to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Trevor dropped his gaze. \u201cI just haven\u2019t seen her since last night.\u201d</p><p>Colby recognized his guilty expression. Jealousy roared through him like a raging forest fire. \u201cYou son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you fuck her when you saw her last night?\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s stubborn chin rose a notch. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>Somehow he\u2019d expected Trevor to deny it. Or Colby had hoped that Channing knew he\u2019d been serious about his threat that no other man touched her besides him. \u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019ve got to say to me is so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? Isn\u2019t that why she\u2019s travelin\u2019 with us? For a little variety?\u201d</p><p>Colby loomed over his friend and growled, \u201cI am gonna kick your sorry faggot ass right fucking now.\u201d</p><p>Trevor didn\u2019t back down. In fact, he stepped up. \u201cBack off, McKay.</p><p>I\u2019m warnin\u2019 you. I\u2019m in a piss-poor mood, half-drunk and rarin\u2019 to beat on someone. Since you\u2019re in my face it can just as easily be you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou prepared to bleed for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably more than you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you the one who told me you wouldn\u2019t be jealous if Channing and I spent time alone together? And now you are? Since when do you think you have the right to freak out about anything concernin\u2019 her?</p><p>Especially when we both know the minute Channing shows up here tonight you\u2019re gonna pretend you don\u2019t even know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLow blow, Trev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, nothin\u2019 happened between me and Channing last night anyway. Not that it matters. You and I are both good at lyin\u2019 to ourselves and neither of us is in a position to be makin\u2019 promises to no one. Our families have pretty much seen to that, ain\u2019t they?\u201d He angled his hat toward the McKay table. \u201cIs Amy Jo the one your dad picked for you?\u201d</p><p>Colby was livid and snapped off the first thing that came to his mind.</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t none of your business.\u201d He turned and walked it off.</p><p>He hated this whole situation, mostly because he hated that Trevor was exactly right.</p><p>Or were he and Trevor both wrong? If they couldn\u2019t make changes in their own lives, who could?</p><p>When Colby reached the table, he granted Amy Jo a big smile and offered his hand to her. \u201cHow about if you and me dance? There\u2019s a couple of things I\u2019d like to talk to you about.\u201d</p><p>Channing and Gemma had fortified themselves with a little liquid courage before they headed to the big dancehall blowout. Luckily, their campsite was within walking distance of the building, so if they knocked back too much beer, they\u2019d have no problem stumbling back to the horse trailer.</p><p>Seemed everyone in Cheyenne had shown up. The place was loud and crowded. The tables were all full. Boots stomped. Shiny shirts and belts sparkled. Laughter rang out. Booze flowed.</p><p>Gemma knew tons of people and introduced her to everyone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Channing felt herself retreating. Becoming quietly observant as she faded into the background.</p><p>They\u2019d found a tall table to stand beside and a round of fresh beers had miraculously appeared. Gemma talked loudly over the music and conversations. \u201cOpening night of \u2018The Daddy of \u2018em All\u2019. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Two cowboys went skidding past on the sawdust floor, fists and hats flying until some brave soul stepped in and broke it up and made them take it outside.</p> <p>Before Channing could answer, a brunette placed her hands over Gemma\u2019s eyes from behind and growled, \u201cGuess who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustin McBride?\u201d Pause. \u201cKeith Urban?\u201d Another pause. \u201cIs it...Keely McKay?\u201d Keely squealed and Gemma whirled around to squeeze the girl a big hug.</p><p>Even if Channing hadn\u2019t heard the familiar last name, the family resemblance would\u2019ve tipped her off. This dazzling, dark-haired woman with eyes the color of sapphires and big dimples was the spitting image of Colby\u2014in petite, feminine form.</p><p>\u201cChanning? This is Keely McKay, Colby\u2019s baby sister.\u201d</p><p>Keely shook Channing\u2019s hand. \u201cBaby sister. Everyone treats me like I\u2019m twelve. I\u2019m almost twenty-one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be twenty-one in another two years,\u201d Gemma corrected, and knocked Keely\u2019s hand away from her beer. \u201cAnyway, what\u2019re you up to besides no good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came down with Mom and Dad to watch Colby compete.\u201d She grinned saucily. \u201cAnd to find a bad cowboy who wants to lead me astray.</p><p>Can you introduce me to one or ten to save me some time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Doesn\u2019t Daddy keep an eagle eye on you, since you\u2019ve been known to get into a fair amount of trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Keely\u2019s smile vanished. \u201cAn eagle eye in the form of Amy Jo Foster. We\u2019re sharing a room, which means I have to be very quiet if I want to sneak out at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Amy Jo doing here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDaddy\u2019s attempt at matchmaking.\u201d</p><p>Gemma glanced at Channing and then away quickly. Channing knew something was up. She didn\u2019t dare ask, because she was more than a little afraid of the answer.</p><p>\u201cPlus, she\u2019s keeping the buckle bunnies away from him.\u201d Her blue eyes widened. \u201cShit, here comes Daddy. You didn\u2019t see me,\u201d she said and squatted down, before she scooted away, ducking through the throng of people until she vanished in the crowd.</p><p>A tall, sturdy man sauntered over. He looked to be around sixty, ruggedly handsome with a square jaw, high cheekbones, those familiar compelling blue eyes. Dark hair beneath his cream-colored cowboy hat.</p><p>He flicked a quick glance at Channing and focused his attention on Gemma. \u201cWhere\u2019d the wild child go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, whoever do you mean?\u201d Gemma asked innocently.</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cIf you see Keely again, tell her I\u2019m lookin\u2019 for her.</p><p>I\u2019ve survived raisin\u2019 five rough and rowdy sons. That one little girl is gonna give me heart failure yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey say what goes around, comes around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer mama and me weren\u2019t ever that wild.\u201d</p><p>Gemma lifted a brow. \u201cIf you say so. Carson, this is my friend Channing Kinkaid.\u201d</p><p>Carson tipped his hat. \u201cNice to meetcha, Miz Kinkaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019re you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMassachusetts.\u201d Right then, Channing knew she couldn\u2019t be more ostracized than if she\u2019d answered Mars.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Carson said.</p><p>A moment of forced silence.</p><p>\u201cChanning is also friends with Colby,\u201d Gemma added.</p><p>Carson\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>Sweat dripped down her spine in the wake of Carson McKay\u2019s accusing stare. She waited for him to quiz her.</p><p>But he decided to ignore her. He and Gemma started dishing dirt on other rough stock contractors. Channing\u2019s feet itched to make tracks for the door. They\u2019d only been here an hour and she was ready to leave.</p><p>A minute later firm male hands landed on her hips. \u201cDance with me.\u201d</p><p>She turned and Trevor tugged her away from the table to the dance floor.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much chance to talk as Trevor whirled and twirled her through three fast songs. When the power ballad \u201cYou Look So Good In Love\u201d began, she fully expected they\u2019d exit the dance floor. But Trevor pulled her into arms, keeping her at a respectable distance as they swayed to the beat .</p><p>\u201cAre you havin\u2019 fun?\u201d Trevor asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Bein\u2019 here around my family makes me realize how much I love bein\u2019 on the road.\u201d</p><p>Channing laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t funny. Times like today I am tempted to pack up and move to Brazil.\u201d</p><p>Trevor danced her backward. She looked behind her to make sure she wasn\u2019t about to plow over someone, when across the way she saw Colby, his hands clamped on the ass of a young, willowy blonde whose mannerisms and carriage screamed \u201creal cowgirl\u201d. They did the old bump and grind, oblivious to anything but each other.</p><p>Her breath caught and something inside her broke. Any secret stupid hope that she had about a future with Colby McKay evaporated like smoke.</p><p>Trevor noticed she\u2019d gone rigid. He peered over her shoulder to the couple dirty dancing and froze. He whispered, \u201cAh hell. I\u2019m so sorry, Chan.\u201d</p><p>Breathe. She remembered Keely\u2019s matchmaking comment. \u201cIs she the one his dad brought here?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\u201cTrevor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Carson brought her. Her family\u2019s ranch borders the McKays\u2019</p><p>and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Channing couldn\u2019t stay on the dance floor, pretending her world hadn\u2019t just crashed around her. When it felt like her heart was being stomped on by dozens of pairs of spiked cowboy boots. She stepped back away from Trevor so fast she stumbled into the couple behind her. Her clumsiness set off a chain reaction, which reached Colby and his new paramour.</p><p>Their eyes met. His registered surprise, then guilt. Hers, she knew, held nothing but desolation.</p><p>Channing fled. She thought she heard someone shout her name but she didn\u2019t stop. She skirted the area where Gemma was fending off Cash and ran straight out the door. She didn\u2019t quit running until she\u2019d arrived at the horse trailer.</p><p>She madly packed the few personal items she\u2019d brought with her. She dialed a cab company to pick her up and take her to the airport. She didn\u2019t care where she escaped to as long as it was far away from here.</p><p>While Channing scrawled a quick note to Gemma, she sucked down a beer. She was totally unprepared for the vicious hammering on the metal trailer door.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re in there, Channing. Open up,\u201d Colby said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t budge. She mouthed go away to him.</p><p>Several more ferocious knocks rattled the whole trailer. \u201cGoddammit.</p><p>Open this fucking door right now or I swear to God I\u2019ll bust it down. And you know I don\u2019t make idle threats.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Seething on the inside, but maintaining an outward calm, she opened the door.</p><p>Colby burst in like an angry bull out of the chute, nostrils flaring, eyes red, his bulky body shaking with rage. He latched on to her upper arms, jerked her against him and smashed his mouth to hers.</p><p>Channing fought him. Kicking, biting, digging her nails into his shirt, trying to claw his heart so she could rip it into shreds like he\u2019d done to hers.</p><p>After she nearly bit his bottom lip, Colby swore, spun her around and braceleted her wrists in his hands behind her back. \u201cKnock it off, you little hellcat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Let me go and get out. I don\u2019t want you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding. Stop manhandling me. Maybe your girlfriend likes it, but I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Instead of releasing her, he tightened his grip and put his mouth right next to her ear, laughing softly with a hint of malice. \u201cShe is not my girlfriend. If you\u2019d give me a goddamn minute to explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about your stupid excuses.\u201d</p><p>Colby hissed, \u201cSure you don\u2019t, shug. That\u2019s why you\u2019re actin\u2019 all jealous like this.\u201d</p><p>Channing twisted her wrists in his rough hands. \u201cI\u2019m acting like this because I\u2019ve got a cab coming any minute. I\u2019m leaving. So let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds good. We\u2019ll take the cab to my motel so we can hash this out in private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have nothing to hash out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong.\u201d</p><p>He wheeled her around and cupped her face between his hands. He settled his mouth over hers, foregoing the earlier brutal kiss and giving her sweetness and tenderness that brought her tears to the surface.</p><p>Damn him. Channing realized she was starved for this man\u2019s touch.</p><p>The way he alternately inflamed and cherished her. The way he instinctively knew which one she needed.</p><p>Yet, her breath hitched in her chest, reminding her of the pain that\u2019d been circling her heart for the last day. She broke the kiss. \u201cColby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me.\u201d He tracked soft kisses up her jawline. \u201cPlease. I missed you, darlin\u2019, something fierce. Stay with me tonight.\u201d Over and over his lips brushed the hair covering her ear as he seemed to breathe her in. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll stick around so we can talk this through, okay?\u201d</p><p>Say no.</p><p>A thick pause hung in the air.</p><p>Finally, she swallowed her pride and whispered, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He hefted her satchel over his left shoulder, grabbed her right hand and they sprinted to the waiting cab.</p><p>Channing paced as she waited for him to unlock the door to the motel room. \u201cHow\u2019d you get a room?\u201d she asked, when she meant \u201cWhy did you get a room I didn\u2019t know about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy folks had an extra reservation because my brother Cord and his family were supposed to come. They gave it to me instead.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>The room wasn\u2019t anything different than the other cheap rooms they\u2019d crashed in for the last week. In the darkness her senses were attuned to sound. The thump of her bag on the carpet. The rattling wheeze of the air conditioner kicking on. The click of the chain as he secured the door. The blood rushing in her ears. The prickle of his beard on her nape as he moved in behind her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later. Right now I need to be inside you before I lose my ever-lovin\u2019 mind. Let me show you how much I missed you.\u201d</p> <p>No. She would not relinquish control to him this soon. She turned and sank to her knees. She had him unbuckled, unzipped and in her mouth before he knew what hit him.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, Channing, that\u2019s not what I wanted... Oh fuck that feels good. Oh, darlin\u2019, just like that. Baby, don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Channing sucked him off, taking her own sweet time to build him to madness. Dangling him over the edge of reason again and again before she relented to his begging whimpers and finished him in her mouth.</p><p>Colby staggered backward and sagged on the bed.</p><p>She escaped to the bathroom. Maybe if she cowered in there long enough he\u2019d fall asleep and she could sneak out because being here was a bad, bad idea.</p> <p>Two seconds later, two raps sounded on the door. \u201cChanning? You okay?\u201d</p><p>Crap. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna hide in there all night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Colby laughed. \u201cWell, as long as I\u2019ve got your undivided attention, let me set you straight on a few things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can turn the water on so I don\u2019t have to hear you,\u201d she said with false syrupiness.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I can break down this cheap-ass door so you\u2019ve got no choice but to listen. You really want that, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Before he could sweet-talk his way around her, Channing blurted, \u201cDid you ask Amy Jo to come to Cheyenne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Why would you ask\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Trevor hinted you told your dad to bring her here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevor was drunk. My dad\u2019s been tryin\u2019 to fix me up with her for the last year. Poor thing is shy and unsure of herself and she needs a little\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle Amy Jo didn\u2019t look so shy and unsure of herself when you two were dirty dancing,\u201d Channing retorted.</p><p>He chuckled again. \u201cAmy Jo asked me to teach her to dance like that because she don\u2019t know how. And it appears she\u2019s already set her cap for some cowboy back home. So she\u2019s tryin\u2019 to shed her wholesome image. I showed her some pointers. Plus, she wanted to rub it in Keely\u2019s face. And my cheeky little sister deserves it after taunting Amy Jo all these years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d What else could she say that didn\u2019t make her sound like a jealous idiot?</p> <p>Silence. Colby sighed. \u201cShug, please come out here.\u201d</p><p>Channing cracked the door an inch and peered a him. \u201cYou left your ropes in the horse trailer, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Just me, just you.\u201d He held out his empty hands. \u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The second she scooted out, he blocked her attempt to dodge him and hugged her spine to his chest.</p><p>She tried to squirm away.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this? I thought you liked me? Now you\u2019re treatin\u2019 me like a leper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still like you. I just don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Colby kissed her crown. \u201cBecause I missed you. Talkin\u2019 to you.</p><p>Touchin\u2019 you. Getting to know you. We\u2019ve had fun learnin' about each other, haven\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean in the biblical sense?\u201d</p><p>He tapped her ass. \u201cNo. I meant in every sense. I want to be with you, Channing. And not just with my dick in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back, allowing his solid warmth to seep into her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved it. But I don\u2019t know why you felt you needed to distract me. I wanted to touch you, too. Lord, I\u2019m achin\u2019 to put my hands on you. But I can wait until you\u2019re ready. And. Ah. It don\u2019t have to be tonight.\u201d</p><p>That shocked her. Wasn\u2019t this thing between them supposed to be about sex?</p><p>Colby whirled her to face him. A hint of hesitation darkened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you comin\u2019 to the afternoon rodeo tomorrow to watch me compete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to but I don\u2019t have a ticket. I\u2019ve heard they\u2019re pretty hard to come by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought one for you today.\u201d He sifted her hair through his hands.</p><p>\u201cYour hair is so soft. You smell so good. Everything about you is soft and warm and sweet.\u201d</p><p>Channing was melting. Giving in.</p><p>\u201cAnd after the rodeo I\u2019ve planned something special for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we get naked for it?\u201d</p><p>Colby scowled. \u201cMaybe I\u2019d like to spend time with you with our clothes on, Chan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be a first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pushin\u2019 your luck, darlin\u2019. I\u2019m tryin\u2019 to be civilized. Givin\u2019 us a chance to talk this out.\u201d</p><p>Channing stood on her tiptoes and licked his neck. \u201cI like you uncivilized and wild. Talk is overrated. I\u2019d rather fuck it out.\u201d</p><p>Another weighty pause. \u201cYour choice. But now that you\u2019ve made it you don\u2019t get to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>Then he was on her. Kissing her, tearing at her clothes. In the blink of an eye she was naked and at his mercy.</p><p>They crashed to the bed in a tangle of arms and legs. Colby crushed her to his chest and rolled with her so she was writhing beneath him.</p><p>He scissored his legs on the outside of hers, immobilizing her lower half. He encircled both her wrists together in his large hand and pinned them above her head.</p><p>Colby\u2019s free hand slid between them. He plunged two fingers inside her wetness. He coated his shaft with her juices, guided his cock to her entrance and drove in.</p><p>Channing groaned. Yes. This is what she wanted, what she understood about this man. The primal need.</p><p>Body to body, forehead to forehead, he thrust into her. Long, hard deep strokes. Not fast, not slow. Just strong and steady and true.</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you ever let me love you like this? Face to face? Heart to heart? So I can look in your eyes while I\u2019m makin\u2019 love to you?\u201d</p><p>Because it\u2019s not lovemaking, it\u2019s just sex.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d</p><p>That you\u2019ll see my feelings for you and cut and run.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Channing Kinkaid.\u201d</p><p>She angled her chin up an inch.</p><p>\u201cWhat I said the other night? I meant it. Maybe it was crudely put instead of poetic, but I meant every damn word.\u201d</p><p>Play it cool, play it dumb. Breezily, she said, \u201cOh. Remind me again what you said. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>A calculating look came into his eyes. \u201cOh I\u2019ll remind you all right.\u201d</p><p>Channing realized she\u2019d made a huge mistake baiting him.</p><p>\u201cI told you that you are mine. You belong to me. Remember now?\u201d He rocked his hips with short, precise thrusts.</p><p>Her body softened for his, yet her mouth remained clamped shut as a rusty well cover.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should repeat it. Then you can say it back to me so I know you understand. And remember.\u201d</p><p>God. He was relentless.</p><p>\u201cSay it. Say you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Channing blinked as he thrust. In. Out. In. Out. In a compelling rhythm as exotic as it was arousingly familiar.</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe he was doing this. Pushing her emotions as he pushed her body to the limit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine. Say it.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, pretending a detachment she didn\u2019t feel.</p><p>No change in his expression. No change in the solid motions of his thrusts. No change or concession in the words he demanded from her.</p><p>\u201cSay you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Channing turned her head away.</p><p>With his chin he forced her face back level to his and peered in her eyes. \u201cGoddammit, Channing. Say it.\u201d</p><p>She watched him warily. Physically, she wasn\u2019t scared of him, but at some point in the last hour, on an emotional level, he\u2019d set out to conquer her. Completely. He wouldn\u2019t be satisfied until he had her total surrender. And she was teetering on the brink of submission.</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>Channing shook her head, wanting to distract him with her hands.</p><p>Her mouth. Anything. But she was totally under his control.</p><p>\u201cSay it. Say you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>She found her voice. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you are mine and you\u2019ll damn well admit it. Say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can. You will. Say you belong only to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Colby. Why are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needed a reminder, remember? Say it.\u201d</p><p>The repetition of his words say it say it was stuck in her head. The repetition of his body plunging in and out of hers stuck her pleasure center like a thousand needles.</p><p>\u201cSay it. Say you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it. I won\u2019t stop fucking you. We\u2019ll be here in this bed, locked together until you admit to me out loud what I see in your eyes, Channing Kinkaid. What I feel in your body whenever I touch you. So say the words to me so I can say them back to you.\u201d</p><p>Was she prepared to give in to him? Especially when he hadn\u2019t clarified if he meant that she belonged to him only for the rest of the night? Or did he mean forever?</p><p>Maybe she should take a chance and find out.</p><p>Channing locked her gaze to his. \u201cI\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>Fire danced in his eyes. He set his jaw and rocked into her harder.</p><p>\u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours.\u201d That tingling pressure for release began to build low in her belly.</p><p>\u201cWhose? Say my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby.\u201d</p><p>Sweat dripped down his temple. \u201cWho do you belong to?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou. Colby McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn right you belong to me.\u201d</p><p>She arched her hips, wordlessly begging for more.</p> <p>Colby fucked her with a ferocity that left her breathless. Helpless.</p><p>Like nothing else that had ever happened to her before that moment mattered. Staring into his heated blue eyes, she saw his determination.</p><p>His need. His discipline of possession. His utter obsession with her. But she didn\u2019t see love.</p><p>\u201cColby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine.\u201d He thrust hard. \u201cMine.\u201d Another pounding thrust that knocked the bed frame into the wall. \u201cOnly mine, Channing. I\u2019ll kill the next man who so much lays a hand on what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p> <p>The orgasm caught her off guard like a summer storm and burst through her with the elemental power of lightning and thunder.</p><p>Colby didn\u2019t yell out his release or miss a stroke as he came silently.</p><p>She felt the hot bursts of semen inside her pussy and then warm liquid seeped out from where they were still joined.</p><p>He simply said, \u201cAgain. Another reminder so you don\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>Colby had taken her at her word; they\u2019d fucked it out. He fucked her until the pleasure was too much, until her body shuddered and quaked, until her brain overloaded on bliss and she passed out in his arms.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p> <p>Channing woke up. Naked. She rolled over and groaned.</p><p>Colby\u2019s side of the bed was rumpled and empty, except for the ticket on the pillow and a note, which read:</p><p>Today, we talk it out. C U after the perf. Love, CWM</p><p>She glanced down her nude body, expecting another set of his marks of passion. She saw none. They were all internal. Mental. But definitely permanent.</p><p>After a quick shower she gathered her stuff and headed for Gemma\u2019s campsite. She opened the door and a swell of heat blasted her. It\u2019d be blistering hot in Cheyenne today.</p><p>As she turned around, Channing bumped into Carson McKay, who wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled to see her sneaking out of Colby\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cUmm. Morning, Mr. McKay.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed to pinpoints. \u201cHey. I know you. You\u2019re that friend of Gemma Jansen. A friend of Colby\u2019s, too.\u201d Carson gave her a once-over.</p> <p>\u201cYou mind tellin\u2019 me what you\u2019re doin\u2019 slinkin\u2019 out of my son\u2019s room?\u201d</p><p>Her first thought was to lie.</p><p>Carson stared her down. Letting his gaze wander to the love bites on her neck Colby had given her that hadn\u2019t faded yet. Judging her.</p><p>Appearing to find her lacking. Just like her own father. Just like everyone else in her old life.</p><p>Her back snapped straight. \u201cYour son invited me into his room. You can ask him what we were doing, but since he\u2019s a gentleman, I doubt he\u2019ll kiss and tell.\u201d</p><p>No response from Colby\u2019s father. Just another cold hard stare.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wastin\u2019 your time with him. I know my son. He ain\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t know your son as well as you think. And if he chooses to waste his time with me, then I don\u2019t see how it is any of your business. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d Somehow she managed to walk away instead of running like a scared rabbit.</p><p>Gemma\u2019s trailer was empty. Channing had a few hours to kill before the rodeo started so she wandered through the vendor stands and the midway. She cruised through the gift shop. Studied the bronze statue of the late Lane Frost for a long time. A reminder that even the best athletes in the world succumbed to forces beyond their control.</p><p>Frontier Park was huge, the biggest outdoor rodeo arena in the world.</p><p>After the Air Force paratroopers sailed in, and the state rodeo queens in attendance were announced, and a barbershop quartet from Riverton belted out \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner\u201d, it was time to rodeo.</p><p>With so many competitors at Frontier Days Rodeo, the individual events were spread out, instead of all the events running one after the other like at other venues. Rough stock riding was interspersed with timed events. Colby ate dirt on his saddle bronc ride. He posted a decent score of 4.5 in tie-down roping. Unlike other rodeos where bull riding was always last, here they were sprinkled throughout the afternoon.</p><p>As she waited, she began to wonder just what his plans were for later. Anticipation made her heart race and she almost missed his name being called.</p><p>The bull, Nobody\u2019s Business, hadn\u2019t been ridden in twelve outs.</p><p>Channing perched on the edge of her seat, expecting a good match up.</p><p>The chute opened to the roar of the crowd. Colby looked spectacular as he rode, synchronized to the bull\u2019s movements like he\u2019d ridden him every day. The buzzer sounded. He\u2019d made it the full eight seconds.</p><p>For some reason instead of watching the first instant replay on the big screens, she kept her gaze on Colby. He\u2019d gotten hung up. Not his hand in his bullrope, but his spur was twisted around the flank strap.</p><p>The bull fighters were trying to get him loose, but the bull hopped and jumped. The next scene seemed to happen in slow motion, Colby\u2019s body sliding under the bull when the bull lunged sideways. Both the bull\u2019s back legs came down on Colby\u2019s left thigh. Then the bull hooked Colby\u2019s vest and tossed him in the air.</p><p>The crowd gasped.</p><p>Channing leapt to her feet.</p><p>Even in the upper tier of the grandstands she could hear one bull fighter screaming for the sports medicine team, while the others chased the bull away. Colby\u2019s leg was bent at an odd angle and he was prone on the dirt.</p><p>A dozen people milled around on the arena floor. It wasn\u2019t long before the far gate opened and an ambulance zoomed in, kicking up dust. Colby was loaded on a stretcher, shuttled in the back end of the ambulance and whisked out amidst wailing sirens and nearly complete silence in the arena.</p><p>Stunned, she just stared at the churned up patches of dirt where Colby had fallen. How long she stayed motionless, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Finally, people behind her yelled, \u201cSit down!\u201d</p><p>She made her deadened body move and she exited the stands in a daze.</p><p>Channing had no idea where they\u2019d taken him. She knew if she tried to sneak back in the contestants\u2019 area without a pass, she\u2019d get escorted out by security. She wandered along the fence\u2014for how long, she didn\u2019t know. Someone shouted her name.</p><p>She whirled around and saw Cash barreling toward her. He grabbed her in a bear hug. \u201cHave you heard anything about what happened to him?\u201d</p><p>Channing shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou saw it, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay. The bull landed on his leg and broke the femur in his left thigh. A bone fragment caused a rupture in his femoral artery. Very serious stuff. I ain\u2019t gonna lie, Channing; it is life threatenin\u2019, so they rushed him to emergency surgery. They also were talkin\u2019 about a collapsed lung where the bull hooked him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOmigod.\u201d She was glad Cash held her upright because her knees gave out.</p><p>\u201cHis family is already gone. I\u2019ll drive you to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>The truth hit her and she began to shake harder. \u201cCash, his family isn\u2019t going to want me there. They don\u2019t even know about me.\u201d</p><p>Cash placed a gentle hand on her cheek. \u201cIt don\u2019t matter if they want you there, Channing. Colby will want you there.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and ducked her head to hide her tears.</p><p>\u201cCash!\u201d</p><p>Gemma ran up, out of breath. \u201cWhat are you doing out here? You\u2019re up in about five minutes. They\u2019re looking for you behind the chutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna have to forfeit this go. I\u2019m driving Channing to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her.\u201d Gemma\u2019s arm circled Channing\u2019s shoulders. \u201cColby would be pissed if you didn\u2019t ride on account of him. So get back there and cover that bull. Meet us there later.\u201d</p><p>Cash nodded and reluctantly trotted off.</p><p>Channing was absolutely numb. She let Gemma lead her into the parking area. The heat from the blacktop nearly scorched her lungs. She didn\u2019t remember anything about the ride to the hospital, as she was too busy praying that Colby would still be alive when she got there.</p><p>Eight excruciating hours later the surgeons gave the news to the family. The doctors had stopped the hemorrhaging, which was their first concern. Then they\u2019d fixed his collapsed lung. After that, they began surgery on his leg and inserted an intramedullary rod down the center of Colby\u2019s thighbone.</p><p>Colby was in intensive care in stable condition. With physical therapy he\u2019d walk again. Even ride a horse. But the doctor\u2019s prognosis for Colby continuing his rodeo career even part-time wasn\u2019t good. Colby had a long road of therapy ahead of him. Months.</p><p>Channing heard all of this information secondhand from Trevor and Edgard. And Gemma. And Cash. She\u2019d hidden herself away in a tiny lounge off the main family waiting area. Not wanting to intrude on the McKays. For her own self-preservation she would not insert herself in a situation already rife with trauma.</p><p>For all those hours Colby was in surgery, she\u2019d paced. Worrying.</p><p>Wondering. When she\u2019d received the news he\u2019d pulled through, she\u2019d curled into a ball and wept. Colby was alive. That was all that mattered.</p><p>\u201cChanning?\u201d</p><p>She looked up when Gemma plopped beside her on the dilapidated loveseat but she couldn\u2019t muster a smile. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been hours. You want something to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019d just throw it up. Thanks, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. That\u2019s fine. How long do you want to stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil I can see him. Let me rephrase that. Until I can see him in private. Without me having to explain who I am to his family.\u201d Not that she knew who she was to Colby.</p><p>His words mine mine mine echoed in her head.</p><p>But what did that mean?</p><p>\u201cYou realize that might not be for a day or two. The McKays have all but circled the wagons \u2018round him. Cord, Colton and Carter will all be here tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Crap.</p><p>Gemma frowned. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>Channing wasn\u2019t aware she\u2019d muttered the word aloud. \u201cBecause me sticking around wasn\u2019t part of our arrangement. Colby and I had always planned to part ways after Cheyenne. Now is just as good a time as any for me to leave.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gemma\u2019s eyes froze into chips of ice. \u201cYou\u2019re just gonna take off like nothing\u2019s happened? Like it don\u2019t matter he\u2019s laying unconscious and beat up and practically dead in a hospital bed?\u201d</p><p>Channing winced at Gemma\u2019s hard slap of words. \u201cNo. But maybe you\u2019d like to give me a chance to explain myself before you go jumping to conclusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m listening. But even you gotta admit things are different now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re probably worse, Gem.\u201d Channing leaned against the concrete wall and resisted beating her head into it. She closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow long is Colby going to be in the hospital? A week? Two? When he\u2019s well enough to leave, he\u2019ll have to return home to the ranch because he won\u2019t be able to take care of himself. His family will expect to do that, as they should. You really think they\u2019ll want me\u2014a strange woman from the East Coast\u2014around?</p><p>\u201cDo you think Colby will want me underfoot? God. When he was injured in Greeley he\u2019d get all pissy whenever I fussed around him. The man is stubborn. And proud. He didn\u2019t want me to see him as weak so he took chances he shouldn\u2019t have. That injury wasn\u2019t nearly as serious as this one is. He\u2019ll have months of physical therapy, months of being dependent on others. So if I drop everything in my life and move to Wyoming to help take care of him, he\u2019ll resent me. I know he will. I couldn\u2019t stand that, Gemma. He\u2019s too important to me.\u201d Her voice broke.</p><p>Gemma pressed Channing\u2019s head to her shoulder and let her cry.</p><p>When the worst of the jag was over, Gemma smoothed the hair from Channing\u2019s damp cheek. \u201cYou know, I\u2019d like to argue with you and say you\u2019re wrong, but I have a sneaking suspicion you\u2019re exactly right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Gemma handed her another Kleenex. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was hard on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what friends do, Gem.\u201d</p><p>They stayed locked in silence for a while. Gemma sighed and scooted away. \u201cSo what are you gonna do, girlie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing I\u2019ve been doing, I guess. Hide out until Colby\u2019s family leaves and then I\u2019ll sneak in to see him. After that, I have some things to deal with at home that I\u2019ve been putting off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna stay there? Back on the coast where your folks live?\u201d</p> <p>Probably not. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember, my door is always open. If things don\u2019t work out for you with your family or your job, look me up. I can always use another set of hands to muck out horse stalls. The company would be nice too, Chan.</p><p>I\u2019m gonna miss you.\u201d</p><p>Channing actually smiled for the first time in hours. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. This whole situation sucks all the way around.\u201d Gemma stood. \u201cCall my cell when you\u2019re done here and I\u2019ll come get you and take you to the airport.\u201d</p><p>Channing nodded.</p><p>Hours passed. Trevor, Cash, Edgard and several other cowboys on the circuit came and went. She watched from the shadows at end of the corridor. No one paid any attention to her. She\u2019d spent her whole life blending into the background and she was damn good at it.</p><p>Around five a.m. Channing was jostled awake. She blinked up into Keely McKay\u2019s curious blue eyes.</p> <p>\u201cChanning, right? Gemma told me to keep an eye on you. My folks are gone. Colby isn\u2019t awake, but he is alone if you want to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The room was small and filled with a medicinal stench. A ghostly sound of Colby\u2019s breathing apparatus echoed, as well as the constant beep beep of the machines keeping him alive.</p><p>Channing bit her tongue hard to stop a gasp from escaping.</p><p>His leg was in a cast. Most of the rest of his body was covered up with blankets. He had tubes in both arms. He didn\u2019t look frail; he looked...like a wounded warrior.</p><p>She approached the side of Colby\u2019s bed, curling her fingers around the metal railing. Her tears fell. \u201cOh, cowboy. Ain\u2019t you a sight for sore eyes.\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>She brushed her fingertips across the scraped-up knuckles on his hand and studied his unconscious face for the longest time, hoping for a sign of some kind.</p><p>Increased activity in the hallway signaled it was time for her to go.</p><p>Channing kissed his forehead and moved her lips to his ear. \u201cGet better soon. When you\u2019re back on your feet, cowboy, come looking for me because I\u2019ll be waiting. No matter where I am or what I\u2019m doing I\u2019ll be waiting for you. For as long as it takes. And I\u2019ll say the words you were so hell bent on hearing from me last night. I love you, Colby McKay. Don\u2019t you ever forget it. I\u2019ll say it again. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Walking away from him was the hardest thing she\u2019d ever done, even when she knew it was for the best. For now.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>One week later...</p><p>Trevor sipped his fourth beer and watched Edgard loading the last of his tack in his luggage. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t wanna take that saddle? It\u2019s awful damn nice. Nicer than mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You can have it. Or you can sell it. I don\u2019t care either way.\u201d</p><p>Pause. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll keep it around for when you come back.\u201d</p><p>Edgard sighed, but he didn\u2019t look up from zipping his soft-sided suitcase. \u201cI already told you, Trev. I\u2019m not coming back.\u201d</p><p>Trevor ignored the stab of pain near his heart. He drained the lukewarm brew and reached for another.</p><p>Thud. Edgard\u2019s last bag hit the floor.</p><p>The silence between them was deafening.</p><p>Edgard said, \u201cWhen are you going to Cody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow. Early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019re you going with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash and Brian. Colby\u2019s cousin Dag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck. Dag\u2019s a great heeler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He fiddled with the metal tab on the beer can. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want me to take you to the train station?\u201d</p><p>Edgard laughed softly. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be wise, amigo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t like I\u2019m gonna make a big scene, Ed,\u201d Trevor scoffed.</p><p>\u201cI know. Maybe I would.\u201d Edgard briefly shut his eyes. \u201cShit. I\u2019m not gonna do this. I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d</p><p>Edgard ran his hand through his hair. A gesture of frustration Trevor had come to recognize in the last two years he and Edgard had been together. Off and on. In secret. He knew it wasn\u2019t fair to either of them.</p><p>Trevor wanted to get up, walk over and smooth Edgard\u2019s dark hair back in place. He ached to soothe him and tell him everything would be all right. But mostly he wanted to wrap his arms around Edgard and beg him not to leave.</p><p>But Trevor did none of that. He just steadily drank his beer, waiting for the numbness to settle in and ease his sorrow.</p><p>Edgard opened the door and tossed out his luggage. Then he closed the door again and braced his shoulders against the wall.</p><p>Automatically Trevor stiffened.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not going to make you uncomfortable by telling you how I feel. You already know. I just wish things could be different.\u201d</p><p>Trevor swallowed a drink and the lump in his throat. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care of yourself, meu amor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>A truck horn honked outside.</p><p>Without another word Edgard turned and walked out of his life.</p><p>Trevor stayed seated until he heard Gemma\u2019s rig drive away. Then he slowly stood, shuffled to the door and locked it.</p><p>He shoved the rest of the case of beer up in the sleeping compartment and crawled across the mattress. He cracked open a fresh can, lay flat on his back and let the tears come.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Eight weeks later...</p><p>Colby McKay sat on the front porch of his parents\u2019 house with his leg propped on a folding chair and scowled at the darkening sky. Fucking clouds. If it was gonna be cloudy, at least the damn things should be rain clouds. They needed the moisture in a bad way.</p><p>A dry autumn breeze drifted through the eaves, rattling the wind chimes. He\u2019d been home for two months. A doctor ordered bed rest after his leg had been busted up like a cheap 2X4, and his lung had seeped air like a leaky balloon.</p><p>As glad as he was not to be pissing in a colostomy bag or wheeling himself around in a chair for the rest of his life, it stung his pride that his family was forced to take care of him at the family homestead for the time being. For six long goddamn months.</p><p>Oh, they didn\u2019t seem to mind. His mom was happy to have him home in any capacity, happier yet he was done with life on the road. He was still shuffling around on crutches with a brace on his leg like a gimped-up old man, but at least he wasn\u2019t flat on his back.</p><p>Still, there was something mortifying about his mom or his sister doing his physical therapy exercises with him every damn day. That little sadist Keely liked inflicting pain on him. He\u2019d warned her paybacks were a bitch and he\u2019d invited Amy Jo over to keep him company on occasion.</p><p>But he suspected the only reason Amy Jo showed up was on the hope she\u2019d run into his brother Cord.</p><p>Colby felt useless. He couldn\u2019t stay by himself in his beloved log cabin on the other side of the canyon. His mother claimed she didn\u2019t trust him not to do too much, too soon. Helping Colton with chores was out, too.</p><p>His dad had told him there\u2019d be plenty of chores waiting for him when he\u2019d healed up properly. Next spring. Even Cord gave him pitying looks, and Cord\u2019s life was even more fucked up than his.</p><p>But mostly Colby sat around wondering what the hell he was gonna do now that his rodeo career was history. Sure, he\u2019d known at the end of this season he\u2019d have to scale back and compete locally only on weekends. So it\u2019d come as a complete shock when the surgeons warned him if he started riding bulls or broncs again, he could end up in a wheelchair permanently.</p><p>Not a chance he was willing to take.</p><p>For the millionth time Colby\u2019s thoughts turned to Channing. He knew that wasn\u2019t why she\u2019d bailed\u2014because he was no longer a rodeo cowboy, now that injury had forced him into being just an ordinary Wyoming rancher. He doubted she\u2019d skipped back to her old life after she\u2019d had her sexual adventure of traveling the rodeo circuit with a trio of cowboys. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Or that she\u2019d forgotten about him as she was on the Eastern seaboard teaching readin\u2019, writin\u2019 and \u2019rithmetic.</p><p>Probably they called it something else at that fancy-pants school where she was hiding away.</p><p>No doubt Channing was hiding. From him. From herself. From what she\u2019d said to him in the hospital when she didn\u2019t know he could hear her. Colby didn\u2019t have any idea what to do about fixing things. Hell, he couldn\u2019t do anything about it until he was a whole man again.</p> <p>Lord. He missed her. After one glorious week Channing meant everything to him. During the last night he\u2019d spent making love to her, showing her how he felt, he knew she\u2019d never just waltz away.</p><p>I\u2019ll be waiting.</p><p>But where? It seemed as if Channing Kinkaid had dropped off the face of the earth.</p><p>A couple of weeks back after he\u2019d gotten through the worst of the pain, he\u2019d taken a chance and called her cell phone only to discover it\u2019d been disconnected. That left him adrift because he didn\u2019t know her parents\u2019 names. He didn\u2019t know where she lived.</p><p>But he did know he loved her.</p> <p>The wind blew the scent of sage and dirt. For a second, he thought he caught a whiff of Channing\u2019s perfume. Wishful thinking. There weren\u2019t a lot of wildflowers in Wyoming in the autumn.</p><p>He sighed. Maybe he\u2019d nap. At least when he was asleep he didn\u2019t think about this shit. And he could dream about her wrapped up in his arms in the middle of his king-sized bed back at his place. Just the two of them alone for a change. No traveling partners. No interruptions.</p><p>The front door opened and his mother hustled out with his nephew Ky cocked on her hip. She pitched Colby the portable phone. \u201cWe\u2019re out of milk and diapers. I\u2019m running to the store. Do you need anything while I\u2019m in town?\u201d</p><p>Colby shook his head. He\u2019d drifted into that dreamy state right before sleep when the phone rang. He snapped, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby McKay, you sound like a bear with a sore paw. How you doing?\u201d</p><p>He relaxed. \u201cGetting better every day, Gemma. And you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t complain. Hey, is your dad around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He and Cord and Colton are sortin\u2019 cows with the cattle broker.</p><p>Why? What\u2019d you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d A rustling sound crackled on the line as she moved the receiver on her end. \u201cNo, Channing, those don\u2019t go there. Put \u2018em in the sun porch.\u201d</p><p>Colby froze. Then his heart raced. \u201cGemma? What the devil is goin\u2019</p><p>on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry \u2018bout that. What did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say Channing is there? At your ranch?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Channing is at your ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwhile.\u201d</p><p>Colby practically growled. \u201cHow long has she been there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been here almost six weeks. Where\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here! Why in the hell didn\u2019t she tell me? Why didn\u2019t you tell me, Gemma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit. I don\u2019t know whether to take a horsewhip after you or her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the direction this conversation has taken, Colby McKay.\u201d</p><p>He breathed deep, trying to calm himself. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s just...I\u2019ve spent the last month tryin\u2019 to find out where she is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now you know. My question is: What are you gonna do about it?\u201d</p><p>Gemma hung up.</p><p>A shaft of sunshine spilled across the porch railing. Colby glanced at the sky. The gray clouds had cleared out, revealing a radiant blue horizon.</p><p>A sign that he\u2019d finally get a chance to clear up some of the issues that\u2019d been clouding his mind?</p><p>He grabbed his crutches and his keys and he was gone.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Meanwhile, back at Gemma Jansen\u2019s ranch...</p><p>\u201cYou always make me do the shitty jobs,\u201d Channing half-complained.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s part of learning the ropes and working on the ranch.</p><p>Somebody has to do them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? I wish you would\u2019ve told me this before I packed up and moved here.\u201d</p><p>Gemma leaned on the pitchfork, her face serious. \u201cDo you have some regrets about shucking life in the city for shucking corn?\u201d</p><p>Even covered in horse shit and hay dust Channing couldn\u2019t hold back a big grin. \u201cNot a single one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She pointed to a mound of golden hay. \u201cSpread that around.</p><p>I\u2019ve got to make a call. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>While Channing shoveled hay, she considered the idea that she might have some regrets.</p><p>After she\u2019d left Colby in the hospital, she\u2019d flown home. It\u2019d taken less than a week for her to realize she couldn\u2019t fathom spending her life living up to someone else\u2019s expectations. Contrary to her parents\u2019 accusations, she hadn\u2019t changed. She was finally ready to accept that who she was on the inside was who she wanted to be on the outside. All the time. Not just for a week during rodeo season.</p><p>So Channing had quit her job before she\u2019d even started it. She\u2019d sold the few things she\u2019d owned\u2014including her BMW\u2014bought an old Dodge truck, packed up and had driven across the country to the wilds of Wyoming.</p><p>It\u2019d been the best decision she\u2019d ever made, besides hooking up with a sweet rodeo cowboy who made her laugh, made her mad and made her scream. The last time she\u2019d seen him, lying in that hospital bed, he\u2019d made her cry.</p><p>So far her only regret was that she hadn\u2019t found the guts to personally visit that cowboy. The couple of times she\u2019d called his folks\u2019</p><p>place, his father had said Colby was resting. She figured she\u2019d give him another week of recovery time before she took a road trip and tried her hand at wooing him face to face, Western style.</p><p>Gemma kicked a stall door shut on her way back into the barn.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d you call that put you in such a bad mood? Cash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in the world would I call Cash Big Crow when I haven\u2019t seen or heard from him in over two months?\u201d Gemma\u2019s face turned bright red whenever Cash\u2019s name was mentioned.</p><p>Channing shrugged. Not her business. They\u2019d either figure it out, or they wouldn\u2019t. It made her sad to think that Trevor was too much of a chicken to buck his family\u2019s expectations and had let Edgard go back to Brazil alone. \u201cHey, you want to shoot some pool tonight at the Lantern?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. We\u2019ve got too much to do. Let\u2019s stick around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Channing quit leaning on her pitchfork and got back to work.</p><p>An hour and a half later, Gemma disappeared again while Channing finished in the barn. She heard a vehicle zooming up the driveway and gravel crunching as it came to an abrupt halt. A metal door slammed.</p><p>\u201cChanning Kinkaid, get your butt out here right now.\u201d</p><p>Colby? Was here? She tossed her leather work gloves on the wooden tool bench.</p><p>\u201cThat was your first warnin\u2019, shug,\u201d he yelled.</p><p>Channing sucked in a deep breath and stepped into the sunshine.</p><p>She shaded her eyes with her hand and caught a glimpse of Colby hunched over a pair of crutches beside a dirty black pickup.</p><p>Her heart absolutely soared with joy. He was a little battered, a little thinner, but he was there.</p><p>And mad as the dickens.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell is wrong with you? You\u2019re livin\u2019 in Wyoming now?</p><p>Less than two goddamn hours away from me and you can\u2019t be bothered to let me know?\u201d</p><p>Channing swallowed the lump in her throat. \u201cI did let you know. I called out to your parents\u2019 place a couple of times and talked to your dad.\u201d She froze about twenty feet from him when the truth hit her. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you I called, did he?\u201d</p><p>A muscle in Colby\u2019s jaw flexed. \u201cNo. He didn\u2019t. I\u2019ll deal with him later.</p><p>Right now I wanna paddle your behind for thinking I\u2019d ever\u2014\u201d</p><p>She held up her hand. \u201cStop right there. I thought when we saw each other again you\u2019d at least sweet-talk me a little, cowboy. Seeings you\u2019re so good with that silver tongue. But instead\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cInstead I\u2019m standin\u2019 here like a dumbass because I can\u2019t run to you and scoop you up in my arms where you belong.\u201d</p><p>She paused and stared at him, her heart in her eyes. \u201cHow about if I run to you?\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cOh God, darlin\u2019, please. I\u2019m dyin\u2019 over here.\u201d</p><p>Channing ran.</p><p>He caught her on his right side and hauled her against him. Colby kissed her, not like he wanted to devour her, but with pureness.</p><p>Gentleness. With his heart and soul wide open. Like he was giving them a memory to reflect on for the next sixty years when they looked back on this moment. She drank him in and filled him back up, sharing, drowning in everything they freely gave to each other.</p><p>She buried her face in his shirt, inhaling the warm intimate scent of him. \u201cI missed you, Colby. God. I was so worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I wanted to die when you got hurt. And in the hospital I realized I would wither and die if I didn\u2019t have you in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why you left me?\u201d</p><p>Channing butted her head against his stubborn chin. \u201cTemporarily. I had things to get straight in my own life first. And you had other things to worry about than me. We both know you wouldn\u2019t have wanted me around those first few weeks while you were recovering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. I\u2019ve been grumpier than an old bear. Been in a lot of pain.</p><p>Been kind of an ass to everyone, if you wanna know the truth. But a big part of that was because I didn\u2019t know where you were, shug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here. Waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Colby\u2019s big, gentle hand shook as he wiped away her tears. \u201cYou know I would\u2019ve been here sooner, had I known?

Learning everything I can about life on a ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes twinkled. \u201cSee, I\u2019ve got my eye on this hot ranching cowboy...\u201d</p><p>Colby grinned. Dimple and all.</p><p>She melted.</p> <p>\u201cYeah? Well, there are a couple of things expected of a proper ranch wife that Gemma can\u2019t teach you.\u201d He frowned. \u201cAt least, I hope to hell she ain\u2019t been tryin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only man for the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways. Forever and ever amen. I don\u2019t share what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made that crystal clear a couple of times.\u201d Channing looked him dead in the eye. \u201cI love you, Colby McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped.</p> <p>Colby closed it with his finger and kissed her. \u201cYou told me once, and it was enough to stick in my head forever. Although, it kinda seemed like a dream, but I remember you comin\u2019 to see me in the hospital. I heard what you said. It\u2019s what got me through, the idea that a sweet, sexy, sophisticated woman like you loved a roughneck like me. Loved me enough to tell me you\u2019d be waitin\u2019 for me. No matter what.\u201d He brought the back of her hand to his mouth. \u201cI\u2019d get on one knee, but I\u2019m still pretty beat up. So I\u2019m just gonna ask you outright. Will you marry me, Channing Kinkaid?\u201d</p><p>Without hesitation she blurted, \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot damn.\u201d He readied his crutches. \u201cGet in the truck. You\u2019re drivin\u2019.</p><p>We\u2019re goin\u2019 to the preacher right now before you change your mind. Then I\u2019m takin\u2019 you home where you belong.\u201d</p><p>She almost forgot her list of demands after Colby said home where you belong. But this was too important. \u201cAh-ah. Hold it right there. If I take you on, there\u2019ll be conditions.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cShould I be afraid of these conditions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Channing grinned. \u201cOne: You\u2019ll be in my bed. Every night.</p><p>No boring, once a week missionary style vanilla sex. I expect you and I will both work to keep our sex life as hot and titillating as it has been.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTitillatin\u2019, huh?\u201d He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m down with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo: I wanna have kids. Lots of kids. But not right away. I want you all to myself for awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes, shug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree: Between you still recovering from your injury and me being a novice at living on a ranch, we\u2019ll have to be patient with each other. Your family will have to be patient with me. I\u2019ve been an outsider in my own family for my whole life, Colby. I don\u2019t want to be an outsider in yours, too.\u201d</p><p>Colby leaned on his crutches and stared directly into her eyes. \u201cYou are my family now. Besides, Mama already loves you because I told her all about you.\u201d</p><p>Channing didn\u2019t have to feign surprise. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. And she\u2019s gonna kick my dad\u2019s butt when she finds about him not tellin\u2019 me that you called, \u2018cause she knows how I\u2019ve been pining by the phone waitin\u2019 to hear from you.\u201d He smiled evilly. \u201cSo I think I\u2019ll let her handle him. She can punish him way worse than I ever could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because I\u2019m in for the long haul. I don\u2019t want little picky stuff to tear us apart when the big picture is so promising.\u201d She smoothed her fingers along the dogged set of his jaw. \u201cAny questions?\u201d</p><p>Colby kissed the inside of her wrist. \u201cOne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this where I tell you I love you?\u201d</p><p>Channing\u2019s eyes filled with tears and she nodded.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Channing Kinkaid. You make me the luckiest, happiest man in the world. Life on the ranch ain\u2019t always gonna be rainbows and butterflies and the heart-poundin\u2019 excitement of rodeo, but dammit, it will be our life. I\u2019ll spend every wakin\u2019 hour makin\u2019 sure our life together fulfills your every fantasy.\u201d</p><p>Deliriously happy, she snagged his hat and plopped it on her head.</p><p>\u201cIs this where we ride off into the sunset, cowboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Colby kissed her. Long. And hard. \u201cI\u2019d much rather ride you, but hey, I can adapt to anything you throw my way.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
