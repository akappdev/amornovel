The war against terrorism was still waging, years after it had begun, and in select areas of the Middle East it was hell. The Special Forces unit Dash Sinclair was assigned to had been there for a year now; working together, becoming a part of each other\u2019s lives, depending on each other. Until the day their transport was taken out by a well-aimed missile. It had killed the other seven men. Dash was left barely clinging to life when rescue had arrived.</p><p>At the time, he wasn\u2019t even certain what kept him alive. He was tired. Tired of fighting, tired of hiding, just plain tired of being alone. He had been closer to those seven soldiers than he had ever been to anyone, and now they were gone, leaving an awareness within him of the desolate wasteland his life had become.</p><p>Weeks later, his eyes bandaged, his wounds covered, he lay in a medicated stupor, barely clinging to life. A part of his soul howled out in fury; that restless, yearning part that never seemed to still grieved at the continued fight to survive. Why was he alive when the others had been lost?</p> <p>It was then his commanding officer came to him.</p><p>\u201cYou have a fan, son.\u201d Something inside, a primal, instinctive part of his conscience stilled then. It pushed back the pain, the memories of blood and death, and became watchful. Waiting. He had no fans, no friends or family. And he had lost his unit. He was damned tired of hiding and fighting, and they wouldn\u2019t let him just sleep. And now, the part of himself he had always fought to deny was awake once again. Instinctively he knew his greatest battle was yet to come.</p><p>\u201cA nice little girl named Cassie Colder. Let me read this to you real fast. I\u2019ll answer her until you\u2019re well enough to do it yourself. But I have a feeling this little girl would get right pissed if you didn\u2019t eventually answer...\u201d</p><p>I liked your name best when the teacher gave us the list. Dash Sinclair. It has a very nice sound to it I think. Momma said it\u2019s a very brave, very handsome name, and she bets you like it lots. I thought it sounded like a daddy\u2019s name. I bet you have lots of little girls. And I bet they are very proud of your name. I don\u2019t have a daddy, but if I had one, then I would like a name like that for my Daddy.</p><p>He had created his own name. Long ago. Far away. Created a name he had prayed would hide his past. Then he had fought to change himself as well. But he didn\u2019t have lots of little girls and he wasn\u2019t a daddy. The words his commander read seeped into his brain and a sense of urgency began to fill him.</p> <p>My Momma, her name is Lizbeth. And she has brown hair kind of like me. And pretty blue eyes. But my eyes are kind of blue too. I have a really pretty Momma, Dash. She makes me cookies, and even tells me it\u2019s okay to talk to the fairy that lives in my room with me. My Momma is really nice. My Momma says you are a very brave man. That you are fighting to keep us safe. I wish you were here with us Dash, cause sometimes my Momma gets very tired.</p><p>Even in pain, barely conscious, a sense of alarm surged through him. He could feel fear in that simple sentence. A plea for protection. And he fought to live. He had to live. He had to save Cassie and her momma.</p><p>He saw Cassie, small and delicate, whimpering in fear. But in bright, vivid colors, he saw her mother, desperate, frightened, poised in front of her daughter like a protective she-wolf, snarling in fury. Why did he see that? Why did the image taunt him?</p><p>At other times, he was tormented by the sight of the mother watching him, her eyes half closed in drowsy passion, her body naked, slender and graceful beneath his larger frame. It was little Cassie Colder that wrote to him, but with each line about her mother, each description, each phrase concerning the Momma who looked after her, Dash\u2019s need grew. His sense of possessiveness, his hunger, his inborn knowledge that somehow, some way, Elizabeth and Cassie belonged to him, began to strengthen inside him.</p><p>Yes. The name Dash was a good name for a daddy. For Cassie\u2019s daddy. But it was also a good name for a mate. Elizabeth \u2019s mate. And once again the inborn instinct of the animal raised its head. His senses became sharper as he fought against the fog of pain and medication then. Twisting shadows of violence and the dark bloody stains of death began to emerge and coalesce around Cassie and her momma. They were his, and they were in danger. He had to live.</p><p>My Momma says you must be a very kind man. Kind men don\u2019t hit little girls. Do they?</p> <p>So innocently phrased, yet with a wealth of meaning. He strained within the dark agony that filled him, fought through the layers of pain to find consciousness, to heal. To live. Cassie and her Momma needed him.</p><p>My Momma says there might not really be fairies but it\u2019s okay if I think there are. Cause nothing don\u2019t exist if you don\u2019t believe in it. And if you believe in it, then it\u2019s real as sunshine. I believe in you, Dash...</p><p>Why did he keep hearing a cry? It was inside his head, a woman\u2019s tears and muffled sobs. But it was the child\u2019s words his Major read to him as he fought his way back. A battle he often feared he would lose.</p><p>My Momma says Leprechauns should be real. That gold at the end of the rainbow sounds really nice. I promise, Dash. I know a real fairy. I told Momma and she smiled and said I could ask her in for cookies and milk if I liked. I had to tell her that fairies don\u2019t eat cookies and milk. They really like candy bars...The fairy eventually got to share the candy bar with Cassie. But still, Dash heard a woman\u2019s muffled sobs.</p><p>The kid\u2019s letters became a lifeline through long, bitter months of recuperation. It gave him something to hold onto. He had no one. He was a man alone in the world and he had thought this was the way he wanted it, until one little girl\u2019s letters touched his soul. They were often peppered with amusing, cute little displays of affection toward a mother who apparently loved her daughter very much. And the daughter showered him with a sprinkling of the love her mother gave.</p><p>Sometimes my momma is sad. She sits alone in our room and stares out the window and I peek through my eyes and I think I see tears. I think she needs a daddy too, don\u2019t you?</p><p>The soldiers who had accompanied the Major that day had ribbed him over that one. But Major Thomas had shushed them quickly and continued to read. Dash was conscious now, but still weak and had a long road ahead of him. But he fought. Fought like the animal he was, because of the woman\u2019s tears and a little girl\u2019s fears.</p><p>I wanted to send you a sparkling present for Christmas. But Momma said we just didn\u2019t have the money this year. Maybe for your birthday, she said, if you will tell me when it is. So I emailed Santa instead. I told him exactly what he was to get you, but I bet your other little girls already thought of it too. I wanted a bicycle, but Momma said Santa might not make it this year. I told her he would. This year, Santa would know I\u2019m big enough for a bike. I\u2019m seven years old. Seven years old is a good bike age, I think.</p> <p>She wrapped around his heart, with her youthful wit and humor and her belief in everything good in the world. He wanted her to have that damned bike. He wanted her to know Santa looked after good little girls who saved worthless hides like his. He wanted her to know he was coming for her. He sent her the bike. So she would be comfortable when he arrived. So she wouldn\u2019t be scared...</p><p>She was a matchmaker, though. Major Thomas finally started reading her letters without the presence of the other men who visited. And Dash finally got around to speaking, finally managed to give her a letter in return. It was short. He tired easily but he wanted the little girl to know what her letters meant to him.</p><p>I got my bike, Dash. Momma was really surprised. On Christmas day I was sure Santa didn\u2019t trust me yet. My bike wasn\u2019t under the tree. Then the doorbell rang, and when Momma answered the door, there was my shining red bike. It had my name on it. It was just for me alone and it was brand new. And it had a helmet. And I have little gloves. And I have elbow pads. And I have knee pads. And there was even a present for my Momma from Santa. Can you believe it, Dash? It was the best Christmas ever. Santa even remembered my Momma.</p><p>Of course Santa remembered. Dash had smiled and roughly thanked the Major for taking care of his request. The long robe would keep the mother warm until his arms could do the job. Cassie had said her momma was often cold...</p><p>Then the letters stopped. A month before he was released from the hospital, his eyesight back, his legs working once again, his strength back at top peak, they had stopped. Concerned, he had asked Commander Thomas to check into it. To find out what happened to the bright, cheerful little girl whose momma had raised her to give her love so freely.</p><p>Commander Thomas, I regret to inform you that little Cassidy Colder and her mother, Elizabeth, died in a fire that overtook their apartment building several weeks ago. The bodies were unrecoverable, but there is no doubt that they, along with several others, were caught in the blaze. There was some trouble associated with the child and mother, rumors I\u2019ve heard of a contract on their lives. Please let me know if you would like me to obtain more information...</p><p>The fax had arrived from the private investigator he had hired. Commander Thomas had checked it out immediately. Neighbors had heard the screams, had seen the apartment building explode, flames overtaking it in a matter of minutes. Dash felt his world crumble. The little girl who had saved him, who had given him his will to live, was gone. For days he sat silent, staring broodingly at the ceiling. For so long he had been alone. He had awakened each day knowing he had no one. Had gone to sleep each night feeling the loss. Yet, while he lay near death, God had brought him angels. Only to take them away once again. It was a terrible blow to the soul he thought had withered away years ago. He knew only blood and death. Had never known innocence until Cassie and her Momma, Lizbeth. The immature, childish scrawl of the name had lingered in his mind. Elizabeth . His Elizabeth .</p><p>In thirty years of living, Dash had never claimed any one person as essential in his life. He had grown up knowing his survival depended on having no one, knowing he was different, knowing how imperative it was that he hide those differences. He had made his own way in life, had literally raised himself as best he could until he was old enough to join the Army.</p><p>He had made the service his home. The men he fought with, though not close to him, had given him a base to interact, to sharpen his intellect, to learn how to lead. For twelve years he had done just that. Led. He moved up the ranks, joining the Special Forces and proving his capabilities there. He had thought he hadn\u2019t needed anything more.</p><p>Dash realized now how wrong he had been.</p><p>Elizabeth and Cassie\u2019s deaths tore a wound in his soul he couldn\u2019t explain. He had never touched the woman, had never held the daughter. She wasn\u2019t his mate, wasn\u2019t his child, and yet his heart screamed something different. His soul howled at the loss and some instinct, some inborn knowledge, refused to allow him to deny the bond that existed between him, mother and child.</p><p>\u201cDash, you have to snap out of this.\u201d Commander Thomas sat beside his hospital bed, his green eyes somber, intent. \u201cThese things happen, son. You can\u2019t explain them or make sense of them. At least you have a part of her to remember.\u201d</p><p>Dash stilled the howl that wanted to rise to his lips. He had nothing. A pile of fragile letters wasn\u2019t enough. Not nearly enough.</p><p>His fingers curled into the sheet as he stared up at the dull white ceiling silently. They thought he had sunk into depression. Lost his will to fight. Nothing could be further from the truth. He had one last battle to fight before he could give into the soul-deep need to rest. Vengeance. It kept the blood pumping in his veins, kept his heart beating in his chest.</p><p>He gave his commander a long, brooding look.</p><p>\u201cI want to know what happened.\u201d</p><p>Commander Thomas sighed wearily, shaking. \u201cWhat does it matter, Dash? They\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>Dash felt fury engulf him. It mattered. It mattered because he intended to exact his own form of justice.</p><p>\u201cI want to know. Contact the investigator. I want the information before my release.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had his plans in place. The investigator could provide the background he needed, then Dash would finish the job.</p><p>\u201cSo you can do what?\u201d Commander Thomas leaned back against his chair, watching him with a frown.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be assigned a new unit...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was given the option to return stateside on deactivation.\u201d It was all he could do to keep from snarling.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be returning to duty, Commander. I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d</p><p>Surprise glittered in the commander\u2019s eyes, and Dash knew why. He had been in the service since he was eighteen. He hadn\u2019t once taken a deactivation. Twelve years he had given to first the Army and then to the Special Forces Units. He was one of the best, a natural leader and a savage fighter. But he\u2019d had enough. The unit he had fought with for over a year was gone. The little girl and the mother who had seen him through the need for death were gone. He needed justice. He needed a way to balance the scales and then he needed to find the part of himself he had hidden for most of his life. The commander sighed wearily before nodding. \u201cI\u2019ll call him tonight. You\u2019ll have what you need.\u201d</p><p>He rose to his feet, staring down at Dash for long, silent moments.</p><p>\u201cVigilantism is a crime. You know that, don\u2019t you Dash?\u201d he asked him cautiously. Dash smiled. A slow baring of his teeth that he knew the commander would recognize. Dash was one of the best for a reason. He knew what he was doing. And he knew how to do it right.</p> <p>\u201cThey have to catch you first,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>While he waited on the information, he worked on completing his recovery. He was rarely still. He worked his body and his mind constantly, making certain each were in peak condition. When word came through that the information was being sent to the stateside location Dash had chosen, he packed his duffle bag and prepared to leave.</p><p>Several days before his release, his strength renewed, his mind on returning to the States and armed with enough information to begin a slow, steady hunt, an unfamiliar letter arrived. He knew the handwriting, not the name. His heart stopped when he read the letter within the plain envelope.</p><p>I know you must have lots of other little girls to love. Momma says you must be married with children and don\u2019t need us. But I need you Dash. Please help me and my Momma before the bad guys get us again. I used to be Cassidy Colder, but Momma says now my name is Cassie Walker. Walkers okay I guess. And here. This is Bo Bo\u2019s Kercheif. So you know it\u2019s me. Momma says you will think the splosion got us. It hurt Momma, but we\u2019re okay. Please help us Dash.</p><p>It had been hastily scrawled and it sent terror chasing down his spine. Inside was the locket he had sent her for her eighth birthday, a picture of herself and her mother inside. The mother looked haunted. Big</p><p>blue eyes stared in startled awareness at the camera while the girl smiled charmingly. The small red kerchief had been wrapped around a little teddy bear\u2019s neck that he had asked Commander Thomas to order for her. Bo Bo, she had named it. He could smell her on it. Baby powder and innocence. But there was another scent, Elizabeth \u2019s, and it sent his hormones howling. Pure female seductiveness. Dark, sweet, like a summer rainfall.</p> <p>His eyes narrowed on the picture then, rage shaking his body at the thought of anyone daring to hurt either of them. They were his. And no one dared touch anything or anyone belonging to Dash Sinclair. Before he could stop it, a rumble of pure menace echoed in his chest, a growl of foreboding, a promise of retribution. And the hunt was on. He would go after the enemy later. First...first he had to find the family he had claimed in the darkness of pain. The mate that needed warmth, the child that needed protection. He would find them first. If along the way, a few of the enemy died, too bad. It would be a few less to kill later.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Six Months Later</p><p>He was a Wolf Breed. Dash Sinclair had known what he was even before the news exploded around the world six months before. Thankfully, in Dash, the genetics had recessed and were only identifiable on the genetic level, rather than the physical. It was the reason he had been marked for death at a young age. But it was also the reason he had survived after his escape from the labs. He had joined the army at eighteen, had fought and killed and done his best to hide right under the noses of several of the men who had funded his creation. He knew who they were. He had seen them at the labs when he was just a child, remembered their faces clearly. Dash never forgot the face of an enemy. Over the years he had become confident, strong, and aware of his strengths in a way that kept him from making mistakes. He never told anyone what he was. Never took the chance of confiding in friends. Hell, he had never made friends. He was surly on the best of days, and downright dangerous any other time. Most people knew to steer well clear of him.</p><p>Right now, he was in the mood for blood. He stood still, drawing in the scents of the small ransacked room, and felt rage wash over him. Over the past six months he had investigated Elizabeth and Cassidy Colder until he knew even the most minute detail concerning them. He had made contacts while in the Forces. Contacts that owed him, and he pulled in each favor he could draw on. Cassidy was a little girl living on borrowed time. A child with a price on her head and a mother fighting to save her. The lengths Elizabeth Colder had gone to save her little girl made his gut tighten in fear. Such a small woman should be protected, cuddled, just as the child should be, not running in fear for that child\u2019s life.</p><p>He could smell the little girl\u2019s terror now, her childish tears, just as he sensed her mother\u2019s rage and terror. He snarled silently at the scents, drawing them in, allowing them to fuel his rage. The men chasing them would pay. Eventually.</p><p>He picked up a childish jacket, brought it to his nose and drew in deep. Innocence and the smell of baby</p><p>powder clung to it. But the fact that it was here and not wrapped around her small body sent chills snaking down his spine. It was damned cold out there. A little one would freeze quickly in weather like this. Not that the jacket would do her much good, ripped in half as it was. He picked up a sweater next and did the same. Ahh, there was a smell a man would die happy to know. Female, fresh and clean, a hint of baby powder, but filled with the delicate scent of womanhood. His. He stared around the room. He wasn\u2019t far behind them and it was obvious they were still several steps ahead of the men chasing them. He snarled softly. He would find the woman and child first. It was too cold, too brutal out there to go hunting for the enemy with no assurance that what was most important was safe first.</p> <p>The little girl\u2019s doll was ripped apart, stuffing littering the room. Clothes were shredded, books ripped in half. He knew the smell of the enemy now and he smiled coldly as he drew it in, memorizing it, making certain he never forgot it. Cassidy and her mother must have come in after the destruction of their temporary home. A small basket of clothes sat by the door, left forgotten but undamaged. Laundry. Doing the laundry had saved their lives.</p><p>He dropped the garments. They wouldn\u2019t be needed after he found them anyway. He had everything they would require packed in the SUV. He had made certain that once he found Elizabeth and Cassie they would want for nothing. He took care of what he considered his and everything inside him screamed out in possession of Elizabeth and her child.</p><p>He turned on his heel and moved silently through the room, aware of the hidden bugs placed within it. He had smelled them immediately upon entering the room. His lips twisted into a cold smile. He was dealing with amateurs. There would be little challenge in taking them out when the need arose. The scent of Elizabeth \u2019s fury and fear went no farther than the door, so he knew she hadn\u2019t taken time to investigate the destruction. She was smart. He had been chasing her for months and only in the past week had he gotten close enough that he knew the end was in sight. She wouldn\u2019t be easy for the others to catch. After he found her, they would never have a hope of capturing her. But first, he had to find her. He left the apartment, moving carefully along the dirty passageways, following her scent down the stairs, then to the basement. There, a small window had been pried open. He reached up and removed a tattered piece of flannel. The woman\u2019s. She had cut herself escaping. Blood marred the soft, worn fabric. But she had been smart. Smart enough to know they would be watching the front entrance. Over the past two years she had grown in strength and instinct, learning to hone the abilities she needed to stay on the run. He sensed that, sensed her ability to use her wits where she lacked physical strength. As he stood there staring at the fabric, his fingers running over the dark stains that marred it, he felt another presence begin to disturb the air that flowed in through the opened door. Dash stilled, his head swinging to the partially opened door as a new scent began to mix with that of fabric softener, detergent and stale water. It was insidious. The smell of corruption and furious intent. It wafted through the cool basement air, digging into his senses, filling him with the need for blood. The enemy was on the prowl, stalking him now, foolishly moving from cover to investigate Dash\u2019s interest. Dash was looking forward to the confrontation.</p><p>He stilled the warning growl that rose instinctively in his chest. The smell of cold steel moved closer, the tread of cautious steps. There was only one. He was confident, but filled with fury, and weaker. Dash smiled. The man moving toward him was no more than a flunky. No threat. A hired gun and little more.</p><p>Disposable. It was a good thing because he wouldn\u2019t leave the building alive. Silently, Dash waited. He didn\u2019t have to wait long. The door swung open slowly, revealing the lean, tense body of the enemy. He was a man full grown. A Gamma trying to play Alpha with an animal he had no idea existed. Dash allowed his lips to curl into an anticipatory smile, knowing the other man wouldn\u2019t see it for the lethal threat it was.</p><p>\u201cGetting nosy, stranger?\u201d the other man grunted as he carefully closed the door and aimed his weapon at Dash\u2019s chest. \u201cPut your hands up where I can see them, and don\u2019t move funny or you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>Dash lifted his arms, hands behind his neck, the fingers of one hand curling around the hilt of the large knife concealed in its sheath between his shoulder blades. Oh yeah. Now he could play.</p><p>\u201cJust checking some things out.\u201d Dash narrowed his eyes, aware of the gun barrel\u2019s angle, straight to the heart.</p><p>A silencer had been attached to the barrel. He was a cautious bastard; Dash gave him credit for that. But only for that. Otherwise, he was less than smart. He should have realized the threat Dash was and killed him instantly. If he could. Instead, he wanted to play. Dash liked to play. And he knew for a certainty that his opponent would fall. It was the way of the beast. He could sense the weakness facing him. Overconfidence glittered in the enemy\u2019s eyes as the need for pain scented the air around him.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Beady eyes narrowed. Thick, oily brown hair fell forward, framing a less than intelligent forehead.</p><p>\u201cNo one important.\u201d Dash shrugged as he allowed his lips to curl with insulting mockery. He refused to give respect to a creature so lacking in morality that he would kill a child. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Dash watched the other man closely, the shift of the lanky body beneath the ill-fitting, though expensive, coat he wore, the confident manner in which he held his weapon. The other man was used to killing and he was used to doing it the lazy way. He wouldn\u2019t expect to face a man of Dash\u2019s capabilities. It was almost too easy, Dash sighed. It was a shame; he would have enjoyed a fight.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being too nosy, dude.\u201d The surf boy accent grated on Dash\u2019s nerves. The casual disrespect of the attitude was reason enough to kill him.</p><p>\u201cNot nosy enough maybe.\u201d Dash watched the other man\u2019s gaze carefully as he allowed his smug smile to deepen. \u201cShe got away from you again, didn\u2019t she? Elizabeth \u2019s smarter than you are, dude. Back off now, before I have to take you down.\u201d</p><p>The challenge was made. Dash made certain the insulting derision in his voice was clearly understood. There was no fight here, no conflict. The enemy\u2019s blood would be spilled, period. Angry color filled the other man\u2019s cheeks, his brown eyes glittering with the need for violence as he stepped closer. He would want to be closer, Dash thought, to be certain the bullet killed rather than maimed. To watch the pain and fear he hoped to see spilling into Dash\u2019s eyes as the blood spilled from his chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be a tasty treat to the rest of us when we give that little girl to the boss,\u201d he sneered. \u201cYou like her too, big boy? Too bad. You\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>The other man thought he was close enough. His finger was tightening on the trigger. The knife slid from the leather sheath with a whisper as Dash swung his arm, wrist twisting at the last second, dragging the blade across the tender flesh of the enemy\u2019s neck. The other man\u2019s eyes widened in surprise even as his jugular split beneath the blade.</p><p>\u201cNo, dude. You\u2019re dead.\u201d He allowed the animalistic rumble free, glorying in the smell of blood, the bite of triumph.</p> <p>Dash slid to the side as the reflexive clench of muscle tightened the man\u2019s fingers on the trigger, sending a bullet whizzing harmlessly past him as blood pumped in a wide, vivid arc, splattering across the sleeve of Dash\u2019s custom-made leather jacket.</p><p>The body fell heavily, sightless eyes staring back in macabre astonishment as the crimson wash of blood spilling over the cement floor widened beneath his head.</p><p>There was no remorse in Dash\u2019s heart for the death. Some animals were just plain rabid in the soul, and this one was one of them. There could be no regret for putting the world out of the misery they brought. Casually, he dragged the blade of the knife over the dead man\u2019s shoulder, cleaning it quickly before checking the body for any information he could use. There was a phone number on the back of a wrinkled blank business card. No name. Dash tucked the card into his inner jacket pocket. Money. He tossed it by the body. A message to his boss, keys, a picture of the little girl and her mother. This, Dash tucked away as well.</p><p>Seconds later, confident that the man carried nothing that could be traced back toElizabeth , Dash rose to his feet, replaced the knife and used a discarded towel on one of the machines to clean the sleeve of his jacket. He threw it over the face of the dead man before striding to the door. He jimmied the lock before closing it behind him, making certain it couldn\u2019t be opened easily. The apartment building echoed with the laughter of families, of children. He didn\u2019t want to chance a child walking in on the bloody scene, or an innocent bystander taking the blame for the death. Not that he thought there would be many who would feel the loss of the man he had killed. Dash stalked back to the front entryway into the frigidly cold December evening. As though he had nothing better to do he ambled around the building, heading for the alley in the back, hoping to pick up more information there. Elizabeth and Cassie had gone out the window that led into this alley. He doubted he would find much, but he had to check to be certain. Being cautious had gotten him this far; he wasn\u2019t going to slacken now.</p><p>He didn\u2019t see the navy blue sedan she was driving, thankfully. At least they were in the warmth in the vehicle rather than the biting cold of the frigid winter air. He knelt in front of the open window of the basement, surveying the displaced snow beneath it. The footsteps were barely visible now as they led to a set of tire tracks a few feet over. No, they weren\u2019t too far ahead of him if the tracks in the snow were any indication. And if he wasn\u2019t mistaken the bastards chasing them, minus the one he had just killed, were still watching the building. His hackles had risen the moment he stepped from the front door. Dash looked around carefully as he rose to his full height and began checking out the tire marks along the wide alley. From the looks of it they had left in a hurry. Checking the prints he was fairly certain it matched the sedan and it headed into the heart of town. He sighed deeply as he stared into the twilight sky. Snow peppered his cheeks and forehead, and the smell of the air indicated a blizzard was well on its way.</p> <p>They wouldn\u2019t be able to run for much longer tonight. He should find them soon. Keeping his steps casual he moved back to the front of the building and his own vehicle. The four-by-four SUV would be traded in farther down the road for the military Hummer he had acquired at a local reserve depot. It would make short work of the lousy road conditions and keep him moving when no other vehicle would dare try. To catch the woman he had claimed before he ever saw her face, Dash knew he would need that advantage. It was also a vehicle the enemy was unfamiliar with. That edge would be important in the coming days.</p><p>He watched the rear view mirror carefully as he drove out of the parking lot and pulled his cell phone from the holder at his hip. Nine-one-one was a quick call. Brief and to the point. A dead body, nothing more. All the while, he kept the white Taurus in his peripheral vision. Yep, definite interest from the single occupant inside, but no attempt to follow. They were certain the kid and her mother would show up soon. They had no idea that woman was smarter than a whole unit of dumb asses. He shook his head and made the turn that would lead him in the direction he sensed Elizabeth had taken. His hunt was nearly at an end. Then he could begin playing in earnest.</p><p>Elizabeth was cold and hungry, and desperately fighting the rage and terror streaking through her veins, pumping hard and erratically through her heart. The snow was coming down so damned hard she had been forced to pull into the nearly deserted diner to wait it out. There she fed Cassie, watching the little girl eat even though her light blue eyes were still dilated in shock. Poor little Cassie, she thought. Her life had been a series of upheavals and it didn\u2019t look like it was going to end anytime soon. She hadn\u2019t even cried out when they walked into the destruction of what had once been their home and seen the men sent to kill her. She was more than aware that to do so could mean their lives. Cassie\u2019s involuntary cries had alerted their enemies more than once, and the child had known it. It was a terrible burden for a little girl to have to bear. She was only eight. Bright, beautiful. Too beautiful to live the way she was being forced to live. She was too small. She was losing weight, losing sleep, just as Elizabeth herself was doing. At this rate, the stress of running would kill them before Dane\u2019s enemies could.</p><p>Dane. She stilled the curse that rage fed to her lips. He had been Cassie\u2019s father. Not a good man, but Elizabeth hadn\u2019t believed he was essentially a bad man, either. Not until he had placed his daughter\u2019s life in danger in an attempt to save his own skin. The bastard hadn\u2019t even cared what he was doing to the little girl. All he cared about was saving himself.</p><p>It sickened her to think of the bargain he had made with the man he had been stealing from. How easily he had betrayed Cassie, hoping to escape his own punishment.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Dash will come tonight,\u201d the little girl mumbled softly to herself, barely loud enough for Elizabeth to hear the words. \u201cDo you think he will?\u201d</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t talking to her, Elizabeth knew. When the shock and stress was this great, Cassie turned inward, to herself. She talked to the fairy that she swore followed them. A bright, tiny little form that whispered comfort to her, that assured her Dash Sinclair was a good daddy name. And that Dash would save them.</p><p>God, she wanted to scream out in rage that her child had been reduced to such fairy tales to survive the mental and emotional cruelties being inflicted on her. Cassie was so certain the soldier she had been writing to would rescue them both and they would all live happily ever after. She didn\u2019t know how to explain to her daughter that men, no matter how strong or how kind, wanted no part of the trouble they would bring.</p><p>Not that the soldier hadn\u2019t made her daughter\u2019s life brighter for a while; the bicycle she had been given only a few short months to enjoy, a small doll that Elizabeth had seen torn to shreds in that damned apartment. And she knew he had been behind the gifts of food that had come for such a short while. She had appreciated the gesture, but it had been just another burden. Another person to worry about. She wondered if he had even realized Cassie\u2019s letters had stopped coming to him. If he had even cared. He didn\u2019t know them, had nothing invested in them, and he was half a world away. If he did bother to check, he would believe they had died in that apartment explosion last winter. Damn. It had been close. They nearly had died. The bastards chasing them couldn\u2019t even set up a decent assassination properly. And now, here her daughter sat, another broken dream shredding her soul apart because she had believed so deeply that Dash Sinclair would be there. That he was searching desperately for them. That they wouldn\u2019t have to run anymore. Cassie had been watching for him for a week now, hope gleaming in her eyes each time she caught sight of a tall, dark-haired man. Daily, the little girl studied the fuzzy, out of focus picture he had sent her, terrified that if she didn\u2019t recognize the soldier herself, then he might pass by them without knowing who they were. The picture was taken in front of a helicopter with six other men. Dash stood in the rear, dusty, dressed in Army fatigues, his features blurred. She wouldn\u2019t recognize him if he walked up to her.</p><p>\u201cEat, Cassie,\u201d Elizabeth whispered, reaching across the booth to smooth back her daughter\u2019s tangled dark curls from her white face. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a room for the night and see if we can get some rest.\u201d If Cassie didn\u2019t sleep soon she would become ill. Elizabeth shuddered at the thought of trying to find medical help for her.</p><p>The attached motel seemed reasonable. A few hours of sleep wouldn\u2019t hurt either of them. There was no way anything or anyone was moving in that blizzard outside. No one except the moron pulling into the parking lot in the military Hummer, that is.</p><p>Elizabeth watched as a large dark figure exited the vehicle before striding quickly to the door of the diner. He stepped inside, larger than life, looking stronger than a mountain, his eyes going immediately to her and Cassie. For a moment, fear shook her before she pushed it away. No. The men chasing her weren\u2019t that dangerous, that hard. If they were, she would have been toast two years ago. He was tall, one of the tallest men she had ever seen. Dressed in jeans, boots and a cotton shirt. Thick black hair grew rakishly long, falling over the collar of his shirt. Intense brown eyes, almost the color of amber, surveyed the diner slowly before coming back to her. Electricity sizzled in the air then, as though invisible currents connected them, forcing her to recognize him on a primitive level. Not that she wouldn\u2019t take notice anyway. He was power, strength, and so incredibly male that her breath caught at the sight of him.</p><p>She watched his eyes flare with... No, that wasn\u2019t possession. She was losing her mind. Sleep deprivation and pain had brought her so low that she was seeing only what she knew she wanted to see. It wasn\u2019t possible that a stranger could see her, feel possession, hunger and determination to the extent that she thought she had glimpsed in his gaze before it became shuttered.</p><p>For the first time in years Elizabeth felt her hormones flare to life. That look was almost physical. A caress. A statement of intent. She blinked and shook her head at the hallucination. No. He was just a big, good-looking man, and she was getting desperate. Desperate to find help. To know her daughter was protected. He was big enough to appear able to protect them both. But she knew by now that no one could protect them. It had been driven home forcibly time and time again. She lowered her head, watching Cassie once again as the little girl listlessly nibbled one of the fries from her plate. She had only taken a few bites of the hamburger, mostly because Elizabeth had forced her to.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to eat, baby,\u201d she whispered softly, fighting to hide her tears. \u201cIt\u2019s okay now. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired, Momma.\u201d Cassie dragged a fry through the ketchup now, but didn\u2019t eat it. She was merely playing with it, and only halfheartedly at best.</p><p>\u201cEat, Cassie. And drink your milk.\u201d She pushed the glass closer to the little girl, her heart breaking as Cassie raised her head, staring at her with bleak, horror-ridden eyes. Elizabeth had to fight to still her scream of outrage. No child should ever stare out of such shattered eyes.</p><p>\u201cDash will come tonight, Momma.\u201d Tear-filled eyes stared back at her, so heartbreakingly sad that Elizabeth wanted to die rather than continue to face them.</p><p>\u201cBaby...\u201d How could she tell her? How could she explain that there was no way Dash Sinclair could even know they were alive, let alone that once again, their killers were only hours behind them? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The last attack wasn\u2019t the worst event of their long months on the run, but it was one of the hardest. The men had been waiting on them. If Elizabeth hadn\u2019t locked the basement door behind them and found the window so quickly, then they would have been dead. As it was, a bullet had grazed her thigh, and then she had sliced her waist on the jagged window. She was weak and hungry herself. But she was afraid if she spent more money on food tonight then there would be none to feed Cassie later. A movement from the man still standing by the door had her head lifting, a feeling of panic suddenly overwhelming her as his cool brown eyes met hers. His face was savagely honed. Perfectly angled for a warrior. Or maybe an assassin. Could Dane\u2019s enemies have gotten tired of trying to do the job themselves?</p><p>On the heels of that thought, he began moving toward them. He didn\u2019t just walk; he glided. Smooth powerful muscles rippled beneath the shirt and jeans, bringing him closer by the second. As he neared them, his arm moved, slowly reaching behind his back.</p><p>Elizabeth stiffened fearfully; ready to jump over the table to shield Cassie if a gun appeared. Dear God. What now? They were trapped. Unable to run. No place to hide. A grin tugged at the stranger\u2019s lips, as though he could sense her thoughts. It wasn\u2019t a gun he pulled out, though, but a wrinkled piece of paper. She watched, her heart in her chest, fear burning in her belly even as a strange, displaced desire warmed her thighs.</p> <p>He stopped at the booth, staring down at her, then at Cassie. Elizabeth looked over at her daughter, seeing the rounded eyes, her pale cheeks.</p><p>\u201cCassie,\u201d he murmured as he handed her the paper. \u201cI got your letter.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth felt the world tilt as Cassie whispered his name. \u201cDash?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t possible, she told herself. This couldn\u2019t be Dash Sinclair. He couldn\u2019t have really found them. Couldn\u2019t have even known they needed help. Yet, who else could he be?</p><p>He glanced at Elizabeth. \u201cHave you eaten?\u201d</p> <p>She could only shake her head. Dear God. It couldn\u2019t be. It was a trick. She picked up the letter from the table and unfolded it.</p><p>I know you have lots of other little girls to love. Momma says you must be married with children and don\u2019t need us. But I need you Dash. Please help me and my Momma before the bad guys get us again. How had Cassie managed to post this letter without her knowing it? She stared at her daughter, barely able to process the fact that she was speaking to the stranger. A dangerous, cold-eyed stranger who claimed to be Cassie\u2019s military penpal.</p><p>Cassie\u2019s cheeks were flushed now. Hope radiated from her big blue eyes as shock was slowly displaced by happiness.</p><p>\u201cYou came, Dash.\u201d Cassie threw herself into his big arms, her tiny body looking frail and helpless against the man\u2019s chest, though his expression tightened with some undefined emotion as his arms contracted around her.</p><p>Dash Sinclair. She had loved that name herself, but had pushed it from her mind except for the few times Cassie had written the letters to the wounded soldier. That and when he had invaded her dreams. She hadn\u2019t shared Cassie\u2019s belief that one day Dash would come riding to their rescue, though. That one day he would protect them both. She was an adult. She didn\u2019t believe in fairy tales, though she had fought to keep her daughter\u2019s belief alive as long as possible.</p><p>\u201cEat, Cassie.\u201d He sat Cassie back in her seat, pointing commandingly at the food. Surprisingly enough, a french fry disappeared into her mouth immediately. Then another. Despite Elizabeth\u2019s thankfulness that her daughter was eating, she couldn\u2019t halt a small streak of jealously. Cassie had refused to eat for her mother. Yet she was eating for a stranger.</p> <p>\u201cMac,\u201d he called out the name of the aging, rotund man behind the diner\u2019s bar. \u201cI need two cheeseburger platters, two milks.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth shook her head. \u201cNo...\u201d She knew one of those platters was for her.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Dash.\u201d Cassie laid her head against his arm as she chewed tiredly at the hamburger.</p><p>\u201cMomma was hungry. She didn\u2019t eat yesterday, either. But I knew not to worry. I knew you would be here. I knew you would, Dash.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Dash barely stilled his rumbled growl as Cassie leaned against him. He lifted his arm, curving it around the frail shoulders, and stared back at her mother with a determination he prayed she was taking in. His possessiveness toward these two had grown only stronger, only deeper over the months he had been searching for them. With each miss, each added awareness of the danger they faced, his resolve had only hardened. As though the extra DNA he possessed inside his body was howling out for a claiming in a way that threw him off guard. He didn\u2019t like being thrown off guard. But he found himself accepting the responsibility of these two so naturally, that he often didn\u2019t think to question it. He could sense Elizabeth\u2019s strength. It was there in her squared shoulders, the glint of battle in her weary blue eyes. She didn\u2019t trust him and she sure as hell didn\u2019t believe he was who he said he was. But he had expected that. Expected her to give him a fight. He had known she wouldn\u2019t be easy to conquer. He didn\u2019t want her to be easy, though, Dash realized. She was a strong woman and his dominating instincts would run roughshod over any woman who wasn\u2019t. She would have to learn how to stand up to him, when to push back and when to allow him to shoulder her weight. She would have to learn how to share the burdens rather than carry them on her fragile shoulders as she was used to. Careful of the little head tucked against his chest now, Dash reached into his back pocket and pulled his wallet free. Opening it, he laid it between them. It had his driver\u2019s license in one clear pocket, his service ID in the other, both easy to see.</p><p>He watched her as she studied both and then lifted her eyes, a single brow arching mockingly. She had spunk; he\u2019d give her that. She wasn\u2019t taking anything at face value. Not the letter, not his ID. Her gaze went to her daughter once again. Cassie had slumped against his side, her fragile body slowly relaxing as Dash felt her soaking in the heat of his body through her thin sweater. \u201cEat, Cassie, then you can sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Momma.\u201d Cassie was plain worn down and it infuriated him. Mother and daughter looked like they had spent too many days without sleep or proper food. Their faces were pale, their eyes overly bright from nerves and fear.</p> <p>\u201cI came to help, Elizabeth,\u201d he promised her as he replaced his wallet, aware of the burly waiter as he moved from the bar with the plates of food. \u201cEat and then we\u2019ll discuss it.\u201d</p><p>He tried to sound reassuring. Tried to appear non-threatening, but he knew it was like trying to hide an elephant with a blanket. He was dangerous when crossed in the wrong way. Dangerous period if the situation warranted it, as this one did.</p><p>Mac, as his name tag proclaimed, set the platters heaping with food on the faded top of the booth\u2019s table. As he did, the sleeve of his white T-shirt slipped up, revealing a Special Forces tattoo. Dash filed the information away for the moment. He would need someone to cover for them when they left. With any luck, he could gain help there.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very bossy,\u201d Elizabeth murmured as she stared down at the food. Dash could damned near see her mouth watering. Just as he could see her pride warring with her need.</p><p>\u201cRealistic.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou don\u2019t eat, you can\u2019t fight, darlin\u2019. What\u2019s more important? Your pride or your health?\u201d Or your daughter. He left those words unsaid, though. He knew exactly how important her child was to her. She had prevailed against odds that many men would have faltered beneath to save her little girl. He wouldn\u2019t begrudge her the pride he saw glittering in her eyes, but she would eat.</p><p>And she did. He ate his own food, watching carefully as she ate more than half the huge sandwich and managed to put a dent in the fries. The milk was consumed with pleasure, a flutter of her eyelashes that betrayed her joy in the drink. As though it had been a while since she had tasted it. He wondered if she would find as much pleasure in being touched, stroked, as he had fantasized about in the past months. The closer he had come to finding her, the more explicit his dreams had become, and the more savage his desire for her had grown. He wanted her with a hunger he had never known before. But first, he had to get them settled down, get them to a place of safety. He couldn\u2019t relax his guard until he had managed that. To do it, he would have to drive through one of the worst blizzards of the century. Dash kept a careful eye on the parking lot through the mirror behind her, making certain no other vehicles pulled in. There was a line of eighteen-wheelers extending for miles down the interstate due to the blizzard conditions, and the fluffy white stuff didn\u2019t seem to have a mind to ease for a while. News reports were promising a full-fledged white-out, which meant he didn\u2019t have much longer to get them to a place of safety.</p><p>Thankfully, one of the men he had fought with in the Middle East owned a place just a few hours from where they were. He had contacted him on the cell phone before leaving town and knew he and his family were waiting on them.</p><p>For years Dash had fought alongside his fellow soldiers, maintaining a careful distance, keeping a rein on his need to draw close to others. He had feared he would be turned down when he saw he would have to ask for help along the way. Surprisingly enough, he had been welcomed. They had quite a drive ahead of them and he still wasn\u2019t certain their final destination would provide the sanctuary he hoped to give Elizabeth and Cassie. But at least he knew the way there would be easier. First, he had to get her out of the diner. And she didn\u2019t look so predisposed to trust him. As he ate, one-handed to allow little Cassie her resting spot against his side, he watched her mother. Her delicate face was elegant; a sharp, determined little nose that rounded ever so slightly at the tip, hinting at a playfulness she had been forced to bury within her, wide blue eyes, high cheekbones and delicate rosy lips he could fully imagine kissing.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the food.\u201d She finally pushed her plate away, her gaze settling on Cassie. She had fallen asleep against his side, her slight little body completely relaxed against him. He glanced at her plate. Like her mother, she had been unable to complete her meal, but she had eaten enough to satisfy him. Enough to help her sleep through the long drive ahead.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so tired.\u201d Elizabeth sighed as she raked her fingers wearily through her long, tangled, dark brown hair. It was colored. He knew the silken strands should hold the deep burnished color of dark chestnut, soft and shimmering with auburn highlights. It looked dull, not dirty, but as tired as he knew she was physically.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both exhausted.\u201d He tried to keep his voice soft, to still the rough growl that kept building in his throat, roughening his voice, making him sound hard, but he was unable to. Unfortunately, Dash thought, he was who he was, what he had been made into. He was hard, demanding, and made little allowances for any foolishness. Elizabeth would have to see that her only safety lay in him. He wouldn\u2019t accept anything less.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming with me, Elizabeth. You and Cassie.\u201d He stared back at her firmly, watching her eyes widen. \u201cI know you\u2019re wounded and you\u2019re too exhausted to keep up like this. I came to help you.\u201d</p><p>She eased back, pressing against the back of the booth as she watched him warily. He could see the battle going on within her. The need to trust. The fear. She had been betrayed too many times to just calmly accept his offer. He wasn\u2019t going to give her a choice, though. At the moment she, like Cassie, was more shell-shocked than anything. The earlier escape had been a close one and he knew the terror of it still pulsed through her veins. Fine tremors shook her body occasionally, though he could tell she fought to still them, to maintain her appearance of strength.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the gesture...\u201d</p><p>Dash grunted as he frowned at her heavily. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything you\u2019re going to have to swallow later, Elizabeth,\u201d he warned her, keeping his voice commanding. \u201cWhile I\u2019ve been chasing you down the past six months, I learned exactly what you\u2019re up against.\u201d He hated the way her face whitened further and the hunted look that strengthened the shadows in her eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t fight this alone. You know that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her gaze went to Cassie, and Dash watched them moisten with tears. She pressed her lips tightly together as her fists clenched against the stained Formica of the tabletop. They were small, delicate hands, with long, graceful fingers. Hands a man would kill to have stroking over his body. He was dying to have her touch him. To see if the woman could match the drug-induced dreams he still clearly remembered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d Her voice was rough, hollow. \u201cI can\u2019t take the chance, Mr. Sinclair. I don\u2019t know you. I won\u2019t trust you.\u201d</p><p>They weren\u2019t empty phrases. She had been betrayed one time too many. Had fought too long to give in now and just accept anyone else taking over. Which was okay, he told himself silently. He would let her fight as much as her pride needed, but in the end, he would win. Dash allowed a smile to tip his lips. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you for your trust or your permission, Elizabeth. I was stating a fact. We have to get you and Cassie somewhere safe, then we can see about eliminating the problem.\u201d</p> <p>If her face could have whitened more, it would have. He knew she had tried more than once to go to the authorities, to find a way to do what was right. But men, even those sworn to uphold the rights of the innocent, were often much too human. Those who couldn\u2019t be bought had been killed. And he knew her conscience had been laid bare by the deaths of those who had tried to help.</p><p>\u201cI went to the police. Once,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cI won\u2019t make that mistake again.\u201d Not all of the officers at that station had betrayed her there. The chief alone had been responsible for that one. Several of the investigators were still looking for her, unaware of what had caused her to flee. They only knew she was in trouble. In trouble, and a friend. Elizabeth had grown up with several of the officers in the small town she had been raised in. They couldn\u2019t help her, but Dash knew he could. The small southern California town had been home to a drug dealer as well. A very powerful dealer. One willing to pay for the protection he needed. Unfortunately, Dane Colder had made the mistake of crossing the man. Then, in an effort to save himself had tried to sell his little girl to the perverted bastard. Dane was resting in hell now, courtesy of the dealer\u2019s bullet as Cassie watched. The man had every intention of stealing Cassie away then. There was no doubt she wouldn\u2019t have survived long. Thankfully, Elizabeth had somehow known to check on her baby and had heard the gunshots, watched in horror as her daughter was locked into one of the bedrooms as the body was being disposed of. How she slipped in and took her from under their noses Dash had no idea. One thing was certain, though; she had, and now she and her daughter were in more danger than they knew. Terrance Grange wasn\u2019t just a drug dealer. His connections to the mob and the power structure he had built around his silent little empire had tentacles running all across the United States and into several government agencies. Now Dash had to figure out a way to save them, because who to trust, just as Elizabeth had found out, wouldn\u2019t be easy to decide.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say we\u2019d have smooth sailing, I just said we could do it.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s your choice, Elizabeth. You can come with me and live, or keep running until the bastards take you down and take Cassie away from you.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a hard, deep breath. Dash knew she was aware that eventually she would fail. She didn\u2019t have the connections or the power to protect herself and her child. She was a woman alone and learning exactly what that meant.</p><p>\u201cAnd how do I know I can trust you?\u201d she asked him mockingly. \u201cI don\u2019t know you, Mr. Sinclair, and I sure as hell don\u2019t believe you would chase us for six months out of the goodness of your heart.\u201d</p> <p>Dash glanced down at Cassie. When he returned his gaze to Elizabeth he knew his own anger was flaring in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWrong, lady.\u201d He wanted to growl with the strength of his sense of ownership toward the two females.</p><p>\u201cShe saved my worthless life when it didn\u2019t matter to anyone but her. And I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll let her or the mother she loves die. Now it\u2019s your choice if you come with me or if you stay. But Cassie will be protected. She goes with me.\u201d</p><p>He watched Elizabeth\u2019s eyes widen as fear shadowed them further. Dammit, he hated seeing her eyes go dark with terror rather than the pleasure he wanted to bring her. He could see it snaking through her, knew it would be chilling her blood as she fought to find a way to fight back. She was a strong woman and having control taken from her wouldn\u2019t be easy for her to accept. But he had to do it. Had to establish authority with her and Cassie if he was going to pull this off. A frown snapped in place over her eyes. Battle glittered in the fierce depths. His cock hardened, which was more than disconcerting for the situation and location they were in.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my daughter you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she finally hissed as she leaned forward, anger shaking through her. Which sure as hell beat the lethargy he had seen in her moments before. \u201cYou don\u2019t do a damned thing without my permission.\u201d</p><p>Blood surged through his body, hot and exhilarating, as her scent flowed to him, wrapping around him. She was aroused. Not a lot, curiously aroused maybe, a bit shy. He liked that. Liked that shyness, that hesitancy. But even stronger was her sudden anger. Her child. Her responsibility. She wouldn\u2019t let it go easily. Even to him. Which meant he would have to fight her for it. He was looking forward to that fight.</p> <p>\u201cYour permission?\u201d He tried to keep his voice soft, but he was aware of the throbbing growl resonating just beneath the surface of his words. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m not asking for anything here, Elizabeth. I\u2019m telling you. I didn\u2019t travel halfway across the world and chase your pretty little butt across half the United States only to have you pat my head and send me on my way. You can accept this gracefully, or we can just go ahead and fight it out. But I promise you, baby, I know who\u2019s going to win in the end.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in incredulity.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d she finally asked him curiously. \u201cOr do you just have a death wish, Mr. Sinclair? If you know what I\u2019m facing then you know the men he\u2019s already killed to get to me. Do you really want to end up being the next bloody body he leaves in his wake?\u201d</p><p>She was smart. He had known that all along. The mocking condescension in her expression and her voice would have given any other man pause.</p><p>\u201cActually, I was thinking more along the lines of making him the next bloody body I leave in my wake,\u201d</p><p>he said casually. \u201cMake no mistake, Elizabeth. I\u2019m not so easily brought down.\u201d</p><p>More than one terrorist had tried, men more diseased than Grange with a larger network of evil to back them. Dash knew well how to play this game and how to succeed. He watched her then, sensed the battle waging within her, her instinctive knowledge that if anyone were capable of saving them, it was him. But she also doubted that there was any hope for her and Cassie to survive, period. Hope was slowly dimming within his mate.</p><p>He stood casually to his feet, laying little Cassie gently in the seat as he did so. Then he leaned in close, his hand flat on the table, his nose merely inches from hers as she stared back at him in surprise.</p> <p>\u201cWe leave in five minutes. Me and Cassie, or you, me and Cassie. As I said, it\u2019s your choice.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, her delicate little nostrils flaring as heat swept into her cheeks. He could smell her excitement now, but he also smelled blood.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you...\u201d</p><p>He leaned closer. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d he snarled in her face as she jerked back from his fury. \u201cFight me now and I promise you\u2019ll regret it. Now get ready to pull out of here. We\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her time to comment. He straightened up, giving her one last hard look before turning and stalking to the counter. The husky ex-soldier waited, watching him with narrowed, appraising eyes as he neared.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in trouble.\u201d The balding head nodded to Elizabeth as Dash stopped in front of him. It wasn\u2019t a question. The man had an extra sense for trouble. It was something you learned in combat, something you never forgot.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m here to get her out of it,\u201d Dash growled. \u201cBut I need a favor.\u201d</p><p>Mac stared back down at Elizabeth and Cassie. \u201cI haven\u2019t made the call, but there\u2019s a lot of money being offered for information on those two. \u201d His gaze turned back to Dash. The hazel depths were hard and cold. \u201cTell me what you need, boy.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>What was she to do? Elizabeth watched as Dash paid for their meals, then bought several bottles of water and snack chips as he talked to the waiter. Their voices were low, almost imperative. They were discussing more than the price for a bag of potato chips.</p><p>She bit her lip hard, breathing in deeply as she fought to clear her head of the exhaustion and pain. It had been harder in the last six or eight months. As though Grange had grown tired of playing with her. She rarely had more than a few days to rest, to work some under-the-table job for less than minimum wage before she was on the run again. And Cassie. God, it was killing Cassie and she knew it. She couldn\u2019t keep running like this. She had to find someplace to hide her baby while they both healed, body and soul. Her hand fell from the countertop, pressing against the deep gash in her thigh where the bullet had torn through the flesh. It wasn\u2019t too deep. It could have probably used a few stitches but she considered herself lucky. It could have been a hell of a lot worse. The one in her side from the basement window paled in comparison, though it, too, was fairly deep.</p><p>She had cleaned them earlier in the diner\u2019s bathroom, pouring alcohol straight into the wounds while Cassie stood trembling, watching her. It had been agonizing. More painful than actually receiving the wounds. But she knew she couldn\u2019t afford the infection. If she got sick then there was no way she could protect her baby.</p><p>Her hand trembled, her stomach roiling with remembered panic as she thought of the agonizing flight down the apartment stairwell when she fought to get to the basement. Out of habit, she had pulled into the back of the apartment building rather than from the parking lot. It was rarely used and she had felt more comfortable parking there.</p><p>The back door was hard to open from the inside, though, and she couldn\u2019t afford the precious minutes it would have taken to put Cassie down to open it. The basement door was easier and it had a bolt on the inside. She had slid the thick bolt home quickly before rushing to the line of washers and the often-open small window. She and Cassie had barely made it out before the men had busted through the door. The car had only been a few steps ahead. The doors were still unlocked and, thankfully, she kept her keys tucked in her jeans pocket rather than carrying a purse.</p><p>The past two years had been horrifying. Terrance Grange never gave up. He was like a pit bull, his jaws clamped on tight, refusing to let go or to give her any peace. At first, she had prayed that if she merely ran, forgot about going to the police, stayed quiet and hid, he would leave them alone. But he wanted Cassie. His men had made that clear. Give Terrance Cassie, then she could go free, do whatever the hell she wanted. He didn\u2019t give a damn about Elizabeth. He just wanted her daughter. The perverted bastard. She knew exactly why he wanted her baby, and she would die before she would allow it. But what if she did die and he still managed to get Cassie? Icy terror lodged in her chest at the thought. She wasn\u2019t strong enough to fight much longer. And she was learning just how adept Grange was at cutting off every avenue of escape she could find. He killed the people who tried to help her. Killed them or paid them off, leaving her with nowhere to turn. Had he paid off Dash Sinclair?</p><p>As he talked to the waiter, Elizabeth moved slowly from her seat. He turned his back on her, surveying a small row of teddy bears behind the counter, obviously intent on picking one out. Would he buy a teddy bear for a child he was going to betray?</p><p>She took a deep breath. God, she wanted to trust him. Wanted to believe he could help her, but she had learned better over the past two years. Had learned she could trust no one but herself. She eased Cassie from the seat, her breath hitching in despair at the painful thinness of her little girl\u2019s body. Then she glanced out at the parking lot, fear streaking through her. They could die out there. What the hell was she supposed to do? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get her.\u201d She jerked around, her eyes wide, arms tightening protectively around her little girl. Dash watched her somberly. For once, his gaze wasn\u2019t demanding, wasn\u2019t glittering with heat and anger. It was still, understanding, as he gripped Cassie beneath her thin arms and lifted her easily from Elizabeth\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt her.\u201d She couldn\u2019t stop the plea. For the moment, she had no choice but to trust him. She knew it and it was like a blade digging into her heart. \u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Gentle arms cradled Cassie\u2019s body against his broad chest as savage eyes stared down at her with a hint of compassion.</p> <p>\u201cGet the stuff from Mac that I bought, Elizabeth. I got Cassie a stuffed bear to make up for the one that was destroyed. And some chips, in case she gets hungry before we get to our destination. We need to leave now.\u201d His voice wasn\u2019t gentle. It was cool, dark, deep. It stroked over her shattered nerves, surprisingly enough, stilling them.</p><p>She moved carefully for the counter, watching him, terrified he would simply leave her and take Cassie to the monster searching for her. Her body was tense, every muscle poised to jump and fight when she reached the bar.</p><p>\u201cTrust him, little girl.\u201d The waiter handed her the sack, his hazel eyes kind as she glanced at him. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth flinched in surprise. How could he know? How did he know anything? But there was nothing else forthcoming. She took the bag and moved quickly back to the man intent on taking over her life. Her life and her child.</p><p>Stepping into the swirling snow was like entering an isolated vacuum of icy beauty. It was nearly a white-out condition, with at least six inches of the thick, slick crystals built up on the ground.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t travel in this storm.\u201d Elizabeth shivered as Dash quickly unlocked the rear passenger door. He deposited a sleeping Cassie into the back seat before jerking a blanket over her. He then unlocked the front and urged Elizabeth in.</p><p>\u201cGet in.\u201d His order was less than polite. \u201cI figure those boys you have chasing you aren\u2019t too damned stupid. They\u2019ll guess the best time to catch you is during a snowstorm with a four-by-four. We have just enough time to pull out of here and get ahead of them.\u201d</p><p>She jumped into the seat, staring at the unfamiliar interior in confusion. It was the most advanced vehicle she had ever laid eyes on. She had seen the military vehicles before, of course, but had never been inside one. She doubted she could even reach across the console between the passenger seat and the driver\u2019s seat to hit out at her new captor. She glanced back at her sleeping daughter then. Cassie had been strapped into the single, wide bucket seat in the back, her head resting on a pillow that lay on the wide bench beside her.</p><p>\u201cBuckle up.\u201d He jumped into the driver\u2019s seat and started the ignition.</p><p>\u201cThis is a blizzard, you know?\u201d She did as he ordered, though, and buckled the seatbelt securely. He stared out the window, considering, then he shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve seen worse.\u201d</p><p>Dash reversed the vehicle, a pensive look on his face as he exited the diner\u2019s parking lot.</p> <p>\u201cMac, the owner of the diner, is ex-Special Forces,\u201d he told her quietly as they hit the deserted interstate. \u201cMost of us stick together. I\u2019m pretty certain he\u2019ll cover for us, give Grange\u2019s men a bogus vehicle and directions to follow, but just in case, we won\u2019t be on the interstate long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth gripped the edge of her seat as he picked up speed, making better time than she could have ever imagined on the snow packed road. The windshield, amazingly, had night vision, giving the driver a clear view of the world outside without the betraying beacon of the headlights. It was much more technological than she would have liked. She suddenly felt as though she had been thrown into a twilight zone. It made her off-balance, made everything around her seem a bit surreal.</p><p>\u201cWho did you steal the Hummer from?\u201d She rubbed her arms nervously as she fought the weariness dragging at her mind.</p><p>He flashed her a surprised look. \u201cI didn\u2019t steal it. I borrowed it. There was an Army depot close by. The Major in charge allowed me use of it to get where I needed to go. We won\u2019t be keeping it long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that rather unusual?\u201d She turned, bracing her back against the edge of the seat so she could watch him more closely.</p><p>The dashboard lights reflected back on a hard, primal expression. He didn\u2019t glance over at her, though she had no doubt he could tell every move she was making.</p><p>He shrugged lazily as he pushed the vehicle faster through the thickening snow.</p> <p>\u201cNot normal, but not unusual exactly. I\u2019m inactive for the moment, but still part of the services. My record speaks for itself and the Major at the depot had heard of me. There was no risk to loaning it.\u201d</p><p>Silence stretched between them once again. Outside, the world was a blanket of white, piling against the large eighteen-wheelers parked here and there. Thankfully, it seemed most people had heeded the warnings about the coming blizzard and weren\u2019t out on the roads. So far, they had passed no stranded motorists.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here? And what the hell do you want with my daughter?\u201d Elizabeth couldn\u2019t stand it any longer.</p><p>She was trapped in a blizzard with a man she didn\u2019t know and had no idea if she could trust. A hard, dangerous man.</p><p>His hands tightened on the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie to you, Elizabeth. I came to help. I got Cassie\u2019s letter the day I was returning stateside. When the letters stopped coming I had my Major check into it.\u201d He paused for a moment, breathing deeply. \u201cI thought something died inside me when he told me what everyone thought happened to you and Cassie. I lost something I didn\u2019t know I had. When her last letter came, nothing could have kept me away.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth heard the throb of pain in his voice, a fury that confused her. She didn\u2019t know what her daughter had written in her letters. Cassie had sworn she wouldn\u2019t tell the soldier the danger she was in, and Elizabeth didn\u2019t have the heart to refuse to allow her to write him. It was during one of the rare times she had managed to get Cassie into school. She had bought illegal records, had nearly gotten herself arrested and spent countless nights pacing the floor in fear so Cassie could attend classes once again. So her child could have some sort of normalcy while her mother fought to make sense of the danger they were in.</p><p>The teacher had given the children a list of service men who didn\u2019t receive mail and a permission slip to allow the kids to write. Cassie had been excited over the name she chose. The fairy said this one, Momma. She had giggled as she waved the piece of paper with the name and address on it. He\u2019s got a nice name, Momma. I bet he\u2019s a good daddy. She was fascinated with the idea of good daddies. Daddies who didn\u2019t hit their little girls, who didn\u2019t bargain with their children\u2019s bodies, then get killed in front of their eyes. The fairy, Elizabeth wasn\u2019t sure about. Cassie had been talking about the fairy since her father\u2019s murder. Elizabeth never pushed her about it. She never questioned her. Just like the elves and the unicorns and the other fantasies that played a part in Cassie\u2019s vivid imagination. Elizabeth didn\u2019t have the heart to take it away from her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t owe us your life, Mr. Sinclair.\u201d She shook her head at that thought. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can bear being the cause of any more deaths.\u201d</p><p>He was a strong man. A determined man. But even he had his weaknesses and a bullet didn\u2019t make allowances for any man.</p><p>\u201cI owe her more than my life.\u201d He finally shrugged. \u201cMight as well give in, Elizabeth. You aren\u2019t going to win this one.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth shook her head. She was tired, dazed. How could she be expected to fight him when she knew how desperately they needed him? She was living on nerves alone now rather than a clear mind and well rested body. It wouldn\u2019t be much longer before she made a mistake and when she did, she knew Grange would be there waiting.</p><p>How had her daughter managed to find someone like Dash Sinclair to exchange letters with? What instinct had guided the child to choose his name above all others? Cassie claimed it was her fairy. Elizabeth was terribly afraid it was just another joke fate was playing on them both.</p><p>\u201cShe cried for a week after I refused to let her write anymore,\u201d she finally said tiredly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know she had posted that last letter to you. I don\u2019t know how she found the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing for you she did,\u201d he grunted, though he still hadn\u2019t looked over at her. \u201cIf she hadn\u2019t, you\u2019d be in a hell of a mess right now.\u201d</p><p>She was already in a hell of a mess, though she held back from pointing that out. The snow was getting thicker and she didn\u2019t want to distract him, didn\u2019t want him to become angry and possibly lose control of the vehicle. They were still running much faster than she thought was safe.</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d He was sitting comfortably in his own seat, gripping the steering wheel confidently, his big, lean body relaxed. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little snowstorm.\u201d</p><p>Just a little snowstorm? She refrained from an unladylike snort. It was almost a complete white-out. But as dangerous as she knew it was, she couldn\u2019t help but admire the sheer power and beauty of the storm. It enclosed them within the Hummer, insulated them from the rest of the world in an intimacy that left her mouth dry.</p><p>\u201cYou should try to nap.\u201d His voice was quiet, deep. There was nothing dangerous or threatening in his tone. It lulled her mind at a time that she knew she should be even further on guard. The dark velvet roughness of his voice had her longing to reach out to him, to be enfolded in the strength of his arms, to lean on his strength. She was tired. Elizabeth had known for weeks that she was approaching a point where her body would soon begin faltering. The thought of that had terrified her. The fact that this big, dangerous man was suddenly encouraging her to do so, at once made her nervous as a woman, even as it stilled the fears that often swept through her mind.</p><p>\u201cI will. Later.\u201d She wasn\u2019t about to go to sleep yet. Not until she was certain of what was going on.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn army buddy owns a ranch across the state line,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay there a few days until I can get further with another contact I have. I\u2019m hoping to have you and Cassie in a secured area within a week. We\u2019ll decide our best course of action then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will?\u201d she asked him archly. She had a feeling she wouldn\u2019t have a lot of opinion in whatever decision he made. Dash Sinclair didn\u2019t look like a man who shared anything well, least of all responsibility.</p><p>His lips quirked. It was sexy. That thought slammed into her system like a thunderbolt. Dear God, how long had it been since she had noticed anything about a man other than whether or not he was the enemy?</p><p>That little smile was incredibly sensual. A firm, decisive shift of his lips that looked erotic, making her wonder how they would feel against her own. And that was something she definitely shouldn\u2019t be thinking about right now. Not while her daughter\u2019s life was hanging in the balance. Not while the man she was lusting after could be either friend or foe. Until she knew which, she had no business allowing her body to heat for him.</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d he finally allowed with an edge of amusement. \u201cAs long as the two of you are safe, then you can help decide.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth rolled her eyes at the conditions. As if she was going to accept that one. But she couldn\u2019t stop the grin that tugged at her own lips. \u201cNow that\u2019s not nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to be nice.\u201d But he was restraining a grin. She could see it. It made her wonder what he would look like if he smiled.</p><p>\u201cWell, you weren\u2019t succeeding, either.\u201d Her eyelids drooped as she relaxed against the seat, but they didn\u2019t close. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was so tired. How long had it been since she had slept? Since she had felt safe enough to close her eyes and allow just a few hours of deep escape? Not since the night she had arrived at her ex-husband\u2019s to check on Cassie and heard the sounds of gunshots.</p><p>She flinched, opening her eyes and staring desperately out the windshield. Would she always see it? The view from the window of her husband\u2019s lakefront house. Cassie struggling in Terrance Grange\u2019s hold as he aimed a gun and delivered yet another round in Dane\u2019s body. He had laughed when Cassie screamed out her daddy\u2019s name. His evil, scarred face had held lustful intent as he stared at her baby. A baby. She shuddered, holding back the rage, bottling it inside her to keep from screaming out in fury.</p><p>She was silent, though she was aware of Dash glancing at her several times. Elizabeth jumped when he moved easily, then breathed out a strangled sigh when he turned the radio on. Soothing, soft music filled the interior of the Hummer, wrapping around her, lulling her back into that near sleep existence she always feared.</p> <p>\u201cSleep, Elizabeth,\u201d he whispered soothingly. \u201cI\u2019ll wake you when we arrive at the ranch. I promise you. You and Cassie are both safe.\u201d</p><p>Safe. Cassie was safe. For now. That was all that mattered.</p><p>\u201cWe have to hide her,\u201d she sighed, breathing out deeply as her head rested against the back of the seat, her eyes finally closing. \u201cHe can\u2019t touch her, Dash. I can\u2019t let him touch her...\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>It was daybreak before Dash pulled into the back of the small motel just across the Kansas-Missouri border. He was dead tired and the snow had gotten hazardous hours before. There was no way he was about to make the trek to Mike\u2019s ranch until he had a chance to rest. Until he had a chance to get a break from the intriguing scent of woman, shy arousal and sleep flushed skin. Damn, she had been pretty, slouched in the seat beside him, her head often resting on the wide console between them. Once, he had dared to touch the silk of her hair, sliding his fingers through it and feeling the curls cupping his fingers. She had the softest hair he had ever known, with surprisingly thick curls spiraling down her back. Hair that made a man think of sex, wild and sweet. But overshadowing the lust was the need to protect.</p> <p>He wanted to pull her into his arms, hold her close to his chest and assure her she was safe. Promise her they would protect Cassie. Together. Swear the earth and moon if it would ease the haunting shadows he had seen in her eyes. But he knew he couldn\u2019t do that. Couldn\u2019t make the promises even if she would accept them. The chances of failure, at the moment, were too high. All he could do was fight with every weapon he knew to assure their safety. He was confident he had enough fight to do it. But first, they all needed to sleep. To rest, at least for today.</p><p>Thankfully, there had been a drive-through open in the heart of town serving hot food. A quick stop and he had enough to feed himself, the woman and child. They had both slept as he ordered and collected the food. Next, he had stopped and gassed up the Hummer, careful to take the keys out of the ignition as he stood at the gas pump. He wouldn\u2019t put it past her to take off and run again. Hell, it was what he would have done in her place.</p><p>When he got back in the vehicle, Cassie was still sleeping, but her mother was awake. Not exactly aware\u2014she hadn\u2019t managed more than two hours restless sleep\u2014but she was awake. He kept the coffee he had purchased hidden in the sacks from the drive-through in the back until he pulled into the motel, checked in and then drove to their assigned room. It was far enough from the main road that it hid the Hummer and gave Dash enough confidence that he would hear another vehicle if it pulled in. Not that many others would be able to navigate the slight incline that led to the back rooms. He didn\u2019t waste time with words. He wanted the comfort of the room, the news, and a handy telephone. The cell wasn\u2019t exactly dependable in this weather. Getting out of the Hummer he moved around the vehicle to the passenger side, opened the door and lifted Cassie from the seat as Elizabeth moved stiffly into frigid air. The snow went halfway up her legs but she never showed the obvious discomfort. She trudged behind him, just as silent as he was, as he made a path to the door. He swiped the card, opened it carefully and then stepped inside. Turning, he watched the slowly lightening day as Elizabeth moved quickly past him. It was still dark out and forecasters were expecting the storm to go on through the day. Hell, they all needed time to rest anyway before heading to Mike\u2019s madhouse. Elizabeth was flipping lights on as he closed the door and walked to the farthest bed. He laid Cassie down on it slowly, pulling the blanket over her as her mother moved to her. Elizabeth had a damp cloth in her hand. She used it to quickly clean Cassie\u2019s sleep-flushed cheeks, her small hands. A smile tugged at his lips at the motherly response.</p><p>She slipped Cassie\u2019s shoes off, then lifted her gently and pulled the blankets over her. It was all done very efficiently, very economically. Dash shook his head, turning away from the sight. He didn\u2019t understand mothers. But hell, he\u2019d never had one. He had turned out fine, hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>Then he thought of Cassie. He stopped at the end of the bed and turned back. He had survived because he was tough. Hard. Damn, he didn\u2019t want her that way. He wanted to see the sweet, charming little girl who had saved his life with her letters. He wanted to see her smile, see her secure. Mothered.</p><p>He shook his head as he turned and stalked back to the door and into the storm. He had clothes and supplies for the mother and child. Things they would need. He had been hauling the damned things around for months, the minute he had realized that each time they were found they were forced to leave damned near everything they owned except the clothes on their backs. Minutes later he reentered the room, instantly finding Elizabeth in a defensive position in front of Cassie as the door opened. He set the large tote he carried on the floor then went back out. When he returned with his own bag and the food and coffee, she was sitting at the end of Cassie\u2019s bed, watching the door.</p> <p>\u201cThere are gowns, clothes and stuff in the tote.\u201d He set the fast food bags on the small table. \u201cI\u2019ve bought stuff here and there as I realized everything was being destroyed from place to place. You should have everything you need.\u201d</p><p>He saw her startled look as she glanced at the hard plastic container.</p><p>\u201cI need a fast shower.\u201d He pulled his service revolver from the personal bag he carried on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIf anyone comes to the door, let me know. Otherwise, there\u2019s food and coffee in the bag. Plenty enough for everyone.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t expect a response. He didn\u2019t get one. She just stared up at him with those big sad eyes, so much like Cassie\u2019s, as though she couldn\u2019t decide if she were still dreaming or awake. Dash ached to hold her. He couldn\u2019t stop the need, so he didn\u2019t fight it building in his body, but he kept his arms, his thoughts, and his needs to himself. He had a lot of practice at that. Knew just how it was done. Control. That was all it took. But those shell-shocked eyes did something to him that made his guts tremble with an ache so unfamiliar, so imperative, it was damned hard to fight. Her eyes went to the gun as he stood there. An uncontrollable flare of fear flashed in her gaze. He couldn\u2019t blame her for it. But he hated it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out in a bit.\u201d He had to get away from her. If he didn\u2019t, he was going to touch her. If he touched her, stopping would be hell. And he would have to stop. Now was not the time or the place. He turned the television on as he passed it\u2014the steady noise would keep her nerves calm, he hoped\u2014then moved into the bathroom. If he didn\u2019t get a shower and settle his own libido down, he was going to go stark raving mad. His cock was waging a constant war with his head. It was hard, aching, needing her. Just a taste of her.</p><p>Damn, the woman\u2019s scent had been like a call to arms to his dick. It hadn\u2019t relaxed in the miserable hours of being confined in the Hummer with her. It was still steel-hard and insistent. Not exactly a condition he found any comfort in. It wasn\u2019t as though Elizabeth was even in any shape to realize it. And if she did, it was the wrong place and the wrong time. First, came Cassie\u2019s safety. Then he could claim the mother.</p><p>He shook his head as he entered the small bathroom, closing the door behind him, leaving it unsecured. He stared down at the lock and sighed wearily. Building trust was a bitch.</p> <p>Elizabeth opened the lid to the tote slowly, sinking to her knees and staring down at the contents in</p><p>surprise. The clothes were all new. Some designer labels, some not. All were functional and would be easily cleaned, a must for an eight-year-old child. Stacked within the tote were clothes for her as well. She flushed as she pulled a pair of lacy thongs from the neatly folded contents. They were her size, but so delicate and sexy she would have blushed to wear them.</p><p>There were nightgowns and robes for her and Cassie, socks and dependable shoes still in their boxes. She pulled a dark blue, little girl\u2019s gown free. It was long, cotton, with long sleeves and a lacy collar. There was a robe to match it. Several packages of little girl\u2019s panties and socks, unopened. Next, she pulled one of the gowns and robes he had bought for her out. A smile tugged at her lips. It was flannel and long, with a robe to match. Something to keep her warm. With it was a pair of thick, padded socks. Had the man forgotten anything?</p><p>She shook her head in confusion, wondering when reality had ceased to exist. From one minute to the next she had gone from pure terror to a sense of tentative hope. Surely if he was going to turn her and Cassie over to Grange, he would have done so by now.</p><p>But could she really trust her own instincts? She rose to her feet, hearing the water cascading in the other room. Elizabeth swallowed tightly. God, she wanted to trust him, but fear was like a demon riding her mercilessly. The gun and the Hummer would get her closer to her own destination. She looked at the clothes again, touched the soft gowns and wanted to scream out in fury. She couldn\u2019t trust, no matter how desperately she wanted to. No matter how her soul screamed out in protest, she had to get Cassie away from this new, possibly unknown threat. The sound of the shower was loud, the pipes groaning. She hadn\u2019t heard the lock click in place and she was desperate. She stood and moved for the door.</p><p>Stilling the tremors of exhaustion and nerves that wanted to shudder through her body wasn\u2019t easy. She hated the thought of betraying the only person left to stand between her and her enemies, but she couldn\u2019t bear the thought that she was wrong once again, either.</p><p>As she neared the bathroom door, she thought of the others she had trusted. Admittedly, there hadn\u2019t been many. There was the police investigator in Arizona. She hoped he was living well on the little payoff he must have taken to reveal her location. On the other hand, she remembered too well the news report of the death of the auto mechanic who had helped her escape after repairing her car. He was dead. Because of her.</p><p>Her hand gripped the doorknob, turning it slowly, quietly. He couldn\u2019t take the gun into the shower with him; it would have to be lying within reach. She inched the door open, slowly, carefully...</p><p>Dash leaned his head against the wall of the shower stall, grimacing almost painfully. Don\u2019t, baby. Please don\u2019t. The words whispered through his mind as Elizabeth\u2019s scent stirred the air around him. Even his balls tightened at the smell. Female, sensually warm, determined, frightened. Her fear made his heart ache. Her warmth made his cock jerk demandingly. There was nothing about her that didn\u2019t make him hot and hungry.</p><p>Steam collected in misty tendrils, wrapping the smell of her around his senses, driving a bolt of hunger through the pit of his stomach straight to his throbbing erection. He could see her in his mind\u2019s eye, focused, steeling herself against her fear as she moved into the small room. Trust was essential, he reminded himself firmly. She had to know he could protect them, that he would protect them. She had to know he was strong enough, confident enough, to even stop her if he had to. But once he confronted her, would he have the strength not to touch her? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Don\u2019t do it, Elizabeth. He clenched his teeth as the whisper of her slight body moving past the doorframe had him tensing expectantly. Leave! Don\u2019t let me touch you! If he did, he would never stop. One taste could never be enough. She would be a banquet to his senses, a feast of erotic delicacies. But only if she trusted him. Only if she knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt, he was there for her and Cassie. Not for their enemies.</p><p>Building trust was a bitch, he reminded himself. Better to get it started and get it over with now. He couldn\u2019t help her if he had to guard against her as well as the men hunting her. If he could get past this initial surge of defiance, then they had a chance.</p><p>The defiance was tempting the animal he fought to keep contained. The one that knew this was his mate. Knew this woman was everything he had searched for in his life. Keeping it contained was a battle he knew would erode quickly. Already, within hours of finding her, there was little he could think about except sinking into the warmth and heat between her thighs. Drowning in the hot depths of her cunt as she tightened around him. Never, at any time in his life, had a woman affected him quite this way. He let her move into the room. He felt the hot water pelting his skin, smelled her scent growing closer, tracked her with every sense he possessed as she moved steadily to the gun and the keys that lay on the shelf above the toilet.</p> <p>Her steps were light. Damn, she would make a perfect mate. The thought shocked him, but he realized the truth of it instantly. She was light and steady, resolved in her course of action and making almost no sound as she went for the weapon. She would fight beside him, no matter the battle, physical or emotional. If her heart were committed, then it would be as fierce as any she-wolf\u2019s. She was a bundle of dynamite; destructive to the enemy, life-giving to those she loved. But right now, until she knew if he were friend or foe, she would always suspect enemy first. She would always defy him. He couldn\u2019t allow that. He gave her just enough time to feel victory. Just enough time to allow her fingers to whisper a caress over the weapon\u2019s handgrip before he moved. The shower curtain flew back and he was out of the tub, water spraying as he gripped her shoulders, pushed the door closed then anchored her against it. The move was made within a second, with barely a whisper of a sound, though he had expected her to fight him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t scream. Damn her to hell and back, she didn\u2019t even cry out. No more than a breath of air disturbed the silence as her gasp, quickly reined in, whispered past her lips and her eyes stared up at him in startled fear and surprise a second before her knee cocked and let loose. Dash barely had a second\u2019s warning before he could block the groin shot. One part of him admired the speed and effectiveness of her move while the other part was amazed at her daring. One thigh pressed hard and tight between hers, lifting her to her tiptoes, grinding against the soft, hot pad of her pussy. Her response was instantaneous, though less than welcome by her, he could tell. She strained against him, jerking at the manacled hold he took of her wrists as he locked them behind her head with one hand, arching her breasts into his chest, his knee rubbing against her heat.</p><p>Lust was pounding through his system with every hard beat of his heart, stripping the veneer of civilization that he kept pulled around him, tempting the hunger gnawing at his loins.</p><p>\u201cStay still, dammit. I\u2019m not going to hurt you,\u201d he growled as she twisted against him, despite the fact that she wasn\u2019t gaining any headway in her struggles.</p><p>She was frightened. He could hear it in her harsh breathing, the struggle to hold back her sobs. She had taken a chance and now she would fear the punishment he would exact. But he was careful not to hurt her. He restrained her, controlled her struggles, but he knew he wasn\u2019t leaving so much as the slightest mark against her skin. Skin already bruised, already wounded by too many hard knocks. He pressed against her, holding her to the door as he stared down at her silently, feeling her soft tummy cushion his raging cock. And she hadn\u2019t missed the impact of the steel-hard flesh pressing against her either. That or the imperative need he allowed to glitter in his eyes. One hand threaded through her hair, tilting her head back. His head lowered slowly as he stared down at her, watching her eyes dilate, her skin flush then pale alarmingly.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I let you go,\u201d he allowed the growl building in his chest to echo in his words, \u201cif I were you, I would turn that sweet ass around and hightail it back into the bedroom with Cassie. If you hesitate, even for a second, if you so much as breathe a hesitation, then I\u2019m going to fuck you so hard and so deep against this door that you\u2019ll never hide your screams of pleasure from that child sleeping in the other room. Do you understand me, Elizabeth?\u201d</p><p>His control was a fragile thing right now. The only thing stilling the hunger to taste her parted lips was the knowledge that Cassie slept only feet away from them. The fact that if he tasted her, he would need more. Always more.</p><p>Her eyes widened further, the blue darkening in shock, in amazement. Strangely enough, also with a flare of arousal. Thankfully, she nodded quickly, but nothing could still the fact that her full breasts were rising and falling sharply against his chest. And her nipples were hard. Damn her to hell, they were hard as little pebbles, raking across his damp chest like pinpoints of searing flames beneath the covering of her shirt. He moved his hand from her hair, gripping her wrists individually. Before she could resist, he wrapped the fingers of one of her small hands around the girth of his cock. They had no hope of circling it fully. She had small, delicate\u2014God, soft hands. His groan was throttled, a sound of agonizing pleasure.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he snarled desperately. \u201cNever, Elizabeth, try this on me again unless you\u2019re prepared to accept the consequences. Because next time, I promise you, I won\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back from her quickly, his heart nearly exploding in his chest at the brief hesitation of her fingers on his erection as he released her. Then she snatched her hand back, holding it to her chest, staring up at him, her lips parted, startled awareness darkening her eyes further.</p><p>\u201cGo. Now.\u201d He clenched his fists. Fought his hunger.</p> <p>She gasped. In a second she turned, fumbled with the doorknob and fled the small room as Dash threw his head back and grimaced against the building fury in his loins. Damn her to hell. He was starving for the taste of her.</p><p>He stepped back into the shower, slammed the curtain closed and flipped on the cold water. Son of a bitch. This hard-on would kill him.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>She should be running. Elizabeth paced the motel room, her body shuddering with wicked, pulsing tremors that teased at the emptiness between her thighs. She should have bundled Cassie up and just run. Storm or no storm. She was in over her head here in a way she feared was certain to drown her. She didn\u2019t even know him. That thought seared her senses as she collapsed into one of the two chairs by the table. She knew nothing except the short, cryptic notes he had sent her daughter for a year. Sometimes humorous, but always with a dry, wry humor that had Elizabeth shaking her head. Cassie had liked them, though. She would giggle and say Dash just had trouble telling tales, to give him time and she would teach him. And perhaps in a way, she had. The last few months Dash had written to Cassie, he told her the oddest things. How the scents of the desert were different from home. The sound of a helicopter. The quiet, cold nights in the mountains of a land Cassie would likely never see herself. Little things. But not exactly phrased the way other men would say it. At least, no men Elizabeth had ever known before or since.</p><p>She stared over at the television. The newscasters were once again covering the story of the amazing discovery of the Feline Breeds. The men and women who had come forward were the wonders of the world at the moment. News reports had covered several rescues of other Breeds, a few Wolf Breeds but mostly Feline Breeds. They were totalling in the hundreds now, six months after the first newsbreak. Amazing. Elizabeth shook her head. The cruelty of man never failed to amaze her. They had been created, trained, then hunted as though their DNA made them no more than the animals they were genetically related to. Like a modern day safari, uncaring of the brutality or the horror they perpetrated, the Genetics Council had done everything to destroy their creations when they couldn\u2019t control them. Yet, somehow, rather than reverting to the savagery that was obviously a part of their DNA, the Breeds had instead maintained an honor, a strength, that had helped them to survive the cruelties. Elizabeth envied them in many ways. Even the females were strong, tough, trained to fight and capable of protecting themselves. It made her feel insignificant, very lacking, and she hated that feeling. Hated knowing her own faults, her own weaknesses. She hated the fact that she wanted nothing more than to feel Dash\u2019s arms around her again, for just a few wild moments, to forget the dangers and the pain and to be a woman once again.</p><p>She sighed wearily and pulled a cup of hot black coffee from one of the sacks. There was a cola there as well. The other bags were packed with food. Two larger ones held five Styrofoam breakfast platters. The smaller ones held a variety of biscuits. But she imagined a man that large could eat a lot of food. Her stomach rumbled imperatively and she shook her head at the timing. She needed to think. To run. Not realize the smell of food was so enticing that she had centered on it more than she had escape. But it wasn\u2019t as enticing as what she had held in her hand moments before. Elizabeth felt her entire body heat; flush in what she assured herself was embarrassment. Liquid warmth gathered in her vagina, spilling silkily along the swollen lips of her cunt. Her response to him had been as hard, as shocking, as a lightning bolt.</p><p>She sipped at the coffee, her eyes fluttering in pleasure at the taste, then dug out one of the platters and a plastic fork. Okay. She couldn\u2019t think while she was starving. And she had to think. Dash Sinclair was going to be more of a problem than she had ever anticipated. He could possibly be more man than she had ever encountered.</p><p>God. He was definitely a lot of man. Thick and hard, his erection had shocked her with its size. But his body in general had shocked her. Darkly tanned flesh stretched and rippled over hard-packed muscle. It wasn\u2019t the awkward, graceless look of obscenely bulging muscle, rather it was corded, hard, filling out each inch of his body and shimmering beneath the skin with an aura of intense power. Like an animal, well honed and conditioned and used to hard, intense battle. She swallowed the fluffy eggs and quickly polished off the breakfast before turning back to the television. It was a good thing she had eaten before watching the news, because what she saw would have easily put her off the meal.</p> <p>They showed the victim\u2019s face, if you wanted to call him a victim. Elizabeth sat up straight, staring in shock at the image on the screen. She knew him. It was the same bastard who had tried to ambush her and Cassie in their apartment the day before. He wouldn\u2019t be ambushing anyone else. He was found in the basement, his throat cut. The newscaster called it a professional, highly skilled hit. He still carried his money. The diamond ring on his hand. His credit cards. His identity was given, as was the police record and information on the current warrants for his arrest. She trembled, barely aware that the shower had shut off and the bathroom door had opened. A sudden flashing memory had her gaze swinging to Dash. Beside the gun had been a long, curved, sheathed knife. The wide hilt had looked imposing. Now she knew why. He stopped, gazing back at her somberly as she stared at him in shock. For the first time she realized that Dash\u2019s confidence wasn\u2019t as misplaced as she had feared it was. He appeared to be a welloiled fighting machine because that was exactly what he was.</p><p>\u201cYou killed him,\u201d she whispered, watching him in amazement. No one who had gone against Grange\u2019s men had succeeded. They were either bought off or killed, according to how disposable his hit men considered them to be. Dash had been neither bought off, nor harmed. He had killed instead. Broad shoulders, still gleaming with moisture, shrugged carelessly. He wore soft sweatpants and white socks, but nothing more. In one hand he carried the clothes he had worn into the bathroom, in the other he carried the holstered gun and the knife. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes went to the television, narrowing on the report as the reporter spoke into the camera.</p><p>\u201cTook them long enough to report it,\u201d he grunted as he walked over to the bed he had lain his leather case on.</p><p>He pulled out a black plastic bag, stored his dirty clothes then repacked them. The weapons were tucked beneath his pillow.</p> <p>\u201cYou killed him,\u201d she repeated, careful to keep her voice low in case Cassie woke up. Dash turned back to her. There was no regret in his gaze, no sense of remorse or apology. His gaze was steady, though slightly quizzical, as though he didn\u2019t understand her shock.</p><p>\u201cHe was a diseased animal, Elizabeth,\u201d he said with a distinct air of unconcern. \u201cHe was waiting on you, certain you would come back, and intended to make you and Cassie pay for getting away. Anyone else who tries for you will die just as quickly.\u201d</p><p>Silence filled the room. Elizabeth could only stare at him as he moved away from the bed, taking the other chair and pulling two of the platters free as well as the last cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cYou need to take a shower and sleep the rest of the day. From now on, we travel at night. If this blizzard has blown over by evening then we\u2019ll head to a ranch just out of town. I fought with Mike overseas. He\u2019s dependable, and he can put me in touch with some people who can help us.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth shook her head, wondering at the dream-like fog that seemed to fill her mind. He was talking as though he hadn\u2019t been forced to kill a man because of her and Cassie. As though his life had never been in danger and he had done nothing out of the ordinary.</p> <p>She could feel her heart racing at the knowledge, her mind scrambling to accept what he had done. No one had been able to stand against Grange\u2019s goons before. They always fell, one way or the other. And yet here Dash sat, remarkably unconcerned about the danger involved. Of course he wasn\u2019t concerned. She blinked warily. He was stronger than they were, tougher and smarter and evidently a hell of a lot more determined. For the first time she realized just how intent he was on protecting her and Cassie.</p><p>He glanced over at Cassie, a light frown creasing his brow as her little snuffles of sleep filled the room. Following his gaze Elizabeth watched as the little girl moved beneath the blanket, a little smile tilting her lips, her legs stretching out as though in play.</p><p>\u201cShe sounds like a little pup when she sleeps.\u201d Elizabeth shook her head, trying to accept the changes occurring so quickly. \u201cShe\u2019s always done that. At least I know she\u2019s sleeping, not dreaming, when she does.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Cassie had nightmares. Sometimes, she couldn\u2019t sleep well for days straight. Right now, she was stretched under the blankets, her slight body relaxed and comfortable. Her dark hair framed her sleep-flushed features as she breathed softly, evenly. No. There were no nightmares now.</p><p>\u201cI want you to wake her up. She needs to eat and shower, then she can sleep until we head out tonight. I want her alert and focused.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth swung around, anger erupting through her system then. Protector or not, she wasn\u2019t about to allow him to ruin the only true sleep Cassie had known in weeks.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have any idea how long it\u2019s been since she\u2019s slept so well?\u201d she hissed. \u201cI\u2019m not about to wake her up.\u201d</p><p>He sighed deeply. There was no returning anger, just determination.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t wake her up, keep her up for a while, then she\u2019ll sleep while we\u2019re awake and be asleep when we all need to be at our best. Or even worse, too damned tired to hold onto us, or run if she has to. We have only a few nights to get her ready for the trip we\u2019ll hopefully be making next. Now wake her up, or I will.\u201d</p><p>His gaze was level, commanding.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just make these decisions without talking to me first, Sinclair.\u201d She was shaking, fury nearly robbing her of any control. \u201cThat\u2019s my daughter. And I won\u2019t allow you to jerk her out of a perfectly sound sleep just because you say so. And you sure as hell aren\u2019t making any more surprise trips with her without letting me in on what\u2019s going on first.\u201d</p><p>Her fists clenched with her anger as she stared up at him. He watched her with that cool, assessing gaze, as though she were an amusing little insect under inspection at the moment.</p><p>\u201cTonight, with any luck, we head to Mike Toler\u2019s ranch, just outside town,\u201d he repeated, then surprised her further. \u201cMike is former C.I.A. and has some contacts and information I need about a possible safe house in Virginia. Until I find out if that house is available to me, I don\u2019t want to say more. Mike will shelter us as long as we need, but I only want to stay a day or so. Long enough to acclimate Cassie to me, and to give you a chance to rest. Period. Then we leave. Satisfied?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips tightly together. He wasn\u2019t being mocking or sarcastic. He seemed perfectly serious.</p> <p>\u201cLet Cassie sleep a while longer,\u201d she stated firmly. \u201cAnother hour. She\u2019s just a baby, Dash. She needs this.\u201d</p><p>She moved to step around him then, to make her way back to Cassie\u2019s bed, when the pain in her thigh suddenly intensified, sending her stumbling as she forced herself not to cry out with the shocking strike of agony through the muscle.</p><p>She knew better, was her next thought, to move without thinking first. The pain from the flesh wound had been growing steadily and she had a feeling it was going to bring her problems. Now, it had thrown her back against Dash\u2019s body as he caught her against his chest, then swung her into his arms. She gasped. His chest was just as hot, just as firm, as it had been in the bathroom. His arms flexed beneath her back and thighs, muscles rippling with strength as he stalked to the sink counter across the room.</p><p>\u201cI forgot about your leg.\u201d Self-disgust filled his voice. \u201cI should have taken care of that first thing.\u201d</p><p>He sat her on the counter before she even had a chance to get used to being in his arms.</p><p>\u201cStay put,\u201d he growled, giving her a hard, fierce look.</p><p>She stayed put. But she watched him closely as he went back to the bed, pulled out a small bag from his larger case then lifted one of the chairs and carried both back to her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s check your side first,\u201d he announced. \u201cI know you cut yourself shimmying out of that window.\u201d</p><p>She looked back at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cA piece of your shirt hung on that broken window,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was blood on it.\u201d He pointed out the rip as he started lifting her shirt.</p><p>Elizabeth tried to breathe in deeply, naturally, as his fingers probed the tender area gently.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too bad,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWhen you get out of the shower we\u2019ll put some salve on it and bandage it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded silently as he lowered her shirt again and then watched her expectantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to put you back on the floor. Take off your jeans so I can check that leg.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth blinked. Out of her jeans? \u201cNo,\u201d she snapped hoarsely. The wound was high on her thigh, several inches above her knee and to the side. There wasn\u2019t a chance in hell...</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me cut them off you, Elizabeth.\u201d He sighed, staring down at her. \u201cWe\u2019re both tired and both riding our tempers. If I don\u2019t take care of this it could become infected and then you won\u2019t have a chance of helping Cassie. Is that what you want?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cThat\u2019s dirty,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>His expression grew harder. \u201cThat\u2019s the truth. Now take the jeans off, before I take them off for you.\u201d</p><p>His hands went for the snap. She slapped them back, almost laughing at the look of startled surprise that flashed across his face. His eyes narrowed, the dark golden-brown depths glittering in determination.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she muttered, sliding off the counter, thankful her T-shirt was at least long enough to cover what was most important. \u201cI\u2019m starting to think you\u2019re too bossy, though.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. He didn\u2019t say a word, but the sound held a wealth of male superiority. She flashed him a resentful look as she eased the jeans down, biting her lip as the material scraped over the wound.</p><p>\u201cUp.\u201d He gripped her hips and lifted her back to the counter; the jeans still hung at her knees. \u201cYou forgot your shoes.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth forgot her sanity. He lifted her foot, propping it on his thigh and unlacing the cheap sneaker carefully. His long hair feathered forward, the roughened, damp strands caressing her upper knee as he removed the shoe. He shifted to the next, his hair stroking the skin over her other knee as he removed it as well. Her whole body flushed.</p><p>Had a man ever affected her this deeply? Had one ever made her long to just touch him, to just stroke his flesh and revel in the feel of it?</p><p>As the last shoe fell to the floor, his hands\u2014amazingly gentle hands\u2014pulled the material from her legs, his head rising, his eyes meeting hers as he undressed her. The heat she saw there took her breath. It made his eyes lighter, appear almost amber rather than dark honey. His high cheekbones flushed, his lips becoming heavy with sensuality.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t need stitches,\u201d he whispered hoarsely as he checked the line of raw flesh. \u201cYou were lucky, baby.\u201d The endearment sent a shaft of heat vibrating through her vagina and into her womb. He opened the first aid kit and took several items out, though she had no idea what they were.</p><p>\u201cThis will hurt,\u201d he whispered and she saw his eyes blaze in fury at the thought. \u201cI need to disinfect it, then cover it so you can shower.\u201d</p><p>She was entranced by his face, his expression. It was savage, so filled with hunger it took her breath and almost made her forget the pain in her leg.</p><p>\u201cI cleaned it. At the diner,\u201d she said nervously, tucking her hair behind her ear before gripping the edge of the counter desperately. \u201cIt\u2019s not too bad. It stopped bleeding.\u201d</p><p>He shifted in his chair, his broad, calloused hands probing at the wound as she grit her teeth at the feel of his fingers against her skin. They were so warm, gentle.</p><p>\u201cI killed that bastard for this alone,\u201d he whispered shockingly, causing her heart to race in her chest.</p><p>\u201cAnd I would do it again, Elizabeth.\u201d He raised his gaze, watching her closely. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter who it was. I\u2019ll kill them before I allow them to ever hurt you or Cassie again.\u201d</p><p>He glanced back down at her leg before moving to his feet. She tried to ignore the tenting of the soft fleece of his pants. She really did. But he was huge. He ignored his own arousal, though. Removing a bottle of antiseptic from the kit, he dampened a large square of gauze before turning back to her. His eyes were filled with pain. \u201cI hate seeing you hurt, Elizabeth,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t bear it.\u201d</p><p>She would have reassured him. Would have told him how she had doused it herself with alcohol in the diner if he hadn\u2019t shocked her past speech.</p><p>His lips covered hers as he laid the gauze on her leg. Fiery pain shot through her flesh as his lips swallowed her cry, then replaced it with such amazing sensation she wanted to whimper in return. He licked her lips. He didn\u2019t steal her kiss. He didn\u2019t take it. He cajoled it from her. His tongue swiped over the curves, pressed gently at the seam, licked at her heatedly until she opened her lips and allowed him entrance.</p><p>Did he growl? A short, rough sound echoed in his chest as his hand fell away from the gauze, both arms coming around her, pulling her against him, his lips slanting over hers as he began to feed from her mouth. There was no other way to describe it.</p><p>His cock was a length of hot steel pressing against her suddenly fiery pussy as he kissed her. It ground against her clit, made her body moisten, made her feminine cream slide free of her vagina and saturate her panties. He had to feel it, even through the fleece of his pants, had to know she was wet, her body wild from his touch.</p><p>He nibbled at her lips, his tongue raking forcibly past them to conquer her mouth with hot, ecstatic licks and smooth thrusts. He dared her to return each caress. Challenged her to give as good as he gave. And Elizabeth was helpless against the ravaging onslaught. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His kiss tasted like midnight, dark and deep, frighteningly savage and yet with a power so seductive, she became lost within it. Her breasts swelled, ached. Her nipples poking demandingly against the cloth of her shirt as he moved his bare chest against them.</p><p>He didn\u2019t take advantage of her arousal, though. Didn\u2019t try to force more, though Elizabeth wondered if she would have had the strength to pull away from him. He held her against him, his arms contracting around her, hands stroking over her back as his tongue learned every secret of her mouth and urged her to return the favor.</p><p>It was seductive. Tempestuous. Given and taken in silence, with only the hard rasp of their breathing disturbing the air around them as he kissed her with a hunger only surpassed, maybe, by her own. His taste alone drove her to seek more made her greedy for each stroke of his tongue along hers. Her hands stroked over his shoulders, his hair, on fire to feel as much of his body as this stolen moment in time allowed her.</p> <p>How long had it been since a man had touched her? How many nights had she lain awake dreaming of this man? Envisioning him coming to her, whispering his need for her, his hunger, offering her his strength and his heat. She gloried in it now. She stretched in his arms, rubbing against him, feeling his warmth seeping into her skin, heating the chill that had filled her for so long. They were both fighting for breath within minutes. Bodies strained to get closer, the air heating with a primitive lust that Elizabeth had no idea how to fight. She only knew how to arch closer to him, to feel the ache in her breasts for the touch of his broad hands, the pulse in her pussy for the thickness of his cock. To know she was alive. Finally, irrevocably alive and for one moment in time, a man had no other thought in his head than to touch her. To hold her. To...</p><p>\u201cMomma. Momma, where are you?\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s frightened voice was like ice flowing over her as Dash jerked away from her, struggling for breath as he turned way, obviously fighting to hide his erection in case Cassie came running into the hidden alcove.</p><p>\u201cMomma\u2019s here, Cassie.\u201d Elizabeth slid off the counter, limping quickly around the corner to allow Cassie to see her.</p><p>The little girl was sitting up in the bed, her eyes dark with fear as she clutched the teddy bear Dash had laid beside her.</p> <p>\u201cWas I dreaming?\u201d she whispered, looking around the room, her eyes filling with tears. \u201cDidn\u2019t Dash come, Momma? Isn\u2019t he here? Did I just dream it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Cassie.\u201d Soft as velvet, pitched low, Dash answered for himself. Elizabeth turned back in time to see him coming from the sink area, his body obviously under control as he paced over to his own bed. He sent Cassie a reassuring look before he pulled a T-shirt from his bag and dragged it on. The soft gray cotton hugged his chest and hard abdomen, the sleeves stretching over his powerful arms. When he finished, he snagged the gown and robe from the top of the opened tote and passed them over to Elizabeth.</p><p>Flushing, Elizabeth held the long garments in front of her as she watched her daughter. Cassie was staring back at Dash, her eyes wide, amazement reflecting in her expression.</p><p>\u201cWow, Dash, you\u2019re really big,\u201d she giggled, her lips curving into a bright, pleased grin as he sat down on the side of his bed and looked at her curiously.</p><p>Elizabeth watched this first true meeting cautiously. Cassie had had such dreams of Dash coming to rescue them. And though she admitted that if anyone could save them, then it was Dash, it was still hard to let go of the control she had maintained over the situation to this point.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m too big?\u201d He frowned as though worried at the prospect. \u201cIt would be hard to shrink at this late date, Cassie.\u201d</p><p>A vivid smile broke across Cassie\u2019s face and before either Elizabeth or Dash could guess what she was about to do, she flew from her bed and jumped into Dash\u2019s arms. Elizabeth gasped at Cassie\u2019s speed and daring. She had never been one to trust men, she hadn\u2019t even enjoyed her father\u2019s embraces, but here she was throwing herself at Dash. He caught her to his chest in reflex, his gaze going to Elizabeth in shock, his eyes filling with an emotion she couldn\u2019t define as Cassie wrapped her arms around his neck and planted a loud kiss on his hard cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you came, Dash,\u201d Cassie cried against his neck. \u201cI was so scared. So scared you wouldn\u2019t be able to find us. That I was wrong and that you wouldn\u2019t really come and help me and my momma. But you did. You came, Dash.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth\u2019s heart clenched as Dash\u2019s eyes closed, his expression tightening with emotion as he swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cYes I did, Cassie,\u201d he whispered against her hair, holding her gently, holding her as her father never had. Comfortably. With warmth. With caring. \u201cI\u2019m here, Cassie. Where I intend to stay.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth gasped at the statement at the same time his eyes opened, the golden depths hardening with determination. She had a feeling she might have a chance of surviving the dangers surrounding her with Dash at her side, but knew now, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that he had no intention of allowing them to escape him . He had just made his claim.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Cassie, we need to get a shower.\u201d She fought to keep her voice even, to still the tremor of nerves she could feel racing through her body.</p><p>He might think he had made his claim, she thought, and she might need him now more than she had ever needed anyone in her life, but he would learn she wasn\u2019t as easy to conquer as he thought she was.</p> <p>\u201cOh Momma, let me sit with Dash.\u201d Cassie turned back to her, her expression pleading, her eyes wide and distressed. \u201cI\u2019ll be good. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always good, sweetie,\u201d Elizabeth assured her, keeping her voice firm. \u201cBut you need a bath, and I need a shower. Now come on, so you can eat and maybe watch cartoons for a while.\u201d She dangled the treat before her daughter, hating to take something away from her that she wanted. But she couldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>wouldn\u2019t\u2014trust Dash that far.</p><p>\u201cBut, Momma...\u201d Cassie whined.</p><p>\u201cNow, Cassidy Paige.\u201d She used her full name, keeping her voice firm, aloof. She prayed Cassie didn\u2019t choose now to defy her. She didn\u2019t think she could handle the fight. Cassie sighed deeply as she slid off Dash\u2019s lap. \u201cYou won\u2019t leave. Will you?\u201d she asked in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d He laid his hand against his chest, his expression somber. \u201cI\u2019ll be right here, waiting on my cartoon partner.\u201d</p><p>Cassie giggled as Elizabeth moved to the tote and picked out the clothes Cassie would need. Toothbrushes, hair brushes, little girl\u2019s hair bows, a multitude of small, insignificant but prized items were all held within a large clear plastic carrier lying on top of the clothes. She drew it out, gripping her robe and gown before her as she backed to the bathroom. She kept her eyes on Dash, fought to keep her worries under control.</p><p>He watched her, his golden-brown eyes quiet and intense. Steady.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to put a decent bandage on your leg,\u201d he reminded her as she reached the alcove. \u201cThat soap will burn like he...\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cLike heck.\u201d He glanced at Cassie. Elizabeth flushed but nodded quickly before easing Cassie toward the bathroom door. Like Cassie, she wanted to ask him if he would be there when they were done. If he would promise not to leave. Somehow, he must have read her fears. Keeping his gaze locked with hers, he returned his hand to his chest. \u201cI promise.\u201d He mouthed for her alone.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Dash watched Elizabeth sleep for hours. She was curled around Cassie\u2019s small body, protecting her, even while nearly unconscious from exhaustion. They had both fallen asleep during the first hour of cartoons, and he had let them be. Hell, he\u2019d figure something out about the schedule. Elizabeth was right, Cassie needed to sleep, but so did her mother.</p><p>Dark circles ringed Elizabeth\u2019s eyes. They weren\u2019t as noticeable while she was awake; the vivid blue, so unlike the lighter tone of her daughter\u2019s, drew attention from her pale, tired features. But asleep, she looked wounded.</p><p>He sat on his bed staring at her. He couldn\u2019t help it. He had imagined her for over a year. Touched her in his dreams; loved her in his fantasies. What was it about her that it had only taken her daughter\u2019s smallest descriptions to fill his mind with her?</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a man that believed in soul mates. There were times he wondered if a creation of science could even have a soul. But Elizabeth made him want to believe. And as he watched her sleeping, he realized he did believe. He believed in it more than he had ever believed in anything. But it also made him realize the bleak, agonizing future awaiting him if he didn\u2019t do something about Terrance Grange. That, and convincing Elizabeth that she was his. That he was the daddy Cassie needed, the mate she longed for. Which meant he had work to do. He picked up the phone and called Mike. Dash had fought for more than two years with Mike Toler in the mountains of Afghanistan, searching for the pockets of terrorists hidden within mountain caves and underground tunnels. He had saved Mike\u2019s ass more than once, and he knew the caliber of man he was.</p><p>Mike was ex-C.I.A., a rancher now, though Dash knew he still had enough contacts to get a line on any information he needed. There was something wrong with the situation as he knew it, Dash finally admitted to himself. Terrance Grange was a mean bastard, and a pervert, but he wouldn\u2019t risk his whole organization for one little girl. Even one who had witnessed a murder. Not to this extent. He would wait. Wait until Elizabeth went to the authorities, wait until Cassie was in protective custody and in a place certain to allow him the opportunity to get to her. He wouldn\u2019t be running her and her mother down like animals. The situation was growing more complicated by the day and it was making Dash more suspicious by the moment.</p><p>He had suspected, after no more than a month into the chase for Elizabeth and her child, that the complications were likely to build. He hadn\u2019t expected what he was facing at the time. He had tried to accept that Grange was just an obsession freak, an animal that needed killing. Which was true to a large extent. But still, there was more. He could feel it in the deepest reaches of his gut. He called Mike as daylight turned to night and the worst of the blizzard had passed, at least enough to allow visibility in the Hummer. As he expected, Mike was waiting on him.</p><p>\u201cGet on out here,\u201d Mike ordered him briskly. \u201cYou need to get some rest while I follow up on some other information coming in. Your instincts were right, Dash. As usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you found out?\u201d He kept his voice low. He didn\u2019t want to wake Elizabeth or Cassie.</p><p>\u201cGrange is a dirty bastard. And a pervert. But little girls Cassidy\u2019s age aren\u2019t his preference. Nor is spending this amount of money on tracking down one little girl who was likely too shocked to even remember who killed her father. Right now, the details I have are sketchy at best. I did manage to contact Kane Tyler for you, though. He\u2019s waiting on you to get to the ranch for a secure transmission. Get your ass out here as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>He glanced toward the window. He wouldn\u2019t leave until dark. It was much easier to hide the fact that he carried a woman and child in the Hummer with him after nightfall.</p><p>\u201cTonight,\u201d he told him. \u201cExpect us sometime after eight. I imagine getting this little pup Elizabeth calls a child ready to go will take a while. She has more energy than any kid I think I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d She had bounced around for nearly an hour before collapsing on the bed to watch the cartoons. Mike laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re like wild monkeys at that age. Take care, old buddy. I\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d</p><p>Dash hung up the phone, wiping his hand over his face as he tried to pull together the fragments of information he had. There wasn\u2019t much.</p><p>Dane Colder had been a very prominent doctor in the small California town. He had married Elizabeth when she was fresh out of high school. Ten years older than she, he had wooed her within months before </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>giving her an elaborate wedding. A year later Cassie had been conceived. Two years later, Elizabeth had divorced the bastard on grounds of incompatibility. Dash suspected other reasons. She had fought visitation, but Colder had been determined. He was awarded one week a month with the child. From that time forward charge after charge of abuse had been leveled against him by Elizabeth, only to be thrown out of court for lack of evidence by the judge. Colder had carried a lot of influence, and had some powerful friends. A year before his death, he had hooked up with Grange for some unknown reason. Six months later Colder had sued for custody of Cassie. It was rumored he would have received it if his body hadn\u2019t been found in a dirty alley pumped full of bullets. There was something missing, though. Some piece of information that Dash knew would allow everything to finally fall into place. Until he had it, he was working blind, at least until he got his hands on Grange. Until then, he had to make certain no one could touch Elizabeth or her child ever again. Which meant they would have to head out soon and get to the ranch tonight. Moving to his feet, Dash laid out clothing and shoes for the mother and child before quickly loading the Hummer. Then he woke them up, waiting patiently as Elizabeth helped Cassie wash up, brush her teeth and comb out the mass of curls falling over her face.</p><p>Elizabeth didn\u2019t take nearly as long getting herself ready as she took taking care of her child. She gave the racy black thong and matching bra a long look before picking them up expressionlessly and adding them to the jeans, socks and thick long-sleeved blouse he had laid out for her. Dash hid his grin. She was getting mad. He could see it in her face, feel it in the air around her. She didn\u2019t confront him with Cassie watching them, though. She was careful to give the child every assurance that she was willing to work with Dash. Willing to do whatever it took to keep her safe. His respect only grew for her. She was a damned strong woman. Not many people, male or female, could hold their tempers around him for long. He watched her disappear into the bathroom, wondering how long she would wait before she blew up and confronted him over the decisions he was making. Decisions that hadn\u2019t been passed by her first.</p><p>Cassie watched her, too. Dash caught the little girl\u2019s expression as her mother went into the other room. It was equal parts deliberation and playful manipulation. Oh, she was going to be a handful for sure.</p> <p>\u201cMomma\u2019s clothes are pretty.\u201d Cassie bounced up on the bed beside him as he stuffed the small plastic bag Elizabeth had put their dirty clothes in into the bag he used to carry them. \u201cMine are, too.\u201d</p><p>She ran her fingers down the soft gray velour sleeve of her shirt, then looked down at her new boots. It was obvious she was genuinely enjoying the feel of the outfit. Dash watched her admiring the clothes and couldn\u2019t help but allow a smile to tilt his lips. She didn\u2019t hold much back, and she had something on her mind she was ready to say. Dash just wondered if he wanted to hear it right now. He had a feeling Cassie would keep him off-balance every chance she had.</p><p>\u201cCan you keep secrets, Dash?\u201d she finally asked him carefully as she watched him zip the bag up. Dash looked over at her quietly for long moments. \u201cIt depends,\u201d he finally told her gently. \u201cIf they\u2019re secrets your momma should know, then I might have to try to convince you to tell her.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, long thick lashes covering her eyes for a half a second.</p><p>\u201cWould you tell her if I said don\u2019t?\u201d she finally asked.</p> <p>Dash sighed deeply. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Cassie,\u201d he told her seriously. \u201cSecrets are big things. Little girls should always trust their mommas with their secrets. Even if they think it could get them in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Cassie watched him silently. He could see her expression clearing, her eyes brightening a bit more than before.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good secret,\u201d she finally said. \u201cA secret \u2018bout momma.\u201d</p><p>Now how could he resist? He grimaced. \u201cUhhh, Cassie, don\u2019t tell tales on your momma,\u201d he finally sighed. He was desperate to know anything she would tell.</p><p>She giggled lightly, knowingly.</p><p>\u201cMomma might be angry with you, Dash,\u201d she finally whispered, staring up at him with big, slate-blue eyes. \u201cBe careful or she might yell at you. Momma doesn\u2019t yell really loud, but boy, she can be scary when she does yell.\u201d</p> <p>Dash restrained his chuckle as relief poured through him. He wanted to know every soft inch of Elizabeth inside and out, but he didn\u2019t want Cassie telling tales, either. This tale, he figured he could handle.</p><p>\u201cWhat does she sound like when she yells?\u201d he asked her, his voice just as soft as though it were actually secret. Hell, he knew she was pissed and getting madder by the second. Cassie looked at the bathroom door. \u201cLike she might take away the candy bars for a week.\u201d Cassie nodded solemnly, but Dash could have sworn he saw laughter lurking in the little girl\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou better be nice to her or she might not let you have any treats.\u201d</p><p>Dash almost winced. Yep, he agreed with Cassie, that might be a bad thing. Unfortunately, he had yet to know what it was like to be really treated by Elizabeth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get my own candy bars,\u201d he confided with a grin. \u201cWhat would she do then?\u201d</p><p>Cassie evidently hadn\u2019t considered that angle.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Cassie pursed her lips, considering. \u201cWould you get me one, too?\u201d Her curls seemed to bounce around her face as she smiled up at him sweetly. Pure innocence. Or so she wanted him to think. Dash snorted. Oh, she was a charmer all right.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Messing with your momma over your candy bars might really get me in trouble.\u201d He frowned as though thinking the matter over. \u201cI might not want to chance that, Cassie.\u201d The little girl obviously liked her candy bars. But she was also enjoying the game of learning how great an ally Dash would be.</p><p>He watched as she pulled at one of her curls thoughtfully. Her head tilted and he swore he could see her quick little mind working in those wide blue eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI could tell you how to get her unmad at you,\u201d she finally confided sweetly. \u201cI know the secret. Momma can\u2019t resist.\u201d</p><p>Now this might be interesting. Dash glanced over her. \u201cYou tell first. Then we\u2019ll talk candy bars.\u201d</p><p>Cassie rolled her eyes. \u201cThis information is worth a lot of candy bars, Dash.\u201d She shook her head at him as though he disappointed her. She was obviously expecting so much more from him. Dash wanted to laugh. He was surprised to realize how easily it was building in his chest. She was a tough little thing, for sure. He would have expected her to be huddled in fear, flinching at each sudden sound. Instead, she appeared to have completely forgotten about the day before.</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d he finally grunted, as though he might be reluctant to bargain. \u201cWhat amount are we talking here?\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t had much experience with kids, but Cassie made it real easy to find common ground with her.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She scrunched her face up as she glanced back at the bathroom door before turning back to him with an innocent smile. \u201cAt least three chocolate bars. I really like chocolate, you know.\u201d</p><p>Dash wiped his hand over his face, fighting his amusement. Damn. She was good. Her momma would kill him over three candy bars.</p><p>\u201cThree, huh?\u201d He sighed as though it could be a possibility. \u201cHow mad will your momma get over these three chocolate bars?\u201d</p><p>She straightened the sleeve of her shirt. Ran her hand over the soft material again and then looked up at him with those angel\u2019s eyes as though she had nothing more on her mind then making his life easier.</p><p>\u201cWell, it would be controllable if you knew the secret to make her unmad.\u201d She shrugged her pitifully thin shoulders negligently. \u201cSo, do we have a bargain here?\u201d</p><p>Oh, she was good.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He cocked his head sideways. \u201cI don\u2019t have any chocolate bars right now.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together as she placed two small fingers at the bridge of her nose and shook her head as though she had lost all hope for him. Finally, she sighed as though more than put out. Her eyes were twinkling, though, the shadows of fear easing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you on your word then,\u201d she sighed. \u201cBut you really should stock up on chocolate bars. It\u2019s more precious than gold when dealing with kids, ya know.\u201d</p><p>He nodded solemnly. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind. So what\u2019s the secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKisses.\u201d She leaned back as though she had just pulled off the coup of the century. And to beat all, she was laughing at him.</p><p>\u201cKisses?\u201d he asked her carefully.</p><p>She nodded confidently. \u201cLots of kisses, Dash. And Momma\u2019s already upset. You better pucker up.\u201d</p><p>She was giggling. She clapped her hand over her mouth, though, when her momma walked quickly from the bathroom, dragging a wide-toothed comb quickly through her unruly locks.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot hair bands for me, Mr. Prepared-For-Everything,\u201d she muttered in irritation as she swept the waist length curls behind her shoulder and lifted her head. Her eyes narrowed instantly. Her hands went to her slender hips, emphasized by the snug fit of denim and the black blouse tucked into the waistband.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two up to?\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s eyes rounded instantly as she jumped from the bed and flew to her momma\u2019s arms. Elizabeth caught her easily, a smile crossing her lips, even if it was highly suspicious. She accepted the little girl\u2019s exuberant kiss to her cheek, though, and returned it warmly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we have pretty clothes, Momma?\u201d She leaned back to allow her mother to admire the dark gray velour outfit. \u201cDash has good taste, huh?\u201d</p><p>The little girl was almost as tall as her mother. Dash watched them covertly as he rose to his feet, lifting the bag from the bed as he flexed his shoulder muscles, checking the fit of the leather bands that held the knife sheath between his shoulder blades.</p><p>\u201cYes. Dash has good taste.\u201d She allowed her daughter to slide to the floor, laying her arm across her shoulders. \u201cGet your coat on now, Cassie. It looks like Dash is ready to leave.\u201d Her voice cooled measurably. \u201cMaybe you better hurry and use the bathroom first, though. We might have a lengthy drive ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>Cassie bounced away while her mother looked after her. When the door closed, Elizabeth turned back to Dash.</p><p>\u201cNo chocolate bars,\u201d she said as she sat down at the edge of the bed to lace the boots Dash had provided for her. \u201cIt makes her too hyper and she won\u2019t eat her meals. Right now, vitamins are more important.\u201d</p><p>He knew there was no way she had heard their conversation. She lifted her head after finishing, glancing at his questioning expression.</p><p>\u201cShe bargains for chocolate, Dash. What did she promise in return?\u201d He watched her lips press together as though she were trying to control her own grin. \u201cDon\u2019t believe that child. She really doesn\u2019t know the secret to the universe, or ancient druid curses. She just thinks she does.\u201d</p><p>Hell, she hadn\u2019t offered those to him, he thought with a spurt of amusement. But then again, he knew the little girl was after a hell of a lot more than chocolate. The little conniver was after a bit of matchmaking. He shook his head as Elizabeth rose to her feet, her eyes narrowing on him.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she asked him curiously. \u201cWhat was it?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cCan\u2019t tell. Chocolate secrets are sacred, you know.\u201d</p><p>She snorted at that. Thankfully, Cassie chose that moment to come bounding out of the bathroom. Elizabeth turned quickly to take care of washing and drying her hands, then a quick pat to thick childish curls and getting her into her coat. The whole time, Cassie talked.</p><p>\u201cAre we really going to a ranch, Dash?\u201d She stared up at him in amazement. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to a ranch before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely a ranch, Cassie.\u201d He opened the door.</p><p>Two feet of snow greeted him and more was still falling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome on, chatter box.\u201d He swung her up in his arms and began pushing through the snow to the Hummer, making certain to clear a path for Elizabeth as she moved behind him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry, Dash,\u201d she informed him as he strapped her into the back seat, looking up at him with wide eyes. \u201cCan we get something to eat? I want some pizza.\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at Elizabeth, catching the surprise in her expression.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get rolling first, squirt,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cThen we\u2019ll see what your momma thinks is best.\u201d</p><p>He closed Cassie\u2019s door, then opened the front passenger door, gripping Elizabeth\u2019s waist and lifting her into the high seat. He realized he had left her to make her own way into the vehicle the night before. She tensed in his arms, but allowed him to help her in, casting him a surprised glance as he pulled her seat belt forward.</p><p>\u201cI remember my manners sometimes.\u201d He cleared his throat as she snapped the strap in place. He made a mental note to remember them more often, though they were self-taught. He might have to polish them a bit. Maybe Mike would have some ideas. Hell, he was married now, he should know. The outside lights cast a dim, ethereal glow around her. Her dark hair glistened; her blue eyes appeared darker, more mysterious. Her lips shone with the delicate coating of moisture from the nervous tongue she stroked over them.</p><p>She drew in a deep hard breath, lifting her breasts against her shirt. He remembered the bra. Lacy, flimsy. It was a tempting piece of confection that drove him crazy when he thought about it. He cleared his throat. \u201cPizza?\u201d he asked her softly. He was starved, but not for food. She swallowed tightly. \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>They both jumped at Cassie\u2019s squeal of pleasure from the back seat. Dash nodded abruptly before he closed Elizabeth\u2019s door and strode quickly to the driver\u2019s side. The pizza would be easy enough. Loosening up Elizabeth might be a bit harder.</p> <p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cThis guy is a friend of yours?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth was nervous about their arrival at the Toler ranch. She had gone from having no one to help her, having no options, to having Dash take over and find options she could have never found for herself. For two years she had depended on no one but herself. She had kept her and Cassie alive, often only by the skin of her teeth, but they were still alive. She had made her own decisions. Had protected Cassie alone and accepted the responsibility that each move, each decision, was the best she could make at the time.</p><p>Now Dash was making the decisions and he was doing it without informing her of the consequences, should any of them fail. She felt like she was in the dark, foundering for solid footing amid a situation she was unfamiliar with. She didn\u2019t know Mike Toler. Didn\u2019t know his family, his strengths or his weaknesses and she didn\u2019t feel safe.</p><p>She watched Dash now, noticing his relaxed posture, his air of confidence and control. How she longed to feel so in control of any situation. The lights from the dash reflected off his hard face, the dull gleam of the night vision windshield giving him an almost other worldly appearance. The unfamiliar lights cast his expression in stark relief and made his eyes almost glow as he glanced over at her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a fellow soldier,\u201d he said simply as he shrugged those broad shoulders. Hard, muscular shoulders. She had gripped the smooth, tight flesh earlier that morning, allowed her nails to clench on the supple skin as he ate from her mouth. Her fingertips tingled at the memory. Her mouth watered with sudden hunger to know his taste again.</p> <p>\u201cA fellow soldier doesn\u2019t tell me much, Dash.\u201d She pulled her mind back from the erotic possibilities that shimmered within her mind. She couldn\u2019t let herself lose focus. Cassie\u2019s life was too important. \u201cEven friends aren\u2019t always dependable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikely why I haven\u2019t made any.\u201d He didn\u2019t appear regretful or bitter. It was a statement, nothing more.</p><p>\u201cWe fought in Afghanistan together. In conditions like we knew, you learn the mettle of the men you fight with. Mike wouldn\u2019t betray a kid. He put his life on the line too many times to save one. And he wouldn\u2019t betray me. He owes his life to me.\u201d</p><p>It was information. Nothing more. There was little emotion in his voice other than respect. Elizabeth thought of the people she had believed were her friends once. People she cared had for, had believed cared for her. She had loved them. Openly. Never questioning their honesty or their commitment to her. She had learned quickly that the least controversy had even those friends she had grown up with pulling back.</p><p>Yet, here was Dash, going to a man he had fought with, confident of that man\u2019s loyalty, his honor. It made little sense to her.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d It was her greatest fear. A betrayal that would cost her the life of her child.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trusting this man with Cassie\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d trust him with my own.\u201d He flashed her a dark look. \u201cYou don\u2019t fight with a man for a year in hell and not know what he\u2019s made of, Elizabeth. Mike\u2019s a good man. He won\u2019t let us down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou expect me to just take your word.\u201d She kept her voice low, aware that Cassie was still awake in the back. She regretted the fact that her internal alarm clock had failed her today, allowing her to sleep until Dash awoke them both. She had needed to talk this out with him.</p><p>\u201cThe fairy says it\u2019s okay, Momma,\u201d the little girl piped in then, her voice soft, reassuring. Elizabeth closed her eyes painfully, her chest tightening. How she wished Cassie\u2019s fairy, whoever the hell it was, would tell her. But then again, this fairy thing was already starting to concern her. As they had walked from the basement to their apartment two days before, Cassie had whispered that the fairy didn\u2019t want them going back to their room.</p><p>Please, Momma. The fairy says to stay here. To wait. I don\u2019t wanna go up there. Had Cassie somehow known their enemies were there?</p><p>Elizabeth knew children had an advanced sense of their surroundings. One parents lost as they matured. The ability to see and sense things that parents rarely made sense of. Was the fairy merely a way for her to explain this?</p><p>\u201cTell the fairy I said thank you, Cassie.\u201d She looked between the seats, smiling at her little girl. \u201cBut Momma needs to make sure. Adults don\u2019t have fairies to guide them.\u201d</p><p>Cassie looked up over at her with amazing sobriety. \u201cYou can use my fairy, Momma. I\u2019ll tell you what she thinks.\u201d</p><p>And how did she answer that one? Cassie never failed to surprise her.</p><p>\u201cThank you, honey, but Momma needs more than just the fairy\u2019s word right now. Okay?\u201d She kept her voice gentle. She didn\u2019t want to hurt Cassie\u2019s feelings. Didn\u2019t want her to sense that her mother had lost her belief in fairies long ago.</p><p>\u201cI understand, Momma.\u201d Cassie settled back in her seat, her smile flashing in the darkness. \u201cYou can talk to Dash all you like about it then. I know it\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth\u2019s fists clenched as she turned back and faced forward. Snow still fell, though not as thick as before. The roads were deserted, the country lane blending into the surrounding landscape until only the faintest hint that it was actually a road remained.</p><p>She hated not knowing. Not being certain. She didn\u2019t know this rancher, this ex-C.I.A. agent Dash was taking them to. She didn\u2019t know Dash. Yet she was being expected to trust merely because she had no other choice.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you trusting me , Elizabeth, even this far?\u201d he finally asked her. \u201cYou could have left the motel while I showered. You could have made any attempt to escape me. And you would have if you felt the need. Why didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Dash\u2019s voice was gentle. It was dark and demanding, but the underlying softness soothed the ragged edges of her nerves.</p><p>She pushed her fingers restlessly through her hair. He hadn\u2019t hurt her when he had the chance. He had killed a man for her. He had followed her through a blizzard and taken her farther away from the men searching for Cassie. He had haggled with Cassie over chocolate bars and carried a tote of clothes for months, picking up more here and there because he knew theirs were being destroyed.</p><p>He had bought her daughter a bicycle. Had sent her a robe. He had done so many things, even before he found them, to make Cassie\u2019s life, and hers, easier. How could she not take the chance?</p><p>\u201cYou made your point.\u201d She laced her fingers together tightly. \u201cBut I still don\u2019t know this man. I can\u2019t trust like this, Dash. Not after all this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen trust me,\u201d he suggested. \u201cYou can, Elizabeth. You know you can.\u201d</p><p>She stared out at the steadily falling snow, trying to maintain her control as he turned carefully from the road and drove beneath a sign announcing the Bar T Ranch. They were within only a few miles of this potentially dangerous situation. She braced herself for it, knowing she had no choice now but to trust Dash.</p><p>The dashboard clock was lit at nearly nine o\u2019 clock. The normally hour-long drive had taken over three hours, counting the stop for Cassie\u2019s pizza. Pizza that now sat like a lump in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cPut on your coat, Cassie.\u201d She kept her voice even. If they had to run, she didn\u2019t want her daughter without some protection.</p><p>She tensed as Dash reached down between his seat and door, his body shifting, moving carefully. When he pulled the holstered gun from the cavity and handed it to her, she stared back at him in shock.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t take a chance with your life,\u201d he told her quietly. \u201cI need your trust, Elizabeth. Here is mine in return.\u201d</p><p>She stared down at the weapon before raising her eyes to his once again.</p><p>\u201cWould you expect another soldier to follow you blindly?\u201d she finally asked him somberly. \u201cWould you ask him, with no explanations, without outlining whatever plan I pray you have, to just follow?\u201d</p><p>He was silent for long moments as he laid the revolver on the console between their seats and gripped the steering wheel with both hands as he maneuvered through more than a foot of snow.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a chance that I can arrange a place of safety for you and Cassie. One that Grange can\u2019t infiltrate or access in any way. A place where Cassie will be as safe as gold in Fort Knox.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth took a deep breath. She had been praying for nothing more. Nothing less. But the tone of his voice warned her that she might not like the answer.</p><p>\u201cWhere is this place?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cI\u2019d rather not say until I can be certain, Elizabeth. This requires a place without little ears and more time than we have in this Hummer. Another soldier would understand this. Just as he would understand that I have those I trust. That even if he doesn\u2019t know them, he understands that the contacts are important. Another soldier would understand that a commander knows what the hell he\u2019s doing, and he will explain the full plan and discuss it when he knows it\u2019s a plan.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth grit her teeth. Tight. Damn him.</p><p>She bit back the curse that wanted to sizzle to her lips as she turned away from him, staring outside the</p><p>Hummer resentfully. He was right. But she damned well didn\u2019t have to like it.</p><p>\u201cOhhh, Momma. Dash is good...\u201d Cassie\u2019s awed voice was filled with respect for how easily Dash had managed to turn the tables on a mother she had never managed to outwit. And never will, Elizabeth thought with affection, though she was still a little irked at Dash. Elizabeth snorted. \u201cRemember the phrase \u2018getting too big for your britches\u2019, Cassie?\u201d she asked her daughter, using a firm tone of voice.</p><p>\u201cDash could be in danger here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh oh,\u201d Cassie sing-songed. \u201cBetter remember what I told you earlier.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth glanced over at him curiously.</p><p>\u201cToo big for my britches, huh?\u201d he muttered for her alone. \u201cElizabeth, darlin\u2019, you have no idea.\u201d Then he said to Cassie, \u201cI\u2019ll remember your advice, honey, just as soon as I get the chance. You got your coat on now? We\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Scarlet heat flamed through Elizabeth\u2019s body, flushing her cheeks in aroused embarrassment as she turned quickly away from him, remembering just how big he could get. Definitely too big for his britches. She swallowed tightly then breathed in with slow even breaths to fight the sudden hard thump of her heart. Damn him. Did he have a countermove for everything?</p><p>The rest of the drive was completed in silence. Elizabeth steeled herself for the coming arrival. Death or safety. With each move she had made over the past two years it came down to this. And though she was beginning to trust Dash to a point, finding it in her to trust someone on his say-so alone was harder. The Hummer pulled through the snow easily, though Dash didn\u2019t push for speed. Still, all too soon they rounded the last small hill and the two-story ranch house came into view. It was well lit. The front door opened as the wide entrance to a garage slowly began to rise. A tall man moved easily from the porch along a shoveled walkway, timing his steps to coincide with Dash maneuvering the Hummer into the wide garage. As they cleared the door, it began to lower once again, enclosing them in the brightly lit area as Dash cut the ignition.</p><p>\u201cMomma.\u201d Cassie\u2019s voice was faint. \u201cThe fairy says it\u2019s okay. She really does.\u201d But Elizabeth heard her daughter\u2019s fear as the strange male began to come alongside the vehicle.</p> <p>\u201cCome here, baby.\u201d Elizabeth unbuckled her seat belt as Dash did, grabbed the service revolver in one hand and motioned her daughter to her with the other.</p><p>In an instant Cassie was over the console. Her thin arms wrapped around Elizabeth\u2019s neck, her head burying against it as she trembled.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth?\u201d Dash turned to her, watching Cassie in alarm.</p><p>Elizabeth shook her head. \u201cShe\u2019s frightened.\u201d She ran her hand down Cassie\u2019s back soothingly. \u201cBig men scare her, Dash. Except you. She thinks she knows you...\u201d She let it trail off. She and Cassie didn\u2019t know the man now standing patiently on the other side of Dash\u2019s door, his expression concerned as he waited on Dash to open the door.</p><p>Dash breathed out deeply as she watched him somberly. \u201cShe\u2019s just a baby...\u201d She tried to explain, afraid Dash would now expect more from Cassie than she could give. Cassie had her moments of terror. Her moments of happiness. Elizabeth had learned to accept each as they came.</p> <p>\u201cI know that, Elizabeth.\u201d His voice was soft, though his eyes flashed dark fire at her reprisal. \u201cI was worried for Cassie. Not Mike. We can sit here as long as you need.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth shook her head. Better to find out now what awaited them here in this new atmosphere.</p><p>\u201cIf she finds safety, she\u2019ll calm down.\u201d She left the rest unsaid. Dash pushed his fingers wearily through his hair as he pulled the keys from the ignition and opened the door. Cassie tensed, a small, mewling whimper escaping her lips. Dash stopped. His jaw tightened before he closed the door back once again.</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d His voice was so incredibly gentle as he turned that Elizabeth wanted to cry at the sound. Had she ever heard a man speak to her or her daughter with such warmth? \u201cCassie. The door\u2019s closed, honey. Won\u2019t you look at me?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth rocked her baby slowly, knowing the fear could lead to deep, shuddering tremors that came so close to convulsions they terrified her.</p><p>Surprisingly enough, Cassie peeked up at him, though her hands gripped Elizabeth\u2019s neck so tightly they felt like bands of quivering steel.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay.\u201d Cassie was fighting to be brave, but her voice trembled with her fear. \u201cThe fairy said it\u2019s okay. The fairy is always right. She\u2019s always right.\u201d Elizabeth could hear the tears filling Cassie\u2019s voice now.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Mike has a little girl, too,\u201d Dash suddenly said softly. \u201cJust a few years older than you are. Her name\u2019s Mica. And I bet, living out here without any little girls to play with, that she\u2019ll be very happy when you come in the house.\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s head lifted further. She glanced outside the Hummer. \u201cIs she here now?\u201d she asked him suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the house, Cassie,\u201d Dash said. \u201cI heard her playing when I talked to Mike on the phone earlier. Would you like to meet her?\u201d</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t loosen her grip on Elizabeth, but the shudders eased perceptively.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure she\u2019s here, Dash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what, I\u2019ll step out here and talk to Mike and have him get Mica to come to the inside garage door.\u201d He indicated the closed door at the side of the wide room. \u201cHow does that sound?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth lowered her head, kissing her daughter\u2019s curls as she fought to hide her tears. Dash was being gentle, understanding. His voice wasn\u2019t patronizing as Dane\u2019s would have been, but kept its usual inflection without being demanding.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good daddy?\u201d Cassie\u2019s voice was still rough. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t hit his little girl, does he?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth glanced at Dash. She prayed only she saw the spark of violence that shot through his eyes for a second.</p><p>\u201cNo, Cassie.\u201d He swallowed tightly. \u201cMike would never hit his little girl. You can even ask her if you want to. Mike loves his little girl very much. He would never hit her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll come to the door?\u201d Cassie worried. \u201cI can see her before I get out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can. And I\u2019ll close my door when I get out. That way, you won\u2019t get cold waiting.\u201d Or frightened that there was access to her by the big man standing outside, Elizabeth guessed. Cassie nodded cautiously.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Dash smiled tenderly as he eased his door open once again and stepped out of the Hummer.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Dash wanted to kill. Again. He wanted Grange in his hands, struggling, blood flowing as he pleaded for mercy. A mercy Dash knew he would never be able to give. He was shocked to realize how terrified Cassie had become when she saw Mike. It had been driven home to him then, just how much that little girl trusted him. How much she depended on him to keep her safe and how hard that battle was being fought.</p><p>He cursed silently, breathing out roughly as emotion swamped him. The fear he had smelled in that vehicle had nearly strangled him, ripping through his defenses, if he had any against her, and searing his soul with fury. Grange would pay for the damage he had done to that child and Dash would make certain of it.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy.\u201d Mike\u2019s voice was questioning, and Dash knew the other man could sense his fury. They had fought together too many times, had covered each other\u2019s backs in too many ways. Men who fought together learned the basics of each other\u2019s personalities, strengths and weaknesses in a way that otherwise took a lifetime during peace. War was an alien ground of kill or be killed, and the men you fought with were as necessary to living as breathing. You had to know the mettle of the man whose back you covered, who covered your back.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me Mica\u2019s still up,\u201d Dash said wearily as he rubbed his hand over his face. \u201cCassie\u2019s edging into hysteria seeing only you. She\u2019s terrified to come out of the Hummer.\u201d</p><p>The other man stiffened imperceptibly. The implications of the reasons for such terror washed through his gray eyes. His jaw tightened, teeth gritting for a long second as Dash watched him fight his anger. Mike finally glanced at the darkened windows of the Hummer. \u201cHang on. I\u2019ll get her.\u201d</p><p>Moments later, Mike\u2019s wife, Serena, a tall willowy blonde, and his petite blonde-haired daughter stepped out. Mica wrapped her arms around her daddy\u2019s waist and leaned against him as she smiled back over at Dash.</p><p>\u201cYou remember Dash, don\u2019t you, Mica?\u201d Mike asked his daughter softly. \u201cThe little girl he brought to visit is scared to get out of the Hummer. Why don\u2019t you go with Mommy and introduce yourself? Make her feel more at home.\u201d</p><p>Dash watched as the family came down the landing. Mike separated from them and returned to where Dash stood, watching quietly as the Hummer\u2019s door slowly opened. Soft female voices murmured through the garage. Dash had met the little girl and Mike\u2019s wife several times over the years during brief furloughs stateside. Both were kind and soft spoken, and just what Cassie and Elizabeth needed right now, he thought.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it, Dash?\u201d Mike asked him then, referring, Dash knew, to Cassie\u2019s mental state. Dash sighed deeply. \u201cShe\u2019s held up well until now. Men frighten her, though she came to me easily enough. Big men especially, from what I gather. I haven\u2019t had time yet to talk to Elizabeth in depth about what happened. I was hoping to do that while we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Now, Dash wondered if he would be able to contain his own rage if his fears held out. Had Grange touched Cassie before locking her in that bedroom and giving Elizabeth the chance to rescue her? If he had, Dash swore silently that he would make certain the man suffered a hell few would know before he died.</p><p>Mike breathed out deeply, his body vibrating with a need for revenge. Mike was a damned good father, and his wife and child were his life. He knew Mike would understand the rage threatening to engulf him. The other man was almost as tall as Dash himself, with short, light brown hair and gray eyes. He was less broad than Dash, not as strong in some areas, but definitely a man who could carry himself, and others, in battle. He was a hell of a fighter, and more than trustworthy. But the bottom line was, Mike was a decent man and he would kill for a stranger\u2019s child. For a friend\u2019s, he would inflict a damage few enemies would ever want to face. In that, he was a lot like Dash. Loyalty and the bonds that came with it weren\u2019t easily severed.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate you taking us in,\u201d Dash said quietly as Elizabeth and Cassie finally moved slowly from the Hummer. \u201cCassie and Elizabeth desperately need this chance to rest. I hope we aren\u2019t inconveniencing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Mike shook his head as he watched the movement on the other side of the vehicle. \u201cYou\u2019ll be safe here until we can figure out exactly what\u2019s going on and how to deal with it. But from what I\u2019ve learned so far, there\u2019s a whole lot of pieces missing, Dash. Nothing\u2019s adding up here.\u201d</p><p>Dash was aware of that.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go inside,\u201d Mike invited him as they moved cautiously toward the women. Cassie had a strangle hold on Elizabeth\u2019s hand, but she seemed to be acting more naturally now that Mica stood talking to her. Mike\u2019s daughter had just turned ten. She was a sweet-natured girl whose lively gray eyes sparkled with happiness.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad. Cassie\u2019s heard about the Cat people, too,\u201d Mica suddenly piped up. \u201cThey had another</p><p>interview on the news tonight,\u201d she told Dash. The little girl followed the stories of the Breeds almost religiously. \u201cI think they are so cool. And Tanner is really good-looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Bengal Breed.\u201d Cassie looked up at Mike, then Dash. \u201cHe\u2019s only twenty-five but he\u2019s becoming known as one of their greatest spokesmen. I bet he\u2019s really nice...\u201d she trailed off faintly.</p><p>\u201cTanner\u2019s quite nice, actually.\u201d Mike smiled down at the little girl. \u201cI met him this past summer with Kane Tyler. Both men are very good spokesmen.\u201d</p><p>Cassie looked impressed now, staring up at Mike thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cKane Tyler doesn\u2019t like speaking in public much.\u201d Cassie frowned as she watched Mike, gauging his response. \u201cHe acts like Dash. Tanner is sneakier about what he says. So he\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>Four adults stared down at Cassie in surprise. Mike chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s about right there.\u201d He slapped Dash on the shoulder. \u201cI wonder how much Kane will like knowing an eight-year-old has him pegged so easily?\u201d</p><p>Cassie moved closer to her mother, gripping her hips tightly as she stared up at Mike with a suddenly fierce expression. \u201cJust cause I\u2019m short doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d Elizabeth\u2019s voice firmed as she glanced down at her daughter. \u201cMr. Toler is our host. And I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re a baby.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elizabeth didn\u2019t make excuses for Cassie\u2019s behavior. None was needed. But she was gently letting Cassie know she was stepping beyond her bounds.</p><p>\u201cI thought you seemed awful old for your age,\u201d Mike teased her then. \u201cCome on, ladies, I\u2019m older than eight and I need a comfortable chair for visiting. Serena, don\u2019t you and Mica have homemade cookies cooling?\u201d</p><p>Serena moved to her husband, her arm wrapping around his waist as she reached up and kissed his cheek softly. \u201cWe do indeed,\u201d she said with a smile before turning back to Elizabeth and Cassie. \u201cCome on in and we\u2019ll get you settled in and get some cookies. Cassie, do you like gingerbread?\u201d</p> <p>Serena ushered Cassie and Elizabeth into the house as Dash and Mike trailed behind. Dash couldn\u2019t help but admire the other woman and how easily she helped Cassie and Elizabeth to feel comfortable.</p><p>\u201cThanks, buddy,\u201d Dash breathed as they entered the house. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long haul for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand that.\u201d Mike shook his head slowly. \u201cDamn, Dash, I\u2019ve had nightmares since you called, thinking about those two and what could have happened before you caught up with them. I don\u2019t know how they survived.\u201d</p><p>Dash knew he hadn\u2019t slept much himself before finding Cassie and Elizabeth. And he was starting to feel it.</p><p>Dash grunted. \u201cThey don\u2019t come close to my nightmares.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on into the study and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d Mike nodded down a long hallway off the garage entryway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been getting some reports together for you.\u201d</p><p>Dash nodded. \u201cLet me talk to Elizabeth first and I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>He stepped into the living room. Cassie was sitting on her knees in front of the television by Mica, absorbed in the news report and interviews of the Feline Breeds. Elizabeth stood by the kitchen doorway, watching as Serena made coffee.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth.\u201d He said her name softly, gaining her attention. She turned to him, her long hair swaying at her waist, her eyes dark and haunted. God, he hated that look, hated knowing that even now her fears assailed her. In one hand she gripped his service revolver, though she was careful to keep it behind her back so the girls couldn\u2019t see it. She moved to him slowly, her deep blue eyes watching him carefully. She hadn\u2019t relaxed her guard, hadn\u2019t given in to her need to just rest since he had found her other than the few hours she had slept in the motel. She was still running on nerves and fear and it was making him crazy. She needed her rest. Something inside him demanded that she was too weak, too frail, for the hungers rising inside him.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to Mike for a bit, but I\u2019ll be just down the hall.\u201d He drew her back to the entryway, glancing at the revolver. \u201cYou want to keep it or you want me to hold it for you?\u201d</p> <p>She glanced back at Cassie then at the revolver. Dash watched as she licked her lips nervously before extending the weapon to him. When she raised her eyes, he wanted to howl in misery at the fear and insecurity he saw there.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth,\u201d he whispered gently as he took the weapon with one hand, the other lifting to her cheek to touch her pale skin. Soft skin. Skin he wanted to spend the rest of his days learning the feel of. \u201cI promise you. No one can track us here. No one will find us.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed as she nodded faintly. But the shadows in her eyes didn\u2019t lessen. Dash reached out beside him and extinguished the light in the entryway, dimming the area as she stared at him in shock.</p><p>\u201cI want to kiss you,\u201d he whispered as he backed her against the wall, pleased by the sudden flare of interest in her eyes.</p><p>Oh yes, he thought, she remembered how hot that last kiss had been, how good it felt. It made her eyes glitter with something other than fear.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how soft your lips are?\u201d He was careful to keep his voice from rumbling as he lowered his head to her. \u201cHow warm and sweet you tasted?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer he allowed his tongue to lick over her lips softly. Dash heard her breath catch, watched warm color flush her cheeks. He was hard and hurting, his cock throbbing imperatively as he fought to keep the caress light. If he kissed her as he wanted to, he feared he would never stop.</p><p>\u201cDash.\u201d Her hands lifted to his chest as though to push him away. Her fingers curled against his shirt as her breasts began to rise and fall with her increased breathing.</p> <p>\u201cI could eat you up, Elizabeth,\u201d he told her, allowing a small measure of his hunger to reflect in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWhile I was in that damned drug-induced coma, my only link to the world was Cassie\u2019s letters. And she talked about you. How pretty you were. How kind and good. Slowly, you ceased to be Cassie\u2019s mother, though. I didn\u2019t see a maternal figure, I saw a woman. A woman I needed to hold. To touch. I want to touch you real bad, Elizabeth. So bad my hands almost shake with it.\u201d</p><p>He was taking a chance. It could be too soon to let her see just how hungry he was for her. But damn if he wasn\u2019t tired of waiting, tired of needing alone. He wanted her to think about it. To think about him. To know it was coming.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head, her eyes flaring with a sense of female panic as he put his claim into words.</p><p>\u201cYes, Elizabeth.\u201d Dash kept his voice low, but let it rumble with his arousal. \u201cI lived for you and Cassie. But while I fought to live I dreamed, and it was this I dreamed of.\u201d</p><p>His lips covered hers swiftly, his tongue taking advantage of her gasp and sweeping in commandingly. He had asked for the caress earlier that morning, now he demanded. He conquered, he licked and stroked her tongue and gloried in her instant, if hesitant, response. She was shy. Wary. She wouldn\u2019t give in to the heat pulsing between them easily. But she was curious enough about it to allow the kiss. She leaned into him slightly, her body tense. She was determined to try to control it, to explain it before she would give in to it. For Dash, it was enough that he could feel the hunger inside her for now. The time would come later to explore it more fully. He allowed his lips to sip from her, his tongue to stroke hers, allowing the heat to build slowly. One hand gripped her hip as he held her to him, his chest cushioning her full breasts as they rose and fell harshly. Her shy tongue tangled with his as her hands splayed flat against the tight muscles of his abdomen. He was rapidly losing his mind in her kiss. The building sensations were sweeping through him, buzzing through his mind, his senses exploding with greedy lust until he heard Cassie. Her voice rose as she questioned Serena about the location of her mother.</p><p>Pulling away from her was one of the hardest things he had ever done in his life. But he did, reluctantly, forcing his eyes open, staring into the shocked depths of hers. Her breasts rose and fell swiftly, her nipples hard little points beneath the cloth of her blouse. Her hands gripped his shirt, her delicate nails piercing against his skin as though it was a lifeline, as she fought for breath. His hand framed her cheek, his thumb running over the slightly swollen curve of her lips. They were reddened, fuller now from his caress. Her eyelids looked heavy, her cheeks flushed and he could smell the essence of her need beginning to build. The slick juices would be preparing her, heating her sweet pussy, preparing the way for him. His cock throbbed heavily at that thought.</p><p>\u201cThink about that, Elizabeth,\u201d he growled. \u201cAnd then ask yourself if you taste passion there, or betrayal.\u201d</p><p>Before she could speak, Dash turned and stalked down the short hallway beside them, leaving Elizabeth staring in shock, in reluctant hunger. And, he hoped, some small measure of trust.</p><p>Elizabeth watched Dash walk away. She kept her back pressed to the wall, stilled an instinctive need to call him back to her, and watched his powerful body stalk into another room. Her hand rose slowly to her lips. They tingled, bursting with heat from the touch of his, her mouth filled with the taste of him.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t seem to shake the mood the kiss had put her in. She returned to the kitchen, talked to Serena Toler, watched the kids play, and all the while she remembered Dash\u2019s kiss. His touch. She thought about the way he had come out of the shower, pinning her to the bathroom door earlier that day. His cock had been fiery, rock-hard, pressing against her stomach insistently as he stared down at her, eyes glittering with hunger. Lust was too tame a word for what she saw in his gaze. Finally, Serena showed her and Cassie to their rooms. Dash had already brought in their clothes and placed them in the large bedroom. The queen-sized bed was turned down invitingly; the Victorian flowered quilt and matching sheets brought a pain of longing to her chest. For one brief second she was at home again. The home her parents had left her. The small two-story brick house she had lovingly decorated after her divorce from Dane, filled with sunshine and Cassie\u2019s laughter, and a sense of roots. And Victorian flowered sheets and quilts on the bed. Pillows plumped. A little girl\u2019s frilly bedroom with the canopied bed and white oak furniture. Her home. And it was gone now. Forever.</p><p>Taking a hard, shuddering breath, she opened her eyes. The guest room held heavy, dark furniture, comfortable and elegant with a thick forest-green carpeting as the rest of the house held. There was a small French door leading to the wrap-around balcony. A Queen Anne chair sat beside it.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Cassie.\u201d Elizabeth moved to the large tote Dash had brought in from the Hummer. \u201cLet\u2019s get ready for bed.\u201d</p><p>She gathered the little girl\u2019s gown and robe and knocked softly on the door that connected her room to Dash\u2019s. When there was no answer she opened the door and entered it. Getting Cassie ready for bed wasn\u2019t hard. The little girl was exhausted. She curled under the warm quilts of the bed half an hour later and settled right into sleep. Within minutes she had made one of the soft, mewling little sounds that always brought a smile to Elizabeth\u2019s face. She shook her head at the sound. This new situation was so out of sync with the past two years that Elizabeth couldn\u2019t settle down. The awareness of danger that had surrounded her for so long was no longer present. She sensed the change on every level of her being. As though with Dash\u2019s arrival, there was now hope. How, she didn\u2019t know. But she felt the sense of hope building around her even as she instinctively doubted it. How could anything change so quickly just from the presence of one man?</p><p>But why not? He had changed something in her as well. In the space of twenty-four hours he had made her realize she was more than just Cassie\u2019s mother. She was a woman, too. And it had been a long time, a very long time, since she had felt that surge of feminine need and the thick, juicy arousal pooling between her thighs. Her pussy ached. It had never ached like this, even during Dane\u2019s courtship of her. She hadn\u2019t been on fire from a single kiss. She hadn\u2019t wanted him so quickly or so heatedly as she suddenly realized she wanted Dash Sinclair.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Elizabeth watched Cassie the next afternoon with the Toler\u2019s little girl, Mica, as they played in the backyard. They were throwing snowballs and romping through the snow, laughter echoing into the brightly lit kitchen where she sat with a cup of coffee.</p><p>Dash and Mike had left earlier for the study after explaining to Elizabeth that they were looking into safe houses for her and Cassie, as well as information on Grange. There had been an air of secretiveness between the two men, as though they were delving more deeply into both assignments than they were telling her. But it didn\u2019t matter the questions she asked, she had learned no more than that. Not that the two men hadn\u2019t answered all her questions. They had. It was just a feeling, a sense, that there was more.</p><p>She watched now as Cassie and Mica rolled in the snow, laughter and mock screams exchanged with the ferocity of little animals. Cassie had her teeth locked in Mica\u2019s jacket as the other little girl laughed uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cMica was so happy to have another little girl to play with. I\u2019m glad you were able to make it so soon.\u201d</p><p>Serena Toler sat down across from her, a steaming cup of coffee in her hand, careful not to block Elizabeth\u2019s view of the girls. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you for allowing us to stay,\u201d Elizabeth said softly. \u201cCassie needed the time to rest. I just hope we don\u2019t cause you any problems.\u201d She was terrified she would bring Grange\u2019s wrath down on the family. Serena snorted. \u201cMike and Dash should be so lucky as to have that bastard try to attack here. Trust me, Elizabeth; this house is better secured than Fort Knox. Mike doesn\u2019t take chances and he\u2019s seen worse than Grange.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth couldn\u2019t imagine anyone worse than Grange.</p><p>As they sat there watching the children play, Elizabeth smothered her yawn, realizing this was the first time in as long as she could remember that she wasn\u2019t running or preparing to run. She had slept several hours the night before, but out of habit was awake often, checking the locks on the bedroom doors, listening closely to the sounds of the house.</p> <p>\u201cGo lie on the couch and rest, Elizabeth,\u201d Serena suggested softly. \u201cI\u2019ll sit here and watch the girls, and Mike has several of his old unit working the ranch. They\u2019re on babysitting detail outside. You need to rest.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth had been introduced to the three men. They were a bit older than Dash, but just as hard and capable looking. And if there was one thing she had learned, it was to rest when she could.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She carried her cup to the sink, rinsed it and set it in the aluminum depression before heading into the large, open living room.</p><p>She could still hear the children playing, though the sound was muted. She knew they wouldn\u2019t be able to stay out much longer and felt confident enough to lie down and close her eyes for a brief time. She realized as she drifted off to sleep that never, in the past two years, would she have trusted anyone else, anywhere else, to watch Cassie while she slept. She was too vulnerable if her mother wasn\u2019t awake and aware. But somehow, Dash had instilled a trust in her that had snuck up on her in the past twenty-four hours.</p><p>He had killed to protect her and Cassie. He had followed them in a blizzard, risked his own life to bring them to a place where they could heal, where they could rest, at least for a time. She no longer suspected him of betrayal, and perhaps that surprised her more than anything. As exhaustion wrapped around her, though, it wasn\u2019t trust or betrayal that fed the rich visions within her mind. It was Dash. Naked, fresh from the shower, his body pressed hard against her, her hand overfilled with the hard length of his cock. She didn\u2019t think she had ever known heat as intense as she had when he brought her hand down and wrapped it around the rigid flesh. His eyes had flared. A betraying warmth and wet heat had assailed her pussy, making her throb, ache. She was still aching. His kiss\u2014she shifted restlessly\u2014his kiss was like rough velvet and summer lightning. His taste was dark, heady. She could well imagine him laying her on a bed, his body covering hers, pressing her into the mattress, heavy and demanding as he placed himself between her thighs. She almost moaned at the image, needing him with her now. Needing him to cover her, take her, finish out his threat to fuck her so hard and deep she couldn\u2019t still her cries. She had never been taken like that. Dane hadn\u2019t exactly been a passionate lover. And his kisses had never made her burn. Right now, Elizabeth was burning.</p> <p>Dash stepped into the living room, then came to a complete abrupt stop. His eyes swung to where Elizabeth lay, apparently sleeping, her body shifting restlessly on the couch. What was she dreaming? He could smell her arousal, hot and sweet, wrapping around him, tempting every primitive instinct rising in his body. His cock came to full, surging attention beneath his jeans; his flesh suddenly felt overly sensitive, as though he could feel the very air whispering around him.</p><p>He heard Serena puttering in the kitchen getting lunch together. The kids\u2019 voices echoed from the heated garage where they now played. Mike was still in the study, waiting on the call from Kane Tyler with word on the request Dash had made. He hoped the other man wasn\u2019t foolish enough to refuse him. A trip to Virginia via more conventional mode wouldn\u2019t set well with Dash. All that faded, though. The hot surge of arousal and need that swept over his body in that moment was so intense, so demanding, it had him automatically stopping to still the response. Never had a woman made him this damned hungry. So hungry he wanted nothing more than to throw her to her knees and mount her like the animal that resided inside him. If he didn\u2019t take her soon, he was going to go mad. He stalked slowly into the living room, head lowered, his eyes going over her slender body, her full breasts pressing against the soft cotton of her blouse. A button had come undone, displaying a small amount of cleavage. She was still decently dressed, but the soft upper mounds of her breasts made his mouth water.</p><p>She would be wearing one of the silk and lace bras he had bought her, he thought. The ones with the little front clip, easy to release and peel away. Her breasts were full; her nipples were hard, so damned hard and tight beneath her shirt that his tongue ached to curl around them. He knelt to the floor beside her, his hand lifting, his fingers smoothing a stray strand of silken hair from her cheek. Her whispered sigh was almost a moan, her pouty lips parting as though for his kiss. She needed her sleep, he told himself as he stared down at her. She didn\u2019t need him awakening her, molesting her in her sleep. Too many choices had been taken away from her; he didn\u2019t want to take that from her too.</p><p>He was aware of Serena slipping on a coat in the kitchen, the whisper of the sliding doors as she left the house. Privacy. For what? For the hunger to rage inside him until he devoured her? He didn\u2019t think so. Didn\u2019t think she was ready for that step just yet.</p><p>Her eyes opened then. They were drowsy, slumberous, staring up at him with a hunger that was impossible to miss.</p><p>\u201cI felt you,\u201d she whispered, a smile tilting her moist lips. \u201cWatching me. Should I feel you watching me?\u201d</p> <p>Was she asleep or awake?</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He found the growl building in his throat. \u201cEvery time I look at you, baby, I touch you.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed as her hand reached up to touch his face. Cool, silken fingertips brushed over his flesh before they touched his lips. They traced the curves, her eyes darkening with need, the scent of her arousal wrapping around him until he wanted to drown in it. Drown in her. His lips opened, drawing one of the slender tips into his mouth, caressing it with his tongue as he wanted to caress one of the hard little nipples poking against her shirt. His hand settled just under one of the swollen curves, plumping it up as a spark of surprise lit her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhen I get you beneath me, I\u2019m going to devour you,\u201d he told her harshly as her finger slid from his mouth. \u201cEvery inch of your body, Elizabeth, I\u2019ll make burn for me.\u201d</p><p>She was breathing roughly now. Her breasts rising and falling with her quick breaths.</p><p>\u201cI already burn,\u201d she admitted with slumberous sensuality.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you burn brighter,\u201d he promised as his lips lowered, but rather than moving to her lips, he allowed his own to whisper over the soft curve of her breast revealed by the slipped button. Her breath caught. He could smell her wet heat building, knew her cunt was pulsing, spilling the soft liquid of her arousal. And he wanted to taste it. Wanted to bury his tongue so deep between her thighs that he would always be a part of her.</p><p>\u201cDash.\u201d Her sigh was thick with pleasure as his thumb reached up and rasped over her hard little nipple. It was killing him to touch her like this. To maintain a fa\u00e7ade of decency when all he wanted to do was strip her and pound so hard and fast inside her gripping cunt that denying the need was agony.</p> <p>\u201cI have to stop this,\u201d he groaned, allowing his tongue to rake over her fragrant flesh. \u201cNow, Elizabeth, or I\u2019ll embarrass both of us.\u201d</p><p>He would do worse than that. He would be fucking her on his host\u2019s couch within minutes if he didn\u2019t get the hell away from her. Mike was a pretty understanding guy, but Dash didn\u2019t think he would appreciate coming in from the study to find his guests fucking their way to oblivion on his couch. He raised his head, seeing the hard flush of desire on her cheeks, her knowledge of where they were and who could walk in at any moment. She cleared her throat and swallowed tightly as he settled back and watched her. She pushed herself up until she was sitting on the couch, her trembling fingers fumbling with the button of her shirt.</p><p>\u201cLet me.\u201d He brushed her hands aside and committed the ultimate sin. He buttoned her shirt, once again covering the perfection of the delicate curves.</p><p>\u201cDash.\u201d He could hear it in her voice. Knew what was coming. A carefully constructed excuse. A denial of what he knew would happen.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He laid his finger against her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen, Elizabeth. You know it and I know it. Don\u2019t make excuses and don\u2019t try to deny it. When the time is right, when I have the privacy and the time to make you burn so hot you\u2019re screaming, it\u2019s going happen. Don\u2019t think it won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. Her little pink tongue peeked out to moisten her rose-tinted lips. The low moan that rumbled from his throat had her cheeks flushing further.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dash.\u201d Mike forestalled anything she would have said as he walked in from the hallway. He paused, staring back at them. His expression suddenly reflected a wry apology. \u201cSorry. I was going to get lunch as soon as I could drag Serena back into the house. Hungry?\u201d</p><p>Oh, he was hungry all right, Dash thought. He glanced at Elizabeth, seeing her chagrin.</p><p>\u201cLunch?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cLunch.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>The tension slowly building between them didn\u2019t ease. Dash stayed locked in the study with Mike for the better part of the day, but he came out often. And when he did, he came searching for Elizabeth. He gave her soft touches. A hand on her shoulder, at her waist, as he eased her against him. He smiled down at her, stealing cookies when she and Serena weren\u2019t looking, his eyes glittering with heat. He wouldn\u2019t wait much longer. Elizabeth could feel it in his tense body, see it in the way he looked at her. He had claimed her before he ever met her and soon, he would make good on that claim. Finally, that evening, she found a few minutes to pin him down on the progress being made. Sitting around the house and waiting was wearing on her nerves. She could only rest so much. Serena was a perfect hostess, the kids got along well, and Elizabeth found herself filled with so much nervous energy now it was hard to control it. She was used to running and worrying. She wasn\u2019t used to a place of safety or any amount of time on her hands that wasn\u2019t filled with the fight for survival. After dinner, Mike and Serena took the girls to the living room, leaving her and Dash in the kitchen to talk. Dash watched her closely as they left, his eyes somber, reflective, though arousal lurked hot and impatiently in the very depths of his gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you found out?\u201d she asked him after the children were resting in front of the large television in the Toler\u2019s family room.</p><p>Serena and Mike were sitting in the living room with the girls as Elizabeth and Dash finished their coffee in the kitchen. Elizabeth watched Cassie for long moments, seeing a shadow of the once playful little girl she had been. Her heart clenched. Cassie had lost so much.</p><p>When Dash didn\u2019t speak, she turned back to him, seeing his narrowed gaze on the little girl. He turned back to her, his golden eyes pensive.</p><p>\u201cOnly more questions,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cGrange has a lot of money on her head, Elizabeth. More than reasonable, given the situation.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth snorted. \u201cShe saw him kill her father, Dash. She could have him locked away for a long time.\u201d</p><p>Dash shook his head.</p><p>\u201cLook at this logically, Elizabeth.\u201d He leaned forward as she felt nerves replace the quiet calm that had been settling inside her. \u201cYour husband was in deep with Grange. So he sells Cassie to him. I can see Grange wanting to get rid of the bastard, I really can, but,\u201d he paused as he watched her closely, \u201cwhy in front of Cassie? To scare her? I don\u2019t think so. He has enough sense to see how much easier it would be to achieve his ends if he takes her away and then kills her father. None of this adds up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elizabeth licked her lips nervously. There was no other explanation. It had to add up.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he just didn\u2019t care,\u201d she hissed. \u201cHe\u2019s killed and killed, Dash, and not cared.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head again. Elizabeth clenched her fingers on the coffee cup as he began tearing down the only reasons she could find for the hell she and Cassie had been through.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s killed secretively,\u201d he told her softly. \u201cEveryone but Dane Colder. They were obvious murders but there was no way to tie him to them, or to you and Cassie. He\u2019s been trying to throw a very carefully constructed shield around the two of you. Running you ragged when he could have caught you several times.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth breathed in roughly. \u201cWe were lucky.\u201d At least, that was what she had been trying to tell herself.</p><p>\u201cYou were.\u201d He was watching her intently. \u201cToo lucky, Elizabeth. Things aren\u2019t adding up here. Until I can find a way to make them add up, then I keep working. If I have to, I go hunting. But I would like to get the information I need before I take that route. What exactly does Cassie remember about that night?\u201d</p><p>The threat of an intended hunt hung between them as the final question was voiced. The one Elizabeth had been dreading.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t making sense when I got her out of that room. She was almost hyperventilating she was so terrified, trying so hard not to make a sound. I couldn\u2019t make sense of anything she was saying once we got to the car. I couldn\u2019t understand a word of it.\u201d She fought to hold back the pain, the horror of that night. \u201cShe was completely silent for hours after that and then tried to act as though nothing had happened. I dressed her, took her straight to the police, and while we were there, two of his goons slipped in. Right before they got to the office we were in, Cassie started going crazy on me. She was adamant they were coming. I was so terrified I rushed her from the room. His men were coming down the hall as we left the office. We barely got away.\u201d</p><p>Dash frowned. \u201cHow did Cassie know?\u201d</p><p>A bitter smile twisted her lips. \u201cHer fairy,\u201d she sighed roughly. \u201cWhatever the hell the \u2018fairy\u2019 is, it\u2019s saved us more than once.\u201d</p><p>Dash pushed his fingers through his hair wearily, causing the soft strands to feather around his face. He was worried. Elizabeth could see the frustration building inside him. Just as it had built inside her over the past two years.</p><p>They went over and over her memories of that night. Dash questioned her until she was ready to explode, until her nerves were strung tight and fear twisted her gut. It didn\u2019t make sense. It never had. Facing that wasn\u2019t easy.</p><p>Finally, he returned to the study with Mike to make more calls, to search for more answers. Elizabeth watched him leave then turned, searching for Cassie. She frowned, seeing the pinched, almost fearful, expression in her daughter\u2019s face as she watched the two men leave the room. Finally, the little girl\u2019s head lowered and she stared down at her hands as though they were someone else\u2019s before turning back to the television. Elizabeth frowned as a sudden fear struck her. Was there more to it? Something more that Cassie was aware of and hadn\u2019t told her?</p><p>Elizabeth raked her fingers through her hair at that thought. She had questioned Cassie relentlessly those first months, fighting for answers. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Momma. I don\u2019t know,\u201d was her standard response to most of them.</p><p>She remembered her father stripping her gown from her body and pushing her to Grange as the other man picked her up.</p><p>\u201cIf you can keep her mother off your back, \u201dDane had challenged him . \u201cA bit more time and I\u2019ll have custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho needs custody? No one will find her where she\u2019s going, \u201dGrange had responded before killing Dane in front of his daughter.</p><p>There was nothing else Cassie could tell her. Grange had come for her and Dane had wanted to wait until he could hand her over without problems. Grange had been unwilling to wait. Later than night, after bathing Cassie and tucking her into bed, Elizabeth stood and watched the sleeping little girl. Dash\u2019s questions had bothered her, made her look harder into the past two years now that she had a chance to take a breath and think. She didn\u2019t like the confusion filling her mind or the sudden need to question Cassie further. The only person here who held the answers they needed was Cassie, and she feared the day was rapidly approaching that she would have to be questioned. She lowered her head, shaking it slowly, needing Dash. Needing just a few more minutes to cherish the calm they had found in the middle of this horrifying nightmare. He was like an oasis of calm, of strength that she suddenly found herself craving.</p><p>All too soon she knew their time of quiet and safety would end and they would once again be thrown into the harsh reality of the situation they were in. But for now, she could be a woman. A woman suddenly faced with the first man who had ever made her burn, made her long to cast aside common sense and lie beneath him, whimpering in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He was there. His voice whispered from the connecting door as she stood at the end of the bed, staring at her daughter yet seeing only the changes within herself. Elizabeth turned to him slowly.</p><p>God, he looked good. Tall and broad, his muscular body backlit by the bathroom light. Jeans hugged his lean hips, denim cupping the full bulge between his thighs. She wanted to cup it, she realized insanely, feel his thick cock, not against her abdomen, but burrowing deep and hard inside the tight muscles of her cunt. Her breasts swelled beneath her gown. Her nipples peaked and her pussy began to moisten further. Just as guilt threaded its way through her soul.</p><p>Her daughter\u2019s life was in danger and the moment she found a chance to rest, she was thinking of fucking instead, of riding him, straddling his hard body, feeling him surge inside her. Elizabeth cleared her throat. \u201cShe finally went to sleep.\u201d She gestured to Cassie. \u201cI was just watching her.\u201d</p> <p>Liar, a voice inside her screamed. His expression hinted that he suspected the falsehood as well. The sensuous heated light in his eyes made her pussy burn, her breasts swell with longing.</p><p>\u201cCome talk to me a minute while she\u2019s asleep.\u201d His gaze was hooded, demanding. Elizabeth stared at him uncomprehendingly for a long moment. Talk to him? Alone? She stilled the weakness in her knees at the thought of it. She didn\u2019t want to talk. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired...\u201d</p><p>\u201cElizabeth.\u201d His voice was faintly chiding now. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m going to hurt you? Even now?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. No. She knew he wasn\u2019t going to hurt her. At least, not deliberately. It wasn\u2019t the pain she feared now, it was the closeness developing between them. It had become a bond she didn\u2019t understand and one she feared she would never escape.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He held his hand out to her. \u201cWe\u2019ll hear Cassie if she wakes up.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep, steady breath. She had known the time would come when they would have to talk. Had known there would be so many things to decide. But why did she regret it? Why did she suddenly wish the world would just go away and leave her and Dash alone, surrounded by darkness, flaming with heat? But it wouldn\u2019t. And now was the time to deal with it.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Elizabeth followed him into his bedroom, suddenly nervous, too aware of Dash as a man and too aware of the needs flaming to life in her body. It had been so long since she had felt any need to be touched, any interest in a man. But the year Cassie had written to Dash, Elizabeth had been interested, as greedy for the letters as her daughter had been. The loss of that fragile connection had been missed not just by Cassie, but her mother as well.</p><p>She knew when he drew her into the bedroom what was coming. Knew when he closed his door and went to the intercom installed between the two rooms what he intended. He turned on the receiver only. Elizabeth licked her lips nervously.</p><p>\u201cThis might be a bad idea,\u201d she whispered as he turned back to her. She could easily read the intent in his gaze, the sexual hunger radiating in his large body. If a man could devour a woman with his eyes alone, then Elizabeth considered herself devoured.</p><p>\u201cMight be.\u201d He walked to her purposely, never taking his eyes off her as her breathing began to increase.</p><p>\u201cDash, it might be a very bad idea.\u201d She was breathing roughly as she glanced down, seeing how the denim hugged a more than impressive bulge.</p><p>He was aroused and ready. A man who had put aside his need for as long as he could, and Elizabeth feared she would never find the strength to deny him once he touched her. Her eyes flew back to his face as he stopped in front of her. His lips were tilted in a wry little smile.</p><p>\u201cI only had to look at you and you knew I needed to touch you,\u201d he whispered darkly. \u201cI came in to say goodnight, Elizabeth, that was all. I looked at you and I saw the need to touch. Nothing more, baby. A few kisses, a little petting. Because that\u2019s all you need right now. All you can handle, I think.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a hard breath, bitterness filling her.</p><p>Elizabeth smiled mockingly. \u201cI don\u2019t need your pity, Dash.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t handle that from him. She had fought the need to feel sorry for herself and to sink into the pits of her own self-sorrow for too many years. She wouldn\u2019t let him drag her into it now. She didn\u2019t want his sympathy. She turned and headed for the door, only to have him grip her arm, pulling her against his hard body as he stared down at her with dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cWas that pity you held in your hand the other morning, Elizabeth?\u201d he asked her softly as she flushed in embarrassment. \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, it was my cock. Full and hard and ready to fuck the hell out of you. That\u2019s not pity, baby. And neither is this.\u201d</p><p>His lips didn\u2019t ask for anything. His tongue didn\u2019t seek permission. He covered her lips, plunged his tongue into her mouth and took without asking. It couldn\u2019t be called a kiss. It was a devouring, a feast of the senses, and Elizabeth was helpless against it. He bent her over his arm, arching her hips against his as he lifted her to her toes, pressing his thick, jeans-covered erection into the vee of her thighs as he gave her a taste of the hunger to come with his kiss.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t breathe. She didn\u2019t want to breathe. Her hands gripped his shoulders as small mewling sounds of hunger rose in her chest. Elizabeth could feel her body catching fire, her nipples, her clit, her vagina throbbing, aching for his touch, for the sensual devouring he was practicing on her lips.</p><p>His tongue plunged in and out of her mouth, mimicking a much more sexual act as his hands moved over her back, her hips. They were never still. Stroking her, caressing her body until one moved purposely up her side, cupping the swollen mound of her breast.</p><p>Elizabeth jerked at the sensation of his fingers suddenly gripping her nipple, milking it, rasping over it. Electric darts of almost agonizing pleasure ripped through her stomach and shot to her womb with a punch of sensation.</p><p>She cried out into his kiss, her hands clawing his shoulders, adrift now in a pleasure that threatened to consume her. In her sexual lifetime she had never known anything like it. Had never tasted such a dark kiss, one that warned her he had no intention of making allowances for sensual inexperience. He was hungry. Needy. And she was the meal he craved.</p><p>She had never felt her cunt clench, spasm, with such desperate need. All thoughts of danger receded. The situation, so fraught with desperation until Dash arrived, was swept from her mind. There was only Dash. Only his arms holding her, his fingers tugging at her nipple, his tongue sweeping through her mouth like a sexual marauder intent on conquest.</p><p>Elizabeth moaned into the kiss, her tongue twining with his, helpless against the sweeping sensations working through her body. She was only barely aware of him bending, lifting her into his arms and moving her to the bed. He didn\u2019t release her mouth. And every now and then she swore he growled against her lips. The sound was hot, blistering with hunger, and sent juices flooding her pussy. She was going up in flames. She swore she was going to climax from his kiss alone. As he laid her back on the bed, he released her slowly, his lips sipping from hers hesitantly as he finally broke the connection. Elizabeth lifted her eyelids drowsily, staring up at him, her breath catching as she saw him quickly unbutton his shirt then strip it from his broad shoulders. His hands were strong and wide, lightly calloused and so warm. Elizabeth realized she was almost shaking now with the need to have him caress her, to peel the robe and gown from her body. She wanted him to touch her, stroke her with those demanding hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And he did. Staring down at her, his hands went to the belt of her robe. His lips covered hers again, his tongue pushing into her mouth as she moaned in hunger. He made her hungry. Hungry for every kiss, every touch.</p><p>Elizabeth arched beneath him as she felt the robe part, felt his fingers at the tiny buttons that ran down the front of her gown.</p><p>\u201cGood God,\u201d he groaned as he spread the edges of her gown apart, staring down at the full, hard thrust of her breasts and their tight nipples.</p> <p>Elizabeth flushed heatedly as he stared down at her. She watched his face, seeing the heavy sensuality that shaped his lips, made his eyes appear drowsy, his expression filled with lust and emotion.</p><p>\u201cDash.\u201d She whispered his name beseechingly, her nipples aching for the moist warmth of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cIf I touch one of those hard little nipples I\u2019ll never hold onto my control,\u201d he sighed, watching her breasts as they rose and fell roughly. \u201cDo you understand that, Elizabeth? I won\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>She licked her dry lips, staring into the piercing depths of his eyes when his gaze returned to her.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p> <p>Dash felt flames sear his loins at her words. Quickly he turned, sat on the edge of the bed and began to remove his boots. If he didn\u2019t undress before he touched her, then he\u2019d have no more control than what it took to loosen his pants and pull his cock free before pushing it inside her. Lust raged through him now, nearly out of control as he fought to get the boots off his feet. Behind him, Elizabeth shifted, coming to her knees behind him, her fingers smoothing over his back before halting on his right shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHow cute.\u201d Elizabeth traced the little mark on the back of his shoulder. \u201cCassie has a mark just like that.\u201d</p><p>Dash stilled. She was tracing the genetic marker that shadowed his skin just below the curve of his shoulder. A particular identifying mark impossible to miss if anyone knew what it was. A paw print. It was a standing joke among the scientists who had coded it. Like a small strawberry birthmark impossible to be rid of.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same shape, too,\u201d her voice was a bit amused. \u201cDon\u2019t let Cassie see it. She already claims Dane isn\u2019t her daddy and that she\u2019s certain her daddy has a mark just like hers.\u201d</p><p>The blood began to rush to his head, knowledge flooding his brain like a sudden icy drenching. Cassie had such a mark? There was only one way a child could carry a mark like his. Only one way that genetic marker could have been placed. If Dane was a Wolf Breed. But that couldn\u2019t be possible. Could it? A Breed in such a prominent position as the renowned surgeon had been? No. No Breed would ever allow his child to be harmed, let alone attempt to sell her. What the hell was going on?</p><p>He turned to face her.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He fought to clear his mind. \u201cAbsolutely certain?\u201d</p><p>She was staring at him, her smile slowly faltering as she saw his expression.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She frowned in confusion. \u201cI raised her, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth didn\u2019t have the mark. Dash knew she didn\u2019t. Her shoulders were a soft creamy shade of perfection, without flaw.</p><p>\u201cDid Dane have the mark?\u201d he asked her slowly, somehow knowing that he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Elizabeth shook her head. \u201cNo one in his family did. I teased Dane that the doctors must have gotten his sperm mixed up with someone else\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>She was talking. He saw her lips moving, bitterness lining her face, but it seemed everything inside him had shut down. He was watching her speak, hearing her, his brain processing the information while he seemed to shrink inside himself in horror.</p><p>Artificial insemination. Elizabeth had been unable to conceive because of Dane\u2019s low sperm count. So they had contacted a friend of his, a fertility doctor. Marcus Martaine. He had performed the procedure secretively because of Dane\u2019s pride. The other man hadn\u2019t wanted anyone to know he couldn\u2019t father a child. So they had gone another route.</p> <p>Dane still hadn\u2019t been happy, though. He had never cared for Cassie. Always saw her as his failure, Elizabeth said. Cassie was a girl but he wanted a son. She wasn\u2019t conceived properly. Didn\u2019t look enough like him. Dane\u2019s list had gone on and one.</p><p>Cassie wasn\u2019t Dane\u2019s daughter, though. She was Elizabeth\u2019s. He could smell it. He would have known it if she wasn\u2019t. The differences in the scent would have been too vast if Elizabeth\u2019s egg hadn\u2019t been used. But Dane\u2019s sperm hadn\u2019t been.</p><p>\u201cDash?\u201d She was watching him in concern now as he stared down at her, everything suddenly falling into place.</p><p>Dane had to have known Cassie wasn\u2019t his child. That she was a Breed child. He had to have known because he had tried to bargain with her. The information of the marker wasn\u2019t public knowledge. It was a very carefully kept secret for the time being. Dash had made it his business to study every piece of information being given on them. There was a specific marker in a specific location for each Breed. The Wolf Breeds carried theirs on their right shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI have to see it.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, he had to be certain. Had to make sure Elizabeth wasn\u2019t seeing a resemblance that was possibly not there.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She shook her head, bemused. \u201cSee what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mark, Elizabeth.\u201d He gripped her shoulders, stilling her as she moved to turn away. \u201cShow me the damned mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Cassie?\u201d She frowned, fear starting to shadow her eyes as she pulled her gown and robe closed.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What does it mean? It\u2019s just a mark. We asked the doctor about it.\u201d</p><p>And of course, Martaine would have lied to the doting mother. It was an experiment. A secretly conducted experiment. One Martaine had obviously told no one about except the father. He would have needed Dane\u2019s help. Somehow, he had talked the other man into the dangerous experiment.</p><p>\u201cShow it to me.\u201d He gripped her wrist, dragging her from the bed and into the other bedroom, stopping beside the sleeping child.</p><p>\u201cDash, stop, you\u2019ll wake her,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He ignored her, gently lifting the small strap of Cassie\u2019s gown and baring her shoulder. It was there. A dark shadow just under the skin. A genetic marking of the Wolf Breeds. Had she been raised in the labs, she would have been branded, or tattooed, according to the lab in question, to hide the marker. But she hadn\u2019t been. She had been born to a loving mother and a bastard father. Dash bent close, drawing in the scent of her skin and shaking with the knowledge his brain was finally accepting. It was faint, a bit darker than he remembered. The genetics were obviously recessed much as his were or he would have detected the scent of a Breed sooner. But it was there. She was a Wolf Breed child. But whose?</p><p>What had they done? Dash knew Martaine well. He remembered the doctor visiting the labs, checking results, deciding who lived and who died. Dash had been picked to die. He was the runt of the litter and still smaller, weaker, than the other Breeds of that pack. Martaine had been young then, not even in his thirties. A cold, brutal bastard.</p><p>Dash was breathing harshly, perspiration dotting his forehead as he fought the rage building inside him. They weren\u2019t containing the experiments to the labs anymore? When had they brought the genetic mix into the general population?</p><p>He eased the strap back, glancing at Elizabeth\u2019s tight, furious expression as he stalked from the room.</p><p>\u201cGod damn them.\u201d He had no sooner cleared his bedroom than he turned, ramming his fist into the wall. Plaster cracked. A solid two by four split. Dash felt it as the sound echoed around him. He was aware of Elizabeth jumping back as she entered the room, a small cry smothered behind her hand as she stood staring at him, her eyes wide. Dash leaned his head against the wall, rolling it on the cool plaster as he fought to think.</p><p>\u201cWas she naked when you took her from Grange?\u201d His voice was a hard, vicious growl.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her voice was faint. Thin. \u201cShe was wearing her panties. But her nightgown had been ripped off her. Dash, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Grange would have demanded proof. Dane would have given it to him. Files, of course. He had to have had files of the experiment in case they were needed. And the mark. A mark that could be validated.</p><p>\u201cI should have known,\u201d he muttered. Hell, he thought, he had known but had just refused to admit to it. The idea of it had been too extreme, too far-fetched to consider. How the hell had it happened?</p><p>Martaine must have lost his mind. \u201cGod damn. I should have known. No wonder he wanted her.\u201d A short, bitter laugh escaped him. \u201cHell, sure he wanted her. She was a fucking gold mine.\u201d</p><p>He pushed his fingers through his hair as he fought to beat down the fury pulsing through his body. Elizabeth and Cassie had been through hell. Hunted. A price on their heads. All because Dane Colder had allowed his wife to be impregnated by Breed sperm. How had they managed it? Why had Martaine not informed the Council that he had discovered the secret to breeding the species? He hadn\u2019t, Dash knew. The experiments into the breeding were well documented.</p><p>\u201cDash.\u201d Elizabeth\u2019s voice was filled with fear. \u201cDash, what\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head desperately. He couldn\u2019t tell her. Couldn\u2019t let her know. Her voice was faint. \u201cWhat does that mark mean?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, seeing her white face, her terrified eyes. How he had wanted to protect her. God help him, protect himself. Thinking he could be something to her, build a future and still hide what he was. Still know only her sweet passion and woman\u2019s heart rather than her disgust.</p><p>\u201cI have to talk to Mike.\u201d</p><p>He had to figure this out. Had to inform Kane Tyler of the changing situation. This would assure Cassie\u2019s acceptance into the compound rather than only the consideration of it. Dash had understood the Pride\u2019s stand and had been praying for a positive response. He hadn\u2019t expected his prayers to be answered in quite this way.</p><p>\u201cNo. You have to talk to me.\u201d She gripped his arm, her voice echoing with anger, filled with demand.</p><p>\u201cYou talk to me first, damn you. What does that fucking mark mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, Elizabeth. I have to talk to Mike.\u201d He couldn\u2019t tell her.</p><p>\u201cLike hell you do.\u201d She shook his arm furiously, fear echoing in her voice. \u201cYou tell me what\u2019s going on first, damn you. That\u2019s my baby, Dash. Not Mike\u2019s. What the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>Dash closed his eyes, shaking his head roughly as he tore his arm from her grip.</p><p>\u201cGo to Cassie. Now,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI have to talk to Mike first.\u201d</p><p>He stormed from the room, knowing the lateness of the hour, the fact that Mike was comfortably in bed with his loving wife, likely dreaming dreams of bliss. A short bitter grunt sounded from his chest. Must be fucking nice.</p><p>He found his friend\u2019s room and rapped the door with hard knuckles. He heard a grunt, a curse, Serena\u2019s drowsy voice. Seconds later, Mike opened the door, his eyes blurry with sleep.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His eyes cleared when he saw Dash. Dash knew the fury raging inside him was clearly in evidence.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a Breed.\u201d His voice was flat with pain.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mike shook his head, clearly confused.</p><p>Dash couldn\u2019t blame him. He was having a hell of a time understanding himself.</p><p>\u201cCassie,\u201d he growled. \u201cThat\u2019s why Grange wants her. She\u2019s a Breed, Mike. A Wolf Breed. Just like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Elizabeth\u2019s shocked, disbelieving voice had him turning slowly. She had followed him. Somehow, his mind consumed with rage and pain, he had been unaware of her behind him. He knew now. She was staring at him like the animal he was. Her eyes wide, disbelieving, as she watched him with heartbreaking horror, fighting to deny the truth of what she heard. The truth that the man she had nearly taken into her body, the man whose tongue had plunged into her mouth was an animal. Bitter acceptance filled his mind as he watched her. She looked like she was going to be sick. He growled, a low animalistic rumble that had Mike cursing and Elizabeth shaking in terror. He knew what his eyes looked like in the hall, the dim light overhead reflecting at just the right angle, turning them a demonic red without the sheltering protection of the contact lenses he wore when needed. An animal. An animal she had nearly fucked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He could see it in her eyes as she backed away from him. Saw it in the glazed need to escape as she turned and ran for her room. And he was behind her. She would try to take Cassie and escape him now.</p><p>Run from the animal. From the beast. Escape a truth she didn\u2019t want to accept. There wasn\u2019t a chance in hell he would let her get away from him.</p><p>He caught her at his bedroom door, his arm wrapping around her waist as she fought him, clawing at him as he dragged her against the wall, her fist nearly connecting with his jaw as she broke from his hold. Breathing hard, her eyes wild in her white face, she faced him.</p> <p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Elizabeth knew she shouldn\u2019t have been so completely shocked. The past two years had been a series of betrayals and upheavals that she could have never imagined. But this. She didn\u2019t know if she could survive this.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d She pointed her finger at him, then lowered it as she realized how hard she was shaking. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw the mark, Elizabeth.\u201d His head was lowered. His eyes blazed back at her in fury, in determination.</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be happening. She wanted to slap herself, to tear herself out of this new, horrible nightmare suddenly exploding within her mind. She couldn\u2019t be awake. This couldn\u2019t be real. Her daughter wasn\u2019t created in a damned lab. She had been conceived within her womb, carried to full term and delivered in a hospital under the eyes of a caring obstetrician. Tests. Immunizations. Every care had been taken to make certain Cassie was healthy, free of defects. A perfect baby girl. And now he was ripping what was left of her life apart. Telling her that Cassie was more than she had believed, that her baby now faced the danger of not just Grange, but a deranged Council who was even more powerful. If they found out. If they knew... The consequences slammed into her head, making her fight it instinctively. Not her child.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a coincidence.\u201d Her hands pressed against her stomach as she swallowed deeply, fighting the bile rising in her throat. It couldn\u2019t be possible.</p><p>He laughed, a low, feral sound lacking in amusement. The sound ripped over her nerves, shredding them further. It was animalistic, dangerous. There was no amusement in his voice, only savage acceptance of what he was and what he faced. The man she had fallen in love with before she ever met him would be taken from her as well. Not just her baby, but Dash would be gone. How would she ever manage to hold either of them to her now?</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I know, Elizabeth,\u201d he informed her harshly, \u201cit\u2019s about being a Breed and how to hide it. You can\u2019t hide the marker, though. Nothing can erase it. It\u2019s a genetic imprint created to keep just this from ever happening. To be certain if conception occurred, then a Breed child could be identified. The Council was fanatical about not mixing the animals in the general population.\u201d</p><p>She swayed. God. This wasn\u2019t happening. Please don\u2019t let it be happening, she prayed. If she thought the past two years had been a nightmare, then this was hell and she was being plunged in head first. No chance to test the heat. No chance to accept the danger and the pain. No chance to plan a way out. She wouldn\u2019t accept it.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter is not an animal.\u201d She wanted to scream the words, needed to make certain he heard her, understood her. She didn\u2019t care what he thought he was, but her daughter wasn\u2019t an animal. And she sure as hell wasn\u2019t an experiment. \u201cAnd neither is she a Breed. She\u2019s my baby.\u201d Her hands knotted at her abdomen. \u201cI had her. I carried her. She looks like me.\u201d</p><p>Her baby. Elizabeth fought Dash. Fought the sudden, sickening realization that he could be right. She had always known how special her daughter was. So unique and so gifted in so many ways that she had convinced herself that it was only a mother\u2019s pride that made her see it.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s still your child, Elizabeth.\u201d He tried to step closer to her, then stopped as she retreated in panic. She couldn\u2019t let him touch her. If she did, she would break. Shatter into so many fragments she would never be able to find all the pieces again. \u201cI smell your connection to her. It\u2019s unmistakable. But Dane Colder is not her father.\u201d</p><p>She was going to faint. Elizabeth could feel it and fought it. He could smell it? No. Motherhood wasn\u2019t a smell. Or was it? Cassie had come from her body. Her womb. She trembled violently. How could he smell it?</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d She shook her head desperately, suddenly remembering Dane\u2019s desperation to convince her to have a child that first year. \u201cHe was desperate for a child. We went to the doctor\u2019s office together. He did everything he was supposed to.\u201d</p><p>She was fighting to deny him, to deny what he was telling her. Fighting to try to find a way out of this sudden, horrifying situation. She stared at Dash, silently pleading, begging him to take it back, to show just a small moment of weakness, a doubt that he could be right. If he would, then she could find a way to convince herself that none of this could be true. Instead, he gave her proof.</p><p>\u201cMartaine was a high level Genetics Council scientist,\u201d he said with chilling knowledge. Of course, he knew, she thought. He was a Breed. He knew the monsters who worked within those labs. \u201cHe worked in the initial phases of breeding, trying to reverse the coding that kept the males from fertilizing their females.\u201d A low, painful whimper was her only protest. \u201cWhen he failed to do what they wanted, he was quietly retired rather than killed, in case they needed him later,\u201d Dash continued. \u201cHe went into fertility practice and evidently his experiments continued. Somehow, he figured out how to use the unique Breed sperm to fertilize the ova. Because I swear to you, Elizabeth, Cassie is a Wolf Breed child. That is why Grange won\u2019t let her go. That is why he killed her father. And that was why Dane refused to accept the child. Because he knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head desperately. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have done that. He wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did, Elizabeth,\u201d he snarled, the sound ricocheting through her body like a bullet. \u201cListen to me, damn you, because Cassie\u2019s life is in more danger than you ever realized. She is the first. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>She flinched violently. \u201cShe is the first Breed child conceived outside a lab. The first created, in vitro, without first altering the ova to accept the unique DNA. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying, Elizabeth?</p> <p>She\u2019s unique. A bridge between human and Breeds, and a female in the bargain. Breedable, Elizabeth. Grange would know that. He knows it and he wants her for it. And if he doesn\u2019t get her, his next step will be to sell this information to the bastards who created us to begin with.\u201d</p><p>Breedable? She was a baby. You didn\u2019t breed babies. You cuddled them and you loved them and you raised them to be happy and free and to love you in return. She couldn\u2019t make sense of this. Couldn\u2019t accept the information battering into her brain.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just a baby. You can\u2019t do that with a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElizabeth.\u201d He groaned her name with agonizing emotion. \u201cListen to me, honey. You have to listen to me now. You can\u2019t protect Cassie from this. You can\u2019t shelter her or run far enough away to hide her from this.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth stared back at him in shock. Couldn\u2019t protect Cassie? She had to protect Cassie. She was her child. She couldn\u2019t accept anything else.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let my baby die,\u201d she raged furiously. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. You have to be wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not wrong,\u201d he snapped. \u201cThe sounds she makes while she\u2019s sleeping. There wasn\u2019t a Wolf Breed in the labs I lived in that didn\u2019t make that sound as children. When she was playing with Mica and bit her. It\u2019s instinct to use the teeth rather than the hands to gain freedom. Her canines are longer. Her intelligence is far advanced for her age...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d She screamed out at the pain radiating through her body now. She couldn\u2019t bear to breathe; it hurt so badly. She had to escape him. Had to help Cassie survive this. \u201cGet away from me. Just get the hell out away from me.\u201d</p><p>She moved for the connecting bathroom. She had to get to Cassie. Had to make sure nothing or no one could ever hurt her child again. She tried to run, tried to rush past him and escape the pain he was bringing into her life.</p><p>He caught her just past the chairs, moving faster than she could. His arms, so hard and strong, wrapped around her, dragging her against his chest as she collapsed. One big hand held her head against him, his broad chest absorbing her sudden scream of agonizing denial.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she wailed against his chest, her fists slamming into him as hard as the truth slammed into her soul.</p><p>\u201cOh God, no. He didn\u2019t do this to my baby.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking so hard in his arms she frightened herself. On one level, she was aware of the breakdown. The past two years had culminated in this. The fragile hold she held on her control crumpled and memories assailed her mind.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been comfortable with Martaine. Dane had had to fight, beg and plead with her to allow the doctor to perform the procedure. Elizabeth had wanted someone else. Had wanted a doctor she trusted, one who didn\u2019t make her skin crawl. But Dane had been insistent. It would be private this way. No one would ever know that their child hadn\u2019t been conceived naturally. No one would be aware that he wasn\u2019t man enough to get his own wife pregnant.</p><p>The list of excuses had been long and the fights had almost been violent. Finally, Elizabeth had given in. Dane had been ecstatic until they had been told the procedure had been effective. Elizabeth had conceived.</p><p>He had been quiet. His excitement had slowly faded from that moment on. And she had never known why. Now she knew. It had gone from his wife and child to an experiment. Dane had been almost obsessively jealous. The realization that she wasn\u2019t carrying his child must have eaten him alive. It had. It had destroyed their marriage, and eventually his greed had taken his life.</p><p>\u201cMike, see what you can find out about Colder and Martaine, privately, such as any money owed or paid. I need as much information as I can get. Put a call into Tyler for me. We have to talk again.\u201d</p><p>She had been barely aware of the other man and his wife entering the room as she and Dash fought. Now she was in his arms as he held her tightly to his chest, crying. She didn\u2019t know why she was crying. Tears weren\u2019t going to help. But she couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>As Dash threw out hasty orders to the other man, his hands were stroking her hair, her back, holding her close to the heat and hardness of his body. Sheltering her the only way he knew how. She recognized it. Had done it often with Cassie.</p><p>Her baby had been betrayed again, just as Elizabeth had been. It all made sense now. So many things she hadn\u2019t been able to explain: the sudden influx of money after she conceived, Dane\u2019s distance from the child, Martaine\u2019s interest in her. He had visited the house often before her divorce and had called her personally several times.</p><p>And Cassie. Elizabeth felt her heart stop. Her daughter knew. She knew and hadn\u2019t told Elizabeth. She had to know. She was there when Dane was killed, had heard her father haggling over the price of selling her to Grange. She would have to be aware of her birthright. The pieces started falling into place. How Cassie had known all the times someone had been in the apartments they had lived in. She had stopped, fear holding her body rigid as she breathed in deeply. They\u2019re here, Momma. The fairy says they\u2019re here. The fairy hadn\u2019t shown up before the night Dane had been killed.</p><p>The fairy told her when danger was coming. Instinct. Animal awareness, as had been explained in the interviews she had seen with the Feline Breeds. It developed in the young and only grew stronger as they matured. The fairy told her when their enemies were close. Instinct. She could smell them, just as Dash could smell the proof of her parentage. The fairy always knew the things that Cassie was training herself to accept and strengthen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pushed against Dash\u2019s chest, wiping at the tears on her face, fighting for control. He wouldn\u2019t let her go. He held her to him, knowing she wanted to run, to hide not just from Grange and the truth, but from him as well.</p><p>He had claimed her. He had already informed her of that fact. He wouldn\u2019t let her go. She remembered Callan Lyons\u2019 interviews. His fierce protectiveness of his wife, Merinus. The determination to see her safe at all costs. His eyes had blazed when he spoke of her and she had seen a man who would kill to save his woman. As Dash had done. He had killed to protect her and Cassie. How many more would he be forced to kill now? The thought of that, the danger to not just her child but to Dash as well, was destroying her.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p> <p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d She pushed against his chest again as Mike and Serena left the room. \u201cI have to check on Cassie. Please, Dash. I have to check on her.\u201d</p><p>He let her go slowly as she fought to dry her face, to stem the tears still rolling from her eyes. She</p><p>couldn\u2019t go in there like this. Cassie would wake up. She always knew when her mother was upset, when she was crying...</p><p>God, let her be asleep. She rushed to the room, somehow knowing Cassie was awake. She was. Sitting up in the bed, her own face wet with tears as she clutched the teddy bear Dash had bought her at the diner. Her frail shoulders were shaking with her tears as she rocked to and fro. Silent, heartbreaking sobs that destroyed Elizabeth. How much had her daughter heard?</p><p>\u201cCassie?\u201d Elizabeth realized she was shaking, trembling from head to foot as her daughter raised her head, shame and fear contorting her little face.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not bad, Momma,\u201d she whispered desperately. \u201cI swear, Momma. I swear, I\u2019m not an animal. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d She felt faint, in shock, seeing the truth in her daughter\u2019s eyes as she huddled so miserably on the bed.</p><p>Elizabeth rushed to her, pulling her into her arms, feeling her daughter\u2019s thin little arms wrap around her as sobs shook her body.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t breathe. Elizabeth fought the dizziness wrapping around her as she rocked the little girl, fighting the hysteria edging into her mind as Cassie\u2019s panicked voice echoed around her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she was screaming against her mother\u2019s breast. \u201cMomma, please. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d She fought her own tears as she pulled her daughter back, staring into the little face, seeing so much pain, so much realization of the cruelties of the world. \u201cWhy are you sorry, baby? Cassie, you haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe said you won\u2019t love me.\u201d Cassie was shaking so hard her teeth rattled. \u201cSaid I was an animal. Said I needed to be penned. That you wouldn\u2019t want an animal. And you don\u2019t like puppies. Or even cats. And he said you wouldn\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s hands were clawing at her neck as Elizabeth stared down at her in such overwhelming shock she feared she was losing her mind. Cassie was screaming, crying, so hysterical Elizabeth knew she would make herself sick soon.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Elizabeth shook her firmly. \u201cCassidy Paige Colder. That is enough.\u201d</p><p>She used the voice Cassie called the \u2018no chocolate\u2019 voice. Firm, chastising, guaranteed to grab her daughter\u2019s attention.</p><p>Cassie\u2019s eyes widened, the tears still flowed, sobs still tore from her chest but she wasn\u2019t screaming, wasn\u2019t terrifying Elizabeth with her complete hysteria.</p><p>\u201cCassidy. Why are you crying?\u201d She fought the need to cuddle her baby, to rock her, but she saw the complete shock filling her child\u2019s eyes and knew Cassie would never hear the gentle words. Cassie blinked. \u201cI\u2019m an animal, Momma.\u201d The pain in her voice was hard to hear.</p><p>\u201cIs Tanner Williams an animal, Cassidy Paige? Callan Lyons? Are they animals?\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s breath hitched. \u201cIs that little baby Callan\u2019s wife is having an animal, Cassie?\u201d she questioned her daughter fiercely. \u201cIs this how you see them? Those men and women who fought for their lives and their hearts, so perfectly beautiful. Are they animals?\u201d</p> <p>Cassie stared up at her in surprise. \u201cNo, Momma.\u201d She shook her head fiercely.</p><p>\u201cHave I said they are animals, Cassie?\u201d she snapped fiercely. \u201cHaven\u2019t I always cheered for them right along with you? What makes you think I would believe you are an animal? Young lady, you are very close to losing chocolate for a month.\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s mouth gaped open, her eyes widening as Elizabeth stared down at her with a mother\u2019s righteous anger.</p><p>\u201cMaybe two months,\u201d Elizabeth amended. \u201cBecause if you know anything in this world, you should have known how much I love you, Cassie.\u201d Her voice broke then, tears filling her eyes, clogging her throat as she stared down at the vulnerable, almost broken child. Dear God, she could kill Dane herself for what he had done to Cassie.</p><p>\u201cHe said I was an animal.\u201d She shook her head slowly, the tears finally easing.</p><p>\u201cNo, Cassie.\u201d She gripped the girl\u2019s face, staring down at her with an inner rage that seared her soul.</p><p>\u201cYou are my baby. And whoever your natural father is, wherever he is, I can only thank him for giving me a child as precious, as smart and as loving as you are. Do you understand me, Cassie? Do you hear what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p><p>Cassie blinked up at her. In a second the little girl was in her arms, clinging tightly to her neck, a hard, desperate kiss plastered to her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Momma,\u201d she whispered at her ear. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Cassie.\u201d She could rock her baby now. Could hold her in her arms and cuddle her, comfort her.</p><p>Elizabeth closed her eyes, fighting her own screams, her own sobs, as she held her daughter tightly to her breast. She pressed her lips to Cassie\u2019s head, sheltered her in her arms and prayed to God that they could find a way, some way, to protect her now.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter that the Tolers were standing in the doorway. That Dash was watching them with hungry eyes. All that mattered now was Cassie. Her protection. Her safety. And Elizabeth knew that only Dash could assure it.</p><p>She raised her eyes to him, fighting her tears, knowing Cassie could never handle seeing her mother fall now. But Elizabeth knew she was damned close to doing just that. She was shaking on the inside, lightheaded, weak. Dear God, what were they going to do now?</p><p>Mike and his wife slowly left the room as Dash neared the bed, his eyes bleak and filled with pain as he stared down at Elizabeth.</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d He sat down beside her. \u201cYou were eavesdropping, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Cassie tensed in her mother\u2019s arms, then nodded hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cYou heard what I am then, didn\u2019t you?\u201d he asked her softly. Once again, Cassie nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was very young, Cassie, not much older than you, I escaped the labs and I ran as far and as hard from that place as I could. Because I knew I wasn\u2019t an animal. I knew I deserved to live and to be free. Just as you do. You are a perfect, beautiful little girl. As beautiful as your momma is. But you have to believe that. Remember? You told me that in a letter. If you believe, then it\u2019s as real as sunshine. Do you remember that, Cassie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMomma told me that.\u201d She hiccupped against Elizabeth\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cAnd does your momma lie to you, Cassie?\u201d He touched her hair softly; at the same time Elizabeth felt his arm steal around her shoulders.</p><p>He was heat and strength. God, she needed that strength right now.</p><p>\u201cMomma never lies,\u201d Cassie finally sighed.</p><p>\u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t.\u201d He pulled them both into his arms, holding them, protecting them. \u201cAnd neither will I, Cassie. Ever. Now I need you to tell me exactly what happened that night. Until I know what happened, I can\u2019t protect you and your momma fully. You have to tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth knew when he said the words that she wouldn\u2019t be able to handle Cassie\u2019s remembrances of that night. She was right. But she stayed silent, fighting to escape within herself, to pull that mantle of distance around her shoulders that would keep her strong for her daughter. Dane had owed Grange a frightening amount of money. When the other man arrived at the house, Dane had been waiting. He had already informed Cassie of her parentage, had raged at her, telling her over and over what a little animal she was, how she needed to be caged, penned up like the other animals in the world. That her mother could never want her now. Never love her. Didn\u2019t Cassie know how her mother refused to let her have a pet? He had told her cruelly. How did she think her mother would feel when she learned Cassie was nothing more than all the animals she had denied over the years?</p><p>Cassie had been crying when Grange showed up for his money. It was then Dane offered him something much more valuable. A Breed child. Conceived naturally, and without the genetic faults that kept the other Breeds from conceiving children. Trainable. Breedable. To convince the other man, he had ripped Cassie\u2019s gown from her, showing him the genetic marker. The same marker notated in the Top Secret files Martaine had given him years before.</p><p>Grange had been ecstatic. But he had been smart enough to know Dane could never get away with selling his daughter. He had told Cassie to watch. To see how very easy it was to kill a man. That it would be the first of many lessons she would soon learn. In front of her eyes he had killed her father. Cassie cried as she told them what happened, and Elizabeth didn\u2019t stop her. The sobs were heartbreaking, cleansing. Finally, Cassie was being allowed to face the truth of that night, as was Elizabeth.</p><p>When she finished, Elizabeth rocked her, hummed a lullaby to her and didn\u2019t protest as Dash sat, holding them both. Finally, the little girl slipped into an exhausted sleep in her mother\u2019s arms. Elizabeth laid her back in the bed and smoothed the dark curls away from her face with trembling fingers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wake up soon,\u201d she whispered hoarsely. \u201cI\u2019ll wake up in my house, in my bed and realize it\u2019s all been a horrible nightmare.\u201d</p><p>Dash sighed behind her as he rose from the bed. \u201cWhen you do, wake me up as well,\u201d he sighed. \u201cThen find an explanation for me being in that bed beside you. Because I won\u2019t let you go, Elizabeth. Not now. Not ever.\u201d</p><p>She stared down at her daughter, unable to turn and look at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d she asked him, fighting the feeling of helplessness suddenly overtaking her. \u201cTell me what to do, Dash. How do I protect her now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t, Elizabeth.\u201d His voice was hard, cold. \u201cBut I can. And I will. Now lie down and try to rest. We\u2019ll plan this out tomorrow. And I promise you, Cassie will be protected.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Tomorrow came too soon. Elizabeth sat hollow-eyed and quiet in the study as Dash and Mike Toler faced her. The plans he had made, without her approval, were insane. Somehow, as night had turned to dawn, she had known this was coming. She had listened to Cassie\u2019s soft little puppy sounds as she slept, and had known Dash would take her baby away from her.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter that she knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that he wanted only to protect her. It didn\u2019t matter that she knew protection would come with a price. All she knew was that the culmination of two years of fighting, fleeing and hiding had ended with this.</p><p>She sat on the worn couch and faced the two men, her hands tucked between her knees, feeling disjointed, disassociated from the world around her. Her baby, the child she had raised, had been no more than an experiment to others. She had been used and her daughter had been used, horribly. A little girl had been forced to grow up too soon. To see the horror of a life she should have never known. And now, they wanted to separate her from her mother.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She kept her voice quiet, reasonable. Dash didn\u2019t look surprised. He shouldn\u2019t be surprised, she thought. He should have known she would never agree. He should have come up with another plan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cElizabeth.\u201d He sighed deeply. The sound was filled with regret. \u201cListen to me, baby. If you go with her, then we\u2019ll never draw Grange back to his estate at the right time. We get Cassie safe then we take care of the monster. It\u2019s the only way we can do this.\u201d</p><p>There had to be another way, because she wasn\u2019t accepting this one.</p><p>\u201cCassie stays with me.\u201d She rose to her feet, staring back at the men calmly, amazed at herself and the lack of fury, fear or rage inside her.</p> <p>She should be screaming this morning. Her insides should be a shuddering wreck at the thought of what her daughter was facing. She shouldn\u2019t have been able to function considering the state of shock she knew she had entered.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth.\u201d Dash stepped in front of her as she moved to leave the room. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>She stopped before she could touch him. She couldn\u2019t touch him. Couldn\u2019t let his heat seep past the icy protection she had pulled around her heart. She stared at his chest for long moments, seeing how well the Army T-shirt hugged the broad muscles, stretching and conforming to a body she hungered for. A body she couldn\u2019t touch. Had no right to desire.</p><p>\u201cOf course we do.\u201d She shrugged as she finally stared up at him. \u201cWe do the same thing the Felines do. We go to the media.\u201d</p><p>She could almost feel the air humming around her now, charged with anger and volatile protest. It was a simple solution. The Felines had done it and were now so securely protected and autonomous that no one dared mess with them for fear of public outrage. Her daughter could be protected in the same way. Couldn\u2019t she?</p> <p>\u201cThe media,\u201d Dash said carefully. \u201cThink about that, Elizabeth. Cassie isn\u2019t an adult and she doesn\u2019t have a Pride backing her. What\u2019s more, she wasn\u2019t lab-created. She was conceived naturally, which raises the stakes in ways you can never imagine. You\u2019re a woman alone and the scientists who will be eager to get their hands on Cassie for studies ,\u201d he sneered the word, \u201ccould contrive any manner of charges against you. You\u2019ll go from a mother fighting to save her child, to a money-grubbing mercenary using her baby to make her own way. They could frame you for Dane\u2019s murder. Make it appear you were in league with Grange...\u201d</p><p>She shook her head desperately, panic flaring in her chest. \u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will, Elizabeth.\u201d Dash kept his voice soft, almost sinister. \u201cListen to me. Hear what I\u2019m saying because you know it\u2019s true. They can do it. And they will. Cassie is exceptional. She\u2019s also exploitable. Don\u2019t think you can win with them. If you go to the media now, before she\u2019s listed as a Breed and under their protection, then you\u2019ve lost her forever.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth swallowed tightly as she stared into his eyes, seeing the total conviction there, the strength of his beliefs. She hadn\u2019t considered it, that they would try to take her child away from her, to manipulate opinion in such a manner. She looked over at Mike Toler. His face was somber, his gaze concerned as he nodded in agreement. They could do it , his expression seemed to shout. They would do it. And where did that leave her except without her child?</p><p>\u201cBut, she\u2019ll be without me,\u201d she whispered as she turned back to Dash, wrapping her arms protectively around her chest. \u201cYou have to make them let me go with her.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t imagine being separated from Cassie. Not being there when her daughter had nightmares, when she was frightened. If something happened. How else could she be sure her daughter was protected?</p> <p>\u201cGrange knows your habits, baby,\u201d Dash continued. \u201cHe believes you would never let Cassie go anywhere alone. He won\u2019t expect this. Then, when we\u2019re ready, we\u2019ll let him think he\u2019s found you. If you disappear with Cassie, then he\u2019ll go to ground, hide, until he gets his chance to take her. A chance you won\u2019t be able to anticipate. We have to take him out, Elizabeth. It\u2019s the only way.\u201d</p><p>Take him out. For a moment the memory of the news report flashed in her mind. Grange\u2019s henchman found in a pool of blood, his throat slit open, an efficient killing, the reporter had concluded. Dash had taken him out, completely.</p><p>\u201cKill him?\u201d she asked him weakly. She had never killed anyone. But, she had never been given the chance at Grange\u2019s throat, either.</p><p>\u201cOnly if we have to,\u201d he promised her, but she saw the naked fury in his eyes. She had a feeling he would make it a \u2018have to\u2019 case. \u201cFirst we get Cassie protected. Then we see what we can do about Grange. We might get lucky and he\u2019ll listen to reason.\u201d He shrugged. Elizabeth blinked. His eyes glittered savagely and his tone of voice clearly reflected his hope that Grange wasn\u2019t inclined to listen to any kind of reason. In that moment, he looked like what he had been created to be. A savage, merciless hunter.</p><p>\u201cSo in essence, we go hunting?\u201d she asked him slowly.</p><p>The smile that crossed Dash\u2019s face was nearly a snarl. \u201cThat\u2019s a good description.\u201d He nodded. He seemed to like the idea.</p><p>Elizabeth watched him. As she did, she felt the blistering-hot fury creeping around the edges of the shield she had fought to put in place all through the night. Terrance Grange had hunted her and Cassie for two years. Killing anyone who would have helped them, standing in the way of any chance Cassie would have had at a normal life.</p><p>He had done it out of greed and a lust for power. To possess someone so unique, so special, and use her for his own twisted, depraved ends. He was a demon. A monster that wouldn\u2019t stop until he destroyed Cassie.</p> <p>She took a hard, steadying breath. \u201cTeach me to hunt.\u201d She gazed back at him, allowing the anger to strengthen, feeling the shield crumble. \u201cI mean it, Dash. You teach me how.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t sit on the sidelines. If she had to do this his way, then she would fight as well. And she knew he could teach her how to fight.</p><p>His eyes narrowed and what glowed there should have terrified her. It was lust. Hot. Hungry. As though the thought of her fighting him had ignited a flame he had no intentions of dampening.</p><p>\u201cTrain you?\u201d he asked her carefully. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s what you want, Elizabeth? You could do this the safe way. I don\u2019t mind carrying the brunt of the work. I know how.\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned, nostrils flaring as her head raised and she met his look directly. She could tell he knew how. He was like that, willing to carry it all whether it was his fight or not.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my baby,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cIt was our lives he destroyed. If I have to send my child away to</p><p>protect her, then someone is going to have to pay for it. It\u2019s his fault.\u201d</p><p>So he should pay. She left it unsaid.</p><p>Dash stared down at her for long, silent moments. In that time, the heat seemed to build in his eyes, in the very air around him. She expected any moment to feel the flames licking over her body. He looked like a man ready to give into all of his baser needs whether he had an audience or not.</p><p>\u201cMike,\u201d Dash murmured. \u201cCan I talk to Elizabeth alone?\u201d</p><p>There went the audience. Elizabeth stilled the tremble of trepidation that shuddered over her body. Mike rose slowly to his feet, clearing his throat. \u201cI\u2019ll just be in the kitchen, breathing in clear air. It\u2019s getting too damned hot in here to suit me anyway.\u201d He was grinning as he passed them. As the door closed, Dash turned back to her slowly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fuck you,\u201d he told her softly, without a doubt in his voice that it would happen. \u201cIf I train you, I\u2019ll do more than just teach you how to shoot or how to fight, Elizabeth. I won\u2019t be able to stop it.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips nervously. \u201cYou would have anyway. We both know that.\u201d It was something she had accepted as she lay in his arms the night before. There was no hiding from it. He could have had her then. Could have taken her there in his bedroom and she wouldn\u2019t have stopped him. He shook his head warningly. \u201cIt\u2019s different, Elizabeth. Protecting you and fighting beside you are two different things. If you\u2019re tough enough to go for blood, then you\u2019re tough enough for everything I am. Every part of me. Are you willing to accept that?\u201d</p><p>She frowned then. \u201cWhat? You fuck different from other men?\u201d She finally snapped. \u201cWhat more could you do?\u201d</p><p>He moved around her. He stalked, actually, watching her closely.</p><p>\u201cI bet Dane fucked you missionary. Lights out. A shuffle in the dark, a grunt or two and then it was over.\u201d</p><p>The disgust for the other man, dead though he was, was clearly apparent. Elizabeth flushed. It was much too close to the truth.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cWhat will you do? Leave the lights on?\u201d</p><p>He was behind her, his head leaning close to hers, his lips at her ear.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been mounted?\u201d he asked her roughly, heatedly. \u201cTaken to your knees because the lust was so hot, so powerful, it couldn\u2019t be denied? Your clothes ripped from your body and taken so deeply, so hard, you couldn\u2019t do anything but scream out your orgasm?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth\u2019s eyes widened, her heart suddenly racing in her chest. She shook her head slowly as she tried to speak. \u201cNo,\u201d she finally gasped.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t touching her, but her breasts were swelling, her nipples hardening almost painfully as her pussy wept its thick juices in need.</p><p>His hand moved over the curve of her rear, ignoring her flinch of surprise. \u201cWhat about here?\u201d He actually growled. The sound rasped down her spine, but rather than fear, it brought an edge of excitement she couldn\u2019t deny.</p><p>His hunger pulsed in the air around her. It was deep, consuming, making her womb clench in response.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She was confused now. Consumed by the image of him mounting her, taking her.</p><p>\u201cHave you been fucked up that tight ass, Elizabeth?\u201d he asked as her eyes widened in shocked surprise.</p><p>\u201cDo you know every time I watch you walk, watch that pretty rear flex, all I can think about is sinking my cock inside it?\u201d</p><p>As if it were possible! He was trying to scare her. Trying to make her back down, she was certain. She wasn\u2019t about to.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d She jumped away from him, turning back to him furiously. \u201cWhy are you trying to scare me off like this? I have the right to do this, Dash.\u201d</p><p>The look in his eyes was almost frightening. Dash didn\u2019t have blood on his mind; he had hot, explicit sex filling his head instead.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d He shook his head slowly, a feral smile tipping his lips. \u201cYou keep forgetting. I\u2019m not just a soldier, baby. I\u2019m a Breed. And trust me when I tell you you\u2019ll never fuck another man like me. You\u2019ll never be taken again in the ways I\u2019ll take you. I can protect you, and in doing so, rein in some of the harder aspects of my lust, for a while. But if I have to train you, teach you to fight beside me, then you\u2019ll take me. Every way. You\u2019ll have all I am, Elizabeth, not just the man you want me to be. Now make your choice. And know that once you make it, there\u2019s no turning back. No whining, no pouting, no false denials. You will accept it.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth was dry, but other parts of her body were too damned wet for comfort.</p><p>\u201cWill you rape me?\u201d she asked him suspiciously. No man would take her except on her terms. Dane hadn\u2019t and Dash sure as hell wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>He tilted his head, cool confidence washing over his expression.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo means no,\u201d she told him tightly. \u201cWill you abide by that?\u201d</p><p>He nodded instantly. \u201cOf course.\u201d Then he smiled that smile that made her more than nervous. \u201cYou can\u2019t say no after the fact, though. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him sardonically. \u201cAgreed. But that confidence could find you on your ass, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr up yours,\u201d he murmured. \u201cSo we have an agreement?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was agreeing to allow her daughter to be taken from her. To place her under the protection of strangers. To trust men and women she didn\u2019t know. But, she also knew the hell those men and women had lived. They had been hunted, betrayed. They would care for Cassie, protect her with their lives, just as they had each other. But her baby would be without her. For a while. She drew in a deep breath and swallowed tightly. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>Oh Lord. If his eyes could have gotten hotter, they just did. The golden-brown was nearly amber now, glittering with lust. His nostrils flared, his expression becoming heavy with sensuality.</p><p>\u201cDo you know I can smell your arousal?\u201d he asked her softly. \u201cI know when your sweet heat is flowing for me, Elizabeth. When your pretty pussy is coated with that slick dew, preparing for me. Like it is now. It turns you on to think about fighting me, doesn\u2019t it? Makes you wet and hot to imagine pitting your mind against my strength. Just like it makes me hard. So hard walking could become a problem.\u201d</p><p>Her face flamed with mortification, because she was wet now and only growing wetter by the second. She should be thinking about Cassie. Thinking about the separation, but all she could think about was Dash and the hunger building between them both.</p> <p>Her gaze flickered to his jeans, then quickly back to his face. That zipper was going to burst soon. And he was right. It did turn her on. He intended to take her, to make her submit. She could see it in his expression, hear it in his voice. She had never submitted to anyone. She didn\u2019t intend to start with Dash. Elizabeth licked her lips, relieving the painful dryness, then swallowing tightly as he followed the movement.</p><p>\u201cGo to Cassie,\u201d he finally growled. \u201cGet away from me before I take you now. Kane and his brothers, as well as several of the main Feline Pride, will be here tonight. Get ready, Elizabeth, because when they leave, you\u2019ll see what it means to be my woman.\u201d</p><p>She backed up slowly. She wasn\u2019t running, she assured herself, she was exercising extreme caution instead. He wasn\u2019t joking. He was ready to take her, here and now, and she didn\u2019t know if she could honestly deny him right now.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>The Feline Breeds were just as intense and gorgeous in real life as they had been on the television screen. They arrived after midnight in a large stealth helicopter, landing in the back pasture of Mike Toler\u2019s ranch.</p> <p>Kane Tyler and three of his brothers were there. Callan Lyons, Taber Williams, Tanner, Dawn and Sherra had accompanied them. Each was armed and looked just as dangerous as they had been trained to be. Elizabeth sat in the living room with Cassie, holding her against her chest, rocking her. Despite her dream of actually meeting the Felines, Cassie hadn\u2019t taken the news of her separation from her mother very well.</p><p>She had cried for hours. It broke Elizabeth\u2019s heart listening to her daughter sob and wail, begging her not to send her away. Elizabeth had cried with her. Emotionally, they were both wrecks by the time the large force entered the house.</p><p>Elizabeth could only stare at them in shock. They were as big and muscular as Dash, but their eyes were harder, their expressions carved in stone, until they caught sight of Cassie. Elizabeth watched, amazed, as the two women turned away, their eyes shining with moisture. The three male Felines\u2019 gazes darkened painfully.</p><p>\u201cCallan?\u201d Kane asked softly, as though for confirmation.</p><p>Callan stepped closer, his eyes so golden-brown they were amber, his long, tawny brown hair flowing around the harsh features of his face. As he stepped to the couch, Elizabeth was aware of Dash moving behind her protectively, possessively. The other Breed noticed the movement as well, if the amused quirk of his lips was any indication.</p><p>\u201cCassidy.\u201d He sat on his haunches, staring at the little girl gently. \u201cWhat a lovely little girl you are. I hear you might need our help for a bit of time.\u201d</p> <p>His voice was deep, sandpapery, but exquisitely gentle as he watched the little girl.</p><p>\u201cI wanna stay with my momma,\u201d Cassie hiccupped tearfully as Elizabeth fought the need to demand that her daughter be given exactly what she wanted.</p><p>Pain flashed in Callan\u2019s eyes. They were amazingly expressive as they watched Cassie, showing his sympathy, his need to comfort her.</p><p>\u201cYou know Grange is a very bad man, Cassie,\u201d Callan said softly. \u201cI\u2019ve been checking into him. You know he\u2019ll hurt you and your momma if he can get hold of you.\u201d He held his hand up as Elizabeth began to protest. \u201cI won\u2019t lie to you, Cassie. I won\u2019t tell you any of this is going to be easy, for you or your momma. Facts are facts. Dash and your momma can\u2019t deal with Grange if you aren\u2019t hidden first. If they try, something could happen, and Grange could end up hurting you all.\u201d</p><p>Cassie trembled. \u201cBut the fairy can\u2019t help momma if I\u2019m gone,\u201d she protested tearfully. Callan never looked away from the little girl. \u201cBut Dash can, Cassie. He and your momma can move faster and trick Grange easier if they know you\u2019re hidden and protected. And you\u2019ll both be hidden and protected at my home. I promise you this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want my momma,\u201d Cassie whimpered, her arms tightening around Elizabeth\u2019s waist. \u201cI\u2019m staying with my momma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallan.\u201d The woman that moved behind him was much smaller than the others. Her soft golden-brown hair and eyes were immeasurably gentle. Dawn was a Cougar Breed and Elizabeth could clearly see the influence of the animal\u2019s DNA in her. Her high cheekbones, slanted golden eyes and finely arched brows gave her a very feline appearance.</p><p>Cassie seemed to jerk in surprise when the woman approached her. She leaned forward, then back, then stared up at Elizabeth with rounded eyes.</p> <p>Cassie cupped her fingers over her mouth and whispered up to Elizabeth. \u201cShe has a fairy, Momma. Right beside her. Just like mine.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth wasn\u2019t certain what to say at this point. She had thought Cassie\u2019s fairy was no more than an excuse for the knowledge she picked up through her more advanced senses.</p><p>\u201cShe does?\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>Cassie nodded. \u201cBut she\u2019s sad.\u201d Then she turned to Dawn. \u201cWhy is your fairy sad?\u201d</p><p>Dawn blinked then glanced at Elizabeth.</p><p>\u201cCassie has her own fairy,\u201d Elizabeth explained. \u201cShe...comforts her.\u201d She didn\u2019t know what else to say.</p><p>Dawn finally smiled in understanding. \u201cPerhaps my fairy gets tired of being alone.\u201d She sighed. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many fairies left in the world, Cassie.\u201d</p><p>Cassie tilted her head, considering. \u201cNo. She\u2019s sad because you don\u2019t hear her,\u201d she finally said. \u201cYou should listen to your fairy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Dawn nodded. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how. Maybe I need someone to teach me how to listen to her.\u201d</p><p>Cassie was silent for long moments. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna leave my momma.\u201d Her voice trembled tearfully. Callan moved back as Dawn sat down on the couch beside Elizabeth and Cassie and watched the little girl with tender, though wary, eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you, Cassie,\u201d she finally said sadly. \u201cIf I had a momma like yours, I wouldn\u2019t want to leave her, either. But you and your momma will be safer if you are protected. And isn\u2019t that what\u2019s important right now, Cassie? That you and your momma are safe?\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s fingers plucked at Elizabeth\u2019s shirtsleeve for long moments. Finally she raised her eyes, the blue depths glittering with tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared without you, Momma,\u201d she finally whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know, baby.\u201d Elizabeth swallowed tightly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m scared without you, too. But I can\u2019t make Grange leave us alone if he knows where you are. It\u2019s very important that he can\u2019t find you so that Momma can make him go away.\u201d Far away, Elizabeth thought coldly. Cassie\u2019s head lowered again. \u201cWill you come back?\u201d she finally asked faintly.</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d Elizabeth lifted her daughter\u2019s face until she could stare into her eyes. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t keep me away. You\u2019re my baby. You know I\u2019ll come back for you. Right?\u201d</p><p>Cassie swallowed tightly. \u201cEven though I\u2019m a Breed?\u201d she asked her roughly. Fury engulfed Elizabeth, though she fought to contain it. \u201cCassidy, being a Breed doesn\u2019t make you any different to me. If you want the truth, I\u2019m so damned happy Dane isn\u2019t your daddy that I could kiss that doctor that thought he tricked us. Because he gave me the most special baby in the world. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>Cassie grinned faintly, though her eyes still swam with tears.</p><p>\u201cDash could be my daddy,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMaybe I wouldn\u2019t be so scared away if I knew he was my daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d Elizabeth wasn\u2019t shocked, but she hadn\u2019t expected Cassie to strike so soon.</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d Dash broke in on her protest. \u201cDo you know any other Wolf Breeds, young lady?\u201d</p><p>Cassie raised her eyes and shook her head no.</p><p>\u201cThen it looks like you\u2019re stuck with me. But I can\u2019t convince your momma until Grange has been punished. To do that, you need to go with Dawn and Callan. We\u2019ll discuss the rest of it later.\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s eyes narrowed. Elizabeth had never known her daughter could be such a little schemer.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna take his chocolate, Dash?\u201d she asked him, suddenly more than interested.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, all of it,\u201d Dash promised her. \u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t know the secret to get it back. Remember that.\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s grin was wider now. \u201cCan I have his chocolate, Dash?\u201d she asked innocently. \u201cChocolate should be for good girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA whole boxful, Cassie. But you have to go with Callan so your momma and me can take care of this. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Cassie sighed and glanced up at Elizabeth again.</p><p>\u201cOne day, I can buy my own chocolate,\u201d she finally sighed. \u201cYou better bring me chocolate back, Dash, or I might have to tell Momma how you bargain for ways to stay out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth was watching Dash, saw his eyes narrow, though his lips tipped into a grin.</p><p>\u201cWe might have to see about an allowance when we get back,\u201d he finally said as though she had won.</p><p>\u201cLittle girls need their chocolate money.\u201d</p><p>Cassie turned back to her mother, her smile sweetly innocent. \u201cHe will make a good daddy, Momma. I told you he would.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth snorted. \u201cWhy? Because you can twist him around your little finger?\u201d</p><p>Cassie sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s where all good daddies live, Momma. The fairy said so. We need to talk when you come get me. I could tell you all about it.\u201d</p><p>She looked so serious. Elizabeth blinked down at her daughter, not for the first time, amazed at the little girl\u2019s insights.</p><p>\u201cWe definitely will,\u201d she promised. \u201cDoes this mean you\u2019ll go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She pouted. \u201cBut they better hope they have chocolate. And they better remember, wolfs eat cats for dinner. They better not mess with me.\u201d</p><p>Before Elizabeth could get past her shock her daughter was off her lap and stalking to the stairs. She turned back at the first step. \u201cAnd I want to take my pretty clothes, too. And my gown. And my bear Dash bought me. And you better come back for me, Momma, or I\u2019ll hunt you like the big wolfs and when I catch you, I\u2019ll bite you.\u201d</p><p>She stomped off, in full temper, as Elizabeth sighed roughly. \u201cWell, at least she isn\u2019t crying.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cBut I really don\u2019t envy any of you. Cassie in a temper is not always a pretty sight to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her,\u201d Kane suddenly remarked from the other side of the room. \u201cGod bless her heart. I love her.\u201d</p><p>He was chuckling wickedly as he looked back at the Felines staring at him. \u201cWolves eat cats for dinner. By God, I wanna be a wolf.\u201d He looked at Sherra and growled. Elizabeth looked at Dash. \u201cGood God. This man is going to be watching my daughter?\u201d A flash of pure motherly fear rushed through her. Cassie and Kane Tyler together would be a catastrophe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs. Colder,\u201d Sherra finally said coolly. \u201cFor the most part, we keep him leashed and gagged. We only let him free when the cute little animal jokes are needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane,\u201d Callan said warningly. \u201cLeave Sherra alone.\u201d</p><p>Kane sighed. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to discuss this with Cassie. I bet she could help.\u201d He started for the stairs as he turned back to the others. \u201cI\u2019ll just uhhh...help her pack her chocolate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Elizabeth was on her feet in a flash. She turned back to Dash worriedly. \u201cAre you sure he\u2019s...\u201d she swallowed, \u201csane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s sane enough.\u201d Dash laughed as he shook his head. \u201cAnd he\u2019s just trying to rile Sherra. I hear he does that a lot. Elizabeth will get Cassie packed, Kane. I need to talk to you and Callan in the study. If you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>His voice assured them he really didn\u2019t give a damn if they did mind.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Kane sighed as though disappointed. \u201cI bet she knows some good wolf tricks, though. Shame on you, Dash, not letting your old buddy know about those savage little genes running loose in your body. I could have used some pointers over the last few months.\u201d He turned and followed Dash as Elizabeth shook her head in amazement.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really harmless,\u201d Sherra assured her drolly. \u201cBut we wouldn\u2019t want his humor to infect Cassie, so we promise to keep them separated.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Elizabeth breathed out slowly. \u201cThat might be a very, very good idea.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Kane hadn\u2019t changed much, Dash thought as he led the way into Mike\u2019s study. He was still as sarcastic and hell-bent on causing trouble wherever possible. The little Feline Breed, Sherra, seemed to be the night\u2019s main course for him. Strangely enough though, Dash detected a strong undercurrent of dangerous anger where the woman was concerned. He had known Kane for a long time, had fought with him, covered his back and had his own covered by the man, but he had never seen Kane Tyler quite like this. A mocking, sarcastic Kane was often a sure sign of just how dangerous he was at that moment. If the cute retorts were any indication, the little snow leopard had seriously been on his wrong side for quite a while now.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a cute kid,\u201d Kane remarked as they closed the door behind him. \u201cShe looks like you, Dash. Sure they didn\u2019t use your little soldiers for the experiment?\u201d</p><p>Short and mocking, Kane had little regard for formalities or pleasantries when he was pissed. Dash snorted. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have time to sample my little soldiers, Kane,\u201d he grunted. \u201cI haven\u2019t been in the labs since I was ten years old.\u201d</p><p>Both men stared at him in surprise. Explanation time. Damn, he had thought this day would never happen. Briefly, he explained his escape at ten. Being as small as he was, slipping into one of the supply vans and hiding hadn\u2019t been hard. He had managed to work his way from the small lab in the Colorado Mountains to Missouri in less than six months and after that, life got easy. Foster care had seen him through school, then after graduation he had enlisted in the Army. The recessed genetics had never shown up in blood tests or in physicals, and from there, it had just been a matter of keeping his secrets and doing his job.</p> <p>Both had been fairly easy. Dash had known what awaited him if the Council ever learned he had escaped and lived. They had been known to get possessive where their creations were concerned.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t mated yet?\u201d Callan asked him softly as he and Kane faced Dash from the couch.</p><p>\u201cHad sex?\u201d Dash asked, surprised. \u201cGetting a little personal there, aren\u2019t you, Lyons?\u201d That was definitely none of the Breed\u2019s business.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Callan grinned, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t yet marked the woman, Elizabeth, or I would have smelled it. Which means you haven\u2019t taken her sexually yet. Correct?\u201d</p><p>Once again, none of his business, Dash thought. Damn. He was unaware that finding Cassie protection meant questions regarding his sex life. Especially the lack thereof with Elizabeth. Dash frowned warningly. \u201cWhat does that have to do with Cassie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Cassie, not much.\u201d Callan shrugged. \u201cWith you and the mother, perhaps much. Your recessed genetics may allow you a merciful escape from what Taber and I had learned. As for the Wolf Breeds, we can only assume it\u2019s the same, since we have yet to find any who have mated.\u201d</p><p>Which didn\u2019t explain the reasons for the questions, as far as he was concerned. His relationship with Elizabeth had nothing to do with Cassie or her protection.</p> <p>Dash shook his head. \u201cWhat the hell are you getting at?\u201d</p><p>Callan leaned forward slowly. \u201cThe Feline Breed males seem to have a tendency to show their</p><p>relationship to our animal cousins in a unique way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice way of saying it,\u201d Kane snorted mockingly. \u201cDidn\u2019t know you could beat around the bush so well, Callan.\u201d</p><p>Callan flashed him an irate glance before turning back to Dash. \u201cHave you noticed anything unusual during sex with any other female?\u201d</p><p>Dash flushed as he looked between the two men. Hell. Since when did a personal interrogation come with the agreement to help?</p><p>He finally shook his head as he watched the other man in bemusement. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Kane stared up at the ceiling as though the conversation was now beyond his control or his interest. Callan sighed roughly. \u201cWhen Taber and I found our mates, we learned that our bodies have a very unique reaction to them during sex.\u201d</p><p>Kane grunted but kept quiet.</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d Dash asked in confusion.</p><p>Callan cleared his throat as a slight grin edged his lips. \u201cOur cocks produced a phenomena resembling the barb that actual felines have. It\u2019s blunt rather than sharp, but locks us into our women for long minutes after ejaculation. It\u2019s possible a similar phenomena occurs in the Wolf Breeds.\u201d</p><p>Dash stared at the man in shock. Felines had barbs, canines had... He grinned and looked at Kane.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s joking. Right?\u201d He had to be joking. Elizabeth was an amazingly steady woman, but he wasn\u2019t certain how she would take such an animalistic reaction. Hell, he didn\u2019t know how he would handle it. Kane shrugged, frowning. \u201cHell if I know. And I have no intention of finding out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe mated your sister,\u201d Dash pointed out.</p><p>Kane frowned heavily. \u201cI do not discuss sex with my baby sister,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to hear about the particulars, either.\u201d He gave Callan a warning look.</p><p>\u201cThen leave.\u201d Callan shrugged before turning back to Dash. \u201cWhatever the reactions each Breed has during mating is an issue we must be honest about. The frenzy isn\u2019t a comfortable matter, Kane, and could affect their ability to triumph over Grange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrenzy?\u201d Dash was lost.</p><p>Callan explained in clear, concise terms the \u201dfrenzy\u201d he was talking about as Dash sat and watched him in shock.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he finally breathed out roughly, checking his tongue for any swelling. \u201cOkay. No gland issue there.\u201d</p><p>Now this he didn\u2019t need. Not that he wouldn\u2019t mind having Elizabeth pinned under his body until she conceived the child he had only dreamed of as his own, but he was sure she wouldn\u2019t appreciate the</p><p>experience. Enjoy it, yes. Thank him for it? She might well kill him for it.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she is not your mate,\u201d Callan suggested. \u201cWe\u2019ve found the changes to only occur with one person. Women, in Taber\u2019s case and mine, who complimented us in every way. It\u2019s a mating. There is no other word for it. She could be the wrong woman.\u201d</p><p>Dash growled in protest. \u201cOr perhaps the Wolf Breeds don\u2019t have this reaction,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cAnd we also have to consider the recession of the genetics in my case. The scientists were going to kill me because I was human rather than animal. This discussion could be a waste of time.\u201d</p><p>He really hoped this discussion was a waste of time. He couldn\u2019t see himself explaining this to Elizabeth as such a change occurred in his own body. But the thought of it was so incredibly erotic that it caused his cock to twitch in reaction. Her slender body beneath him, locked to him, unable to escape, unable to do anything but tremble in pleasure as her body soaked up his seed.</p><p>\u201cAnd your genetics can change overnight,\u201d Callan assured him, shrugging. \u201cIt is something you should be aware of. Something that other Wolf Breeds will need to know about, should it occur. We have a few at the Feline compound, but not many as of yet. We are still uncertain if the original Pack in Mexico survived.\u201d</p><p>Dash\u2019s Pack. He shook his head wearily as he remembered the small group of children he had left behind in Colorado, just before the prepared move. At the time, he had no idea where they would go, and had been unable to find them later. \u201cIf anyone could save them, it would be Wolfe. He was a born leader, even as a child. I won\u2019t believe he\u2019s dead until I hear they found the body. As far as I\u2019ve heard, they can\u2019t be certain either way at this point, which tells me they escaped.\u201d</p><p>He had suspected all along that they had escaped but hadn\u2019t made attempts to try to track them down since learning of the location of the lab. His life had been too consumed with finding Elizabeth and Cassie. Finding his Pack could come later.</p><p>\u201cWe have lines of communication open,\u201d Kane said firmly. \u201cI have several men checking on some leads. If we hear anything, we\u2019ll let you know when you get back.\u201d</p><p>Dash nodded. \u201cI expect at least a month before we can return. I need a week, perhaps two, to run Elizabeth through some basic training before we go after Grange. I want her ready to fight in case it\u2019s needed.\u201d</p><p>Callan frowned. \u201cYou should allow her to come to the compound as well. Take some of my men, Dash, and take care of Grange. There is no reason to endanger the woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my woman, Callan.\u201d Dash shook his head. \u201cIf she stays, life won\u2019t always be easy. I won\u2019t be hemmed up in a compound unless I have to be. Elizabeth and Cassie will both have to learn how to protect themselves. You get government acceptance for Cassie and I\u2019ll take care of Grange. The rest we\u2019ll take care of as we have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrange won\u2019t be easy,\u201d Kane warned him. \u201cI checked him out before heading in. He has several highlevel government friends, which is why he\u2019s running around without a leash. He knows of Cassie\u2019s genetics; he\u2019ll know the minute we put in for government acceptance of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought of that.\u201d Dash shook his head. \u201cAll a child needs is the father\u2019s name,\u201d he reminded them.</p><p>\u201cList my name alone and leave mother and child\u2019s names blank, as well as the ages. After the papers come back, you have six months to return them with the name of the mother and child.\u201d It was a safety measure the Felines had demanded for any minor Breeds found. \u201cI\u2019ll claim parentage. That\u2019s all we need.\u201d</p><p>Callan nodded and turned to Kane. \u201cCan you get the papers together before we leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought the laptop.\u201d Kane nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll contact Merinus and have her send the file immediately. All he has to do is sign the government copy. Elizabeth has to sign our copy and I\u2019ll notarize them. We can have it done within the hour.\u201d</p><p>Dash nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s do it then. I want to get Cassie out of here as fast as possible and get on the road. We\u2019re safe enough here, but I don\u2019t like taking chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Callan said as they all rose to their feet. He extended his hand to Dash. \u201cWelcome to my Pride, Dash Sinclair. It\u2019s good to include you.\u201d</p><p>Dash accepted the handshake, feeling more than just a binding of an agreement. For the first time in his life, it was almost like having a family. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elizabeth signed her name slowly to the papers. In them, she agreed that Dash Sinclair was the paternal parent of her daughter, Cassidy Paige Colder, and as such, she had agreed to legally accept the change of name for her daughter from her birth name to that of Cassandra Angelica Sinclair. The name was picked by Cassie, of course.</p><p>\u201cCassandra Angelica is what my fairy thinks.\u201d She had nodded firmly when Elizabeth informed her of what they were doing and why. \u201cAnd I like having Dash for my daddy. I think I deserve chocolate. This matchmaking stuff is hard work.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t get chocolate, but she did get a daddy. Dash signed his own name firmly beside Elizabeth\u2019s and handed the papers over to Kane to notarize.</p> <p>The decision to change Cassie\u2019s name had come after Dawn had brought up the fear that any female child would be immediately suspect if Grange did indeed have contacts within that branch of the government. Cassie\u2019s age would be left off, but a slightly altered description would be included. Once at the Breed compound her dark locks would receive a temporary color and her change of identity would be established.</p><p>Elizabeth felt as though she were losing her daughter. The decisions she was being forced to make didn\u2019t set well with her. She had always cared for Cassie, had always made certain she was protected and safe and loved. Allowing others to do that, as well as changing her name and appearance, twisted her heart. They had her packed and dressed in her new coat all too soon. Elizabeth carried her to the waiting shadow of the helicopter, fighting her tears with every breath. She was letting her baby go. How was she supposed to let her baby go?</p><p>\u201cThe fairy says you\u2019ll come back for me, Momma,\u201d Cassie whispered in her ear as she clutched the chocolate bar Elizabeth had given her. Dash had slipped it to her minutes before they left the house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll definitely be back, Cassie.\u201d She prayed she would be.</p><p>\u201cThe fairy says Grange is bad, and that Dash will make sure he never hurts us again if I go with the Feline Breeds,\u201d the little girl said softly as she lay against Elizabeth\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019ll be my daddy and everything will be okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt will be, baby.\u201d Elizabeth paused at the dark opening of the helicopter. Everyone had already entered the large aircraft except Callan Lyons.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Momma.\u201d Cassie was near tears again, and Elizabeth knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to contain her own much longer.</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby.\u201d She kissed her forehead softly, lingeringly. \u201cYou be good for Momma, and I\u2019ll come get you soon.\u201d</p><p>She handed her baby to Callan. Cassie looked so small, so defenseless in the other man\u2019s arms as he lifted her up to Dawn.</p><p>He jumped into the helicopter as Dash wrapped his arms around Elizabeth and pulled her back. The door closed, blocking out the sight of Cassie\u2019s pale face. As she and Dash drew back the required distance, the motor was engaged, the huge blades whipping up the snow on the ground, then it slowly lifted away.</p><p>\u201cCassie,\u201d she whispered painfully, allowing her tears to fall now that her daughter was out of sight. Hot, scalding streams of moisture poured from her eyes as her chest tightened violently. \u201cOh God, Cassie. Momma already misses you.\u201d</p> <p>Dash\u2019s arms were around her, holding her tightly to his chest, his head lowered over hers as the helicopter sped swiftly away from them, carrying away her reason for living.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby,\u201d Dash whispered at her ear, his voice husky, dark. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll make him pay for it. I promise you, he will pay for it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>The Tolers returned to the ranch early that morning as Dash was packing the Hummer. Elizabeth was sleeping. Finally. She had cried herself into exhaustion as he held her. She was grieving, he knew, hating the separation from her daughter and the fear that filled her. But he knew it had been a cleansing thing, a preparation for what she was aware was coming. So he had let her cry, holding her, stroking her long hair back from her pale face and murmuring gently to her.</p><p>He had never been comfortable with a woman\u2019s tears before. Had never known exactly how to handle the feeling of manipulation he had always known during them. It was absent in this case. It was the first time he had seen Elizabeth cry, had seen the control she kept so firmly in place slip. Or had it? It was hard to tell with her. She was equal parts warrior and woman. As she cried in his arms he could almost feel her resolve strengthening, her rage and pain forming into the core of steel she would need to see her through the coming days.</p><p>He could have accomplished this much faster, much easier and with no threat to her if he had taken</p><p>Callan up on his offer. But Dash had known even before then that Elizabeth would have to see this through before she would have the courage to face the life ahead of them. He had chosen her as his mate, and she knew it, even if she never spoke of it. He was now, legally, Cassie\u2019s father. The little girl was unique in so many ways that protecting her would be a full-time job until she was old enough to protect herself.</p><p>She would need parents who knew how to defend her, knew how to fight together. Dash would make certain Elizabeth was in the least amount of actual danger possible. But to be assured she could face the dangers that could come in their lives, he had to allow her this. There was always the chance he could be killed. A chance that once again she would be alone, facing dangers she had never imagined from the Council. He had to make certain she was able to protect herself, Cassie, and any other children they might have along the way.</p> <p>When she had slipped into sleep, curled in the bed Cassie had slept in, Dash had slipped away and began preparing for their departure. A plane would come for them later that night and fly them to a deserted airfield not far from the cabin he had rented for a month\u2019s stay. There, he would train her, see how tough she was and make plans to get to Grange.</p><p>Mike was insistent that Dash allow the bastard to live. All they needed were the files Grange possessed, detailing the experiment done in-vitro on Elizabeth. That alone would secure Cassie\u2019s safety, as much as anything else would. Once she was under Pride protection the news of her existence would be revealed and would pull the teeth from the threat Grange posed. But Dash knew men like that. Knew that Grange would never be satisfied, never be content, until he destroyed Cassie. He wouldn\u2019t allow that threat to continue. Grange was a drug runner, a slaver, a child molester. A man whose soul was so dark and diseased that he caused misery wherever he went. Dash knew he would likely have to kill him. He wouldn\u2019t feel guilty over that fact, or remorse. Such monsters didn\u2019t deserve to draw breath. He loaded all the equipment necessary into the Hummer before packing the back seat area with weapons and ammunition. Getting to Grange wouldn\u2019t be that hard, but he wanted Elizabeth familiar with the weapons he would be carrying in.</p><p>\u201cThis is too risky, Dash,\u201d Mike warned him again. \u201cIf you won\u2019t accept the offer Callan made, let me send a few of my men in with you. Make short work of the mission and get out. You\u2019re placing Elizabeth in too much danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did that when I came for her.\u201d Dash ran a mental checklist as he stared at the store of weapons.</p><p>\u201cWhat she\u2019ll face later will be even more dangerous. She needs this to continue, Mike. Life may not be easy from here on out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a soldier, Dash. She\u2019s a woman. Cassie\u2019s safe now, her concentration will be fractured. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s strong enough for this.\u201d</p><p>Dash braced his arm on the top of the vehicle\u2019s frame as he leaned in to check the store of ammo stacked in the floorboards.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s strong enough.\u201d He had no doubt about that. It was the strength and experience to work under this new stress that bothered him. \u201cI\u2019ll protect her. I know what I\u2019m doing, Mike.\u201d</p><p>He had pulled too many civilians out of situations more exacting than what he was leading Elizabeth into. Grange was a pimple on society\u2019s ass. Burning him off wouldn\u2019t be the problem. Knowing that Elizabeth would survive with her honor and strength intact was the problem. He didn\u2019t want to break her. Didn\u2019t want to ask more of her than she could give. But he had to know she could follow him. Follow him, fight beside him and protect herself if she had to.</p><p>\u201cI know you think you know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Mike finally sighed. \u201cFor your own good, I hope you do. Just in case, I\u2019m sending Matt and Joey out there. They\u2019ll be in town if you need them. Don\u2019t hesitate to use them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Dash turned back to him, confused now.</p><p>Mike was watching him with a frown. \u201cBecause you might need help,\u201d he snapped. \u201cYou might think you\u2019re superman, Dash, but you\u2019re not. I don\u2019t want to have to bury you, if it\u2019s all the same to you.\u201d</p><p>Dash shook his head. \u201cIf I die, then I reckon they\u2019ll dispose of the body somehow, Mike. What does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>Mike was silent for long moments. \u201cIf someone massacred me and my family, Dash, what would you do?\u201d he finally asked curiously.</p><p>Dash shrugged. \u201cGo hunting. They wouldn\u2019t live long.\u201d</p><p>A grin tugged at Mike\u2019s mouth. \u201cWhy would you do that? I\u2019m sure mine and Serena\u2019s parents would bury us.\u201d</p><p>Dash was suddenly uncomfortable. \u201cIt would piss me off,\u201d he growled. \u201cI might need your ass one of these days to help put out a fire.\u201d</p><p>Mike shook his head. \u201cWhy not admit we\u2019re friends, Dash? I\u2019ve noticed you do that a lot. Forget you have friends. Steady, dependable friends. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>Dash sighed wearily. \u201cI\u2019m a Breed, Mike. You let your friends know you. Knowing who and what I am puts you at risk.\u201d</p><p>Mike shook his head again. \u201cWe were already friends, buddy. You need to loosen up some and accept that. Friends share the burden. If my wife or daughter were in danger, you would have been the first person I contacted because I know you would be the one most likely to never flinch in protecting them. Our friendship would assure you would never betray them. Not just because you\u2019re the best damned warrior I know, but because you\u2019re a friend, one I know and respect. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d</p><p>Dash pushed his fingers through his hair, sighing roughly. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to be a friend, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell.\u201d Mike frowned. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been anything but the best friend I ever had. You think I don\u2019t know who was looking after Serena and Mica on that last mission I took? You requested leave, flew over here, and spent a damned month in the hills watching the house to protect my family. What was that if it wasn\u2019t friendship?\u201d</p><p>Dash was more than surprised. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>Mike shot him a sardonic look. \u201cCome on, Dash. You were damned good, I admit. But there\u2019s no way those two \u2018hunters\u2019 that turned up dead on the other side of the mountain were anything but Gorley\u2019s men. And you forget, that nice clean little swipe across the throat is one of your trademarks. I knew the minute I got the information what was going on.\u201d</p><p>Dash cleared his throat uncomfortably. \u201cThe knife doesn\u2019t make as much noise as a gun.\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I liked Serena. She\u2019s too good for your sorry ass, though. I told you that already.\u201d</p><p>But Dash was realizing something more. He was realizing that, despite the fact that he had fought to keep himself distant, a loner, the people he depended on were more than military contacts. He had told himself that was all they were, and yet, at the same time, he had formed bonds he now realized were stronger than he could have imagined.</p><p>\u201cEverything packed then?\u201d Mike asked as he closed the door to the Hummer. Dash nodded. \u201cI\u2019m going to head up and get some sleep before leaving tonight. I appreciate you returning the Hummer for me.\u201d</p><p>The supplies would be transferred to the plane when it arrived, then to the truck Dash had arranged to be waiting at the airfield. The plans he had worked out with Mike after receiving confirmation that Cassie would be accepted into the Breed compound were coming together quickly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou need any other help, you be sure to let me know, Dash.\u201d Mike sighed. \u201cYou have a lot of people who would help you in a heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>Dash took a deep breath. He had never considered how close he was to some of the men he had fought with until his near death. And even then he had shied away from the knowledge, always feeling that he would bring friends more danger than comfort if his secret was ever revealed.</p><p>\u201cSerena, Mica and I are heading into town for the day,\u201d Mike told him as they entered the house. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back in time to catch you before you leave. Rest while you can. I\u2019ll talk to you soon.\u201d</p><p>Dash didn\u2019t go to his room, though. He went to Elizabeth\u2019s. She was still curled in the middle of the bed, a slender mound beneath the blankets, her hair flowing in wild abandon around her. He listened as Mike and his family left the house, shaking his head at the knowledge his friend\u2014and he admitted it now, Mike was a friend\u2014had forced him to realize. He had more than he ever dreamed he could have. A child, his woman, and a network of men and women working to make certain he could protect them both. Not because they were fellow soldiers, but because they were friends.</p><p>And those friends were now gone. The house was silent. There was no one there but him and Elizabeth, and the raw, aching throb of his cock. As he stood there, she rolled over, her eyes opening drowsily, watching him with a silent question. He could smell her heat, smell the soft cream building between her thighs, the need racing through her system.</p><p>\u201cUndress, Elizabeth.\u201d He almost winced at the growl that rumbled in his throat. \u201cI can\u2019t wait much longer.\u201d</p><p>Amazingly, she moved from the bed. Her hands were shaking, the vein at her throat pulsing almost violently as she began to undress.</p><p>Her shirt fell to the floor. She loosened her jeans, drawing them slowly down her hips. Elizabeth watched him closely as she revealed the black silk and lace thong he had bought her. The scraps of sensual material matched the bra hiding the full mounds of her breasts from his view. He undressed slowly, watching her, knowing this first time could be more than either of them could handle. If what Callan suggested was the truth, it would be better to learn now rather than later. Better to let her go before they were firmly in place back in California. He also knew there was no way he could wait any longer.</p><p>\u201cTake off the rest.\u201d His gaze never left hers as she unclipped the bra, drawing the cups back from the swollen mounds and shrugging it from her shoulders. Her hands went to her panties, slender fingers hooking beneath the elastic and easing them down her hips. He wanted to moan in hunger as she stepped out of them, revealing the smooth, shaven mound beneath. It glistened with her juices, the sweet earthy scent making his mouth water.</p><p>He laid his clothes over the chair as he stroked the tormented length of his erection. He was thick, large and would fill her until she screamed with the pressure. It wasn\u2019t abnormal, but it was striking. Her eyes widened as she finally glanced lower than his face. He knew the one time she had held the hard flesh in her hand hadn\u2019t been long enough for her to realize the full effect of this erection. He would more than fill her. He would take her as no other man ever had. Perhaps in ways neither of them could imagine. He had never been with a woman like Elizabeth, either. One so small, so sexually uncertain and inexperienced. His women had always been raw-boned and lusty, well able to take the formidable flesh he pushed between their thighs. Elizabeth was delicate, slender. The thought of the amazing tightness he knew he would find when he entered her was enough to make his breath catch in need.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d he whispered as he approached her, feeling the hunger for her rising so sharp and fast it nearly overwhelmed him.</p><p>Her scent wrapped around him, made him drunk on the need to touch her, taste her. He stopped in front of her, his cock throbbing and heavy between his thighs, pressing against her tummy as he leaned his forehead against hers. Her hands were trembling as he linked his with them, pulling her arms gently behind her body, arching her breasts against his chests.</p><p>She was breathing roughly, staring up at him with those dark, hungry eyes.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I need it to hurt a little.\u201d Her whispered moan had his jaw tightening with the effort to control himself. \u201cI never asked you to be easy, Dash.\u201d</p><p>He growled then. \u201cYou have no idea what I\u2019ve imagined doing to you, Elizabeth,\u201d he told her roughly.</p><p>\u201cThe many ways I\u2019ve taken you in my dreams. How many times you\u2019ve screamed for me in my fantasies. Screamed because you needed what I was giving you. Begging for more.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed tightly as his head lowered, his tongue licking at her shoulder as her hands flexed within his.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been tied?\u201d he asked her. \u201cCompletely restrained? Helpless? At the mercy of the man taking you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head roughly.</p><p>\u201cI want you helpless beneath me, Elizabeth.\u201d He wanted it, needed it until it was a hunger in his soul. \u201cI want you begging, so wet and hot that when I start stretching you open you can only beg for more.\u201d</p><p>He heard her whimper, a sound of naked longing. His sweet little Elizabeth, always so in control, always so proper and levelheaded, was shaking in arousal at the thought of being tied down for him.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t lie to you.\u201d He secured her hands in one of his while the other ran over the soft curve of her rear. \u201cI won\u2019t be easy on you. I can\u2019t be. You won\u2019t let me protect you from everything else, I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll protect you from who or what I am. Do you understand that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need another warning, Dash.\u201d Her eyes flashed in the dim light of the room, her body straining closer to him. \u201cI don\u2019t need protection from anything. Least of all you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips moved over his shoulder, then her teeth scraped before nipping at him gently. Dash closed his eyes as he fought the need to take her fast and hard.</p><p>\u201cShall I show you,\u201d she asked, \u201cjust how much I do want you, Dash Sinclair?\u201d</p><p>Her lips moved farther down his chest as she tugged roughly at the grip he had on her hands. Her tongue, liquid fire, lashed over a hard male nipple as he groaned roughly and released her. Dash stood there, damned near helpless in ways he had never been, and watched one of his greatest fantasies come to life.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Elizabeth had never known a need in her life as powerful as the need to taste Dash. To lick his skin, feel the muscles rippling under his tight flesh. His hands released her wrists, caressed over her arms as she moved lower and sampled his rapidly moving chest. His skin was free of hair except for a very faint, very soft covering of tiny fine hairs that tickled her tongue. But even that was erotic. Sensual. Everything about the man was sexy as sin.</p><p>She sank her teeth into the thick muscle below a hard male nipple, her womb clenching at the hard growl that tore from his throat. His hands clenched at her shoulders, his fingers rubbing against her bare flesh as her head moved lower. Down, past his heavy chest until she was exploring the clenching muscles of his abdomen. Her tongue licked over the hard, tanned flesh, her teeth nipping, moving steadily closer to the hard, thick erection awaiting her below.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth.\u201d His voice was a dark, sexy rumble that had her pussy creaming with hungry abandon. Her vagina ached, her womb clenching convulsively as her hands moved to his thighs. She licked closer, excited, frightened, wondering if she could possibly contain the bulging head of his cock in her mouth comfortably. Who said science didn\u2019t know what the hell it was doing? When they created Dash they gave him everything a man would need: a tall, strong body, an honorable heart, and a cock that would fill her in every way imaginable.</p><p>She went to her knees, her fingers gripping the smooth, heated flesh as she slid her tongue delicately over the throbbing head. It was the size of a large plum, dark and velvety soft, tempting her as her hunger demanded she consume him.</p><p>\u201cSweet heaven,\u201d he groaned as she slid her lips over the hard flesh. Surprisingly, a soft pulse of precome shot from the tip into her mouth. She hummed her approval of the taste. A mix of salty sweetness that made her long for more but had Dash whispering a heated curse and trying to pull free of her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered as his cock slid free of her mouth. \u201cNot yet.\u201d Her mouth covered him again as a strangled growl echoed around her.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Dash protested, but his cock slid deeper as his hips thrust against her. Her fingers enclosed the length, her mouth taking him as deep as possible. Another hard pulse of fluid shot into her mouth as she tightened on him, hearing his gasping breaths above her, feeling the tense, desperate arousal that tightened his body.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth, we need to talk first.\u201d Another small spurt of pre-come pulsed in her mouth, making her hungrier for more.</p><p>She licked the underside of the shaft slowly, suckling at the hard flesh hesitantly as she fought to accustom herself to the thickness. She had rarely gone down on Dane. He hadn\u2019t liked it. Hadn\u2019t wanted her mouth there. Dash hadn\u2019t been far from the truth when he said missionary only and lights out. She wasn\u2019t terribly experienced, but she was greedy now. She wanted to experience every sexual act a man and woman could experience with Dash. She wanted it all.</p><p>His fingers threaded through her hair, tightening in the long strands as he pulled at it gently, as though to dislodge her. As though he would pull her from the treat she was giving herself. She rarely allowed herself any type of treats, especially one like this. She hadn\u2019t been touched sexually in more years than she cared to count. Now here she was, on her knees, this powerful cock filling her mouth, this strong man breathing harshly, desperately, as she suckled at his flesh and decided now was the time to make up for her lack of treats.</p><p>\u201cGod help me, Elizabeth, please...\u201d Another strong pulse of fluid filled her mouth now. The pre-come was liquid silk and slid easily down her throat as she drew on his cock slowly, gaining confidence as he fought and failed to pull away from her.</p><p>Surely she was doing it right, she thought. Something he enjoyed as much as she enjoyed his touch. He couldn\u2019t stop, even though she knew he seemed unwilling to spill himself into her mouth. Still, he thrust against her, moaning with a pleasure that made her skin prickle with awareness. Her tongue flickered over the pulsing head with greedy licks. Her hands pumped the shaft, slick now with her saliva and the slick essence of his pre-come. His thighs were corded and tight, his hands kneading her hair, sharp growls rumbling from his throat as she pleasured him. Elizabeth felt her own arousal surging at the knowledge that she was pleasing him, that he was unable to pull from her, that the sensations she delivered to his throbbing erection kept him from forcing his will on her. For now. She knew it wouldn\u2019t last long, that each second was a miracle as he allowed her to push him closer to the climax she knew was building in his scrotum. She could feel the tight sac beneath his shaft, drawn close to the base of his cock, flexing periodically as she drew on the pulsing head. She wanted to taste him, wanted him filling her mouth with his come, hearing his cry as he released his semen, his release shuddering through his body. She wanted it all as she had never wanted anything in her life.</p><p>\u201cDamn. Baby.\u201d His voice was guttural now, harsh and exciting as he fucked against the strong pull of her mouth.</p><p>Shallow, strong strokes powered past her lips, sinking the head of his cock deep in her mouth as she tongued it hungrily. Another pulse, a hard throb of his cock and then he stilled, his hands tightening in her hair, holding her steady as he pulled slowly from her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo. Dash, please.\u201d She tried to follow, to take him again, to force him back. He pried her hands from his cock then pulled her to her feet, jerking her against his chest as she stared up at him, needing him. Her cunt wept with the need; her body vibrated with it.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he growled with feral savagery. \u201cWe might have a serious problem here, Elizabeth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stilled in his arms. \u201cIs someone else in the house?\u201d She listened closely but could hear nothing above her own heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His hands clenched on her hips as she moved against his cock, cushioning it firmly against her belly.</p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t care.\u201d She shook her head desperately. \u201cI need you, Dash. I don\u2019t care about anything else right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, Elizabeth,\u201d he groaned as she moved against him, her hand reaching up, threading through his hair and bringing his lips to hers. \u201cI could hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Her tongue moved over his lips as she stared up at him, dazed with the arousal pulsing through her body.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t break,\u201d she whispered against his lips. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t fuck me soon, Dash, I just might have to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Her explicit words seemed to tip in her favor. Flames erupted in his eyes, his face flushing with arousal, his cock jerking against her stomach as she stared up at him. Before she realized his intent he lifted her from the floor and tossed her to the bed. She rolled, coming up on the far side on her hands and knees, staring at him as he moved onto the mattress, his knees sinking into the soft pad.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way I want you eventually,\u201d he told her, his voice rough. \u201cOn your knees, bent over for me, screaming as I push my way up your tight pussy. Turn around, baby. Let me show you what I can do.\u201d</p><p>She smiled slowly. His voice sent shivers up her spine. It was part threat, part pure seduction as he stared at her, one hand gripping his cock, his fingers stroking over the shaft slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s going to be that easy?\u201d she asked him, fighting to breathe now. \u201cYou want it, you can take it.\u201d</p><p>His smile was intent, confident. \u201cI can do that, Elizabeth,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI really could. But if I start wrestling you down, I\u2019m not going to have the control to take time to eat that sweet cunt. And I really want to taste that hot cream I smell flowing from your body, baby.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth trembled. His voice was so rough, so dark, it was almost a physical caress as it stroked over her senses. Her pussy clenched at his dark offer, an ache like nothing she had ever known before pulsing in the very depths of it. She wanted him there. Wanted to feel his tongue stroking over the flesh she kept free of hair, waiting, anticipating a time when she could feel his touch against it.</p><p>\u201cLie down.\u201d He moved to the bottom of the bed, watching her intently. \u201cCome on, baby. Let me show you how a Breed male makes a meal out of his mate.\u201d</p><p>She trembled, licking her dry lips as hunger throbbed in her womb. A Breed male. The words sent shivers racing over her spine. Nothing was known about their sexuality. Nothing documented that they were different from any other man. But it was hinted that their savage natures could slip over the edge of humanity and enter into that unknown sphere of the mixed DNA. Some scientists had hinted that it could go further, that the men could show actual characteristics of their animal cousins. That the Felines could exhibit a barb-like growth. That the Wolf Breeds could exhibit much more. It was rumor rather than fact. But Elizabeth was now more than eager to know the truth. Dash had stroked an arousal inside her that nearly consumed her dreams before she ever met him. Now that he had touched her, it didn\u2019t matter if he was man or animal. She had to know his touch, had to know his possession.</p><p>\u201cHis mate?\u201d She moved to the center of the bed, watching him carefully. \u201cWho says I\u2019m your mate?\u201d</p><p>His smile was so certain it sent pulsing shivers washing over her flesh.</p><p>\u201cOh honey, we both know you are. Now come on, let me love you for a while before I lose my sanity and start fucking you until we both scream.\u201d</p><p>Yes. That was what she wanted. She wanted to scream. To be so insane with the pleasure and the need that nothing could hold back her cries. To know and experience pleasures she had only heard about, but had never known herself.</p><p>\u201cI could handle that.\u201d She was panting as she lay down slowly, watching as he came over her. He didn\u2019t answer her. His lips came over hers roughly, slanting against them as he claimed her with a kiss that rocked her to her toes. His tongue pushed past her lips, pumping into her mouth with slow, deliberate strokes, teasing hers, making her groan in hungry need as her arms came around his shoulders. His hands smoothed up her waist, cupped her breasts. His thumbs traced slow, intricate designs around her pebble-hard nipples as he possessed her mouth, moaning against her as she pushed up, her soft abdomen raking the heavy length of his cock.</p><p>\u201cGod, you make me crazy,\u201d he muttered as his lips slid from hers, tracking down her neck as she arched it just for him and shivered in pleasure as his teeth raked her skin.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d she panted as his lips feathered over one nipple. \u201cNow, Dash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he groaned, his hand plumping the mound of her breast a second before his lips covered it. He suckled her deeply, moaning against her flesh, his tongue lashing the little bud before he moved and treated its twin similarly. Then his lips were moving lower, his hands pulling her thighs apart, lifting them, spreading them as his mouth covered the swollen, desperate flesh of her clit.</p> <p>Rockets of sensation burst through Elizabeth\u2019s skull as his rough heated tongue moved slowly against the little pearl. She was so close. So sensitive that she could easily find her release with just with the right stroke. Evidently though, he was determined to torment her.</p><p>His mouth slid lower, his tongue stroking through the narrow slit of her swollen folds. He parted them easily, drawing the thick juices into his mouth, lapping at her heatedly as he stared up at her from between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of this,\u201d he whispered against her sensitive flesh. \u201cDreamed of drowning in your pussy, lapping all your sweet juices into my mouth, fucking my tongue hard and deep inside you.\u201d</p><p>His tongue plunged into the clenching depths of her vagina as she arched violently against him. A thin wail of need echoed around them as she fought to close her thighs, to hold him inside her. But his hands were there, spreading her farther apart, his eyes staring up at her over the mound of her pussy. It was the most incredibly erotic thing she had ever known in her life, feeling his tongue lapping deep inside her cunt as his golden eyes mesmerized her. Then watching him move, licking delicately through the slit once again and circling her clit with tormenting strokes before returning to the pulsing well of her pussy.</p><p>Over and over again he tormented her, licking at her teasingly, pushing deep and hard inside her clenching vagina as she screamed out at his tormenting touch. Her fingers were locked in the blankets beneath her, her head twisting against the pillow in desperation as she gave up watching him. Her eyes were closed, her mind rioting with the sensations spearing through her womb.</p><p>\u201cDash, please.\u201d She was nearly sobbing now as he sucked at her clit again, his tongue stroking softly around it. \u201cPlease. Please. You\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>He moaned thickly. His thumbs spread the folds of her pussy apart, his mouth moving deeper against her, his tongue increasing its strokes as she held her breath in anticipation. Yes. Like that. She could feel the heat coiling in the little bud, the wracking sensitivity increasing as his lips and tongue drove her closer to the edge.</p><p>Elizabeth trembled in anticipation, her thighs tightening against his shoulders, her hips writhing beneath him. Closer. Closer. Her eyes flew open as it struck her. Like a blast of heat, an explosion of pure, intense sensation swept through her body, arching her back, dragging a strangled cry from her chest as she came apart beneath him.</p><p>The pleasure beat at her brain, ripping past the fabric of reality and flinging her into a world of bombarding colors and light. She shuddered, convulsing beneath the whiplash of his tongue as the world dissolved around her.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d He moved before the last violent pulses stilled.</p><p>He came over her body, catching his weight on his elbows, staring down at her with savage intensity as the bulbous head of his cock nudged against the sensitive opening of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he whispered again. \u201cI make you my woman, Elizabeth. Now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Dear God. He was so big. Elizabeth felt the bulging head of Dash\u2019s cock press against her sensitive opening and caught her breath at the tight stretching sensation that began to burn her tender flesh. He watched her carefully, kneeling between her thighs, her legs raised, knees bent over his arms as he lifted her to him.</p><p>She whimpered in distress as he paused, then shuddered as she felt a hard pulse of the silky pre-come throb from his cock. Dane had never done that. Had never spilled that slick fluid inside her as he entered her.</p><p>A second later, another followed. As it did, she noticed a slow loosening of her flesh around the thick head and he slid forward marginally. Oh, that was so good. She was stretched tightly around his cock, gripping the small amount of it he had worked inside her, and she was greedy for more. He groaned as yet more of the pre-come spilled within her. With each short spurt of the fluid, her muscles eased more. Distantly, she realized this couldn\u2019t be natural. That there was no way pre-come could relax her tight, unused pussy, but it was doing just that.</p><p>\u201cDash,\u201d she whimpered, suddenly nervous despite the incredible pleasure filling her. He slid forward another inch. The head of his cock was now buried inside her, and every few seconds the short, sharp ejaculations were released inside her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so tight, Elizabeth,\u201d he groaned as his gaze moved to the point where he was penetrating her.</p><p>\u201cSo hot and sweet, it\u2019s almost impossible to wait to sink inside you.\u201d</p><p>He retreated marginally before working the erect tip back inside her, loosening her further, easing her open for him. His muscles were taut, his body corded with his fight for control as he watched his cock sink inside her. Elizabeth twisted beneath him, breathing roughly as she felt him stretching her, feeling a fire raging inside her that threatened to destroy her sanity. The pulsing liquid he spilled inside her sensitized the tissue, making each inch he worked within her caress nerve endings that screamed out for relief. She was stretched so tight around the broad shaft now that she could feel every vein, every detail of the velvety shaft working inside her.</p><p>\u201cDash.\u201d Her hands were ripping at the sheets, her head tossing as he began to pump gently inside her, stroking deeper, filling her further as her cunt slowly relaxed enough to allow it to slide in. It was exquisite, a building, blistering sensitivity and heat that had her gasping, her womb convulsing as her pussy spasmed around his cock. And Dash was the most erotic sight she had ever seen in her life. His muscles bulged as he fought for control, his golden-brown eyes blazing down at her, his black hair falling forward around his face, creating the impression of a savage, lusty male animal. Elizabeth arched to him, taking him deeper, working in time to his strokes as he muttered a prayer, then whispered a curse as she stretched around him.</p><p>A hard jet of fluid suddenly filled her as Dash stilled, shaking his head, gasping for breath.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth, ah God. Baby. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He was breathing hard, rough. A little more than half of the</p><p>straining flesh filled her now, throbbing hard and hot up the once narrow channel of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cDash?\u201d Her own voice was strained as she felt her cunt milking his flesh, drawing at it, urging it deeper.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d He was fighting for breath now, for control. \u201cI can\u2019t wait, baby. You\u2019re so tight, so sweet...\u201d</p><p>His eyes closed as he drew back marginally, caressing the sensitive nerve endings of her cunt before he stilled again. Elizabeth barely had time to draw in a deep breath before he slammed hard and deep inside her.</p><p>She wailed his name as he pushed past the clenching tissue, separating it, stretching it as his cock jerked with several more hard ejaculations inside her.</p><p>Elizabeth writhed beneath him, fighting to accept the ample width of male flesh impaling her. Dash\u2019s eyes blazed down at her, his hands gripping her thighs as he breathed out roughly. \u201cI\u2019m an animal, Elizabeth,\u201d he growled, his voice rough as his cock pulsed again. \u201cFeel it. Feel what I\u2019m shooting inside you.\u201d He sounded agonized, but that didn\u2019t keep him from moving deeply inside her, or from spilling yet more of the fluid within her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDash.\u201d She shook her head desperately. The blend of pleasure and pressure inside her pussy was making her crazy now.</p><p>\u201cFeel it, Elizabeth,\u201d he demanded roughly. \u201cFeel what I\u2019m doing to you, dammit. Only an animal would do this.\u201d</p><p>He was tortured, tormented. He growled roughly when she felt him pulse inside her again. Distantly, Elizabeth was aware now of what the fluid was, a natural side effect of his DNA. A lubrication that eased and prepared the female entrance for his penetration. She was thankful for it. She needed him. Needed him inside her, filling her as she had never thought possible. Without it, there wasn\u2019t a chance she could have taken him comfortably.</p><p>\u201cDash.\u201d She reached for him, her hands sliding up his damp chest, nails scraping lightly as he shivered beneath the caress. \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>And she didn\u2019t. She moved her hips against him, her breath hitching in desperation as she felt his cock moving snugly within her. He was so hard, so hot, so firmly embedded within her cunt that she knew she would never forget the feel of him now.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t care?\u201d He groaned as he moved convulsively inside her, spreading her thighs further as he released them and leaned over her.</p><p>His bigger body blanketed hers, his elbows catching his weight as her hands slid over his shoulders, relishing the feel of his skin against her. It also changed the level of penetration, causing him to sink deeper inside the giving flesh of her pussy.</p><p>Sensations piled atop each other, lightning-hot flares of pleasure and pressure building in her womb, streaking through her cunt. Her clit was swollen, throbbing, rising eagerly as his pelvis ground against it. Her nipples were cushioned against his hard chest, the smooth muscle rasping over them, the tiny, fine hairs caressing them heatedly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she gasped as she arched beneath him, pressing the aching buds tighter against him. \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>One hand cupped her hip as he drew back. He slid smoothly within the tight entrance, retreating then forcing his way back until he was once again buried to the hilt.</p><p>\u201cI could knot you, Elizabeth.\u201d Her eyes widened at the harsh words, staring up at him in shock. She couldn\u2019t make sense of the words, couldn\u2019t imagine his DNA affecting his sexuality to that point. But she realized she didn\u2019t care if he did. Didn\u2019t care how he took her, how much he filled her, as long as she knew that for now, she belonged to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never done this with a woman in my life. But that could happen as well.\u201d He was breathing roughly, fucking her with almost involuntary strokes, lifting her hips to him, sinking deep inside her. She knew she needed to retain her grasp on this conversation. Knew she needed to make sense of it. But Dash was moving now, his cock retreating then burying inside her, over and over again, stroking sensitive tissue and firing nerve endings to screaming life. She couldn\u2019t concentrate. Couldn\u2019t make sense of anything he had to say. And he wasn\u2019t talking anymore anyway. He was breathing roughly, his head lowering so his lips could caress her shoulder as he thrust inside her with steadily increasing strokes. Elizabeth could hear herself mewling in pleasure. Her legs wrapped around his hips, lifting her closer to him, thrusting back against him, the searing impalement sending sparks of fire zipping through her entire body.</p><p>\u201cHarder,\u201d she gasped, protesting his almost gentle thrusts now. He was growling at her shoulder, his teeth scraping the flesh as she bucked beneath his. Sweat soaked their bodies as she felt Dash clinging to his control with desperate fingers.</p><p>\u201cWait. Elizabeth,\u201d he groaned desperately as she moved beneath him. She couldn\u2019t wait. Didn\u2019t want to wait. She was on fire. Her pussy spasmed around his thick cock, needing more, starved for the driving, fierce thrusts she had never known during her marriage to Dane. She had never known anything like this. Wild and hot, shredding any sense of decorum, any modesty she once possessed. She needed him deep, hard, plunging in her as they set fire to the world around them.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She tightened on his throbbing erection. \u201cPlease, Dash. Fuck me now. Fuck me harder. Please.\u201d</p><p>Her explicitly hot demand exploded through his head, shredding his control. Her soft voice, so sweet and husky, almost innocent, begging to be taken, to be fucked, was more than he could stand. Dash groaned desperately, fighting the urge to lock his teeth on her delicate shoulder and give her exactly what she wanted. He had fought the instincts, the driving hunger, as long as he could. When her words whispered over his senses, he was lost.</p><p>He snarled at her shoulder, gripping it with his teeth as his hands tightened on her hips and he gave her</p><p>what she was begging for. Sinking into the slick, ultra-tight tissue, he set a hard, fast rhythm that drove his erection to the very depths of her, burying his cock to the end and fucking her with a hunger he had never known in his life.</p><p>She was his. His woman. His mate.</p><p>Elizabeth was screaming out beneath him, her nails piercing his back as his teeth pierced her shoulder, his dick piercing her tight pussy. He could feel his release looming, as he could feel her flesh rippling over his cock. So close. He held her still as he pumped inside her harder, the sounds of wet sex filling his ears, sucking cunt wrapping around him as he felt her explode around his cock. Her pussy tightened, milking his flesh, fighting to hold it deep inside her as her juices spilled around it. It was too much. Too hot. Too damned tight. He felt the last of his control snap as his own release broke free of his restraint.</p><p>\u201cNo. Fuck, no.\u201d He tried to pull back as he felt the first hard jet of his semen spew inside her, then felt something more.</p><p>A desperate swelling in the middle of his cock, a pulsing erection blooming that terrified him.</p> <p>\u201cOh God! Dash!\u201d Elizabeth screamed his name as he felt her body shudder spasmodically beneath him, her orgasm rising in power, ripping violently beneath her flesh. She was so tight around him. Her flesh stretched, hugging him, giving way to the knot blooming in his cock and locking him deep inside her. He couldn\u2019t move without hurting her, couldn\u2019t jerk his swelling flesh free of her tight pussy. He could only groan in defeat, hold her to him and allow his release to surge through his body.</p><p>Each hard pulse of his seed throbbed in the hard knot, triggered contractions in her cunt that had her screaming hoarsely. She writhed beneath him, struggling to accept the additional girth as another orgasm peaked inside her, causing her to shudder harshly as she was forced to accept every hard pulse of his semen inside her already overfilled depths.</p><p>Dash tasted blood and realized the sharp tips of his canines had pierced her shoulder. His tongue licked over it, his mouth suckling the small wound as she whimpered beneath him. The wracking shudders that had slammed through her body were weaker now. She trembled beneath him, her pussy clenching on the hard knot locked inside her as she moaned at the intermittent bursts of orgasmic echoes. Her hands had fallen to the bed, her legs sliding weakly from his hips before he finally felt the easing of his flesh inside her. It was slow. It was destructive. Hard, hot blasts of his semen spewed inside her with each flexing throb of the knot, though they lessened in intensity as the swelling began to diminish. Dash held her close to his chest, breathing roughly, fighting his own shock and horror until he could finally pull free of her, exiting her pussy as it gave a soft, resounding farewell kiss to his flesh.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>He had meant to move away from her, to leave the bed, the room, to find someplace away from the sweet scent of her heat where he could think. Where he could consider this new, shocking development clearly. But as he moved from her, she whispered his name. Drowsy with repletion, her body exhausted</p><p>from the demands he had made on her, it had sighed over his flesh like a whisper of silk as she moved against him.</p><p>She tugged at him, pulling him down beside her, moving into his arms and laying her head against his chest. He stared down at the tangle of dark hair that spilled to the bed. One slender leg crossed over his; her arm lay over his stomach. He was tied as securely to the bed now as he would have been if it had been chains instead of one delicate woman.</p><p>What was he supposed to do? Tentatively, he turned to her and wrapped his arms around her, expecting the position to be uncomfortable. It wasn\u2019t. She fit against him as though she had been made for him. He had never allowed himself to hold a woman after sex. Had never felt comfortable enough, or relaxed enough to sleep with one. And he had sure as hell never been able to keep from pulling away from one. But Elizabeth was different. In more ways than one.</p><p>God. What had he done to her? He closed his eyes, swallowing tightly at the remembrance of the thick swelling into her already snug pussy. Like an animal. But nothing could eliminate the fact that the pleasure had been so intense, so much deeper than anything he had known, that he wanted nothing more than to repeat it.</p><p>Instead, he held her against him and let her rest. He hoped she was sleeping. Prayed she was sleeping. Because if she wasn\u2019t, there wasn\u2019t a chance in hell he could keep from taking her again. Dash let his fingers sink into the soft waves of hair that flowed over his chest and down her back. She was such a creature of sensuality, hot and erotic once the restraints had come off. She had burned him alive.</p><p>He rested his chin against her head, wondering at this strange change within him. He knew she was his woman. His mate. He had accepted it over a year ago when his commander had first begun reading him Cassie\u2019s letters. There was no other way to explain the soul-deep possessiveness that had filled him, the inborn knowledge and rage that had gripped him while buried beneath the drugs as his body healed. He had known her. Known her laughter, her touch, had known her heat. By the time he awoke, he had been filled with a determination to hurry and heal and strengthen that he had never known before. He had amazed the doctors who had fought to save his life. He had exhausted his therapists as he worked to get stronger. Every minute of that long, painful battle, all he thought of was Elizabeth and Cassie. His woman and his child. They needed him. He needed them. The response of his body to her had been shocking, though. Never had he done anything like that with another woman. Never had he produced an ejaculation like the small, slick spurts of fluid that had eased her vagina around him. And never had he conceived that anything could have occurred like the thick swelling that locked him deep inside her already tight vagina. It had been like nothing he could have imagined. Filling her with his seed, knowing there wasn\u2019t a chance in hell that so much as a drop of it could spill before being given the chance...</p><p>Oh hell. The chance to impregnate her. He swallowed tightly. She wasn\u2019t on the pill. He knew she wasn\u2019t on the pill. And for the first time in his life he had taken a woman without even thinking about protection.</p><p>His cock jerked and seemed to harden further at the thought of making a child with Elizabeth, one as</p><p>sparkling and filled with life as Cassie. Perhaps a little boy. One that was tall and strong and filled with the same sense of determination and strength as his mother. His arms tightened around her, his heart racing as he imagined the family he could have. The family he had never dared dream of until now.</p><p>Elizabeth lay silent, still. Dash wasn\u2019t restless but he wasn\u2019t sleeping, either. She could feel his chest beneath her cheek, his heart racing, feel the tense readiness of his body. She would have moved from him, but when she glanced from the shield of her lashes, down the length of his tall body, she had seen his erection, thick and strong, still glistening from their combined releases as it lay against his lower belly. The flesh was at least as thick as her wrist. Long, steel-hard. The mushroom-shaped head was a dark color, almost violet, indicating the level of Dash\u2019s arousal. Not more than her own, she thought. Even now, mere minutes after she had managed to pull him down beside her, she still ached to feel him buried within her once again, locking tight and hard inside her.</p><p>She barely controlled a weak hitch of her breath at the memory of the swelling. She knew what it was. Just as she now knew what the silky ejaculations had been. A lubricating fluid, somehow enhanced to relax the desperate tightness of the female channel. She had felt it when the fluid mixed with her own juices, heating inside her, easing the resistance in her vagina as he pushed past the snug muscles of her pussy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It had done the same to her mouth, her tongue. Before he had pulled free she had wondered if she could take that bulging head clear to her throat. It was amazing. Unlike anything she could have imagined. Yet, not completely unexpected.</p><p>Elizabeth wasn\u2019t fooling herself in any way. She had wondered if it would happen. Wondered if he possessed not just the sense of the wolf, but in some part, the sexuality as well. The Feline Breeds called their women their mates. In one interview, Callan Lyons and his wife had been amazingly reticent about the sexuality Callan displayed. But Elizabeth had known that something had bonded them closer than just love. She could see it in their faces, in their eyes as they gazed at each other. That little glimmer of a secret. And she had been envious. She knew Dash would have warned her beforehand if he knew this would happen. Knew he wouldn\u2019t have hidden it from her. And he had been even more surprised than she had. It filled her with a sense of pride, of feminine possessiveness, to know that he had not given that experience to any other woman. It was hers alone. As shocking, as amazing as it had been, it was still hers alone. Just as that magnificent hard-on was hers. Period. She watched as it flexed, throbbed. Tempted her. Her hand smoothed over Dash\u2019s chest as he suddenly tensed further, down his abdomen, across the top of his thigh.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth.\u201d His voice was dark, thick, his fingers tightening in her hair.</p> <p>\u201cHmm?\u201d She caressed her way between his powerful legs, her fingers moving slowly until she was cupping the smooth, silken sac of his scrotum. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have any hair here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh God.\u201d His hips arched as she caressed his testicles softly, running her fingers over the ultra-smooth, obviously ultra-sensitive, flesh. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a Breed.\u201d He seemed to have pushed the words between</p><p>clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d She stilled, watching the soft pearl of liquid forming at the opened eye of his cock.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he breathed out roughly. \u201cBut are you sure you want to keep this up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She pressed a kiss to his chest, watching his hard flesh jerk as she cupped the sac more fully within her palm. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElizabeth,\u201d he groaned as she moved lower, her lips stroking over his flexing abdomen. \u201cBaby. Wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Her hand stroked up from his testicles to the hard shaft of his cock. Her fingers couldn\u2019t circle it, but she could stroke it. She watched as her hand slid up the thick pole, her finger rubbing over the slick essence that seeped from his cock.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d His voice was strained. \u201cAbout earlier. Elizabeth, we have to figure this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to figure out?\u201d She laid her head on his lower stomach, the bulging head of his erection just below her. Before he could speak, her tongue peeked from her lips and swiped along the glistening head of his cock.</p><p>\u201cOh hell. Elizabeth,\u201d he muttered, his fingers tangling in her hair as the muscles of his abdomen clenched harshly.</p> <p>She went lower, despite the pressure he exerted on the strands he gripped. Her mouth capped the hard crest, her tongue flickering over the little eyelet at the tip before stroking around the bulging crest. She was rewarded with a small spurt of the salty sweet fluid that had released into her mouth before.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Before she could tempt him further, tease him further, he gripped her shoulders and flipped her to the bed as he rose over her. \u201cAre you insane?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips slowly as she watched him from beneath lowered lids, hungry for the taste of him. There was something wickedly exciting in drawing his cock into her mouth. Something that fired all her baser instincts and made her completely wanton.</p><p>\u201cNot insane,\u201d she whispered as she lifted her head and licked her tongue over his lips, pressing against them, slipping it between them.</p><p>She shared the taste of his essence with him then. Her gaze locked with his, seeing shock flare in his eyes a second before he groaned roughly; the hand that had tightened in her hair pulled her head back until he could take control of the kiss.</p><p>His tongue tangled with hers, then followed it as it retreated behind her lips. He swept into her mouth demandingly, licking at her lips, her tongue, kissing her with a heat and hunger that had her moaning and arching into his touch.</p><p>\u201cDamn you.\u201d He tore his lips from hers, breathing roughly as he stared down at her. \u201cYou felt what happened last time, Elizabeth. You know what I did to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she sighed, smiling in anticipation. \u201cNow do it again. Let\u2019s see if it will work again the second time.\u201d</p> <p>Shock filled his gaze, then heat. Incredible, incendiary heat as he stared down at her intently. Slowly, a smile that could only be called wolfish curled his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you scream harder this time,\u201d he warned her softly. \u201cI\u2019ll make you...\u201d</p><p>He stopped, his head suddenly rising, eyes narrowing as he stared at the door.</p><p>\u201cDash?\u201d Elizabeth felt his body tense dangerously, rather than in arousal. He was moving from her as she heard feet pounding up the stairs, then a hard knock at the door. \u201cGet ready, Dash. Grange has men in town and they could be heading out here. We have to get you moving. I\u2019ve called the pilot; fifteen minutes to landing.\u201d</p><p>Dash snarled as his head turned, but Elizabeth was already out of the bed and pulling on the clothes he had left laying out for her.</p><p>\u201cSo much for a damned shower,\u201d she muttered as she pulled her panties over her long legs, covering the glistening, soaked mound of her pussy. \u201cDammit, I hate wearing wet panties.\u201d</p><p>Dash turned for his own clothes, snarling in silent fury. Her panties were wet, his cock was steel-hard and they were heading to a cold plane. He reminded himself to make sure he hurt Grange. Really bad. Before he finally got around to killing him.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>\u201cYou were loud enough to wake the dead,\u201d Dash snapped as Elizabeth slipped around the corner of the cabin two mornings later. Sweat poured from her braided hair and down her face; her clothes were damp with it.</p><p>She had worked her way down the point in twice the time it should have taken her and she had ignored half of what he had told her along the way. He had caught her scent first thing simply because she hadn\u2019t tested the direction the wind was blowing. He had heard her skirting the small clearing five minutes before, going in the complete opposite direction that she should have gone. She stopped, frowning, her blue eyes flashing with anger.</p><p>Her breasts were heaving with exertion and nerves and he doubted she could have heard anyone sneaking up on her for the pounding of her own heart.</p><p>\u201cI was quiet, dammit. I didn\u2019t make a sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I would lie to you?\u201d he growled. \u201cI heard you coming five minutes ago. If this were Grange\u2019s property the guards would have already had you down, stripped and fucked. I told you, Elizabeth. Quietly. I showed you how.\u201d</p><p>He was being hard on her. But if he could hear her that far away then those damned dogs patrolling</p><p>Grange\u2019s estate could too.</p><p>\u201cHow much quieter do I have to be?\u201d She was tired, irritated and ready to tear into him now.</p><p>\u201cA hell of a lot quieter,\u201d he snarled. \u201cTurn around, get your ass back up to that point and try it again. Grange returns to his estate in two weeks. That\u2019s it. End of training and kill time. You won\u2019t be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I won\u2019t,\u201d she snarled. \u201cSon of a bitch. You\u2019re a Breed. Of course you heard me. Grange doesn\u2019t have Breeds for soldiers, does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said softly, smiling tightly, controlling the instinctive rush to protect her. \u201cHe has dogs. Big mean dogs trained to fuck nosy little girls who come creeping around his estate. You\u2019ve had a taste of it, baby. Wanna try for the real animals now?\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed in fury, her lips thinning as she stared at him coldly.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you just a barrel of laughs this morning,\u201d she sneered. \u201cToo bad you\u2019re not as well trained as Grange\u2019s dogs are.\u201d</p><p>She turned on her heel and slipped back around the cabin as he felt offended anger flow through his body. He stomped after her, determined to teach her that soldiers never sassed their trainers. Not and get away with it.</p><p>As he rounded the side of the cabin he had no more than a second\u2019s warning before his feet flew out from under him, leaving him on his back with a furious Elizabeth straddling his chest, the sharp end of a stick pressing to his throat.</p><p>\u201cI get breakfast now, big boy,\u201d she snarled, curling her lip in sneering triumph as he narrowed his eyes at her. \u201cWho says I can\u2019t be quiet?\u201d</p><p>She had him. Damn her, she had tricked him so quickly he hadn\u2019t even considered she would turn so sneaky.</p><p>He lifted his hand and pulled the stick away from from her, tossing it aside as he stared up at her.</p><p>\u201cNext time you come over me like that you better be naked,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cNext time, I\u2019m going to stomp your balls for being so insulting,\u201d she snapped back. He had no doubt she would. If she got the chance.</p><p>He lifted her off him then rose to his feet as she stood, watching him in triumph. \u201cYou did good. Not good enough, but good.\u201d</p><p>She breathed out roughly.</p><p>\u201cNot good enough?\u201d She placed her hands on her hips as she watched with a frown. \u201cI got you. Fair and square. How is that not good enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I trust you and I have the added handicap of being so damned hot to fuck you I can\u2019t consider you a threat just yet. Bad move on my part. I won\u2019t make that mistake again.\u201d Damned if his pride could handle it.</p><p>They had been working for most of the morning. He had dragged her out of bed before dawn, marched her to the top of the rise above the cabin and told her to wait before heading back down. On the way up, he had taught her how to move through the brush, keeping her steps light, her breathing slow and easy. How to pace herself, time her steps, and move without causing a ripple of sound. Not that he had expected her to pick it up as well as she had. She had actually surprised him. But she could be better. If his instincts were right, she had the potential to move as silently as any hunter ever born. And she was willing to work for what she needed to know. That was imperative. Elizabeth understood that she needed what Dash was teaching her, just as Dash himself was aware of it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a poor excuse,\u201d she finally grunted before turning and heading back to the front of the cabin. \u201cI need a shower and breakfast. I\u2019ll try it again after I\u2019ve thought about it.\u201d</p><p>She was rolling her shoulders, her voice was thoughtful, as though something had come to her that she wasn\u2019t quite certain of, and her ass was filling those jeans out like a dream. Dash grimaced as his dick throbbed and his lust seemed to hit peak level. He hadn\u2019t touched her since the night at Mike\u2019s ranch. The rushed departure, exhausting flight and the journey to the cabin had been made in less than twenty-four hours. They had both collapsed into the bed and slept like the dead as soon they had eaten a hastily prepared meal.</p><p>Training had begun yesterday as soon as they left the cabin and by the time he nearly carried her back into the cabin last night, he had known sex wouldn\u2019t be at the top of her list of priorities. But it was rising quickly to his.</p><p>He watched her disappear into the bedroom of the small cabin, and minutes later heard the shower turn on full force. He put together a quick breakfast: two large, filled omelets, fried potatoes and orange juice. Fresh coffee brewed on the counter and by the time she walked out of the bedroom nearly thirty minutes later, he was setting it on the table.</p><p>\u201cEat. We\u2019ll practice self-defense after breakfast then give it a break until evening.\u201d</p><p>He sat across from her, digging into his own food. It was fuel, pure and simple, high on carbs and protein with plenty of running power. She would need the energy to get through the next two weeks. She was already run down, tired. She wasn\u2019t living on shattered nerves and fear now. That adrenaline heightened the senses and gave an added edge, even if it was a false one. Now, she was going to have to teach her senses to work in the proper direction. Without the nerves. Without the adrenaline kick that the life or death situation she had faced before had given her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She drew in a deep breath, but rather than arguing, only nodded. The action drew his attention to her breasts. Unconfined, without the bra, they were still ripe and full, plump little mounds that his hands itched to cup and caress. He was dying to take her again. To see if the sensations were as intense a second time around or if it had all been a dream.</p><p>Training first, he reminded himself as he finished his meal then sat back to enjoy his coffee. It was his first cup in days and damned if he hadn\u2019t missed it. The caffeine jolt to his system was almost immediate, making him contain a hum of pleasure.</p><p>Elizabeth wasn\u2019t nearly as reticent. A long, low sound of appreciation vibrated in her throat as she closed her eyes, relishing the taste as well as the jolt. Her expression was pure sensual delight and as she swallowed the hot brew, her tongue peeked out to catch an escaping drop on her lower lip. Dash\u2019s cock jerked in awareness. He remembered her licking her lips in just that manner once before. When she had licked the last taste of his cock from them after he pulled her from him right before Mike\u2019s interruption.</p> <p>\u201cI almost forgot how good it was.\u201d She sighed as she opened her eyes, her gaze meeting his. A flush instantly filled her cheeks as his gaze dropped to her damp lips.</p><p>\u201cFinish your coffee.\u201d Dash rose to his feet, clearing their plates from the table. \u201cI want to start teaching you how to fight with more than nerves and fear. You have to keep your head clear to be efficient. To deliver a blow that will disable instead of merely stun. If you just stun your enemy, you risk him coming up behind you later. If you disable him, you can put him out indefinitely. Short of killing him, that\u2019s your best bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s the enemy, why not just kill him?\u201d She rose to her feet as well, moving to the coffee pot to refill her cup. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice you caring much for disabling that guy you killed at the apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no other choice.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cHe had a gun in my face and he was depressing the trigger. It was kill or be killed. I chose to live. You go around leaving dead bodies and you\u2019re drawing more attention than necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeats having a bunch of pissed off enemies following after you,\u201d she commented dryly as she lifted the cup to her lips.</p> <p>\u201cThe key is, you keep the enemy from knowing who you are or why you\u2019re striking,\u201d he told her, fighting to keep a measure of pride from his voice. Damn her, she was bloodthirsty as hell. He loved it. She wouldn\u2019t balk if blood had to be shed, but she had to learn that there were different levels of enemies. Only the upper notch really deserved death. \u201cDead bodies leave a trail for the simple fact that everyone has a preferred way of killing. Mine\u2019s the knife. If I left a string of bodies behind me, the media would start yelling vigilante. Someone I\u2019ve worked with would hear it, and instantly, the facts of the killing would make him suspicious. There\u2019s your first domino falling and toppling the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, learn another way to kill.\u201d She was damned sure enjoying that coffee as well as whatever bloodthirsty little fantasies she must be having about now.</p><p>Dash sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re not as hard as you\u2019re pretending to be, baby. Taking a life isn\u2019t that easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilling Grange won\u2019t cause me to lose even a moment\u2019s sleep. It will help me sleep better,\u201d she assured him, her voice hardening. \u201cDon\u2019t fool yourself, Dash. If I could have killed those bastards without my baby seeing it over the past two years, I would have. Easily.\u201d</p><p>Dash nodded. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t have blamed you, Elizabeth. But the heat of battle and killing in cold blood are two different things. Right now, you think it\u2019s not. You\u2019re filled with rage and a need for vengeance, and that\u2019s good. It will keep you strong. Make you learn. But when the killing time comes, it won\u2019t be so easy. It\u2019s damned hard to pull that trigger and to know, know in your soul, the man you\u2019re taking out deserves no more chances to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were harder than that, Dash.\u201d She surprised him with her harsh words. Or maybe she didn\u2019t, Dash thought. This rage had been brewing in her for a long time, hardening with each strike against her and her daughter.</p> <p>He sighed wearily. \u201cMy first kill, Elizabeth, was against a monster. I knew he was a monster. He had brutalized men taken hostage. Had turned good, strong women into broken shells of humanity. He had nothing to redeem him. Except one thing. The man was a born fool over a tiny little scrap of humanity he had sired. He had nearly destroyed his little wife, but after that child was born, he treated her like gold because that kid loved her. I had to take him out to secure the release of two of my men he had imprisoned in a cellar room near the house. Didn\u2019t have a choice. Even though I knew that kid and his mother would suffer. And I did what I had to do. It was him or my men. I made the choice. But I\u2019ll regret having to make it to my dying day. Nearly everyone has a weakness. Somewhere, somehow. He didn\u2019t deserve to live because nothing in this world was safe but that child and her mother. But, if she ever learns the identity of the man who pulled the trigger, she will come hunting. I knew it then. I know it now.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth finished her coffee, turned back and poured another cup. When she finished she turned back and watched him curiously. \u201cAm I supposed to feel sorry for Grange now?\u201d she asked him coldly. Dash shook his head. \u201cNo, baby, I don\u2019t expect that from you. I\u2019d be surprised if you felt it. He doesn\u2019t deserve your pity. The choice of life or death is yours to make. You\u2019re the one who has to live with it, has to lie down and sleep at night with it. Just remember what I said. When it\u2019s your life or theirs, it\u2019s different. When it\u2019s cold blood, you\u2019re no more than the animal you\u2019ve come to despise. And then, it gets damned hard to sleep at night. And damned hard to remember what makes you human. Now finish that coffee so I can teach you how to fight.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth watched as Dash cleared the living room, pushing furniture against the wall before folding out a large exercise mat he had hauled from Mike\u2019s. He moved efficiently, gracefully for a man. There were no wasted actions, no puttering around. Within minutes the mat was unfolded and he turned back to her with a lift of his brow.</p><p>She lifted her coffee cup silently. She wasn\u2019t finished. And she couldn\u2019t attempt to focus on letting him teach her how to fight with her mind in the state of turmoil it was in now. Could she kill Grange? That question haunted her now. She had been so certain before. Had convinced herself she could easily put a bullet between his eyes and never think twice. Anywhere. Anytime. Cassie wasn\u2019t with her now. Her innocence wouldn\u2019t be a casualty to the blood her mother shed. She turned from Dash and stared out the window over the sink as he moved to the mat and began a series of warm-up exercises. The forest was thick, sheltering, hiding the little cabin perfectly. A secure place, he had called it. A fellow soldier loaned it out. No big deal . A friend. She noticed everyone was an acquaintance, a fellow soldier, part of the Forces. He had contacts to hell and back, and his voice reflected his respect and often affection for each man he had talked about. But he never called them friends. Never gave voice to the bond she could hear that tied them together. They were a part of a network of honor, of dedication to each other. He had killed to save her and Cassie. He had killed to save his men. He had killed in the heat of battle and didn\u2019t question the lives he had taken. It was kill or be killed. But he wouldn\u2019t kill in cold blood. And she was terribly afraid she could.</p><p>Grange was a monster. As long as he was alive he would pose a threat to Cassie. He would never stop in his desire to take her. Men like that didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>She sipped at the coffee, remembering the two years she had spent running. The lives Grange\u2019s men had taken. The times they had hunted her without mercy, without emotion. As she finished the coffee and rinsed her cup slowly, she realized the haze of anger and pain that had filled her over the months had been slowly hardening inside her.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth?\u201d She glanced at the reflection in the window, seeing Dash behind her, staring down at her gently.</p><p>She swallowed tightly. \u201cDoes it make me a monster too, Dash?\u201d she asked him. \u201cAm I unredeemable?\u201d</p> <p>His hands settled on her shoulders as he drew her to his chest, meeting her gaze in the window before them.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more dangerous than a window, Elizabeth,\u201d he told her rather than answering her question. \u201cYou feel safe in the house. Everyone does. They don\u2019t think about windows. But hunters do. They watch the windows, hidden, safe, their sights trained on that small square as they wait for the target to pass by, to stop and admire the view. Then they have you.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him in shock. \u201cSo we\u2019re standing here why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always vulnerable. Everyone is. And you\u2019re smart enough to know that what comes around goes around. Grange is a monster. If he makes getting Cassie\u2019s file a danger to you or me, then he\u2019s dead. Period. If not by your hand, then by mine. Nature takes care of the diseased, baby. Eventually Grange will fall, if not sooner then later. When he does, there will be a dozen more monsters to take his place. It\u2019s the way of evil. Always there.\u201d He drew her away from the window, leading her to the mat.</p><p>\u201cNow get ready, because I\u2019m going to put you on your ass.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>He did put her on her ass. More than once. Over and over. Snapping orders at her like a damned drill sergeant when she didn\u2019t move as fast as she should have or how he thought he had explained to her. He was cheating. She knew he was. He was aware of every move he had taught her and he knew exactly how to counter it. And he was doing it with amazing efficiency then daring to laugh at her as her frustration mounted.</p><p>She tried to pull his hair, but the pressure he exerted on her wrists had her releasing him immediately. She went for his eyes, but he was taller than she was and always waiting on her. Cool and determined, those golden-brown eyes never missed even the slightest flinch. She came to her feet slowly, facing him, breathing roughly. She was too aware of her swollen breasts and the peaks of her nipples rasping against her bra and T-shirt. Between her thighs, the seam of her jeans exerted just enough pressure against her sensitive clit to make her yearn for more.</p><p>She was hot and sweaty and getting more pissed off by the minute. Damn, he wouldn\u2019t even pretend that she might not be ready for him.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d he ordered her coldly. \u201cYou\u2019re on point. You\u2019re watching for me. You\u2019re covering my back, Elizabeth. Now turn around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t working,\u201d she complained heatedly. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything like this but take the beating you want to dish out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter me than Grange or his men.\u201d He wasn\u2019t the least sympathetic. \u201cNow turn that tight ass around. Wiggle it or something. Maybe you\u2019ll distract me with thoughts of fucking it.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, still catching her breath. He insisted on threatening her with it.</p><p>\u201cLike any of Grange\u2019s men have a cock like that,\u201d she pointed out breathlessly. \u201cIf it were normal-sized, Dash, I might let you try.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cOh darlin\u2019, I\u2019ll do more than try when the time comes. Now flip it around and let me see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me catch my breath.\u201d He was a demon.</p><p>\u201cTell it to Grange,\u201d he snarled. \u201cSee if he lets you rest before he kills you. You might catch him in a good mood.\u201d</p><p>Her teeth snapped together as she fought a vicious reply. But every time she snapped at him he came back with something that only pissed her off further.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She flipped around. \u201cGet a good look, assho...\u201d</p><p>She was on her ass. Before she could prepare herself he was on her. Hard hands flipped her around, a foot sweeping hers from beneath her as his big body followed her down, immobilizing her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho do you think you\u2019re wrestling here, baby?\u201d he taunted her as she struggled weakly against him. She was on her back, staring up at him, breathing heavily as he smiled with lazy humor. \u201cI\u2019m amazed you\u2019ve managed to escape Grange for two years. I thought you were better than that.\u201d</p><p>She was exhausted. He had out-maneuvered every lowdown dirty trick she had ever learned, as well as the ones he had taught her. \u201cNot fair,\u201d she panted. \u201cYou were expecting me.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, feeling him hovering over her, his heat wrapping around her and driving her crazy. What the hell was wrong with her? They had been at this for hours and her cunt was only getting progressively wetter. Her panties were wet, and that was something she just didn\u2019t like at all. They clung to the bare lips of her sex and rasped her swelling clitoris erotically.</p><p>\u201cYou think they aren\u2019t expecting you now?\u201d His hard thigh was pressed against her mound, one hand smoothing up her leg as he stared down at her. \u201cThey were waiting on you at the apartment. Nearly had you that time, Elizabeth. They\u2019re getting wise to you.\u201d</p><p>She had realized that then. Her teeth clenched in frustration. Her arousal was making her insane. She could barely think for the pulse in her pussy. It was a steady driving throb that kept her off-balance as much as he did.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Okay. I\u2019ll try again.\u201d She was trying. She was, she assured herself. But every time he touched her she went weak with lust.</p><p>Dash moved quickly to her, reaching down and giving her a hand up as she moved into position. She turned her back on him, flexed her shoulders and waited. Sometimes he made her wait forever. Other times it was a quick attack. She could never be certain when it was coming. She tensed, preparing herself.</p><p>\u201cLoosen up.\u201d She flinched at his hard, merciless voice. \u201cYou\u2019re tiring yourself out waiting on me to attack. Listen, Elizabeth. Close your eyes. You\u2019re in the middle of Grange\u2019s estate, not a safe little cabin. The attack could come from any quarter. You\u2019re ready, but relaxed. You\u2019re listening. Smelling the air...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Dash, I\u2019m not a Breed...\u201d He came at her then. His arm went around her throat as hers flew up. One hand latched onto his arm at her neck as the other flew behind her going for his eyes. At the same time her ankle wrapped behind his as she moved, jerked, went for a blinding stroke. He went down hard, rolled to his feet and narrowed his eyes on her as he faced her now. A smile lingered on his lips.</p><p>\u201cOh, good baby,\u201d he crooned in approval as she stared at him in shock. \u201cNow do it again. Turn around.\u201d</p><p>She backed up instead. How the hell had she done that?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be expecting me,\u201d she argued, shaking her head, more than amazed herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pretend I\u2019m not,\u201d he snapped. \u201cTurn around and do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it on command.\u201d She shook her head, breathing roughly. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I did it the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re dead,\u201d he said cruelly. \u201cA bloody dead mess, Elizabeth. Let\u2019s call Cassie now so she can start grieving for her mother. Now turn around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it again.\u201d She backed away from him nervously. \u201cLet me think about it. Figure out how I did it the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Turn around.\u201d His eyes were snapping in anger, but that was okay, because his domineering attitude was really pissing her off too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready.\u201d</p><p>He came for her anyway. Before she had time to consider it, she saw the anger, the determination to force something from her and she moved quickly aside, barely evading his grasp. He turned back to her.</p><p>\u201cYou want to kill Grange?\u201d He grunted. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill anyone, Elizabeth. You don\u2019t have what it takes. You don\u2019t have the courage to learn your own strengths, let alone your weaknesses. Grange will take</p><p>Cassie, just like he plans to, because we\u2019ll never get those papers and you\u2019ll be dead. He can move right in then, kidnap her at first chance and he has her. No one will be able to save her, Elizabeth. No one. Because you\u2019ll fail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe papers alone won\u2019t save her,\u201d she argued desperately. \u201cA bullet to his head would be more effective and I know how to shoot a gun.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThose papers pull his teeth,\u201d he informed her coldly. \u201cWe steal the papers, the proof of the experiments, and we expose his plan along with your and Cassie\u2019s testimony on Dane\u2019s death, and he\u2019s gone. Legally. Broken, Elizabeth. You pull the teeth of the monster. Killing isn\u2019t easy. Neither is it always beneficial.\u201d</p><p>Fury was mounting inside her. She wanted Grange dead. Wanted him to bleed, to suffer, and he was taking it all away from her.</p><p>He came for her again. Rushing her, moving in fast and hard as she dropped to the floor and rolled for his feet. He had taught it to her. He leaped over her quickly, turned for her again but she had stayed down, moved to the side and gone for his feet again. He went down this time and she was instantly on his back, her hands tangling in his damp hair, jerking his head back.</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d she snarled. \u201cI\u2019ll have my own damned knife.\u201d</p><p>Before she could gasp he had a hold of her wrist, pulling her off of him and straddling her body as he slammed her wrists to the mat.</p><p>\u201cYou hesitated.\u201d His lips pulled back from his teeth in fury. \u201cYou gave a warning rather than a killing stroke. Your enemy has you down now, Elizabeth. You\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d she panted, enraged.</p><p>Blood rushed through her veins, adrenaline surging through her system and throbbing in her pussy. She stilled, tamping it back, relaxing beneath him so suddenly he automatically tensed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me,\u201d she breathed, fighting for breath. \u201cWe can talk about this, Dash. Really. I\u2019ll do better next time.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d She gazed up at him innocently before her gaze flickered to the hard bulge in his pants. She allowed a smile to tip her lips. \u201cWe could play for a while now instead.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth wiggled her wrists beneath his, watching him with lowered lids as she licked her lips slowly, dampening the dry curves. \u201cI\u2019ll make you a very happy man, mate.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back slightly, loosening her wrists. Just a little more, she thought as she took a deep breath, lifting her breasts as his gaze went to them. At the same time she moved her legs, a powerful upswing that sent them around his arms and torso as she jerked back, surged up, put her hands together in a fist and delivered a blow to his lower abdomen.</p><p>He grunted. Yes! He fell backward as she scrambled away from him and faced him triumphantly.</p><p>But now he was more than just determined. Lust filled his eyes as the thought of her making a surprise move, tricking him, and gaining freedom had fired a hunger he could no longer sustain. The same hunger that had been boiling in the depths of her wet pussy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucked.\u201d His voice was a hot, sexual growl. \u201cSo fucked, Elizabeth.\u201d</p><p>She raised her hand, flickering her fingers back toward herself. \u201cCome on. Knot me, baby. I dare you.\u201d</p><p>Dash ignored the lurch of his cock beneath his jeans; ignored the heady demand to rush her. He could see her readiness now. Not her tense nervousness, but her readiness. She was confident. She thought she was in control. Thought she had gained the upper hand. She was getting good; he would give her that. In a few hours he had done no more than begin polishing the weapons she had developed herself. Now, with her defiance, her willingness to fight him back, he was suddenly so damned horny that all thoughts of training her in anything but fucking had fled his mind. He was going to take her down, rip those jeans off that tempting ass and give her every hard, tormented inch of his cock. He moved around her, watching as her eyes narrowed and her nipples tightened further. He could smell her arousal. Had smelled it from the minute she joined him on the mat. It was sweet and hot, like an intoxicating elixir that he had to have more of.</p><p>She licked her lips, running her tongue over that full lower curve and dampening it temptingly. Sooty lashes were lowered deceptively, casting intriguing shadows on her creamy cheeks. Knot me, baby.The words had been like a fiery sword slashing through his groin, drawing his testicles tight against the base of his cock. He was dying to see if it would happen again. To feel the hot flex and ripple of her pussy as he filled it further than any other man ever could.</p><p>\u201cScared?\u201d she taunted him, watching as he moved carefully around the mat.</p><p>\u201cDebating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d She lifted a brow mockingly. \u201cAnd what are you debating, big boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust how fast it would take to work my cock up that tight ass.\u201d He bared his teeth warningly. \u201cOr if I have the patience.\u201d</p><p>Her laughter was low, amused. \u201cThat threat is getting old, Dash.\u201d</p><p>He just smiled. It wasn\u2019t a threat. There was a particular heady pleasure in taking a woman anally. Having her bending before him, submissive, accepting him easily, willingly. The need to do so had never been as driving as it was now, though. He wanted her bent before him and screaming out in pleasure as he stretched that little nether hole. Stretching wide for him, submitting to his pleasure and taking her own at the same time.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d he dared her.</p><p>She smirked. \u201cDo I look stupid to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look eatable,\u201d he corrected her, allowing his voice to deepen, the instinctive growl that gathered in his chest to echo within it. \u201cDeliciously eatable. Now turn around.\u201d</p><p>She shivered. He loved it when she did that. And her pussy was getting hotter. He could smell it. The sweet temptation of it was nearly more than his dick could bear. If he didn\u2019t fuck her soon he was going to be howling in misery.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d She shifted to the side as he stepped forward. \u201cI have a feeling I should really keep an eye on you right now.\u201d</p><p>She was smart. He had always said she was smart, he thought in growing pride. She would never be tamed, but damned if he wouldn\u2019t have fun convincing himself he could do it. Dash moved slowly, carefully, watching her as he gripped his T-shirt at the neck and tore it from it his body. Her eyes widened. He loved it when her expression went from wildfire or fury to innocent and sensually aware all at once. He was barefoot, so there were no boots or socks to worry about. His hands went to the metal buttons of his jeans.</p><p>Her nostrils flared, her lips parting as she began to breathe raggedly. He loosened the first two buttons only.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She shook her head no.</p><p>Dash smiled in anticipation. She wanted the battle. She wanted to be taken as much as he wanted to take her.</p><p>\u201cYou will go down,\u201d he warned her gently.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you will instead.\u201d He watched her brace her body, arms loose and relaxed at her sides as she narrowed her eyes on him.</p><p>He shook his head slowly. \u201cYou will go down, Elizabeth. And when you do, you\u2019re fucked.\u201d</p><p>Amusement flickered in the heat of her gaze. \u201cYou gonna talk me to death first, or go for it?\u201d</p><p>He went for it.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Elizabeth was determined she wasn\u2019t going to make it easy. The adrenaline pumping through her body, the rush to pit herself against him was throbbing too hard, too fast. Her pussy was wet and hot, her breasts swollen and nipples throbbing, and she wanted to be taken. But not easily. When he came at her, she slid quickly away from him, trying to trip him and grimacing at the low laugh he directed at her. He was playing with her, damn him.</p><p>Dash rushed her again, giving her just enough time to slide away before his hand hooked in the neckband of her T-shirt, ripping it away from her body. She struggled with the scraps as she turned to face him, tearing them from her and tossing them to the floor.</p><p>She wore only a white, fragile lace bra now. Her breasts were heaving, nipples rasping against the fabric as he stared at them. His chest was glistening with sweat, the crotch of his jeans so tight they looked ready to burst. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he came for her again she gave him a second to think he had her before she sidestepped, ducking low and throwing herself at his legs. He flipped. Son of a bitch did a perfect flip before turning and watching her with heated warning.</p><p>\u201cJeans go next,\u201d he snarled as he came at her again.</p><p>She went down. His hands went to the snap and zipper of her jeans as he allowed her to fight. He wrestled them down her hips then gripped the legs and tugged as she abandoned the jeans in exchange for freedom.</p> <p>Thong and a bra was all she had left on her body. She flipped around, coming to her feet, staring back at him as he tossed the jeans over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to knot you, baby,\u201d he told her, his voice hot and rasping. \u201cNext time, you stay down.\u201d</p><p>Her cunt was so wet she could literally feel her panties soaking with it. He rushed her again. As she moved to slide under his arm, he dipped, caught her and rolled with her until he had her on her stomach, his bigger body pinning her to the mat. His hand hooked in her panties as he gave a jerk.</p><p>Elizabeth screamed out in frustration as the panties snapped and a second later they were tossed aside. Her arms were stretched behind her as Dash locked her wrists in one hand. Then he pulled her up to her knees as she felt him working at his jeans.</p><p>\u201cMounted,\u201d he growled. \u201cSubmitted.\u201d</p> <p>She struggled against him, almost throwing him off-balance as he released his cock from his pants. It was destructive being held this way, unable to fight him, unable to get away from him. The heat of it wrapped around her senses, making her body so sensitive that when his fingers smoothed over the slick folds of her pussy she nearly climaxed then.</p><p>\u201cLike it, baby?\u201d he growled as he positioned his cock at the entrance of her cunt. \u201cGod, I love having you like this. Restrained. Submissive. It makes my dick harder than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d</p><p>The steel-hard flesh nudged against her, a silky spurt of the pre-come jetting inside her. They both groaned. It was so warm, making her hotter, slicker, as he began to work his cock into the tight entrance, pushing her shoulders to the mat as he forced her legs to stay bent, her rump raised to his burrowing impalement.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d she panted roughly as she struggled against his hold, still fighting to get free, bucking against him then groaning roughly as it only lodged the thick head deeper inside her.</p><p>Oh, that was too good. The painful pleasure of the abrupt impalement had her nerves screaming, her clit throbbing in desperation.</p><p>She tugged at the hold on her wrists, wiggled her hips, dislodging him once then groaning fiercely as his hand connected sharply with the cheek of her ass. Okay. She liked that too much. He nestled his cock against the entrance again. She felt another spurt of fluid as he slid in. Pulling back he began to work his erection inside her once more. She dislodged him again. Dash chuckled. \u201cDo you like being spanked, Elizabeth?\u201d His hand connected to the curve of her ass again, causing her to jerk and moan heatedly. \u201cI think you do, baby. I think you like having that pretty ass spanked. I bet you\u2019ll like having it fucked even better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d she cried out as his fingers slid against her anus. Thankfully, his cock tucked against the folds of her pussy once again.</p><p>\u201cDo it again, Elizabeth, and I\u2019ll take you hard,\u201d he warned her. \u201cDon\u2019t play with me right now.\u201d</p><p>And she was playing with him, tempting his control and she knew it. She wanted him hard and deep, wanted to shake that tightly held power he had over his own actions. He spurted inside her again and she felt her vagina relax. She struggled harder, laughing when he cursed, turning her hips to the side and dislodging him again as she bucked back, surprising him into releasing his hold on her wrists to keep from hurting her. She scrambled away from him, glorying in the hard growl that erupted from his throat a second before he gripped her hips and jerked her back. His cock pressed hard inside her again as a hard jet of fluid filled her a second before he pushed half the hard erection inside her with a swift thrust.</p><p>\u201cDash.\u201d She arched, screaming out at the pleasure/pain as he pulled back then thrust deeper, then again, until on the third stroke he impaled her with every hard thick inch of hungry, throbbing cock.</p><p>\u201cOh God!\u201d she cried out, fighting to relax around the engorged intruder as it moved back and thrust home again.</p><p>He thrust hard and deep. He was breathing roughly, his hands gripping her hips, working his cock in and out of her with surging thrusts that had her crying out in greedy lust. He was stoking a fire inside her that threatened to steal her mind, stretching her wide, filling her before retreating, only to open her again. Fire streaked up her spine; pleasure tore through her womb before arching along her body. Each time he filled her, groaning harshly as her pussy gripped him heatedly, her orgasm tightened in her belly. He was making few allowances for her now. The strokes were increasing in thrust and depth, powering inside her as she screamed out beneath him, twisting and thrusting back to drive him harder into the convulsing muscles of her cunt. They fought for the dominance of the act then, to see who could push the other further. To see if Elizabeth would explode or Dash would lose that last hold on his teetering control. She was determined to win.</p><p>As he plunged inside her she tightened her cunt, milking his flesh as he growled in resistance and pulled back, fighting her hold on him. She fought her own release, knowing if she came before he lost his own control then she would have lost that dominance in this act alone. The ability to make him need her above all things, to take her as he needed her, to accept her as his woman, his mate, able to accept every facet of his needs was imperative.</p><p>\u201cHarder,\u201d she cried out as he kept the thrusts timed, groaning with each forward stroke as though it were killing him. \u201cDamn you, Dash. Fuck me harder. Now.\u201d</p> <p>She pushed back, not allowing him to draw from her, stroking his cock with the flexing of her muscles as his hands tightened at her hips.</p><p>\u201cLizbeth,\u201d he moaned almost brokenly. \u201cGod, baby. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She fought his hold, bucking back and driving him deeper, flexing around him as tight as she could bear as she felt him shudder behind her, felt his hands tighten convulsively on her hips as a tremor shook his hard body.</p><p>Elizabeth moved back harder, driving him deeper as she reached beneath her body, her hands finding and caressing the hard, tight sac beneath the base of his cock as a strangled groan filled the air and he lost all semblance of control.</p><p>He was taking her in hard, deep, fast strokes that powered into her as the jets of fluid fought to relax the desperately tight muscles of her pussy while she clenched further around him. She was going to climax. It was building in her womb, surging through her body as she lay beneath him, crying out, screaming his name as the pleasure overwhelmed her.</p><p>\u201cGod. Elizabeth...\u201d He slammed hard and deep and moved to pull free again when she felt it happen. The tight stretching, the knot swelling midway up the length of his cock, filling her, locking into the rippling muscles of her pussy as she exploded beneath him. Her scream was torn from her throat as she felt his harsh explosions at the mouth of her womb, filling her, searching for fertile ground as she pulsed and exploded in her own release.</p><p>It seemed never ending. She collapsed to the mat as Dash followed her down, buried inside her, locked in the depths of her convulsing cunt as their bodies shuddered with each hard spurt of his semen. Sweat coated their bodies as they fought for breath. Dash\u2019s head lay beside hers, his teeth locked on her shoulder from the moment his release began, his groans sounding more like feral growls each time his seed jetted inside her.</p><p>Finally, long minutes later, she felt the fierce swelling begin to ease, felt him shudder then pull free of her tight grip with a deep, harsh moan. He fell beside her, breathing harshly, his hard body trembling.</p><p>\u201cI should spank you.\u201d He gasped for breath as he looked over at her with rueful amusement. \u201cI could have hurt you, Elizabeth.\u201d</p><p>She laughed weakly. \u201cYeah well, you didn\u2019t. \u2018Could have\u2019 doesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes closed. Damn, she was tired. So tired she could fall asleep where she lay. She let herself drift, darkness closing over her, feeling Dash beside her, comforting her, protecting her. Her body was replete, her mind, for the moment, at ease. It all combined to lull her into the deep, dark comfort of rest.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Dash made her wake up for a quick shower. He placed her in the bathtub, turned on the spray and washed her efficiently from head to toe as she watched him in bemusement. As though no one had ever bathed her. Her body was sweetly curved, lean and compact with firm muscle. To him, she was perfection.</p><p>Between her legs she had shaven her little pussy free of soft hair that was beginning to re-grow. It hadn\u2019t bothered him, but he knew the stubble must be uncomfortable for her.</p><p>\u201cSoap or baby oil?\u201d He knelt at her feet as he spread her legs, cleaning her with the soapy rag, careful of her tender flesh and sensitive clitoris.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cDo you shave your pussy with soap or baby oil?\u201d</p><p>She flushed lightly as she cleared her throat. \u201cOil. Lots of oil. But I can do it.\u201d</p><p>Something akin to panic flared in her eyes as he reached to the recessed shelf in the shower wall and drew down the bottle of oil he had brought for her.</p><p>\u201cShush,\u201d he commanded roughly. \u201cI do have to shave my face often, so I think I can care for one little pussy.\u201d</p><p>Rinsing her quickly, he flipped off the shower and dried them both before laying a thick towel over the closed toilet seat. \u201cSit.\u201d He pushed her down on the seat and knelt before her once again. Dash knew he didn\u2019t dare linger in the job. Already his cock was engorged, ready to take her again. He spread the oil thickly over the folds of her pussy and proceeded to shave the silken skin, marveling once again at how delicate she appeared there to him. When it was free of any stubble and as soft as anything he had ever known, he reapplied a coat of oil to soothe the freshly shaved folds. Not a word was said. As she accepted that his mind was set on the job, she merely watched him, blushing faintly, but staying in the sprawled position he needed to access her pussy. She was going to be the death of him. Dash carried her to bed, tucking her in before moving tiredly beside her and drawing her into his arms. The woman had a power over him that shook him every time he realized how deep she was digging her way into his soul.</p><p>There was nothing like loving her, being so deep inside her he could feel himself sinking into her cells. The very mouth of her cervix had cupped his cock as he locked in her, shooting his semen into the dark, rich depths of her womb. He had never known anything like it. No matter how hard he tried to still the swelling, it overruled his control and left him gasping in painful pleasure as it locked him inside her. And now, it left him wondering what the hell he would do if anything ever happened to her. He was getting ready to lead her into a war zone. Into a hell that could destroy her if he couldn\u2019t still the fury raging inside her. If he managed to keep her alive and she killed Grange in cold blood, he worried for her. Elizabeth wasn\u2019t a killer. She could defend herself, just as he would expect her to. She could kill if she had to and survive it. But from what he knew about Grange, if she ever faced him, the other man wouldn\u2019t push her to kill him. Grange would depend on her being weak. Honorable. If she killed him under those circumstances Dash wouldn\u2019t think worse of her for it, but he feared what it would do to her. As he had told her, she would have to be the one to live with it. Dash sighed deeply at that thought. In another day or two, they would leave the cabin and get ready. He had a house set up not far from Grange\u2019s estate and he would begin the nightly forays around it. Mike\u2019s men were watching for Grange, tracking the security and getting information on the men he used as guards. Some might be vulnerable to bribes; it seemed Grange wasn\u2019t well liked, even by his own men. Mike was working on information about Dane\u2019s death, getting the case ready to go to a special prosecutor for Breed Affairs when they returned with the files Grange had taken from Dane. Cassie clearly remembered the thick manila envelope splattered with the dead man\u2019s blood. Grange had been ecstatic as he read it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My own little bitch, he had told the little girl as he looked over at her. What Elizabeth had been unaware of, another piece of information Cassie had held back from her mother, was that Grange wanted Elizabeth too. The best Dash could figure, the man had been testing her and Cassie. Pushing them to their limits to see how strong each was. He wanted more Breed children, and Elizabeth was a proven breeder.</p><p>That thought caused his chest to clench almost painfully. He turned to her, his hand moving softly to her belly, his eyes closing. Could she be carrying his child now? He knew from the information Callan had given him that no birth control had stopped his or Taber\u2019s mates from conceiving. Did he somehow carry the hormone that would counteract those precautions as well? That thought had tormented him since the night he had first taken her. There was little chance that his semen wasn\u2019t reaching her womb. Each time his release swelled in his cock, it locked him tight, forcing the opening of his cock against her flexing cervix. He could feel the little entrance there cupping over the spurting tip, soaking in his seed, greedily consuming the hard ejaculations.</p><p>Was he risking not just his mate but also his child in this mission? He was getting ready to take her from the protection of the cabin, allowing Grange\u2019s spies to catch sight of her in town and draw him back to her. He was getting ready to place her in the worst sort of danger, all in the name of a prayer that she could survive.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t a fool. He prided himself on facing reality at every opportunity. There was no way to keep the information of Cassie\u2019s birth a secret, no way now for him to stay hidden from the Council\u2019s knowledge. The public may not know the truth of him as they did the Breeds, but their enemies would. Elizabeth could be forced to fight, to defend herself and Cassie, and possibly another child if worse came to worse. He couldn\u2019t protect her. She wouldn\u2019t allow it if he tried, and he knew that. But realistically, no measures he took would safeguard her.</p><p>\u201cI can hear you worrying.\u201d She shifted against him, her hand smoothing over his abdomen, her lips whispering against his chest.</p><p>He glanced down at where her head lay against him, certain that the fierce throb in his chest at her softened voice couldn\u2019t be a good thing. She was his weakness. He was only just realizing that but it was one he couldn\u2019t let go.</p><p>\u201cWe have to leave here soon.\u201d He sighed regretfully. \u201cI wish we had longer. There\u2019s a lot I have to teach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have time later.\u201d He could hear the reflection in her voice now. But would they? There were so many possibilities, so many things that could go wrong. He found himself hesitating now, wishing he had forced her to go with Cassie to the Breed compound, to be safe while he took care of Grange. He could have trained her later. Could have seen how strong she was at another time. No matter how safe he thought he could make her on this mission, there would have been another, something else safer that he could have tested her on.</p> <p>\u201cYou could be carrying my child, Elizabeth.\u201d He stared at the ceiling as he spoke, feeling her stiffen against him.</p><p>His chest tightened further at the thought of that. God, what was he doing with her? Risking her in the same ways he risked his own life? There had to be a way to keep her safe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m protected, Dash.\u201d</p><p>He hoped she was. At least for now. But he couldn\u2019t discount the information the Feline Breed leader had given him.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t help the Felines. No birth control worked with them. Their scientists suspect it would be the same with the Wolves. The hormone that produces the swelling also works to ensure conception. We could be risking another child.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hold the truth back from her. He wouldn\u2019t lie to her or hide any part of the dangers they faced.</p> <p>\u201cThen it\u2019s better to rid ourselves of Grange now,\u201d she said quietly, though he could hear the trepidation in her voice.</p><p>His hands smoothed over her back, relishing the feel of warm, silken flesh and well-toned muscle. She was like a young she-wolf. Lean and fit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to send you to the Breed compound before I go after Grange,\u201d he finally decided. \u201cYou were right; separating you from Cassie wasn\u2019t a good idea. We\u2019ll let his men get a good look at you in town, then I\u2019ll send you back...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you will.\u201d She sat up, her eyes sparkling in fury as she faced him, her nakedness all but forgotten as her gaze cut into him with lethal intent. \u201cI won\u2019t be pushed aside and protected, Dash. I deserve the chance to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you are carrying our child?\u201d he asked her softly. \u201cDo you deserve the chance to risk that life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I conceive, then any child would be placed at risk by the very fact that it will be a naturally conceived Breed,\u201d she reminded him angrily. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid, Dash. There are a lot of things I\u2019ve taken into consideration. I haven\u2019t made these decisions lightly.\u201d</p><p>He stared up at her, frowning. \u201cYou don\u2019t discuss anything you\u2019ve considered with me, Elizabeth. How would I know what you anticipate?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. He had never seen that particular expression of female exasperation from her before. It was endearing.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk,\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou weren\u2019t even going to tell me you were a Breed, Dash. Wouldn\u2019t I have been in for a hell of a surprise when you locked inside me if I hadn\u2019t known?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, would have been nice to have had someone else as shocked as I was,\u201d he growled. He watched her, seeing the anger, but seeing something more. A cool, quiet calm that was as much a part of her as the heat of her sensuality, the depth of her acceptance. As though the past two years had tempered a steel core of strength inside her soul. She was the most giving woman he had known, and the strongest. The years had been cruel, harder on her than he could have imagined, but her very survival had molded her into a warrior.</p><p>\u201cI do have a mind, you know?\u201d she finally told him with an air of amusement. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen me as this soft little woman that needs to be protected and coddled. I don\u2019t want to be protected. I don\u2019t want to be coddled. I want to share the responsibilities, Dash.\u201d</p><p>She should have been born a Breed. She was as tough as either of the two Feline females he had met.</p><p>\u201cI know you have a mind,\u201d he told her quietly. \u201cI have nothing but the greatest respect, Elizabeth, for the very fact that you still live. Most women would have failed to even rescue Cassie, let alone run with her for two years.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, a sharp sigh emitting from between her lips as she moved from the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou sound very patronizing, Dash,\u201d she told him softly as she pulled on her robe. \u201cAny mother would have given her life to protect her baby. I got lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were smart.\u201d He sat up in the bed, watching her curiously. \u201cI\u2019m not patronizing you, Elizabeth. If I didn\u2019t think you had what it takes, you would be in Virginia with Cassie rather than here, training to go after those files and Grange. Never doubt I don\u2019t have the highest respect for you. As a woman, a mother, and a mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mate,\u201d she murmured, shaking her head. \u201cYou found me less than two weeks ago, and you\u2019ve already claimed me for life.\u201d She pushed her fingers through her hair as she skirted the window and curled up in the large chair that sat on the far wall.</p><p>Distance. He saw the need to escape the intimacy that the bed afforded and he allowed her that. For now. The days they had spent together had been so rushed, so filled with the need to protect Cassie and then to complete the minimum amount of training he required. There had been little time to talk. What he knew in his soul had never been expressed to Elizabeth. Not that he had the words to do that now, but he saw in her a need to know more than she had learned so far.</p><p>\u201cI found you over a year ago, Elizabeth,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cThrough Cassie\u2019s letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe letters.\u201d She sighed deeply. \u201cGod, it was so dangerous putting her in school then. I don\u2019t know how I let her talk me into that. I was completely against letting her go and allowing the pen pal thing,</p><p>Dash. I worried myself to exhaustion that year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you did.\u201d And he did know. Somehow, some way, he connected to both Elizabeth and her child. Seeing their pain. Their fear. \u201cWhen the letters began, I had just been in an accident, Elizabeth. I lost men I had fought with for years. Good men. Friends. No one was expecting me to live. I was in a drug-induced coma the first three months of those letters. If it hadn\u2019t been for my commanding officer\u2019s belief that Cassie\u2019s letters would penetrate it, I would be dead now.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened slowly, flickering with pain, fear.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t,\u201d he said gently. \u201cMy CO wrote her back at first, until I could. But while I was in that haze...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI wanted to die then. I was tired of hiding, of having no one. I had let myself get close to the men in that unit, and then they were gone as well. I was tired of fighting. Then he read that letter. And I saw you, Elizabeth. I saw you just as you are now. Your hair tangled around you, your eyes dark and haunted, and I knew I had to live. I knew you and Cassie needed me. Each letter only strengthened that impression.\u201d</p><p>He watched her breathe out roughly, saw the shock, the bemusement in her eyes as he moved from the bed and walked to her.</p><p>Her gaze flickered to his straining erection, but at this moment, it wasn\u2019t sex he needed. He knelt in front of her, staring back at her, his arms lying along the sides of the chair.</p><p>\u201cI saw you crying, Elizabeth. I heard you whisper my name and ask God on a prayer to bring you a miracle. And in just that instant I woke up. I made myself wake up, because I knew to my soul you were my mate. My woman. And I knew I had to find you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were filled with tears, brilliant sapphire gems that pierced his heart with beauty and her pain.</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d she whispered before swallowing tightly, her voice hoarse. \u201cI was standing there, and it was raining. Cassie had gone to bed whispering that you would save us. How did she know, Dash? How could she have known?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how she knew,\u201d he told her firmly. \u201cAll that matters was that she did and it was right. You\u2019re right, Elizabeth. I don\u2019t know a lot of very important things about you, but I know your strength, and I know your heart. And nothing or no one short of death will take that from me. So never, ever doubt that I do know and respect the abilities you\u2019ve shown to protect yourself and that child. I respect them, and I thank God for them daily. For them and for you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>She was crying when he leaned forward, his lips touching hers, rubbing against them gently. As the small rivulets of moisture reached his mouth, his lips moved to her cheek. With infinite tenderness he kissed them away, drawing the moisture into his mouth as his hands cupped her head. Warmth rushed through her, piercing the shell she had fought so desperately to keep between her heart and this man\u2019s total acceptance of her. From the first moment, in the diner, he had taken over, clearing her way, sheltering her and Cassie as she rested. He had paved the way for her daughter\u2019s safety, given her a chance to once again regain control of her own life, and in the bargain, he had given her the very core of who and what he was.</p><p>Gentle words. Soft kisses. Like now, his lips moving over her face as he crooned gently to her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, baby. Your tears rip at my soul. Don\u2019t you know that? I would move heaven and earth to wipe away any pain you would know, if I could.\u201d</p><p>And he would. She saw it in the somber lines of his face, the golden glow of his eyes. The man couldn\u2019t be real. It wasn\u2019t possible. How had she ever deserved for God to answer her prayer in this manner, with this man? He was strong, too arrogant, and too sure of himself for her to be comfortable with, but a man whose voice rang with quiet honor, with acceptance of all he was. He never made excuses. He didn\u2019t pretend to have all the answers. But he was like a boulder of strength beside her, clearly willing to shelter her however she needed. And he had come to her without expectations, knowing the danger she and Cassie faced. Knowing the risk to his own life. When he drew back, staring down at her with a flare of heat and a gaze filled with adoration, she didn\u2019t know what to say. No one had ever accepted her so completely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me,\u201d she said, suddenly afraid that the faults she knew she possessed would weaken what she saw in his eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I\u2019m like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m like,\u201d he agreed softly. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how I have to fight my possessiveness and my need to hold back to keep you safe. How dominant I get and how kinky I can get sexually. I have the same fears you do, Elizabeth. We\u2019ll work through them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so certain?\u201d She was frightened now, terrified one day he would see her as she knew she was. Grumpy in the mornings, irrational during PMS, and most of all, willing to kill a man in cold blood.</p><p>His fingers slid over her cheeks, his thumb smoothing against her lips.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how, Elizabeth,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I know is that the bond with you was stronger than with any other woman, before I ever found you in that diner. That I knew you in my dreams, in the darkest depths of unconsciousness. That I know I would kill anyone, without first considering his right to live, who attempted to harm so much as a hair on your head. You complete something that has been missing inside me. That\u2019s all I know. I don\u2019t ask for more. The rest will come in time.\u201d</p><p>She breathed in raggedly as she stared back at him, feeling the heat of his body enfolding her, the warmth wrapping around her like a cloud of comfort. It sent shivers chasing up her spine to realize she had never known anything like it. At the same time, she realized how swollen her breasts were, the nipples throbbing in longing. Between her thighs, her cunt pulsed, spilled its precious moisture and further slickened the plump lips there.</p><p>\u201cI can smell your heat,\u201d he whispered as his lips lowered to hers, barely brushing against them as he stared back at her with drowsy sensuality. \u201cHot and sweet. Do you know what that does to me, Elizabeth?\u201d</p><p>He urged her to unfold her legs, pulling them down until they lay along the outside of his. His fingers worked at the knot of her robe then, loosening it slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her breathing was rough now, heavy, as she fought to drag in air to combat the extreme excitement his touch always caused to rise within her.</p><p>\u201cIt makes me very hungry,\u201d he revealed. \u201cIt makes me want to eat you slow and easy, drawing every drop of cream into my mouth and making more flow as I lick into your tight pussy. It makes me want to hear you scream, feel you shudder and pulse and spill your sweet juices against my tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod! Dash!\u201d He made her weak, made her shiver in anticipation as he drew the edges of the robe back from her body.</p><p>\u201cOh, look how pretty.\u201d His gaze went to her straining breasts. \u201cSo full and sweet, with the prettiest little berries resting atop them. I want to taste your pretty breasts as well, Elizabeth.\u201d</p><p>Her head fell back against the chair as she watched his head lower. His hands cupped the full mounds and lifted them to his mouth, his gaze never leaving hers as his tongue licked over a nipple slowly.</p><p>\u201cDash. Are you going to torture me?\u201d She gripped the sides of the chair in desperation.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. I\u2019m going to love you.\u201d He laved the hard tip with wicked flicks of his tongue, watching her closely as he did so. \u201cDo you like it, Elizabeth?\u201d he asked her softly seconds later as his lips rubbed over the twin mound and began to caress it as well.</p><p>\u201cToo much,\u201d she panted.</p><p>She had to touch him. Had to touch that smooth, hard flesh. Her hands moved to his shoulders, palms sliding over the flexing muscles there and watched as his lips opened and he drew one desperate nipple into the suctioning heat of his mouth.</p><p>His teeth rasped the little bud, his tongue licked, his mouth suckled. Sensation after sensation slammed into her womb, convulsing her stomach as she fought for control. She could feel her cunt growing wetter, her clit swelling hard and tight.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you taste so good,\u201d he growled as he moved to the other breast. He repeated the procedure there, growling his pleasure in her, the sound vibrating on the sensitive peak as her nails bit into his skin. She wanted to close her eyes, wanted to revel in the sensations, in the darkness of the sensuality he called within her, but she found him holding her gaze. His eyes were demanding, glowing with his lust and hunger, the lids lowered to half-mast, his lips swollen from the meal he was making of her nipples. Each sip, each rasp of his tongue, each draw of his strong mouth was a whiplash of pleasure nearly too devasatating to bear. She was whimpering from the hunger rising in her own body. Dash could do things to her that no man had ever accomplished. Never had she been poised on such a sharp precipice of arousal and need, knowing that when her orgasm came, that it would rip her out of herself and throw her into a place of such ecstasy she feared one day she may not return.</p><p>\u201cDelicious,\u201d he groaned as his lips lifted from her nipple then began to sprinkle light, delicate kisses over the full mounds.</p><p>Even the smallest amount of flesh was not left unattended.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me.\u201d Her head tossed against the back of the chair as he gripped her hips and pulled her forward.</p> <p>\u201cNo, baby. I\u2019m going to love you,\u201d he crooned, his voice velvety and dark, sending ripples of pleasure over her flesh. \u201cAnd how I do enjoy loving you.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her legs, spreading them wide, pulling her buttocks to the edge of the chair and staring between her thighs with hungry intent. His hand smoothed up the inside of her thigh seconds before he allowed it to cup her pussy, his finger moving up the narrow slit and coating his finger with her juices. Then his eyes rose to her.</p><p>\u201cTaste,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSee why I can barely keep my lips from your juicy cunt, no matter how dangerous things get.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth gasped in shock as he smeared the thick moisture over her lower lip, his gaze flaring with such fiery lust it nearly stole her breath.</p><p>\u201cTaste,\u201d he urged her again.</p><p>Her tongue flickered out. He grimaced in almost violent pleasure, which did no more than urge her on. She loved that look on his hard face, the intensity of arousal, the nearly painful desire. Her tongue ran slow and easy over the curve then, drawing in the thick moisture, pleased to realize it was a pure, earthy taste.</p><p>\u201cDamn. Elizabeth.\u201d That hard, primal growl was back a second before he pressed his finger between her lips, allowing her to suck the rest of her juices from his fingers. It wasn\u2019t unpleasant; it was arousing to taste herself, to see his eyes darken, to see the hunger glow to an almost mad desperation as he watched her.</p><p>He licked his own lips, as though envious that she had tasted of the sweet moisture and he hadn\u2019t. His shoulders lowered, his long body sitting on the floor now as he placed his hands on each thigh and bent his head to partake of her smooth flesh.</p><p>The first slow lick between the full, swollen lips of her pussy had Elizabeth stiffening in violent pleasure. Arcing flares of pulsing sensation ripped and ricocheted through her body at the speed of light as her hips jerked involuntarily.</p><p>\u201cDash.\u201d She moaned his name as her fingers speared through his hair, eager for a firmer touch, to have him eating her with all the hunger she could feel vibrating in his body.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he mumbled against her clit as his tongue made a slow, delicious trek around the straining nub. His tongue licked and probed at the throbbing nub, flickering against it with light, wet caresses that had her straining to him, her fingers clenching in his hair, her body setting afire with the needs rocketing through her flesh.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand it,\u201d she cried out, overwhelmed by the tenderness he displayed in his greedy feast of her flesh.</p><p>\u201cYou have to,\u201d he groaned heatedly, his breath searing her soaked cunt as he tried to lick every drop of the flowing syrup from the shallow slit. \u201cGod, Elizabeth. You intoxicate me. I could lie between your thighs for days and survive merely on the soft cream that flows from you.\u201d</p><p>She would have protested his declaration. Would have begged for him to take her if he hadn\u2019t chosen that second to sink one broad finger into the clutching depths of her pussy. She arched her hips, a strangled scream tearing from her lips at the penetration. He worked the digit in slowly, smoothing past the convulsing tissue and coating his finger once again with her juices. A protesting cry broke free of her as he retreated and shock coursed through her body as the finger slid against her lips. His lips slid lower. As Elizabeth accepted her own taste into her mouth his tongue plunged hard into her quaking vagina and his groan echoed through the room. She sucked his finger into her mouth. Her tongue licked at it desperately as his tongue flickered inside the tight depths of her pussy. He was eating her like a man starved, dragging the flowing moisture into his mouth and returning for more. His tongue fucking her with hard heated strokes until it whipped a firestorm inside the rippling channel.</p><p>She would have screamed, but that would have meant releasing the hard finger lodged in her mouth. She was terrified the plunging thrusts up her pussy would stop if she did, so she hung on, her lips clamped around it as she exploded violently.</p><p>Strangled screams tore from her throat as his finger slid free of her mouth, his tongue sinking over and over into her spasming tissue. He was groaning intently, obviously determined to suck every drop of juice from the tunnel before he finished.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>Elizabeth was so aware of every sensitized nerve ending in her pussy that it was nearly torture as Dash withdrew his tongue and came quickly back to his knees.</p><p>\u201cGod, I should move you to the bed,\u201d he whispered as he stared down at her. \u201cBut you\u2019re so damned hot, splayed out in that chair, ready for me, that I want to see you just like this as I fuck you past sanity.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth was breathing hard, her gaze flickering to his straining erection, the purpled head violently aroused and gleaming with his pre-come. He lifted her knees, holding her as he spread her further.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth,\u201d he groaned. \u201cTouch your breasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cPlay with your nipples,\u201d he told her roughly. \u201cI want to watch you, see you pleasure yourself as I fuck you. Let me see you play with your pretty breasts. Please.\u201d</p><p>She was shocked. Even more so than she had been when he needed her to taste herself. She could feel the flush moving up her neck, her face, as she watched him. There was no denying him. No protesting his needs or her own need to please him.</p><p>Elizabeth cupped the full mounds, her thumbs and forefingers gripping her nipples, pulling at them slowly.</p><p>\u201cSweet God!\u201d he groaned, his hips jerking, raking the tip of his cock against the swollen folds of her pussy. \u201cYeah. Just like that. Let me see you do that as I fuck you, Elizabeth. Let me watch.\u201d</p><p>She watched him, too. Her gaze lowered, her eyes widening at the sight of his bulging cock nestling inside the bare, pink folds of her flesh. She felt the soft spurt of his pre-come then, the lubrication that would relax her tense tissue and make her pussy burn that much brighter. She groaned at the warmth of it flowing into her, mixing with her own wetness and making her slicker, hotter. Dash flinched, as though the sensation were too pleasurable to endure. His eyes flickered to her face, then back to her hands at her breasts.</p><p>\u201cYeah, pull at them,\u201d he groaned as his cock pulsed again and she pinched her own nipples erotically.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re so pretty and red. Such hard little berries, Elizabeth. Do you have any idea how good they taste to me?\u201d</p><p>She moaned. His words alone had her on the edge of orgasm. She could feel her muscles relaxing around the hard, silk-covered steel wedge working inside her pussy, stretching her, throbbing with hot demand as he pressed into her. The intermittent spurts of his fluid were so sexually arousing she was gasping, the fire igniting in her cunt driving her to the edge of madness.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for me yet, baby?\u201d He eased the tense flesh from her cunt as she cried out in protest before easing back into her hungry vagina, spreading her tightly, heating her lusciously. \u201cAre you ready to take me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes. Yes. Dash, please. Fuck me.\u201d Elizabeth could feel her juices flowing from her cunt, coating his flesh as he began to sink farther inside her.</p><p>A strangled moan echoed from her as she watched the plump lower lips spread around the hard flesh impaling her. It was erotic, lascivious, watching him enter her, working his cock back and forth, the flesh dripping from her flow of juice as he spread her deliciously. Another, harder pulse of pre-come had her arching, groaning in need.</p><p>Inch by slow inch he invaded the tight channel, working his engorged cock back and forth, hard growls of hunger issuing from his throat as his cock continued to sporadically pulse its hot warmth into her pussy. Never in her life had she known anything so explicit, so erotic. She had never dreamed of being taken in such a manner. Of being possessed, impaled, as she watched the penetration into her hot pussy. It was killing her. Making her mad with the pleasure. She was certain she would never survive it, but knew she would surely die happy.</p><p>\u201cYou like that, don\u2019t you, baby?\u201d he whispered as she convulsed, on the edge of orgasm, shuddering with the growing heat coiling in her belly. \u201cWatching me take you. Watching your pussy flatten out around my cock.\u201d</p><p>No. She loved it. She was shaking with the pleasure, shuddering with her need to orgasm.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she panted, never taking her eyes from the sight.</p><p>He was flattening the curves, drawing her flesh tight around him, making her clit stand out in swollen demand.</p><p>\u201cTouch your clit.\u201d His voice was hoarse, rough with hunger. \u201cPlay with your nipples with one hand and touch your clit with the other. Hurry, baby. Play with it while I push every hard inch of my cock up your tight pussy.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth whimpered. One hand fell to her straining clit, her eyes never leaving the sight of roughly a third of his cock gleaming outside her vagina.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful.\u201d He was straining to hold back. She could feel it in every hard throb of his cock inside her.</p><p>\u201cNow keep stroking your pretty clit. There you go, baby. Show me how you like it. Let me watch.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers were rubbing around the pulsing nubbin, her gaze mesmerized as he watched his cock draw back slightly. Then he was pushing back, spearing into her, filling the clenching depths of her pussy with every hard, blistering inch of his engorged cock.</p><p>She was filled with him. She could feel her muscles straining around the thick flesh, at first protesting, then greedily milking at his erection. Inside, she felt another fierce blast of fluid and fought for the strength to scream at the pleasure. Her fingers paused on her clit until he groaned in protest, then began to stroke it faster, sliding in the thick moisture that dripped all along her pussy.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth. Baby. Yes. Hell, you\u2019re so fucking tight you\u2019re killing me.\u201d Perspiration gleamed along his body, small rivulets sliding from his shoulders.</p><p>The pressure was building in her clit now. The stimulation of that little bunch of nerves, her fingers at her nipple, Dash\u2019s hot gaze and his cock nudging at her cervix almost sent her over the edge. She would have exploded then. Could feel her body igniting, beginning to ripple. But he chose that moment to move, to slide back, to tempt her and tease her as he built the sensations inside her body. Slow, agonizing strokes had her mewling in protest as he seemed to relish each stroke of her pussy over his cock.</p><p>\u201cDash. Please,\u201d she moaned desperately.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cI want to watch you, baby. Watch you stretch so tight around me while you pleasure yourself. I want to make you come so hard you\u2019ll never forget the feel of my cock inside you. Never forget how hot the hunger gets.\u201d</p><p>She would die. She knew she would. His erection was hot, throbbing. She could feel the threat of the knot pulsing in the center of his flesh, the deep, flexing ripple of need that echoed along her body.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she whispered, her fingers moving in firm, even strokes against her clit as she watched him fucking her.</p><p>He was drawing out, the engorged flesh dripping with their combined juices before pushing back in a surging thrust of desperate hunger. He was watching her fingers on her moist flesh. She was watching him fuck her. It was so damned explicitly sexual she knew she would never forget the sight of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come, Dash.\u201d She was arching closer to him, driving him deeper inside her with each hard stroke he gave her. \u201cI have to come. Please. Please, I need you. I need to feel you stretching me more. Locking inside me...\u201d Her voice rose, roughened, as she remembered the feel of his seed blasting hard and deep inside her womb.</p><p>She worked her pussy on the thick pole penetrating it. Deep, desperate lunges as he groaned, growled and picked up the pace of his fierce thrusts. He was fast and hard now, the sound of sucking flesh and desperate moans filling the room as Elizabeth felt her orgasm tightening in her body. Her clit was straining beneath her fingers, her cunt tightening on the flesh driving inside it. Elizabeth writhed against him in desperation. She thrust into the powerful strokes, her cries rising, becoming hard and hungry, ripping involuntarily from her throat as she felt the fragile threads of her control snap.</p> <p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d she screamed, feeling her clit swell further, harden, the lightning-fast arcs of pleasure and searing heat ripping through it as he lunged inside her. \u201cOh God, Dash. Now. Now...\u201d</p><p>She lost her breath, lost her sanity. Her clit exploded as her pussy began to ripple, spasming around the hard, immediate swelling in his cock. She felt the thick head nudging against her cervix, the knot inside her aligning the hard flesh until the opened eye was lodged against the entrance to her womb and the hard jets of his semen began to pulse inside her.</p><p>Gurgled screams escaped her as she began to twist, to convulse, her hips jerking against him, driving him harder against her as another explosion tore through her body. She couldn\u2019t stand it. She wouldn\u2019t survive it.</p><p>\u201cDash...\u201d She screamed his name, crying, pleading as the pleasure consumed her. \u201cOh God. Dash. I can\u2019t stand it, I can\u2019t...\u201d She arched in his arms as her body tightened to a near breaking point, hearing his agonized groan, the flexing of his muscles, his hard hands gripping her hips to hold her to him as his release tore through him.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth. Baby. Baby.\u201d His voice washed over her as his body collapsed against her, holding her still as he spilled every rich drop of semen into her convulsing womb. She had heard of it. Had heard Dane once discussing the phenomenon of the cervix capping over the spurting head of a cock, opening enough to suck the fertile seed inside it but she hadn\u2019t thought it possible. Hadn\u2019t believed it could actually happen. Until she felt it. And not for the first time. Distantly, hazily, she knew it had happened each time Dash had taken her. Each time he had swelled inside her. The hard, surging explosions repeated each time she felt the swelling throb, each time she felt his seed erupt from his cock. As though her mind had opened as deeply to him as her body had, she was aware of each contracting orgasm that shuddered through her body, and his moan of pleasure as it caused her pussy to milk the knot locking him inside her.</p><p>His body was tense, tight, as he covered her. His lips were at her shoulder as she realized he was once again biting her, his teeth sinking into the same area of flesh he had marked before, his mouth drawing at it as the dull pain of the bite blended in with the agonizing pleasure echoing through her. It seemed to last forever, draining her, sapping any strength, any energy she could have possessed, just as it had before. All too soon, she felt his flesh begin to relax inside her, his teeth releasing her shoulder as he moaned with low, desperate satiation.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Elizabeth,\u201d he whispered in her ear, faint, almost too low to hear. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>He was in love with her. Elizabeth watched Dash the next morning as he moved through the brush ahead of her, showing her by his actions how to pass through the forest without a sound. It amazed her. As he moved by, he disturbed nothing. Not a leaf or a breath of air. Birds chirped in a steady symphony, squirrels continued to play and the sounds of the mountain remained steady, uninterrupted. When she moved to follow him, no matter how hard she tried, the forest around them stilled by several degrees and she felt as though the wildlife was laughing at her attempt to mimic Dash\u2019s grace and ease of movement within the forest.</p><p>He watched her with narrowed eyes for long minutes.</p><p>\u201cStop. Watch.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t big on words during the training phases he had set up. Since the night before and his whispered declaration, he had been even quieter than normal. She knew she had hurt him. Knew her silence had pricked at him.</p><p>She watched him now as he had ordered. Watched each shift of his body, each ripple of muscle. He had discarded his shirt earlier and was now dressed only in the camouflage pants he wore in the wilderness. The dull, forested colors seemed to suit him, blending in with the raven\u2019s black of his hair, the dark tanned tint of his flesh. He moved through the trees and underbrush with a confidence born of his savage DNA. He was natural, a part of the land and the battle for life that flowed through the mountain.</p><p>\u201cYour objective is to blend with the area around you as much as possible.\u201d His voice was smooth, flowing, caressing over her like the soft breeze that rustled the trees. \u201cIf you know you can\u2019t achieve the silence needed, then wait for the breeze. It ripples through the land, and any slight noise made then can be attributed to it. Your enemy is listening for the unusual, the out of place. He\u2019s not searching for the sounds that are commonplace in his territory.\u201d</p><p>He waited for another breeze before slipping through a thick growth of fern and tall, blossoming bushes. She saw the leaves rub together, saw his legs as they parted the brush, but the sound of the wind whispering through the leaves overhead covered it.</p><p>\u201cThere will be dogs on the estate,\u201d he told her as he paused at the other side of the greenery. \u201cHighly trained animals. We\u2019ll go in downwind of them and time our penetration of the house with the guards\u2019</p><p>rounds to keep them from catching our scent. But it means we\u2019ll have to be fast. Fast and quiet aren\u2019t always good companions. So you have to get this right.\u201d</p><p>She did love him. She watched him move through the thickest parts of the underbrush, teaching her what she needed to know to survive, to go after an enemy that would kill them if they were caught. He trusted her to cover his back, to fight alongside him. And despite her refusal to give him that final commitment, he hadn\u2019t wavered in his determination to protect her and Cassie as best he could. And he knew she would have to fight, have to be a partner as well as a lover when knowledge of Cassie\u2019s birth was revealed.</p><p>\u201cRemember, Elizabeth, the mission comes second place to making certain we survive it. We do nothing that stacks the odds against us, because we can always fight another day. And there are other ways to protect Cassie if we have to. This is the most efficient and the most logical at the moment. If it fails, we pull out. Do you understand me?\u201d His voice had hardened as he turned back to her. She nodded slowly, watching him with careful intensity. His expression was somber, as he always was while training her.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He nodded, a bleak, dark look entering his eyes for just a second. \u201cAny questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you love me?\u201d The question seemed to surprise them both. He stared at her in amazement for all of five seconds before his brows snapped into a fierce frown. He grimaced then, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cHell, Elizabeth, why do you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait until I\u2019m fucking distracted to ask something so idiotic. For a smart female, that was one of your dumber questions.\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned at the insult as she crossed her arms over her breasts and watched him angrily.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t consider it a stupid question,\u201d she informed him heatedly. \u201cSeriously, Dash. It\u2019s not as though I have a lot of experience with men telling me they love me. Maybe I need a little clarification.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cClarification of what?\u201d he snapped, his eyes glittering dangerously. \u201cFigure it out.

Now get your ass over here and don\u2019t make a sound doing it.\u201d</p><p>Her blood heated at the order. She more or less stomped over to him, stopping an inch from his body and staring up at him confrontationally.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead,\u201d he snarled. \u201cIf this was Grange\u2019s estate you would have just alerted every damned guard and dog on the place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell it\u2019s not Grange\u2019s estate, and I asked a perfectly logical question,\u201d she informed him furiously. Sometimes he reminded her that he was still a man, even if he was a Breed. And men were nothing if not harder than hell to get along with. \u201cI deserve an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t know, then you don\u2019t deserve jackshit,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She was ready to kick his shins for being so damned stubborn. \u201cKeep it to yourself, big boy, and I\u2019ll keep just as quiet about why I love you. Better yet. I\u2019ll be quiet period . I\u2019m going back to the cabin.\u201d</p><p>She turned to do just that, but before she moved more than a step he had gripped her arm and jerked her around.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d he growled.</p> <p>\u201cNot a damned thing.\u201d She jerked her arm out of his grip. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m hot, I\u2019m hungry and I\u2019m mad. So you can kiss my ass. I\u2019ve had it for the day.\u201d</p><p>He snagged the back of her pants, pulling her to a stop as he loomed over her dangerously. \u201cYou\u2019re going to keep teasing me with that sweet ass, baby, I\u2019m going to take it.\u201d</p><p>She tossed him an exasperated look. \u201cYou can stop with the threats. We both know there\u2019s no way. Now, I\u2019m hungry. Go away and hunt or something. You\u2019re bothering me.\u201d</p><p>He released her, but she was more than aware he did so not because she was able to jerk away from him, but simply because he decided to do so.</p><p>\u201cYou go right ahead and convince yourself of that, baby.\u201d He smirked. \u201cGo on to the cabin. If I don\u2019t find my self-control, I\u2019ll show you just how possible it really is. And we\u2019ll discuss your lack of common sense in daring me later.\u201d</p><p>An unladylike snort was her only response as she hurried away from him. It would teach her to tell that hulking, arrogant piece of male flesh that she loved him. But she realized she was smiling as she trekked back to the small cabin. She was smiling and filled with a warmth she hadn\u2019t believed possible. He had to really love her, she thought as she came off the mountain. Otherwise, he would have been pissed rather than just irritated.</p> <p>Then she stopped. For a moment, she wasn\u2019t certain why, she came to an abrupt complete stop and slid behind the trunk of a centuries-old oak. Her heart was suddenly racing out of control, her skin prickling with a sense of danger, with an abrupt change in the air.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a sound. The birds weren\u2019t singing, and it felt as if the forest was held in a suspended state of waiting as the land watched whatever new game was playing out. She felt behind her, gripping the butt of the gun Dash insisted she carry. She pulled it free, checked the clip silently and flipped off the safety. Where was Dash? She turned, staring back from the direction she had come, but seeing nothing. Could he sense the change from above her?</p><p>Don\u2019t do anything stupid. The refrain began to repeat through her mind. Retreat if you have to. Fight another day. But where was Dash?</p><p>She forced her heartbeat under control, breathing deeply as she calmed the heavy throb of her pulse in her ears and fought to listen closely to the sounds around her. A breeze, a rustle to her right. She shifted again, moving along the trunk of the tree to ensure she stayed hidden. Weapon ready, she crouched along the base of the tree, peering around it carefully. There. A swiftly moving shadow as though something or someone had slipped along the edge of that outcropping of boulders several feet from the tree she hid behind.</p><p>Oh God. Had Grange found them? Had he somehow learned what they were doing? She turned, putting her back to the tree, watching the area around her with narrowed eyes as she considered her options. Whoever it was more a danger to her than to Dash. But what if the irritation filling him had dulled his senses? He was upset with her. He might not be as careful as he should be. How many were there?</p><p>Where were they?</p><p>She breathed in deeply, nostrils flaring as she had watched Dash do, but nothing came to her. She couldn\u2019t sense where they were hiding, had no idea how to get into position for a better view.</p><p>\u201cHey lady, where\u2019s Dash?\u201d She flinched as the male voice echoed from the boulders she had spied seconds before.</p> <p>She stayed silent.</p><p>\u201cCome on. I know he\u2019s up here. I just have to talk to him. Just let me know where he\u2019s at and everything\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>She was trembling. She could feel the breeze whispering over her chilled flesh as a sense of dread filled her.</p><p>Stay silent when uncertain, Dash had told her the day before. If you\u2019re hidden, you\u2019re hidden. No matter how much they think they know where you are, there\u2019s always a chance you managed to move. Your best defense is silence.</p><p>She stayed silent. She didn\u2019t shift or move, merely watched the land before her. She could see nothing from her side, couldn\u2019t sense any movement behind her.</p><p>\u201cLady, I\u2019m getting pretty tired of sitting back here. I know you\u2019re there. I can smell Dash all over your body. Now tell me where the hell he\u2019s at.\u201d</p><p>Fear flashed through her. Oh God. How could he smell her? He had to be a Breed. Or lying. Lying, she decided. Callan and the Felines were the only Breeds aware of their location and they had Dash\u2019s cell number. They wouldn\u2019t be sneaking around the mountain.</p><p>\u201cKilling you would be so easy,\u201d the voice snarled with controlled fury. \u201cStop being stupid and answer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilling you would be easier.\u201d Dash. His voice seemed to echo around her as dizzy relief flooded her body. \u201cDrop your weapon and move out where she can see you. Don\u2019t fuck with me, either. This is my territory. You can\u2019t win.\u201d Silence filled the mountain for long moments. \u201cElizabeth, move around to your right carefully, keep that gun trained between his thighs until I get there. We don\u2019t want to kill him if he gets stupid, just hurt him real bad.\u201d</p><p>Giddy pleasure washed over her as she moved carefully to do as she was ordered. As she rounded the tree, she almost dropped the gun in shock before she managed to direct it as Dash had ordered her. She blinked over at the stranger, watching as his pale eyes regarded her calmly, his hands held carefully away from his body.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re his woman.\u201d His eyes were narrowed on her intently. She swallowed tightly, refusing to speak. His lips quirked in amusement.</p><p>\u201cHe did good.\u201d He nodded. \u201cBetter than I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon, you stupid son of a bitch.\u201d Dash entered the small clearing, anger vibrating through every pore of his body. \u201cAre you trying to get your ass killed?\u201d</p><p>He was obviously a soldier of some sort. He held himself with careful readiness, his lean, muscular body poised for action. He had short dark hair, pale blue eyes and the face of a fallen angel.</p><p>\u201cTrying to help you.\u201d The other man shrugged. \u201cI waited forever at that cabin and decided to come looking for you. Your woman sensed me, though. She\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Dash glanced over at her and Elizabeth basked in the approval of his gaze.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth, meet one of the men I fought with overseas. What the hell he\u2019s doing here I have no clue.\u201d</p><p>He flashed the man a hard look as he lifted his arm and indicated to Elizabeth that she should come to him.</p><p>\u201cI told you what I was doing here,\u201d he said with a slow, soft southern drawl. \u201cI\u2019m not alone. I have a unit waiting back at that cabin. We didn\u2019t want to surprise you too bad.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth felt Dash\u2019s body tighten in surprise.</p><p>\u201cA unit?\u201d He frowned. \u201cWhat the hell for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaught wind of what you were up to here.\u201d He shrugged as he leaned down carefully and retrieved the weapon he had dropped. He holstered it immediately. \u201cTaking that bastard won\u2019t be easy, Dash. I\u2019ve pulled my old team together and we\u2019re here to help.\u201d</p><p>Despite the soft, pleasant drawl, Elizabeth glimpsed a stubbornness in the man Dash called Simon that warned her he wouldn\u2019t back off easily.</p><p>Dash was watching him, not suspiciously, but in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Dash shook his head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your fight, Simon. Or your units. And I sure as hell can\u2019t afford your fee.\u201d</p><p>Simon\u2019s full, sensual lips quirked mockingly. \u201cConsider it a freebie,\u201d he said softly. \u201cLet\u2019s head back to your cabin. I have Stephanie making coffee. Hope you don\u2019t mind. And the others are waiting impatiently.\u201d</p><p>There was a long tense silence then.</p><p>\u201cOh hell. You pulled the Ladies in,\u201d Dash groaned as though pained. \u201cSimon, dammit, those women are vicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest kind.\u201d Simon nodded. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve been damned worried about your sorry ass since hearing about this fool\u2019s mission you\u2019re on. Don\u2019t you know better, Dash? Grange will have an Army waiting on this pretty thing you\u2019ve got. And if he gets her, you know damned good and well he\u2019ll have the kid eventually.\u201d</p><p>The lazy drawl, the redneck attitude and sinfully good looks were a combination that could have been devastating if it weren\u2019t for the fact her body and her heart belonged to Dash. Simon was the least likely-looking soldier she could have imagined. He looked like a good ole boy playing at being a warrior.</p><p>\u201cIs he for real?\u201d Elizabeth asked Dash.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, he is.\u201d Dash sighed. \u201cCome on, you can meet Simon\u2019s Ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis Ladies?\u201d she asked suspiciously.</p><p>Dash glanced down at her with something akin to resignation. \u201cYeah. His Ladies.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>Dash had some strange friends. Ex-C.I.A. agents as ranchers, Special Forces types who baited Feline Breeds, and a smooth-talking southern boy with a harem all his own. A very dangerous, lethal harem, if Elizabeth wasn\u2019t wrong.</p><p>The small cabin was filled with estrogen and female hormones and it was all directed one way. Toward the soft-spoken fallen angel that very obviously enjoyed them all.</p><p>\u201cThis is Stephanie, my little lady of passion.\u201d He drew the nearest woman into his arms as they entered the cabin. She was tall, slender and stacked. The woman showed an excessive amount of caf\u00e9 au lait skin in the snug bra-type gray top and form-fitting black leggings. She had a gun strapped to her hips, a dagger sheathed on her thigh and a gleam of laughter in her dark, chocolate-brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cOr so he likes to think.\u201d She looked up at the man with a mocking smile. \u201cIt\u2019s good to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my little Danica. She takes care of all our...uhh social engagements.\u201d Long black hair and wearing form-fitting black, weapons in place and stacked. Her blue eyes glowed with adoration as she stared up at Simon.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you again, Dash.\u201d Danica greeted him before nodding at Elizabeth. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlori, baby.\u201d He drew the smaller brunette into his arms. \u201cThis is my humble baby, Gloria.\u201d He dropped a kiss to her lips as she snuggled against his side after Stephanie moved away.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dash.\u201d She flashed Dash a wide smile. \u201cYou training her?\u201d She nodded at Elizabeth. \u201cYou need to buy her some better clothes than jeans.\u201d She ran her hand over the hip of her snug spandex leggings.</p><p>\u201cThis is freer.\u201d</p><p>Dash cleared his throat but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cJanette, Oleta and Kimberly.\u201d Janette had a pair of handcuffs dangling from the wide belt that crossed her hips. She was a blonde siren. Stacked. Oleta was a vibrant brunette with subtle hints of dark blonde highlights and Kimberly was a redhead with a definite gleam in her eyes when she looked at Dash. Elizabeth frowned as she glanced up at her lover. Dash looked down at her with a wry gleam of amusement, which only made her more suspicious. The women were just a little bit too familiar with Dash to suit her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have dinner soon,\u201d Stephanie called from the open kitchen. \u201cCoffee\u2019s on now. Good thing we brought supplies with us. You guys actually think that stuff you called food was healthy?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth frowned. She rather liked the stews and chili that Dash had been putting together.</p><p>\u201cMy Steph is a whiz in the kitchen.\u201d Simon beamed. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a meal you\u2019ll not soon forget.\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth kept silent. The women were moving around the kitchen and living room now; a few were cleaning weapons, two were cooking and the other two had taken watchful positions at each window. Dash sighed. \u201cElizabeth and I are going to go shower. Make yourselves at home, Simon. We\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we will.\u201d Simon leaned lazily against the wall, his arm going around one of the redheads that moved in against him. \u201cYou go on. I have some things to show you this evening and then we can plan.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth followed Dash into the bedroom, waiting until he closed then, strangely enough, locked the door behind him. He moved the straight-back chair from the side of the wall and propped it under the doorknob. She lifted her brow mockingly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t trust him?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>Dash stared up at her in surprise. \u201cI trust him well enough, I just know him too damned well.\u201d He raked his fingers through his hair in a gesture of obvious irritation. \u201cDamn, I wasn\u2019t expecting this.\u201d He seemed more than bemused by the turn of events.</p> <p>\u201cI thought you said you didn\u2019t have friends.\u201d She kept her voice low as she watched him curiously. Dash was frowning. He glanced to the door, then back at her.</p><p>\u201cSimon\u2019s an anomaly. Ignore him.\u201d He glanced back at the door, appearing more confused by the second.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Elizabeth asked him.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cDamned man. I have no idea what the hell he thinks he\u2019s doing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds to me like he\u2019s here to help you.\u201d She sat down on the bed and began unlacing her boots. \u201cFor a man who claims he doesn\u2019t have friends, you keep accumulating a bunch of them.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her, just stood watching her with a dark, wary expression.</p> <p>\u201cDash, you\u2019re worrying me.\u201d She removed her boots before standing up and pulling her T-shirt over her head.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t bothered with a bra that morning. The damned things were too restricting and uncomfortable when trying to move about the forest. Then she unsnapped her jeans, pulled the zipper and drew them from her body. When she looked up at Dash, he didn\u2019t appear concerned anymore. He looked hungry.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she snorted. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to make me scream with all those women standing in there listening. They would attack you the minute you left the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t deny it. Instead, he began to strip himself as she headed for the bathroom.</p><p>He caught up with her as she was adjusting the water, gloriously naked and more than a little aroused.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth.\u201d He caught her against him as she moved to step beneath the spray, staring down at her with those golden eyes that never failed to make her breath catch. \u201cI love you because you hold my soul,\u201d he told her simply. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved you. I just haven\u2019t always known you.\u201d</p><p>Damn him. Just when she thought she had one or two defenses left against him he pulled something like this on her.</p><p>She laid her head on his chest, because she knew if she continued to watch him she would end up crying again. He broke her heart sometimes. She had never been loved, been accepted so deeply, as Dash loved and accepted her.</p> <p>\u201cI love you for the same reasons, Dash.\u201d She finally admitted what she had known when he was no more than a weekly letter, a ray of sunshine into her and Cassie\u2019s dark life. \u201cFor the same reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Here\u2019s what we have.\u201d Simon accepted a thick sheaf of papers from one of his Ladies as they sat at the kitchen table after dinner. \u201cThere are Wolf Breeds that escaped that lab. We estimate at least half a dozen. Maybe more if the young survived.\u201d He spread out several official documents as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cSoon as I learned what you were and what you were up against, I put the Ladies to the computers and told them to hack to their hearts\u2019 content.\u201d He cast smiles to the women arranged around him. \u201cThey\u2019re good, too.\u201d</p><p>Dash sighed. He had been doing that a lot lately. \u201cWhat I want to know is how you found out,\u201d he finally said. \u201cThe information was supposed to be contained within a small circle.\u201d</p><p>Simon shrugged his broad shoulders. \u201cI know a few of the Felines. Rumor has been circulating for months in the underground that Grange had him a Breed kid. When the little girl showed up at the compound last week while Dani was there, she let me know. She also overheard your name mentioned. Next day, your papers as a Breed were filed as well as your paternity statement with Breed Affairs in Washington. It was kind of a no-brainer from there, Dash.\u201d He shook his head as though Dash hadn\u2019t given him enough of a challenge.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve also met what we suspect to be Wolf Breeds.\u201d Dani spoke up then as Simon seemed to beam in pride. \u201cA young woman named Faith, no last name, and her brother, Aiden, in Colorado. A few months later we met up with a big guy named Jacob. Once again, no last name, this one in Texas meeting with a well-known Breed sympathizer with mega cash. All three have the same lack of histories, and none of them can be traced via computer or records. All three have definite agendas where the Breeds are concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAiden, Faith and Jacob were the names of three litter mates I was raised with,\u201d Dash informed them.</p><p>\u201cThe Pack Leader, Wolfe, named them himself. We were given numbers in the labs rather than names. It sounds like they escaped after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey disappeared again, though,\u201d Danica said sadly. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to make further contact, though when the papers hit Washington and news started spreading of a naturally conceived Wolf Breed child contact was made in high-level offices within Breed Affairs. Word is being given that the child is currently on the move and in hiding. No definite place of residence was listed. You can bet Grange is tracking this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrange has also beefed up security at his estate,\u201d Stephanie said as she rifled through the papers.</p><p>\u201cThree new guards were hired and rumor says he\u2019s home next week. His young mistress has been reinstalled and everything is being prepared for his return.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth listened as the information was relayed at an almost furious rate for over an hour. They had everything. Locations, destinations, names, addresses and family members of the guards, and they were even certain they had several that could be bribed to allow them into the estate. Two of which were brothers of the young woman who had been forced to take the position of mistress in Grange\u2019s bed. He liked his women young. This one was barely eighteen, and Simon\u2019s reports stated she had been treated for a suicide attempt within months of going to the monster\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cI contacted Mike last night.\u201d Simon was talking again. \u201cI know you have a few of his boys out here, and I found out Callan has dispatched several Felines, as well as a couple of the Tyler brothers to help you. We have a small army going here, Dash. Let\u2019s get this done fast and right and take the bastard out this time.\u201d There was suddenly a dangerous flare of anticipation glowing in the other man\u2019s eyes. Elizabeth glanced at Dash again. He was fingering several of the papers, his gaze reflective as he pretended to read one.</p><p>\u201cLook, Dash.\u201d Simon leaned forward. \u201cI know how you feel, man, after losing your unit. The more people involved the bigger the risk of losing more than just yourself. But you saved my ass and my girls too many times to count. I\u2019m not letting you take your woman in there alone. I know she has to go. I understand that need, if nothing else, from her standpoint. But alone isn\u2019t the way to do it.\u201d</p><p>Dash stood up from the table and for the first time Elizabeth noticed the tense, wary set of his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI saved your ass and those girls because I didn\u2019t want you dead, Simon,\u201d he snapped. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a job you were hired for and it\u2019s not your fight. You have no business here.\u201d</p><p>Simon turned to Elizabeth then. She watched the somber glint in his eye for a second before he hid it with cool laughter. \u201cHe\u2019s a stubborn bastard,\u201d he drawled. \u201cHas he told you yet he doesn\u2019t have friends?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth cleared her throat. \u201cHe mentioned that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe likes to lie to himself.\u201d Simon leaned back in his chair. \u201cWe\u2019ve had more than a dozen calls regarding half that many units he\u2019s fought with that have b made themselves available to join in. That boy has a load of friends chewing their fingernails to the quick worrying about his \u2018John Wayne do-it-myself\u2019</p><p>attitude. Thinks everyone needs help but him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Simon,\u201d Dash growled. He didn\u2019t sound amused. He sounded worried and pissed.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Another thing about Dash I\u2019ve always noted.\u201d Simon smiled a bit sadly. \u201cHe always thinks it\u2019s his fault when one of those non-friends gets their ass in a sling or ends up resting eternally. Doesn\u2019t matter to him if he was there, involved or knew what the hell was going on or not. Always thinks it\u2019s his fault. Has he told you about Afghanistan yet? He lost his brothers there...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, I said to shut the fuck up.\u201d Elizabeth flinched in surprise and fear as Dash\u2019s rough, desperate voice seemed to echo around the room.</p><p>Silence filled the small cabin as all eyes turned to Dash. He turned from them, raking his fingers through his hair, the muscles in his back rippling with tension.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure Dash.\u201d Simon\u2019s voice was curiously gentle as he stood to his feet. \u201cWe have the cabin at the base of the mountain. We\u2019ll head back now. Here\u2019s my cell number.\u201d He scribbled the numbers on one of the papers. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back in the morning first thing for breakfast. Steph thinks the two of you might be undernourished or something. Come on, ladies.\u201d</p><p>They gathered around the tall dark-haired man, all of them casting Dash quiet looks so filled with caring and pain, for his sake, that it broke Elizabeth\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Simon.\u201d She moved to him, giving him a hard, brief hug as he opened his arms easily to her. He had grown on her in the space of a few short hours. Equal parts hard edged warrior and playful immaturity that endeared him to her.</p><p>\u201cTake care of the stubborn ass,\u201d he finally sighed. \u201cTalk some sense into him maybe. He listens when he has to.\u201d</p><p>Dash ignored them all until Simon and his Ladies left. No sooner had the door closed than he moved. Elizabeth gasped as she was pushed roughly against the wall, his eyes blazing down at her, his hands hard, almost hurting, as he held her pinned to the rough wall.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he snarled, his eyes blazing furiously. \u201cNever fucking touch another man in my presence, Elizabeth. Never, do you hear me?\u201d His lips were drawn back, his expression so explosively enraged her heart jumped in fear for one hard minute.</p><p>Then anger filled her. Furious blinding anger that ripped through her stomach, her chest. Before she knew what she was doing her leg came up, her knee contacting hard and fast between his thighs as he suddenly paled and swayed.</p><p>Jerking away from him, shaking with her fury, she turned back to him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever manhandle me like that, Dash. Never again. And don\u2019t you dare try to pretend to know anything about me when you can\u2019t face your own truths. Now I\u2019m going to bed. I\u2019ve had about all I can stand of your churlishness and your refusal to accept yourself, let alone those around you.\u201d</p><p>She stomped away from him, confident that he would recover from the blow that was, at best, light. She could have put him to the floor. She also knew he would follow her. Aware and waiting. By God, she\u2019d put his balls in his throat the next time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><p>The lights were out and Elizabeth was lying stiffly in the bed an hour later when Dash finally slipped into the room. He removed his clothes in the dark then eased beneath the blankets.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d His voice wrapped around her, filled with regret. \u201cI had no right to act that way.\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth sighed wearily. \u201cSo why did you, Dash? Simon came to help you, and I appreciate that. Besides, he\u2019s harmless...\u201d</p><p>Dash snorted. \u201cElizabeth, Simon is the least harmless man I know. But I know he would never touch you with anything other than respect. The hug was harmless, a part of who you are, and I know that. I don\u2019t have an excuse for what I did.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at the ceiling, letting the scene replay in her mind once again. Dash had been on the edge of his control. Something had triggered a ragged fury inside him that she thought confused even him.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you admit to having friends, Dash?\u201d She knew that had been the key to his anger.</p><p>\u201cEveryone has friends somewhere. Everyone accepts that. Why not you? Why does the thought of having them make you so angry?\u201d</p> <p>At first, she thought he wasn\u2019t going to answer her. When he did, the ragged sound of his voice alone broke her heart.</p><p>\u201cI was the runt of the litter I was created with,\u201d he told her bleakly. \u201cHalf the size of the other Breeds, and scrawny as hell. One of the scientists seemed to have taken me under his wing, though. Devroe. A cold-eyed bastard, but he seemed to like me well enough that it kept me alive for ten years. I endured tests that I cringe to think of now, because they were so painful, because he asked me to. I saw him as a father. Until the day I heard him planning to put me down.\u201d He grunted mockingly. \u201c\u2019Just like an animal. Bastard\u2019s never going to grow into anything,\u2019 he told his supervisor. \u2018We\u2019ll put him down next week.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth closed her eyes in horror.</p><p>\u201cI saw him as a friend. A mentor. All the things kids look up to, but that day, I saw the monster he really was. Two days later I found my chance, hid in one of the supply trucks and shipped out with it. I knew I\u2019d have to hide. I\u2019d have to be smart and careful, and keep my guard up unless I wanted to return to my own death. Friends make you weak. You want to trust them. You want to depend on them, let them depend on you. I saw all the hazards of that after I found foster care and began growing. \u201d</p><p>He had been a child, she thought. Ten years old and alone. His voice washed over her as he told her about the life he found. Foster care hadn\u2019t been easy for him, but he had excelled in school, and finally started growing. And he made sure no one else had the chance to betray him. He didn\u2019t make friends. Stayed to himself. When he joined the Army and then the Special Forces, he had kept that determination. But as he talked, Elizabeth realized that the honor and determination to save lives that filled Dash had run the course of his Army life. Men he had held at arm\u2019s length owed him their lives, just as he owed several of them. His voice became softer, a bit amused as he spoke of those years and those men. And she saw how he had protected himself, never admitting to the bonds that had formed. Finally, he came to the year he was sent to Afghanistan to weed out a new contingent of terrorists that were hiding in the mountains there. His voice changed then, becoming cooler, though she heard the pain beneath it.</p><p>\u201cThere were twelve of us,\u201d he finally said softly. \u201cWe\u2019d been fighting together for over a year. My longest unit assignment. I was usually moved around pretty regularly as I was needed. I\u2019m a good tracker.\u201d His voice was hoarse. \u201cYou get close when you fight that long together.\u201d He sighed. \u201cYou learn each other\u2019s dreams. You know who carries secrets and who doesn\u2019t. You...\u201d The silence surrounding them deepened for long minutes. \u201cYou become brothers,\u201d he finally finished. \u201cWe were the Deadly</p> <p>Dozen. And for the first time in my life I was thinking, you know, maybe it wasn\u2019t so hard having friends. I had hidden for so damned long, Elizabeth. Sometimes it was scary, how fucking alone I tried to make myself.\u201d</p><p>She moved closer to him. He wasn\u2019t alone. He never had been, but she couldn\u2019t tell him that yet. Couldn\u2019t say anything until he was ready to hear it. He had thought himself alone, and as she told Cassie, what you convinced your mind was all that mattered.</p><p>\u201cWe had just cleared up a killer mission. Son of a bitch, we pulled it off without a casualty. Those men were bruisers, and we covered each other\u2019s asses like underwear. We\u2019d just been airlifted and were heading home. I was thinking of putting in to take command of the unit. I was unofficial commander for a year. I thought maybe it was time, that maybe I could find a place for myself. Kind of a family.\u201d He cleared his throat as his voice became thick, rough.</p><p>\u201cJack and Craig, they were damned good sharpshooters, were joking about going home to their girls for the weekend. There were a few nurses on base they had been seeing. Mac and Tim, the explosives experts, were divorced and were talking about getting drunk and calling the ex\u2019s. The others were ribbing each other, flying high on adrenaline and success. And I was sitting there watching them. I kept pushing back that little warning in the back of mind. That something that kept telling me things weren\u2019t right. The world went to hell two minutes later.\u201d</p><p>She lay against him, desperate to hold him. Her arm went over his chest as she lay against his body, feeling his arms close convulsively around her.</p><p>\u201cI was close to the door and was thrown clear as the helicopter went down. I don\u2019t even know how that happened. The others were dead before they hit the ground. The impact of the explosive was damned precise. They knew what the hell they were doing that time, Elizabeth. They knew we would be there and they knew who they were hitting. And they killed every damned one of those men because I wasn\u2019t on guard. Because I let their camaraderie and their friendship distract me. I got them all killed, Elizabeth, because I let them be friends.\u201d</p><p>She heard the ragged edge of guilt, the torment he felt because he had been unable to control the events that happened. But she saw something more as well. She saw his fears of losing those he cared for, the scars it left on his soul because he couldn\u2019t save everyone. She rose up in the bed, turning so she could stare into his eyes. The dim light from the moon spearing into the window lent just enough of a glow to allow her to see the moist pain in his gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t run from this one, Dash,\u201d she told him gently. \u201cYou can deny the friendships until hell freezes over and it won\u2019t change anything. Just like all the guilt in the world won\u2019t change the fact that you couldn\u2019t save those men, that you had no way of controlling what happened that night. You have no way of controlling Simon, his women or me. But you can still accept us, and you can still love us. And you can know, that if any of us die at any time, we died loving you and knowing that somewhere along the way, you enriched our lives. There\u2019s no more you can do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou, I can control,\u201d he almost snarled. \u201cDon\u2019t think for a minute, Elizabeth, that I won\u2019t have your ass covered. Simon...\u201d He sighed. \u201cThat man is like a Texas whirlwind and refuses to listen to good sense. Those Ladies of his aren\u2019t always as careful as they should be, either. They live for the adrenaline and for Simon. Just as Simon lives for them. It\u2019s damned scary to watch them together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She tilted her head as she watched him closely. \u201cBecause you know he loves them? Because you know if he lost just one of them, it would rip him to shreds? And he\u2019s your friend, so you worry about that. And you feel helpless, because you know if he lost one of them, you couldn\u2019t ease the pain.\u201d</p><p>He was silent now.</p><p>\u201cBut Dash, I saw something you might have overlooked,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI saw six women who found in one man something to hold onto, to balance the ice inside them. Those women are dangerous. I could see that and I would prefer to face Grange than piss one of those women off. They could kill you without blinking. But Simon tempers them. He gives them someone to love, something to hold onto without fear. And he loves them back. Without each other, they would already be dead. And I think, at one time or another, without you, they would have been dead as well. They care for you too, Dash.\u201d</p><p>He breathed in deeply. It was the sound of a man fighting to deny what he already knew was the truth.</p><p>\u201cI would die without you,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI\u2019d be crazy with terror if there were six of you to defend. Not to mention crazy, period.\u201d There was a vein of amusement in the final sentence. She took his hand and moved it to her abdomen. \u201cDid I ever tell you, Dash, how much I dream of babies? Lots of babies. I wanted at least three, more if I could. And if what you say is true about your semen counteracting birth control, do you think you might not have plenty of little girls to protect and go crazy over? What will you do then? Stop having sex with me?\u201d</p><p>She saw the pure terror that glittered in his eyes for just a second. Raw, blistering hot fear as his fingers flexed against her abdomen.</p><p>\u201cGod help me,\u201d he groaned. \u201cYou will make me crazy, Elizabeth.\u201d He moved, gripping her hand and drawing it down to his erection. \u201cJust the thought of making babies with you drives me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not crazy, Dash,\u201d she murmured as her fingers gripped the steel-hard weight of his bulging cock.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s horny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, does that to me too.\u201d He lifted his hips for her, pushing his cock against her fingers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Elizabeth.\u201d He drew her to him, his lips brushing against hers. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have taken it out on you. I shouldn\u2019t have been an asshole. I don\u2019t ever want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d She smirked, her fingers flexing on his cock. \u201cI can see I didn\u2019t hurt you, either.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cWell, took a while to pull my balls out of my throat, but after I got them back in place I figured I could count myself lucky.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth pushed the blankets back from his body, revealing the erect flesh straining between his thighs. She was wet and eager for him. She was always eager for him. Her pussy stayed slick and ready, her body always humming for his touch.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He groaned as she began to straddle his body, her head lowering to his lips once again.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Sure about what?\u201d She eased against the bursting head, feeling it nudge into the folds of flesh and tuck against the opening of her vagina.</p><p>\u201cDamn. Nothing,\u201d he panted. \u201cGod, you\u2019re so hot and ready for me. No one has ever wanted me like you do, Elizabeth. Always so sweet and hot and slick.\u201d</p><p>He spurted inside her. She loved it when he did that.</p><p>\u201cYour fault.\u201d She could barely talk now.</p><p>Elizabeth began easing down on the hard shaft, working it into the snug depths of her swollen pussy, relishing the painful pleasure that streaked into her womb. A part of her realized there might be something just slightly depraved about her. She loved that flare of pain as he entered her, or when he locked inside her. The burning blend of agonizing pleasure that sent her rocketing to orgasm.</p><p>\u201cEasy, baby.\u201d His hands gripped her hips as she lowered her head to his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo hurt me,\u201d she groaned roughly as she raked her fingers over his shoulder, remembering how good it felt when he did that to her. \u201cTake me, Dash, like you need to. Now. Don\u2019t hold back for me.\u201d</p><p>His muttered oath was thick with need. \u201cI\u2019ll hurt you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll love it.\u201d She was breathing roughly.</p><p>But still he hesitated. He worked inside her slow and easy instead, his body tight and corded with the need to hold back. She didn\u2019t need him to hold back. She let her teeth grip the flesh of his shoulder lightly, then gathered herself, forcing the muscles of her pussy to relax a second before she impaled herself hard and fast on his shaft. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She bit him. God, she knew why he did that now. It was agonizing. Savage. He howled beneath her, a primal sound of such pleasure that her body shuddered with it as her pussy convulsed in spasmodic ripples of sensation. Her orgasm was instantaneous. Too much sensation. Too much fiery pleasure inside the swollen depths of her already sensitized pussy.</p><p>His cock was spurting hard inside her now, as though the ultra-tight grip had signaled something inside that hard muscle that regulated the flow of the pre-come. He was moaning hard beneath her, his hands gripping her thighs, his hips bucking against her, stroking through the violence of her orgasm and building another as they cried out at the intensity of feeling.</p><p>She was biting him hard. She knew she was and couldn\u2019t help it. Her hips writhed, twisting against the hard throb of his cock lodged inside her as his thighs bunched and he began to thrust in and out in powerful lunges as he lubricated her further, intensified sensation and threw her headlong into her next release.</p> <p>Dash was only seconds behind her. She felt him swell, lock inside her, then spill his semen deep inside her body.</p><p>\u201cLizbeth.\u201d Minutes, hours later he shifted beneath her as his cock began to slowly lose its desperate swelling inside her. \u201cHoney, let go of my shoulder.\u201d</p><p>His voice was thick, replete, but edged with amusement.</p><p>Elizabeth tasted blood. Gasping, she drew back, her gaze flying to his in horror.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He laid his fingers against her lips as regret began to spill from her. \u201cI loved it, baby. Bloodthirsty little thing.\u201d He lifted her from him then, groaning as his cock slid free of her, her pussy kissing it loudly as it exited. \u201cSleep, woman. You\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you, Dash.\u201d She snuggled against his chest as he turned to her, his body sheltering her.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Elizabeth.\u201d He sighed roughly. \u201cMore than I\u2019ve loved anything in my life.\u201d</p><p>But the fear was back. She could hear it in his voice, feel it in the tenseness of his body. They would go after Grange soon, and she knew that it would be not only her greatest test, but Dash\u2019s as well.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>There was indeed a small army. The next morning, before the sun had risen over the cabin, Simon was back with his Ladies. Before breakfast was ready, several Feline Breeds arrived, three men claiming to be Callan Lyons\u2019 brothers-in-law, four of Mike Toler\u2019s men and a handful of soldiers packing their duffle bags fresh off a plane from the Middle East. There were over two-dozen men in all and Simon\u2019s six lusty Ladies. Dash was furious.</p><p>\u201cGet your asses right back on that plane,\u201d he was yelling at the dozen soldiers watching him dispassionately. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to come out here and I\u2019ll be damned if you\u2019ll risk your asses like this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, Major. It\u2019s not happening.\u201d The unofficial leader of the unit shook his head. \u201cTook us weeks to arrange leave without giving a proper reason. We\u2019re not going back.\u201d</p><p>Dash was cursing. Elizabeth watched from the doorway of the cabin as he raged. She hadn\u2019t seen Dash so worked up over anything. He was usually calm, holding his control tightly in check. It was more than obvious he was ready to lose it, if he hadn\u2019t already. Some of the words spilling from his lips she hadn\u2019t even imagined existed.</p><p>\u201cJonsey, are you that eager to make that new wife of yours a widow?\u201d he yelled heatedly at one of the younger men. \u201cSon of a bitch, I thought you loved that girl.\u201d</p><p>Jonsey was a tall, lanky young man. Maybe twenty-five, with wide hazel eyes and thick red hair.</p><p>\u201cI do love her, Dash.\u201d Jonsey nodded solemnly. \u201cI\u2019ve had a year with her. A year I wouldn\u2019t have if you hadn\u2019t pulled her out of that hospital they bombed. Cindy agrees with me being here. I\u2019m not going back.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth could hear Dash growling in irritation.</p><p>He turned to the man beside Jonsey. He was nearly as tall as Dash, with short, spiked brown hair and deep brown eyes. His face was lined with exhaustion and he had obviously had enough of Dash\u2019s temper.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you even start on me, Major,\u201d the soldier snapped back. \u201cI\u2019ve not slept in a week to bring my ass out here and I\u2019m not in the mood for your god complex, either. So just tell me where I can sack out for a while and then we\u2019ll discuss your plan of action when I wake up.\u201d</p> <p>He was snarly. Elizabeth perked up, as did several of Simon\u2019s Ladies. They sauntered from the house, immediately drawing attention. Eyes were bugging out of sockets as the men caught sight of them.</p><p>\u201cHell, Simon\u2019s here,\u201d one of them seemed to sigh in reverence. \u201cOh man. This is gonna be a good fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Major. I might have found someone to keep me warm.\u201d The soldier looked damned near ecstatic as one of the Ladies sidled up to him, cooing gently about his weariness.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Chase.\u201d Dash was growling now.</p><p>\u201cGive it up, Dash.\u201d Merc, the tall Feline Breed, growled back from the sidelines. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about you anymore, or about your woman. Chill out and accept the help or ease back and we\u2019ll do it ourselves. You\u2019re mated now. Mated to a woman proven to be able to conceive easily with Breed young. We can\u2019t afford to lose you or her.\u201d</p><p>Fury ignited in Dash. Elizabeth watched as his head lowered, turning as he stared at the Feline in building fury.</p><p>\u201cMy woman is not a breeder for the fucking Breeds,\u201d he snarled, his voice low, dangerous.</p><p>\u201cShe will be if you get your ass killed. Whatever Breed the Council managed to make mount her. Her and that kid. You want to risk it?\u201d Merc was only a bit larger than Dash. If it came to a fight, either man could have come out the winner. \u201cGet a handle on yourself, boy. You never were alone in this world.\u201d</p><p>He nodded to the soldiers. \u201cAnd you sure as hell aren\u2019t now. Let\u2019s all get some rest and we\u2019ll see what kind of plan you have in place. And stop growling at me. It\u2019s pissing me off.\u201d</p><p>As she watched, Elizabeth was aware of Simon moving up behind her, watching curiously.</p><p>\u201cCould get interesting now,\u201d he said softly. \u201cDash thinks he has to do everything on his own. Thinks he has to save everyone he takes under his wing. Usually manages to, too. But he doesn\u2019t accept help so well. It will be interesting to see how gracefully he accepts us poking our noses in his business.\u201d Simon sounded like he was looking forward to any fight that arose.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Dash finally snarled so violently, so furiously, Elizabeth flinched. He turned away from them and stalked away from the cabin, moving purposely into the woods surrounding it as she moved to follow him.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Simon caught her arm. \u201cGive him a few minutes to work through it first. Let\u2019s get these boys fed and bedded down for a while. They\u2019re a tired bunch. Then you can go after him.\u201d</p><p>What the hell had happened? Dash couldn\u2019t understand it for the life of him. He had fought to stay distant from the men he fought with, to do his job, keep their asses alive and go his merry way. If knowledge of what he was had leaked out while he was fighting with them he would have put every man in whatever unit he was in, in danger. The Council didn\u2019t care who they killed. But evidently he hadn\u2019t stayed distant enough. He had over two-dozen fighters standing in the clearing of the cabin awaiting orders. Orders he didn\u2019t want to give. He didn\u2019t want to lead them into his personal battle and have one of them die because of it.</p><p>Damn. He sighed wearily. He was pissed as hell, but he knew those men wouldn\u2019t leave. Not unless he did. And they would follow. They were damned good men, too. The best. As good or better than the unit he had lost in Afghanistan.</p><p>He stopped his furious trek up the mountain, pausing at a sheltered bench of land that looked down on the cabin. Tents were being pitched and voices were raised as coordination among the men began to establish itself. He knew the minute he saw the first arrivals that this mission had turned into something more than just the fight to save Elizabeth and her child. It was now a fight to establish dominance, to show the Council and those who would strike out against the Breeds in general that there was a bigger battle than they wanted to face.</p><p>There was no way Grange could anticipate over two-dozen men moving in on him. Men so adept, so well trained in every area of battle, that he didn\u2019t have a chance of fighting against them. Finally his lips quirked in amusement. Grange would fight and there was always the chance of losing one or more men in the group. Dash could do nothing but make certain they planned for everything and pray they all got through it alive. It was all he could do.</p><p>As he sat there, watching with narrowed eyes as the clearing turned into an armed camp, he watched Elizabeth leave the cabin slowly. Damn. She was like a ray of sunshine. Moving past the soldiers working around her, she headed up the mountain. She was graceful, a creature of such fluid movement and erotic design that it made his loins clench in sudden hunger. How had he ever deserved anything so beautiful to call his own? He couldn\u2019t make sense of it, but he had never wanted to fight it, either. As though he had waited all his life for that moment in the diner, his body had instantly recognized her scent, her dark eyes, her quiet strength.</p><p>She was a mate that would fight beside him and would protect her young and him, if needed, against all odds. She had proven that in her determination and quick thinking in saving Cassie. She wouldn\u2019t balk, no matter what was needed.</p><p>\u201cDone pouting yet?\u201d She moved to him, watching him in concern as he gripped her wrist and pulled her down between his thighs.</p><p>He nestled her back against his chest, wrapping his arms around her, and propped his head on her shoulder as he watched the action below them.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re damned good men,\u201d he said softly. \u201cGood fighters, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she agreed softly. \u201cThey seem to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJonsey, he has this pretty little nurse for a wife. She was hurt badly in that bombing. Lots of bleeding, in shock. I didn\u2019t think she would make it.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI kept telling her how Jonsey was on his way. She loves that boy, Elizabeth. I guilted the hell out of her. She lived because she knew she had to. Knew if Jonsey saw her like that, all bloody and broken and dead too, that he wouldn\u2019t survive it. They were married a year later. Took her that long to recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sounds very strong.\u201d</p><p>Dash nodded.</p><p>\u201cSimon and those women.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThey\u2019re like trouble waiting to happen. But they\u2019re damned good at cleaning it out and celebrating later. The man has his own personal harem devoted to his pleasure and his happiness above all things. They\u2019re dangerous as hell, and at any given time are ready to reward any man lucky enough to become deserving of their attention. But all Simon has to do is lift his finger and they\u2019re back in his arms. They love that crazy cowboy more than he deserves sometimes.\u201d</p><p>And on it went. Each man. Another adventure, another tale. He knew every facet of their personalities, what made them strong, what made them weak. What made them love or hate. Elizabeth sat against him and not for the first time, marveled at the man who had walked so calmly into her life and took it over. The man who had given her his love before he ever met her. Who had dreamed about her as he lay in a medicated stupor and woke up because he saw her crying. For the first time in her life, Elizabeth knew what love was. Not just his love for her, but his love for those men working to set up a usable camp and determined to fight by his side again. His friends. Finally, he was quiet, watching as she was, holding her close as he grunted or chuckled at some action below them. Simon\u2019s Ladies were, of course, helping. In ways that made Elizabeth blush a bright crimson. They were earthy, strong women. And Simon looked on like a proud parent as they tempted and teased the appetites of many of the men below. They steered well clear of Jonsey, though, and he made certain he steered clear of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTime to get ready,\u201d he finally sighed quietly. \u201cWe leave here tomorrow night, Elizabeth. Grange returns in a week. You sure you want to do this?\u201d</p><p>Oh, she was damned sure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure, Dash,\u201d she promised him quietly. \u201cI miss Cassie. I want it done and my daughter safe. I want it over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on then.\u201d He moved to his feet and pulled her up beside him. \u201cLet\u2019s go whip these boys into shape. We\u2019ll let Simon\u2019s Ladies take care of their lusts and then we\u2019ll start planning. We\u2019ll get him, baby, and then we\u2019ll go home.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-One</p><p>A week later Elizabeth was being dragged roughly into the house that had been rented in the small town she had run from two years before. Dash had a manacled grip on her wrist, his body was vibrating with fury and she wasn\u2019t any less pissed.</p><p>Behind them, Simon and his Ladies trailed more slowly, as did several others of the group that amassed together. The rest were at logistical points around the Grange estate or working with the two guards that had been bribed from Grange\u2019s service. She and Dash had been slipping through town, testing the determination of the men Grange had in place to catch her.</p><p>His orders to her had been precise. She knew when she slipped from the shadowed alley to be certain Grange wasn\u2019t in the car they had been watching that he would be pissed. That he would, in no uncertain terms, let her know how displeased he was. But she hadn\u2019t expected this. She had been so close. She had nearly been in the right position to check the identity of the two men when Dash had grabbed her, dragging her back into the alley and then to the car awaiting them on the other end. He had been chillingly silent, angrier than she had ever seen him.</p> <p>\u201cDammit, Dash, stop dragging me around.\u201d She tugged on his hold as he pulled her up the staircase. She was fighting tooth and nail, but it was follow him or be dragged. She wasn\u2019t in the mood to incur any more bruises along the way.</p><p>Dash was madder than she had ever seen him. Stone-cold enraged rather than growling mad. His expression was savage, his lips pulled back in a silent snarl as he glanced back at her, his golden eyes glowing with liquid fire. She was almost trembling in fear.</p><p>When he reached their bedroom door, he opened it, jerked her inside and turned to close it with deadly silence. The snick of the lock turning caused her to flinch.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be manhandled this way by you,\u201d she charged him fiercely, trying to ignore the weakness in her knees as he faced her.</p><p>\u201cTake your clothes off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she snapped. \u201cSo you can show me my place? Under your body? I was safe, Dash.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou broke formation. You disobeyed orders. Do you know what I would have done to Jonsey, or Chase, or any of the others who so blatantly threatened not just the mission but also their own lives?\u201d</p><p>His voice was deadly.</p><p>Elizabeth shook her head. \u201cI was safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a fool. You were being tricked, Elizabeth. There was another vehicle pulling in no more than ten feet from you. You were nearly seen,\u201d he told her quietly, the dark, harsh timber of his voice making her tremble.</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have seen me,\u201d she argued furiously. \u201cI was being careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if they had?\u201d he asked her with deadly calm. \u201cIf they had managed to take you or, God forbid, just kill you and have it done with. What then?\u201d</p><p>She blinked up at him, horror filling her. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI was hidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you had moved forward so much as another inch, you would have been seen,\u201d he said, his voice still throbbing with fury as he jerked his shirt over his head. \u201cYou risked my men, but even more, you risked my mate. Possibly my child, and everything we\u2019ve planned for, Elizabeth. Now take off your clothes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She backed away from him, the horror of what she had nearly done still vibrating through her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dash. I was being careful. I just thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you to think on this mission unless it went to shit real fast,\u201d he informed her coldly, his hand going to his pants. \u201cNow take your fucking clothes off before I rip them off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like this.\u201d She shook her head desperately. \u201cNot while you\u2019re so mad at me, Dash.\u201d</p><p>He stilled. \u201cMad at you?\u201d Agony resonated in his voice now. \u201cYou think this is mad, Elizabeth? This isn\u2019t mad, baby. If I were mad I\u2019d be stripping the hide off your bones with every insult I could come up with. I\u2019m not mad. You scared me out of ten years of my life. Now take those fucking clothes off.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop undressing after casting her that first, incredulous look. Before her eyes, he dropped his weapons, his boots, his clothes, standing before her gloriously naked and aroused. Adrenaline was still pumping through her body, fear and remnants of anger and a sudden excitement that shocked her. He was going to take her whether she wanted him to or not. Like a traitor her body heated, her pussy clenching in hunger. She backed away from him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she snapped, her gaze flickering to the straining length of his cock before going back to his face.</p><p>He smirked as he inhaled deeply. \u201cI\u2019m going to mount you and I\u2019m going to show you who\u2019s boss in this little endeavor, baby. A lesson you won\u2019t soon forget. Now take your clothes off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoss?\u201d She lifted her brow with what she knew was haughty disdain as she watched him carefully. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Dash.\u201d</p><p>His hand had fallen to his cock, his fingers gripping the abundant flesh and stroking it lazily. The engorged head was glistening with moisture and throbbing wildly with arousal.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it was driven home relatively hard tonight that you think you can get away with anything in this relationship,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou continually tempt my possessiveness by hugging around on my soldiers and generally babying them. Simpering and so damned sweet it\u2019s enough to give me a toothache. But I handle it,\u201d he stated with a vast amount of male pride. \u201cI handle it well, I think. But I\u2019ll be damned if you\u2019ll be allowed to disregard my orders on a mission. Not now, not ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again.\u201d But she knew it likely would. She wasn\u2019t stupid. She was used to being in control, not following someone else. \u201cYou can fuck me after you\u2019ve calmed down.\u201d</p><p>He smiled slowly, rather coldly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He began to stalk her then. The bedroom was large, but it wasn\u2019t that damned large. She didn\u2019t have a hope of escaping him. The thought of that sent her pussy convulsing, spilling the thick cream along the plump curves and preparing her for his penetration.</p><p>She moved to the edge of the room, her eyes darting anxiously from side to side as she tried to find an escape route. There weren\u2019t any, and Dash was getting closer by the second. As he neared her, she jumped to move. His hands hooked in her shirt, ripping it from her body. She turned on him furiously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of you tearing my clothes off me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen undress.\u201d He was calm, determined. \u201cDo it now. Take your punishment like a good girl, baby.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed on him. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged easily. \u201cThen I\u2019ll tear every shred of cloth off your body and buy you more when you need them.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth gritted her teeth in fury. She was closer to the door now, her only chance. She turned and ran for it. Unfortunately, Dash was faster. Before she could escape he was on her. Hooking his arm around her waist, he dragged her to the bed, threw her on it then followed her. Rolling to her stomach, she had every intention of escaping. Before she could do more than come to her knees, he had her again. Fighting, twisting, she fought him with every breath as he curled his fingers in the waistband of her leggings and tugged them over her hips.</p><p>Screaming out in frustration she kicked back at him. He rewarded her with a chuckle as he pushed the material to her knees and left them there. She was twisting against him when his hand suddenly landed on the rounded curve of her bottom. Shocked, she stilled for a second. In the next she was reaching back, clawing at him, cursing him until he caught her hands in one of his and held them to the middle of her back.</p><p>Struggling was getting her nowhere. But worse, it was making her hotter, making her pussy cream furiously as his hand landed on her rump again. She jerked in amazement.</p><p>\u201cAre you spanking me?\u201d she screamed out furiously. \u201cSon of a bitch, I\u2019ll kill you when I get up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe I won\u2019t let you up.\u201d His hand landed again.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a hard smack, but enough to warm her ass, to make her wiggle in protest. It was making her pussy blaze. Her breasts were swollen with arousal now, her nipples hard little points that brushed against the sheet, sensitizing further with each move against the material.</p><p>\u201cDash, I swear, you\u2019ll pay for this.\u201d She meant to sound tough, threatening; instead it came out more like a moan, a sound of hunger.</p><p>The small, hot smacks to her ass were making her crazy. Being pinned beneath him, helpless, on fire, was destroying her. Both half moon curves were attended to, his hand striking her, burning her until she was writhing beneath him, but whether in pain or pleasure even she couldn\u2019t say for certain. She gasped as his hand pushed between her thighs, his fingers smoothing over the syrupy slickness of her bald cunt. Every nerve in the swollen flesh pulsed to life. Her clit throbbed in impatient demand as she whimpered against the small caresses he stroked around it. Pulling his hand back, he gathered the slick essence, smoothing it back along her pussy to the cleft of her buttocks. Elizabeth flinched as his fingers pressed against her anal opening, pushing the silken natural lubrication into the tiny hole.</p><p>\u201cDash.\u201d An incredible flare of aroused pleasure streaked through her as the tip of his finger pierced the little opening and muffled her small protest.</p><p>It felt too good. The tip of his finger moved gently inside her, stroking deeper and deeper until the full length of it was buried in her backside. Elizabeth was shocked. She had never been touched there, never caressed or penetrated in such a manner. She moved back tentatively, trying to hold back the groan of pleasure as his finger slid out, then back in, tunneling inside her with carnal intent.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth.\u201d She tensed; his voice was crooning, deliberately gentle. That was never a good sign.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She was gasping as another finger joined the first. She was raised perfectly for him now, her shoulders flat to the bed, her butt elevated for his decadent exploration as he held her hands secured at the small of her back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck your ass, baby,\u201d he told her, shocking her, heating her blood with the sensual promise. \u201cHard and deep, Elizabeth. I\u2019m going to show you what happens when you rouse the animal inside me. I\u2019ll show you, baby, not to ever put yourself in danger like that again.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened as she trembled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt me, Dash.\u201d Was he going to punish her with pain now?</p><p>His fingers slid free of the tight channel. A second later a resounding crack to her ass had her jerking furiously.</p><p>\u201cHave I ever hurt you?\u201d he snapped as he shifted behind her. \u201cHave I, Elizabeth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She moaned, feeling his cock slide along the cleft of her ass. He was thick and full and she knew there wasn\u2019t a chance in hell he was going to manage to work it inside her. It wasn\u2019t possible. His fingers returned to their previous work, sliding through the juices easing from her vagina and spreading them back to her anal entrance as he worked his fingers slowly inside her.</p><p>\u201cDamn. You\u2019re tight here,\u201d he whispered as she clenched on him. \u201cI bet, Elizabeth, that when my cock shoots that lubrication up your sweet ass, I\u2019ll slide right in. You\u2019ll be all nice and hot and so tight around my dick I\u2019ll go crazy with it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She trembled at the explicit words. She was fighting just to breathe. It was too sensual, too depraved, being held down as she was while Dash eased her ultra-tight anal muscles. Long minutes later, she whimpered. The bloated head of his cock pressed against the sensitive entrance as Dash tucked it tight into the small opening he had created. Immediately a hot, surging pulse of the pre-come shot inside her.</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d Dash released her hands as his own smoothed down her back, gentling her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. Just relax for me.\u201d</p><p>Her anus heated, sensitized. Suddenly, it seemed as though a million little nerves were whipping to life and they were pleading for his cock to surge inside her. The muscles began to loosen marginally, and she felt the head of his shaft sink in a bit more. For each small penetration, the hot fluid jetted inside her, easing her, making a way for him to work the thick head past the tight little entrance. She was on fire. She could feel her flesh stretching around his, cupping the throbbing head of his cock as the Breed fluid pulsed inside her, forcing her body to stretch, to accommodate the thick erection sliding into her untried anus.</p><p>\u201cDash.\u201d Her fingers gripped the blankets; her ass raised for him as she trembled beneath him. She was</p><p>scared. The sheer domination of the act was overwhelming her as nothing he had ever done before had. She felt taken in ways she could have never imagined.</p><p>\u201cNever again, Elizabeth,\u201d he said as the head of his cock finally slipped in fully, popping through the tight anal ring as she bucked, crying out beneath him. \u201cNever disobey me in such a manner again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She would have promised him anything then. What was more, she knew he would make certain she stuck to it.</p><p>The head of his cock was embedded in her now, throbbing, spurting inside her, filling her rectum with a heat she didn\u2019t know if she could survive. His hands held her hips steady, his big body looming over her as he began to work the thick tip in and out of her. He was sinking deeper with each small thrust, stretching her further, creating a blooming fire in the depths of her ass that she could have never imagined possible.</p><p>With each ripple of movement inside her, the small channel accepted more and more of his erection until finally, she screamed out in pleasure/pain as the full length slid inside the tight depths. Elizabeth could feel his pelvis pressing into the cheeks of her rear, his hands gripping her hips, holding her tight against him as several more silky pulses of fluid filled her rectum. His bigger body was covering her now, his thighs holding her in place.</p><p>\u201cThis is mine,\u201d he growled in her ear. \u201cMine to protect. To fuck. To love. You will never again endanger it in such a way. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Elizabeth nearly shrieked.</p><p>She was impaled in a way she could have never imagined possible, her muscles easing around him just enough to send hard, fiery arcs of agonizing pleasure straight to her womb.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you now,\u201d he told her softly, though his voice vibrated with a lust-driven hunger she had never heard from him before. \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck your sweet ass, Elizabeth. Because it\u2019s mine. Mine to fuck. Mine to shelter. You will never again forget to take care of what\u2019s mine.\u201d He was snarling as he began to move inside her, a deep, growling sound of carnal greed that sent shivers racing over her flesh. Then she knew nothing but his cock driving up her ass. He pulled back until only the head remained before surging forward again, stretching her, burning her as she bucked beneath him, swept away by sensations she couldn\u2019t imagine fighting.</p><p>She could feel the channel stretching, straining around him as each thrust sent another burning pulse of fluid jetting inside her, making each stroke easier to take, each impalement driving her closer to the brink of a release she knew would terrify her. He was groaning at her ear, fucking her with a hard rhythm, throwing her closer to orgasm as the coil of pleasure/pain began to tighten in her womb. Elizabeth couldn\u2019t move, could do nothing but tremble under his heavy weight, crying out at each penetration, feeling herself being sucked into her own destruction. Streaking arcs of sensations tore through her body with each thrust, driving her higher, hotter, until it reached its zenith. She tightened around him, hearing his desperate moan as his thrusts increased. The slap of flesh, the sucking echo of hard strokes into the well lubricated tunnel of her anus and her own desperate, strangled screams heralded her orgasm.</p><p>Like a supernova, she exploded. White heat filled her as she felt Dash\u2019s teeth grip her shoulder, felt him suddenly swell, terrifying her with the building pressure as she climaxed beneath him. Suddenly, she was climbing again. She could feel the fierce swelling pressing into the thin wall of flesh between her anus and her cunt, filling her pussy, causing the muscles to ripple against one another, as an exacting pressure tightened around her clit and she rocketed into oblivion.</p><p>It was devastating. The hard, agonizing pleasure was consuming her, ripping through her, streaking with hard, powerful shudders through her body as she bucked and writhed beneath him, her body consumed by a release that shocked her so thoroughly, ripped through her mind so swiftly, that before Dash had finished filling her rectum with his hot seed, darkness overtook her.</p><p>Long minutes later, Dash felt his cock ease, felt the agonizing heat and tight grip around his flesh relax and he pulled free wearily. He was more than aware that the final, violent orgasm that had ripped through Elizabeth had left her unconscious. Damn. He\u2019d never fucked a woman into a faint in his life. He didn\u2019t like having his mate be the first.</p><p>He dragged his body wearily from the bed and padded into the bathroom. There he cleaned himself, then wet a clean washrag and returned to the bed. He cleaned Elizabeth carefully, wiping away the semen and lubricating fluid that dampened her buttocks and thighs before spreading the delicate cheeks and washing the cleft.</p><p>Traces of his semen still spilled from the reddened little entrance. His eyes closed, remembering the brief glance he had allowed himself of her flesh stretching around him, hugging his cock like a tight leather glove and making him crazy to fill her with his seed. But he had intended to pull free instead. He had never meant to allow the swelling knot to anchor him in the tender hole. It had been her climax. When she tightened on him, holding him inside her as she climaxed, his brain had exploded. Before he could pull free, his cock had locked inside her, spilling his release into the blistering depth of her anus.</p><p>He was completely exhausted now. The emotional and physical demands had taken a toll on his body, and he couldn\u2019t wait to lie down beside her and sleep. Returning to the bathroom he dumped the cloth into the basket there and returned to their bed. Pulling her into his arms, he grinned at the grumpy, less than pleased sound of her sleepy groan, but she snuggled into his chest, breathed out softly and continued to sleep.</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby,\u201d he sighed, kissing her head.</p><p>He loved her, but he swore if she ever did anything so stupid again, he was going to blister her butt with the palm of his hand. On the other hand, another scare like that would give him a stroke. Grange hadn\u2019t been in the car Elizabeth had been checking. He had been in the one pulling in behind it. And he was watching for Elizabeth. He had been within a second of having her. The terror that had filled him when he realized that had been unlike anything he had ever known before. His arms tightened around her. What the hell would he do if he lost her?</p> <p>Chapter Thirty-Two</p><p>\u201cRemember the plan.\u201d Dash cast Elizabeth a hard look two nights later as the team prepared to invade Grange\u2019s estate. \u201cWe go in quietly. Grange will be in the study. Elizabeth, Merc and I will slip in, get the files, disable Grange and be on our merry way. Should be simple and easy. No problem. Let\u2019s not create any.\u201d</p><p>Three of Simon\u2019s Ladies had managed to catch Grange\u2019s attention earlier that evening and were now within the mansion, occupying the bastard until they could get in. Grange liked playing in his study, from what his young mistress had said. Her contact with them minutes before had confirmed he was now in the room with the women.</p><p>There were plenty of outside guards to keep Simon and the other three women satisfied hunting. The unit of soldiers that had come in to help was stationed outside the perimeters, ready to back them up along with the Tyler brothers and the other Feline Breed, Tanner.</p><p>Nods accompanied Dash\u2019s orders, especially Elizabeth. She had no intentions of pissing Dash off again where a mission was concerned. Not that she hadn\u2019t enjoyed the anal adventure he had given her, but the intensity of her orgasm wasn\u2019t anything she was ready to experience again any time soon.</p><p>\u201cMerc, you\u2019re with me and Elizabeth. Let\u2019s keep this as clean as possible.\u201d</p><p>It was much cleaner than Elizabeth had anticipated. The two guards Dash\u2019s men had bribed made certain the path they were using into the estate\u2019s mansion was clear. The back door was unlocked. They moved into the darkened back hallway quietly and made their way to the foyer at the front of the house. Checking the well-lit area, Elizabeth watched as Dash turned to Merc and motioned him up the curving staircase. When the other man had made it safely to the top, Elizabeth followed suit. Joining Merc on the landing, they both stood ready as Dash moved silently up the steps as well. Timed perfectly. They stood tense, expectant, as the guard made his round then, shuffling drowsily through the foyer and into the kitchen.</p><p>As he disappeared, Dash gave the signal to move forward. The upstairs was a series of hallways and closed doors, with Grange\u2019s study occupying the middle suite. They paused at the door, listening carefully at the tinkling laughter and Grange\u2019s smooth, cultured voice from inside. Weapons ready, Dash knocked quietly. A careful pattern of small thumps that first resulted in silence, then a furious curse from Grange as the three women obviously made their move. The panel was jerked open quickly by Stephanie. Her eyes were cold, her expression bloodthirsty as they stepped into the room.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth.\u201d Grange was sitting behind his big oak desk, hands lying carefully on top of the smooth, polished surface as Danica stood behind him, a knife at his throat. \u201cHow interesting. And I see you have friends with you.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth stilled her shudder of revulsion as she stared at the monster who had hunted her and her daughter for over two years. He was carefully groomed, his thick brown hair sweeping back from a face that could have been passably handsome if it weren\u2019t for the jagged scar sweeping across one cheek and the glint of cold mockery in his hazel eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, she does,\u201d Dash answered with an edge of amusement as Merc closed the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cMercury Warrant.\u201d Grange watched the big Breed with a glimmer of fascination. \u201cHow interesting.\u201d He turned back to Elizabeth. \u201cI guess you finally figured out what a little gold mine you conceived, darling. Dane wasn\u2019t so pleased with the pup after all, was he?\u201d</p><p>Her daughter wasn\u2019t a pup. Elizabeth stilled her fury as she aimed her gun at his head. \u201cI want those files.\u201d She was amazed at the veil of ice that spread through her body. Her soul. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Grange\u2019s eyes narrowed as his gaze flickered to Dash.</p><p>\u201cShe could bring you millions. But not without help. I have the Breed semen...\u201d</p><p>Dash laughed. \u201cWhat you have is a joke compared to what I have.\u201d He smirked. He turned, jerking the sleeveless T-shirt he wore over his shoulder to reveal the shadow mark. When he turned back, Grange appeared suitably impressed.</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d he breathed. \u201cMartaine swore the Wolves had been killed. I guess he was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d Dash sounded unconcerned, but Elizabeth had detected the shadow of pain that edged his words. \u201cGive us the files you have, Grange.\u201d</p><p>The other man\u2019s thin lips quirked as Danica moved carefully away from him, content to let Dash now handle the control of their enemy.</p><p>Grange sighed. \u201cI think not.\u201d He smirked as he looked between Dash and Elizabeth. \u201cIs she breeding yet?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elizabeth smiled. \u201cLet me kill him, Dash,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe can find the papers later.\u201d</p><p>Grange\u2019s gaze flickered in concern.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, baby.\u201d Dash sighed. \u201cI told you, if he cooperates he can live. We need the papers more than we need his death.\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth shrugged. The look she gave the other man warned him, though, that she would relish the chance to kill him.</p><p>Grange cleared his throat. \u201cAh well. It was a good plan if I could have pulled it off.\u201d He shrugged carelessly as he nodded toward the safe Danica had found while checking behind portraits and prints that hung on the wall. \u201cThe file is in the safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCombination.\u201d Dash moved to the metal door. \u201cAnd don\u2019t fuck with me, Grange. Elizabeth will take your head off your shoulders with that gun. It was all I could do to convince her to do this my way.\u201d</p><p>She fingered the trigger of the gun as she begged Grange with her eyes to give her an excuse, any excuse, to pull the trigger. He gave them the combination instead. Elizabeth kept her gaze on Grange, watching carefully as she listened to Merc communicating with the men outside and Dash punching in the numbers to the digital combination. She was expecting an alarm to sound. Was praying Grange would give her an excuse to kill him.</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Dash\u2019s voice had her grimacing.</p> <p>\u201cHe has you leashed. Interesting.\u201d Grange smirked. \u201cTell me, Elizabeth, what\u2019s it like to fuck an animal?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth snorted. \u201cI have no idea. Let\u2019s call your mistress in here and ask her.\u201d</p><p>His expression tightened as anger flashed in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth, that trigger isn\u2019t something to play with. It\u2019s damned touchy,\u201d Dash warned her as he moved carefully behind her. \u201cMerc, watch our buddy there while we go over this file. I need to make certain everything we need is here.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth turned to Dash, almost missing Grange\u2019s sneer of satisfaction. She watched as he opened the file. The first page had him stiffening. Several more pages later and he turned haunted, shocked eyes back to her.</p><p>\u201cMartaine did enjoy his little experiments,\u201d Grange sighed with smug amusement. \u201cI thought it very ingenious actually. The creatures have no soul I\u2019m told. Vicious killers who enjoy playing with their prey. I had high hopes Cassie would live up to her DNA. He made certain he gave it every chance, of course.\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth felt her heart explode in her chest as she moved over to Dash.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth.\u201d She stopped as she saw the grief in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI want to see it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI want to know what they did to my baby.\u201d</p><p>She moved until she could read the notes Martaine had made.</p><p>Genetic splicing of the Coyote and Wolf DNA was successful and not nearly as difficult as I first surmised. I have created enough of the unique sperm to ensure the chance of conception with the right female. Dane Colder seems more than interested in my little experiment. His sterility makes him a viable partner in this, as does his belief that a man should kill if necessary and train his children to take what they want. It will be interesting, watching the growth of the child. I can only hope it\u2019s male.</p><p>Three months later</p><p>The in-vitro process was more successful than I had hoped. I wonder if Ms. Colder is aware of the little abomination growing in her womb. All initial test results from the amniocentesis shows the DNA has held. I\u2019ll have to be certain to be there at the birth to perform all tests on the infant myself.</p><p>Elizabeth made it through the first page before she stared up at Dash in horror. They couldn\u2019t let Cassie know. Couldn\u2019t allow this information to ever become public knowledge. Already the news was littered with rumors of the Coyote experiments. Human animals, experiments that had finally given the scientists the killers they had been working to create. So far, none had been found, but the lab reports, training notes and scientific files attested to the fact that they existed. Cold-blooded, as soulless as their animal cousins and glorying in the blood they could spill. It would destroy Cassie if she ever learned she was part of the creatures the Council had created.</p> <p>\u201cStephanie, you and Gloria secure the exit out,\u201d Dash ordered the other woman. \u201cMerc, contact the men outside and make certain the guards are disabled. Danica, tie that bastard up before we leave.\u201d</p><p>Grange sneered humorously. \u201cI\u2019ll be certain to follow her maturity, Elizabeth,\u201d he told her coldly. \u201cOnce that information gets out, there\u2019s no way you can hide it from her. No way you can stop her DNA from shaping her. She has no soul. She\u2019s a corruptible little shell, nothing more. A bitch to breed the perfect son.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth aimed the gun in her hand. She saw Cassie, so sweet and loving, her soul shining brightly in her eyes, in her laughter, in her love for everyone around her. She saw the strength it had taken the little girl to rise above what this monster had already done to her and she wanted to scream out at the cruelty, the monstrous lack of decency it had taken to do what he had tried.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth?\u201d Dash stood behind her, not stopping her, no censure in his voice, only love and understanding. \u201cHe\u2019s not worth it, baby. We know better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll destroy her,\u201d she whispered hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cNot if we don\u2019t let him. Cassie\u2019s stronger than he is.\u201d</p><p>Danica stood to the side, watching the scene carefully as she held the length of rope Merc had brought along to restrain Grange.</p><p>Elizabeth turned to Dash. As she did, from the corner of her eye, she saw Grange move. His hand whipped under the desk, a gun emerging, pointing toward her, fury lighting his face. Elizabeth smiled as she lifted her arm just as quickly, in a split second, aiming her weapon as her finger tightened on the trigger. Grange would never hurt anyone else. She saw surprise flash in his eyes the second the bullet buried dead center between his eyes even as his own weapon discharged. Fire seared her chest, took her breath, causing her legs to buckle as Dash screamed out her name. She collapsed in his arms, her gaze going to the rapidly spreading stain across her shirt. She raised her gaze to Dash, agony searing her soul at the horror in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cProtect my baby,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cGod no. Elizabeth, don\u2019t you fucking die on me!\u201d Dash screamed as he lowered her to the floor. She could hear Merc yelling out orders in his comm. link, felt Danica press a cloth hard to the wound, but she could feel ice spreading through her body. Her breath hitched as pain seared her heart.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d She fought to hold back her tears. \u201cForever, Dash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerc, get that ambulance here now. Have Chase contact Mike and meet us at the hospital. Have the men pull back. All of them. Goddammit, get her some help.\u201d</p><p>He was holding her, rocking her. She felt his arms around her, felt the dark edges of cold peace shifting at the corner of her mind. Dash would have to ease Cassie\u2019s fears now. He could protect her. She had killed the monster. She had made certain Cassie would never know.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth. Stay with me.\u201d Dash\u2019s voice was fierce as he picked her up in his arms, rushing from the room. Sirens were echoing in the distance, shouted orders filling her head. \u201cIf you love me, if you love Cassie, then you stay with me, damn you. If you love that baby you\u2019re carrying in your womb now, then by God you\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>She blinked up at him. His gaze sliced down to her.</p><p>\u201cMy child, Elizabeth. You\u2019re carrying my child. Do you really want it to die as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried weakly. She could feel the cold spreading through her, the blood pumping from her chest. \u201cNo. Dash. Dash...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay with me, Elizabeth.\u201d He was running down the stairs, Danica at his side, somehow managing to hold the makeshift tourniquet to her breast.</p><p>The foyer was chaos, a dizzying rush of color and pain and Dash\u2019s voice yelling at her, begging her. And she fought. She fought, but the crashing waves of dark ice were covering her, slipping through her mind, carrying her away. Her last thought was of Dash. His touch, his gentleness, and the price he had paid for letting her close. He had lost the protection he had kept around himself so long. His protection and now the child he had dreamed of. Like Elizabeth, he had lost it all...</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Three</p><p>One Week Later</p><p>\u201cRemember, you have to be quiet.\u201d The hospital door opened and Dash eased in, carrying the somber, frightened little girl who clutched her new teddy bear with desperate hands. Elizabeth opened her eyes groggily, her heart swelling in her chest as she saw her baby for the first time in nearly a month. Dash held Cassie against his broad chest, his golden-brown gaze meeting hers with warmth and love as he carried her child to her.</p><p>\u201cMomma.\u201d Her voice was whisper-thin as tears sparkled in her eyes. Dash brought her to the chair that sat by the bed, settled into it and let Cassie lay her head next to her mother\u2019s on the pillow of the hospital bed.</p><p>Elizabeth couldn\u2019t contain her tears. They fell from her eyes as she turned to the little girl, reaching up painfully so she could sink her fingers into Cassie\u2019s curls as a thin little arm curled around the top of her head.</p><p>It had been so long since she had felt Cassie\u2019s warmth, saw her innocent little face and knew in her mother\u2019s heart that her baby was safe. The hellish events of the week past was a recurring nightmare, her struggle to breathe, disjointed memories of agonizing pain and bright operating lights as surgeons rushed around her.</p><p>Thankfully, the bullet hadn\u2019t caused any lasting damage, though it had been close. She had been lucky, she was told. Very lucky. As was the child resting safely in her womb. Despite the terror of those conscious moments, she had lived and would heal.</p><p>\u201cHow is my baby?\u201d she whispered weakly. \u201cMomma missed you, Cassie.\u201d</p><p>Cassie sniffed back her low sobs as she nodded faintly. \u201cI missed you, Momma. I was so afraid you wouldn\u2019t come back. That I would be all alone and scared for forever. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth lifted her gaze as Dash smoothed his hand over Cassie\u2019s hair. Elizabeth knew he had been the one to tell Cassie of her mother\u2019s accident and that she would be confined to the hospital for a while. Exhaustion had sapped her body before the wound, making her healing take progressively longer. But she would be leaving the hospital soon. In a few days. Though the doctors warned her she would have to take it easy.</p><p>\u201cHey, beautiful.\u201d Dash touched her cheek as she gazed over at him. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep her away. She\u2019s as stubborn as her mother is.\u201d</p><p>His voice was rich and gentle, nothing like the hoarse, pain-filled tone he had used to scream at her as the darkness flowed over her the night she had been shot. She could still remember the horror that had echoed in his ragged howls as the darkness closed over her. She didn\u2019t want to ever hear such pain coming from him again.</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d She smiled sleepily. She was sleeping a lot. The doctors had assured her it would help her heal. \u201cI get to leave soon.\u201d She couldn\u2019t wait to sleep in his arms again, to feel him holding her, loving her through the night.</p><p>He stayed with her as much as he could at the hospital. When he wasn\u2019t there, Dawn or Sherra, who had come from the Breed Compound with Cassie, stayed with her instead while guards waited outside the room. No chances were being taken with either her or Cassie\u2019s protection.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cMomma?\u201d Cassie raised her head. \u201cDash said I\u2019m going to have a brother or sister. Am I?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth smiled, fighting to hold her eyes opened. She had missed Cassie so desperately, she hated to fall asleep on her.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she sighed sleepily. \u201cYou like that idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Her head bobbed swiftly. \u201cWe should celebrate with chocolate, though. I told Dash we need a big ole chocolate cake, just like the one Simon brought me the other day. It was all kinds of chocolate.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elizabeth winced, frowning over at Dash\u2019s chagrined expression. \u201cSimon, huh?\u201d</p><p>She felt sorry for Cassie\u2019s babysitters. There was nothing like chocolate to keep her running at full speed for hours on end.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. He\u2019s really nice. And he doesn\u2019t mind tea parties, either. Him and his Ladies had tea with me twice.\u201d Cassie stared down at her with all seriousness, as though the man she had been having tea with wasn\u2019t the same man who had hacked his way through six guards as he heard Dash\u2019s howls shatter the night.</p> <p>Elizabeth fought the weak laughter building in her chest. Lord, she would have loved to see that one. Her eyes drifted closed a second before she fought to open them once again. And there was Dash, watching her, loving her. Her heart swelled with emotion at the thought.</p><p>\u201cCome on, pumpkin. Kiss Momma asleep and head outside with Merc and Simon. I\u2019ll be right out,\u201d</p><p>Dash finally told Cassie softly as Elizabeth\u2019s eyes fluttered sleepily. Cassie smacked a timid kiss to Elizabeth\u2019s cheek before she jumped down from Dash\u2019s lap and headed to the door.</p><p>Dash turned back to her, his eyes dark with concern as he leaned close, touching her cheek gently.</p><p>\u201cDoing okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat.\u201d She had to keep her eyes open. Had to stare into his wonderful gaze as long as she could.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned cold at night,\u201d he sighed. She could see the effects of his sleeplessness. \u201cBut everything is arranged. When you\u2019re released we\u2019ll stay at the Breed compound until you\u2019re strong enough, then we\u2019ll head home. I have a place...\u201d He watched her carefully. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice little house, Elizabeth. Big enough for a family, not too far from town, but we\u2019ll be safe there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as we\u2019re together, Dash,\u201d she whispered. Nothing else mattered to her.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He lowered his head then, his lips whispering over hers. \u201cI love you, baby.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as her eyes drifted closed. \u201cLove you...mate. Forever.\u201d</p> <p>Dash left the hospital, catching Cassie up in his arms as she threw herself at him. She had barely let him out of her sight since the morning after Elizabeth\u2019s surgery. She cried if he left without her, and Dawn said the little girl would sit at the window, watching the road with a desperation that broke all their hearts until he returned to the hotel.</p><p>He hugged her close, feeling her tremble in his arms as he carried her out of the hospital. She was quieter since Grange\u2019s death. Almost as though she were expecting something more to happen now. Expecting a kick that would once again tumble her into the nightmare of the past two years.</p><p>\u201cDo you still love me, Dash?\u201d The surprising question was whispered in his ear as he stepped into the elevator.</p><p>He looked down at her head as the doors slid closed. \u201cOf course, Cassie, why wouldn\u2019t I? I told you, you\u2019re my little girl now too. That won\u2019t change.\u201d</p><p>She sighed as though in relief. \u201cCan I call you daddy now, Dash?\u201d she asked him as her head rose from his shoulder, her eyes staring back at him with such warmth, such love, that he knew Cassie did indeed have a soul.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He grinned, feeling as proud of himself as he had when he realized Elizabeth had conceived his child. \u201cYeah, Cassie, you can indeed call me daddy now.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her to him, and knew that whatever the future brought, it wouldn\u2019t bring the killer Grange and Martaine had dreamed of. He would make damned certain of it.</p><p>Everything is okay, Cassie, just like I told you.</p> <p>Cassie sat alone in the bedroom weeks later, watching the soft misty form of the fairy as she sat on the side of her bed. The fairy had been there when the other man had killed her father. Not her daddy. Her daddy was Dash. Dane had been her father, but he hadn\u2019t been nice to her like Dash was. But it was then that the fairy had come. Urging Cassie to be quiet, to be calm, that her momma would come and that everything would be okay. She had stayed with her ever since, always promising her that everything would be okay. But Cassie was still scared.</p><p>\u201cMy Momma is okay. That\u2019s the best thing,\u201d Cassie said, even though she could feel her chest aching that funny way when she wanted to cry but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Cassie. Are you worried again? The fairy always knew when she was.</p><p>\u201cWill I be bad?\u201d Cassie whispered the words as the ever-present fear grew within her. That\u2019s up to you, Cassie. The fairy whispered as she reached out, touching her cheek with a feather-soft caress. You were blessed with light and given life for a reason. It\u2019s up to you how you live that life. The fairy didn\u2019t always make sense but she understood enough to know that it appeared to be her choice. Her Momma said she was a good little girl, and Cassie was determined to always be a good girl. She hugged her new teddy bear closer. It was bigger than the last one. Fluffy and warm and she didn\u2019t feel so alone when the fairy left her side more often these days. Besides, Dash said if she got scared then all she had to do was call to him and Momma. They always came to her, sat with her when she was frightened or when the nightmares were too bad.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t tell Momma why the nightmares were bad. She couldn\u2019t even tell Dash. She hadn\u2019t been born to be a good girl, the man with the scar had laughed at her when he told her that. She had been born to be an animal. To be a killer. But all she wanted to be was a good girl. Cassie, didn\u2019t I promise you that everything would be okay? The fairy asked her then. Have I ever lied to you?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, wanting, needing to believe her.</p><p>Sleep, Cassie, the fairy whispered then, a gentle smile tilting her ghostly lips as a feeling of warmth accompanied the soft touch she made to Cassie\u2019s forehead. Rest, little one, and know you were given a soul as bright and shining as your smile. Sleep.</p><p>Cassie closed her eyes. As she felt the warmth slowly ease away she peeked from between her lashes and watched as the fairy stood to her feet and began to dissolve.</p><p>Goodnight, Cassie. The soft glow eased away, leaving her alone as her lashes fluttered sleepily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a good girl, Bo Bo,\u201d she whispered to the teddy bear as she hugged it tighter. \u201cMomma says I am. And Momma doesn\u2019t lie to me. Maybe not all Coyotes are bad. I\u2019ll be a good one...\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
