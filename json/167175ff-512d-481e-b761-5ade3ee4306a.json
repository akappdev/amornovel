To me it was just a bunch of lines and squares in different colours with some shading here and there. It looked familiar. In fact, I thought I had a picture Cole had drawn me when he was three years old tucked away somewhere that bore a remarkable resemblance to it. Although I doubted I could expect anyone to pay three hundred and seventy-five pounds for Cole\u2019s drawing. I also doubted the sanity of anyone who would pay three hundred and seventy-five pounds for the piece of canvas that looked like it had been sitting next to a railway at the exact time a train full of paint careened off the rails and crashed.</p><p>However, chancing a glance around me, I could see that most of the people in the gallery liked the artwork. Maybe I wasn\u2019t smart enough to get it. In an effort to appear more sophisticated for my boyfriend\u2019s sake, I adopted a pensive expression and moved on to the next canvas.</p> <p>\u2018Um, okay, I don\u2019t get it,\u2019 a low, husky voice announced beside me. I would have known that voice anywhere. Its American-accented words were disturbed here and there by a lilt, or the sharper consonants of a brogue, all a consequence of its owner having lived in Scotland for almost six years.</p><p>Relief flooded me as I brought my head down to meet the gaze of my best friend, Joss. For the first time that evening, I smiled brightly. Jocelyn Butler was a straight-talking, ballsy American girl who tended bar with me at a pretty swank place called Club 39. It was a basement bar on one of the city centre\u2019s most famous streets \u2013 George Street \u2013 and we\u2019d been working together for five years now.</p><p>Kitted out in a designer black dress and Louboutins, my vertically challenged friend looked hot. So did her boyfriend, Braden Carmichael. Standing behind Joss, his hand resting possessively on her lower back, Braden exuded confidence. Drool-worthy, he was the kind of boyfriend I\u2019d been searching for, for years, and if I didn\u2019t love Joss so much and Braden didn\u2019t adore her past all reasoning, I would have trampled over her to get to him. Braden was almost six and a half feet tall, which was ideal for someone of my height. I was a striking five foot ten \u2013 that made me more than six feet tall in the right heels. Joss\u2019s boyfriend also happened to be sexy, rich, and funny. And he loved Joss to distraction. They\u2019d been together for almost eighteen months. I could feel a proposal brewing.</p><p>\u2018You look amazing,\u2019 I told her, eyeing her curves. Unlike me, Joss had big boobs, along with hips and an ass that wouldn\u2019t quit. \u2018Thank you so much for coming. Both of you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, you owe me,\u2019 Joss muttered, her eyebrow arching as she glanced around at all the other paintings. \u2018I\u2019m going to have to do some serious lying if the artist asks me what I think.\u2019</p> <p>Braden gave her waist a squeeze and smiled down at her. \u2018Well, if the artist is as pretentious as her art, why lie when you can be brutally honest?\u2019</p><p>Joss grinned back at him. \u2018That\u2019s true.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I interjected, knowing that if I let her she would do just that. \u2018Becca is Malcolm\u2019s ex-girlfriend and they\u2019re still friends. You go Robert Hughes on her ass and it\u2019s my ass that gets kicked to the kerb.\u2019</p><p>Joss frowned. \u2018Robert Hughes?\u2019</p><p>I sighed. \u2018He was a famous art critic.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I like that.\u2019 Joss grinned evilly. \u2018You know they say honesty is next to godliness.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I think that\u2019s cleanliness, babe.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course it\u2019s cleanliness, but surely honesty is a close second?\u2019</p><p>The stubborn glint in Joss\u2019s eyes caused my throat to almost close up. Joss was a force to be reckoned with, and if she had an opinion or wanted to say something, there was little you could do to stop her. When I first met her she was an incredibly private person, preferring not to get involved in her friends\u2019 personal affairs. Since meeting Braden she\u2019d changed a lot. Our friendship had grown, and Joss was now the only one who really knew the truth about my life. I was thankful for our friendship, but in moments like these I sometimes wished she was the old Joss, the one who kept her thoughts and emotions locked up tight.</p><p>I\u2019d been dating Malcolm Hendry for almost three months. He was perfect for me. Kind, laid-back, tall \u2013 and wealthy. Malcolm was the oldest of all my \u2018sugar daddies\u2019, as Joss jokingly called them. Although at thirty-nine, he was hardly old. He was, however, fifteen years my senior. I didn\u2019t care. Convinced that he might be the one, I didn\u2019t want Joss jeopardizing the progress of our relationship by insulting his good friend.</p><p>\u2018Jocelyn\u2019 \u2013 Braden gripped her waist again, eyeing me and my growing panic \u2013 \u2018I think it best if you practise the art of artifice tonight after all.\u2019</p><p>Finally reading my expression, Joss placed a reassuring hand on my arm. \u2018I\u2019m kidding, Jo. I\u2019ll be on my best behaviour. I promise.\u2019</p><p>I nodded. \u2018It\u2019s just ... things are going well, you know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Malcolm seems like a decent guy,\u2019 Braden agreed.</p> <p>Joss made a sound at the back of her throat, but we both ignored it. My friend had made her opinion clear on my choice of boyfriend. She was convinced I was using Malcolm and he was using me. It was true that he was generous and I needed that generosity. However, the bigger truth was I really cared about him. Ever since my \u2018first love\u2019, John, when I was sixteen years old, I\u2019d fallen for charming providers and the idea of security for me and Cole. But John had gotten fed up with playing second fiddle to my family, and after six months he\u2019d dumped me.</p><p>It had taught me a valuable lesson.</p><p>It had also given me a new requirement in a boyfriend \u2013 he had to have a good job, be driven, hardworking, and have a good income. No matter how hard I worked, with my nonexistent qualifications and lack of any real talent, I was never going to make enough money to secure a stable future for my family. I was, however, pretty enough to secure a man with good qualifications and talent.</p><p>A few year after I pieced myself back together from the heartbreak of my failed romance with John, Callum entered my life. Thirty, a well-off solicitor, gorgeous, cultured, sophisticated. Determined to make it last, I became what I imagined was the perfect girlfriend to him. It was a habit, becoming someone else, especially since it seemed to work. Callum thought I was perfect for a while. We were together two years \u2013 until my secretiveness about my family and my inability to \u2018let him in\u2019 drove too deep a wedge between us and he left me.</p><p>It took me months to scrape myself back together after Callum ... and when I did, it was to run into the arms of Tim. Horrible decision. Tim worked for an investment company. He was so mind-numbingly self-absorbed that I actually dumped him. Then there was Steven. Steven was a sales director for one of these annoying door-to-door sales companies. He put in long hours, which I thought might work in our favour, but it didn\u2019t. Joss thought Steven had dumped me because of my inability to be flexible about anything because of my family obligations. The truth was I dumped Steven. Steven made me feel worthless. His comments about my general uselessness brought back too many memories, and although even I thought there was little to recommend me other than my looks, when your boyfriend said the same and ultimately made you feel like a paid escort, it was time to call it quits.</p><p>I took a lot of crap from people, but I had my limits, and the older I got, the narrower those limits became.</p><p>Malcolm was different, though. He never made me feel terrible about myself, and so far our relationship was moving along nicely.</p><p>\u2018Where is Lotto-Man?\u2019</p><p>I shot a glance over my shoulder and searched for him, ignoring Joss\u2019s sarcasm. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I murmured.</p><p>With Malcolm I\u2019d literally hit the jackpot, as he was a solicitor-turned-lottery-winner. He\u2019d won the EuroMillions three years ago and given up his job \u2013 his career, in fact \u2013 to begin enjoying a new life as a millionaire. Used to being busy, he\u2019d decided to try his hand at property development and now had a portfolio of properties he owned as a landlord.</p><p>We were standing in an ancient redbrick building with its dirty windows made up of rows of small rectangles that you\u2019d be more likely to see on a warehouse than an art gallery building. Inside was a different matter altogether. Outfitted with hardwood floors, amazing lighting and partition walls for the art, it was the ideal gallery spot. Malcolm had divorced a year before his win, but of course a good-looking, wealthy man attracted young women like me. He\u2019d soon encountered Becca, a savvy twenty-six-year-old Irish artist. They\u2019d dated for a few months and remained good friends even after they broke it off. Malcolm had invested money in her art, renting a gallery a few blocks away from my old flat in Leith.</p><p>I had to admit the gallery and the art show were impressive. Even if I didn\u2019t happen to understand what the art was saying to me.</p><p>Malcolm had managed to gather a group of private buyers to attend this special opening of Becca\u2019s new collection and thankfully the art was speaking to them. As soon as we\u2019d arrived, I\u2019d lost my companion for the evening. Becca had come hurrying towards Malcolm and me in metallic leggings and an oversized sweater, her bare feet slapping against the freezing-cold wooden floor. She\u2019d given me a flustered smile, grabbed Malcolm, and demanded that he come and introduce her to the people who had shown up. I then proceeded to walk around the gallery wondering whether it was that I had no taste for art or that this art was just atrocious.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019d thought about buying something for the flat, but ...\u2019 Braden gave a low whistle as he saw the price tag of the canvas we were standing in front of. \u2018I make it a rule not to overpay when I\u2019m buying shit.\u2019</p><p>Joss snorted and nodded in absolute agreement. Deciding it best to change the subject before one of them encouraged the other to be openly rude, I asked, \u2018Where\u2019s Ellie and Adam?\u2019</p><p>Ellie was a sweetheart and could put a positive spin on anything. She also managed to temper the blunt tongues of her best friend and her brother, which was why I\u2019d specifically invited her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018She and Adam are staying in tonight,\u2019 Joss replied with a quiet seriousness that concerned me. \u2018Today she got the results from the MRI. Everything\u2019s all clear, of course, but it brought it all back for her.\u2019</p><p>It had been just over a year since Ellie had had brain surgery to remove benign tumours that had been causing physical symptoms and seizures. I didn\u2019t really know Ellie at the time, but Joss had crashed at my old place once during Ellie\u2019s recovery, and I knew from what she\u2019d told me it had been a pretty hard time for them all. \u2018I\u2019ll try and pop round to see her soon,\u2019 I muttered, wondering if I could squeeze in the time to do that. Between my two jobs, looking after my mum and Cole, and accompanying Malcolm whenever he wanted me somewhere, my life was pretty hectic.</p><p>Joss nodded, a crease of concern between her brows. She worried about Ellie worse than anyone. Okay, maybe not worse than anyone, I thought, shooting a glance at Braden, whose own brows were knitted together in a troubled expression.</p> <p>Braden was quite possibly the most overprotective brother I\u2019d ever met, but since I knew all about being overprotective of a younger sibling, I had no room to make fun.</p><p>In an attempt to pull them out of their dark thoughts, I joked about the utterly crap day I\u2019d had at work. Tuesday, Thursday and Friday nights, I worked at Club 39. On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday during the day I worked as a personal assistant to Thomas Meikle, an accountant at Meikle &amp; Young\u2019s accountancy firm. Mr Meikle was a moody bastard and since \u2018personal assistant\u2019 was really just a posh word for \u2018gofer\u2019, I suffered constant whiplash from his colourful temperament. Some days were fine and we got along well enough; other days, like today, \u2018I didn\u2019t know my arse from my elbow\u2019 \u2013 direct quote \u2013 and was utterly useless. Apparently my uselessness had hit a new record today: there hadn\u2019t been enough sugar in his coffee, the girl at the bakery ignored my instructions to take the tomatoes off his sandwich, and I hadn\u2019t mailed out a letter Mr Meikle had forgotten to give me. Thankfully, tomorrow was my day off from Meikle and his vitriolic tongue.</p><p>Braden once again tried to persuade me to leave Meikle and come to work part-time at his estate agency, but I declined to accept his help, just as I had refused Joss\u2019s many offers of help in the past. Although I was grateful for the kindness, I was determined to always make my life work on my own. When you relied on people you cared about, put your trust in them with something huge like that, they inevitably disappointed you. And I really didn\u2019t want to be disappointed by Joss and Braden.</p><p>Obviously feeling more persistent tonight, Braden was relaying the benefits of working for him. Suddenly I felt the hair on the nape of my neck stand on end. My muscles tensed and I turned my head slightly, Braden\u2019s words becoming muffled as I checked out who or what had caught my notice. My eyes flickered across the room and then my breath hitched as my gaze paused on a guy who was staring at me. Our eyes met, and for some absolutely bizarre reason the connection felt physical, like acknowledging each other\u2019s presence had actually locked me in place. I felt my heart rate pick up, the blood rushing in my ears.</p><p>There was a fair distance between us, so I couldn\u2019t make out the colour of his eyes, but they were thoughtful and probing, his brow creased as if he was just as confused by the static between us as I was. Why had he caught my attention? He was not the kind of guy I usually responded to. Aye, he was pretty good-looking. Messy dark blond hair and sexy stubble. Tall, but not as tall as Malcolm. This guy was probably six feet tall and no more. I would stand a few inches taller than him in the heels I wore tonight. I could see the muscles in his biceps and the thick veins on his arms because the idiot was wearing a T-shirt in late winter, but he wasn\u2019t built like the guys I dated. He wasn\u2019t broad and beefy. He was lean and sinewy. Mmm, \u2018sinewy\u2019 was a good word for it. And did I mention the tattoos? I couldn\u2019t tell what they were, but I could make out the colourful ink on his arm.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t do tattoos.</p><p>When his eyes lowered under their lashes, I inhaled at the shock-like feeling that jolted through me as his gaze travelled down my body and back up again. I felt like squirming, overwhelmed under his flagrant perusal, though usually, if a guy checked me out like that, I would just smile back flirtatiously. The moment his eyes came back to my face, he offered me one last searing look \u2013 a look that I felt like a callused caress down my body \u2013 and then dragged his gaze away. Feeling dazed and decidedly turned on, I watched him stride off behind one of the art walls that divided the gallery into sections.</p><p>\u2018Who was that?\u2019 Joss\u2019s voice broke through my fog.</p><p>I blinked and turned back to her with what I imagined was a stupefied look on my face. \u2018I have no idea.\u2019</p><p>Joss smirked. \u2018He was hot.\u2019</p><p>A throat cleared behind her. \u2018What was that?\u2019</p> <p>Her eyes twinkled mischievously, but when she turned to face her scowling partner she had schooled her expression into one of innocence. \u2018I meant from a purely aesthetic point of view, of course.\u2019</p><p>Braden grunted but pulled her tighter into his side. Joss grinned back at me and I couldn\u2019t help but smile. Braden Carmichael was this no-nonsense, straight-talking, intimidating businessman, and yet somehow Jocelyn Butler had managed to wrap him around her pinkie.</p><p>I think we stood there for about an hour, drinking the free champagne and discussing everything under the sun. Sometimes I felt intimidated when the two of them were together because they were so intelligent and knowledgeable. I rarely felt I had anything profound or interesting to add to the conversation, so I just laughed and enjoyed them teasing the hell out of each other. When I was by myself with Joss it was different. I knew Joss better than I knew Braden, so I was confident that she would never want me to feel like I had to be anybody other than myself. It was a nice change of pace from the rest of my life.</p><p>We chatted with some other guests, trying not to seem confused by their enthusiasm for the art, but after an hour Joss turned to me apologetically. \u2018We have to go, Jo. I\u2019m sorry, but Braden\u2019s got a really early meeting tomorrow.\u2019 I must have shown my disappointment because she shook her head. \u2018You know what? No, I\u2019ll stay. Braden can go. I\u2019ll stay.\u2019</p><p>No. Absolutely not. I had seen myself through situations like this before. \u2018Joss, go home with Braden. I\u2019m fine. Bored. But fine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re sure?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Positive.\u2019</p><p>She gave my arm an affectionate squeeze and took Braden\u2019s hand. He gave me a nod, and I returned it with a smile and a \u2018Goodnight,\u2019 then watched as they walked across the gallery to the clothes rail where all the guests\u2019 coats were hanging. Like a true gentleman, Braden held Joss\u2019s coat for her and helped her shrug it on. He kissed her hair before he turned to pull on his own coat. With his arm wrapped around her shoulders, he led her out into the cold February night, leaving me inside the gallery with an unfamiliar ache in my chest.</p> <p>I glanced down at the gold Omega watch Malcolm had bought me for Christmas, and as always when I checked the time, I bemoaned the fact that I couldn\u2019t sell it yet. It was possibly the costliest gift I\u2019d ever received, and would do wonders for our savings. There was always the hope, however, that my relationship with Malcolm would turn into something more significant and selling the watch would no longer be an issue. But I never allowed myself to get my hopes too high.</p><p>It was nine fifteen. My pulse picked up a little and I riffled through my tiny fake Gucci clutch purse for my phone. No messages. Dammit, Cole.</p><p>I had just pressed SEND on a text message reminding Cole to call me as soon as he arrived home, when an arm slid around my waist and the woodsy, leathery smell of Malcolm\u2019s aftershave filled my nostrils. Not needing to tilt my head back to meet his gaze since I was wearing my five-inch heels, I turned and smiled, covering my worry for Cole as our eyes met. I\u2019d gone for sophisticated in the Dolce &amp; Gabbana red pencil dress that Malcolm had bought for me on our last shopping trip. The dress showed off my trim figure to perfection. I loved it. I would be sad to add it to my eBay pile.</p><p>\u2018There you are.\u2019 Malcolm grinned at me, his brown eyes bright as they crinkled attractively at the corners. He had a head full of lush, dark hair with a sexy sprinkling of grey at the sides. He wore suits all the time and tonight was no exception, the Savile Row tailoring exquisite. \u2018I thought your friends were coming tonight or I wouldn\u2019t have left you all alone.\u2019</p><p>I smiled at that and placed my hand on his chest. \u2018Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m fine. They were here, but they had to leave early.\u2019 I looked at the phone still curled in my hand \u2013 where was Cole? Little gremlins awoke in my stomach to nibble anxiously at my insides.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m buying one of Becca\u2019s paintings. Come and pretend with me that it\u2019s brilliant.\u2019</p><p>I chuckled and then immediately felt bad, biting my lip to stall the sound. \u2018I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not the only one that doesn\u2019t get it.\u2019</p><p>His eyes darted around the room, his lips curled in amusement. \u2018Well, thankfully these people know more about art than we do, so I\u2019ll at least get a return on my investment.\u2019</p><p>He kept his arm around me and guided me through the gallery and behind a couple of walls, where Becca stood under a huge monstrosity of splashed paintwork. I almost tripped over my own feet when I saw who she appeared to be arguing with.</p><p>Tattoo Guy.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>\u2018You okay?\u2019 Malcolm glanced down at me, frowning as he felt the tension in my body.</p><p>I smiled brightly. Rule number one: never let him see you as anything but positive and charming. \u2018I\u2019m great.\u2019</p><p>Tattoo Guy was grinning at Becca, his hand on her hip, trying to pull her to him, his expression bordering on appeasing. Wilfully, I ignored the catch in my breath at the flash of his wicked white smile. Becca still looked a bit put out, but I totally understood when she stepped into his embrace. I thought any woman would have forgiven the bastard anything when he smiled at her like that.</p><p>Averting my eyes from Tattoo Guy, I followed Malcolm as he came to a stop and the couple turned to us. Becca\u2019s cheeks were flushed pink, and her eyes sparkled with excitement. \u2018Just ignore me and Cam. We\u2019re just fighting because he\u2019s an eejit.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t look at him, but I heard him chuckle. \u2018No, we\u2019re fighting because we have different taste in art.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cam hates my artwork,\u2019 Becca said with a huff. \u2018He can\u2019t be like other boyfriends and lie at least. No. Brutally honest, this one. At least Malcolm likes my work. Did Mal tell you he\u2019s buying my painting, Jo?\u2019</p><p>You\u2019d think I\u2019d be jealous of Malcolm\u2019s obvious affection for Becca, and I know it sounds horrible, but until I saw her artwork I was a little jealous. I wasn\u2019t exceptionally smart, I didn\u2019t draw, I didn\u2019t dance, I didn\u2019t sing, I was just an okay cook ... Thankfully, I was pretty. Tall with legs that went on forever, I\u2019d been told countless times I had a good body and great skin. Combine those with huge green eyes, long, thick strawberry blonde hair, and delicate features and you were left with an attractive package \u2013 one that had been turning heads since I was a teenager. Aye, I didn\u2019t have much, but what I did have, I used to my family\u2019s advantage.</p> <p>To know that Becca was cute and talented had worried me a little. Perhaps Malcolm would get bored of me and go back to her? Actually, though, Malcolm\u2019s less-than-enthusiastic response to her artwork made me feel better about his relationship with her. Not that that made any rational kind of sense.</p><p>\u2018He did. Good choice.\u2019 I smiled at him and I could tell he was dying to laugh. His hand slid from my waist down to cup my hip and I moved in closer to him, chancing a glance at my phone. Still nothing from Cole.</p><p>\u2018Jo, this is Becca\u2019s boyfriend, Cameron,\u2019 Malcolm suddenly said, and I drew my head up quickly to finally study the man I had been avoiding looking at for the last few seconds. Our eyes met and I felt that frisson of excitement ripple through me again.</p><p>His eyes were cobalt blue and seemed to be stripping me back to nothing as they perused me for a second time. I watched his gaze quickly flicker over me, noting Malcolm\u2019s hand on my waist. I stiffened as Cameron took us in, drew some kind of conclusion about us, and slammed his expression shut with the hard pressing together of his lips.</p><p>\u2018Hi,\u2019 I managed and he gave me a barely there nod. The blaze in his eyes from earlier had definitely gone out.</p> <p>Becca started chattering to Malcolm about the painting, so I took the opportunity to check my phone once again. At a disgruntled snort, my head shot up, my eyes clashing with Cameron\u2019s. I couldn\u2019t understand the distaste in his expression or why I felt the sudden need to tell him to go fuck himself. Faced with animosity or aggression I tended to flinch and not utter a word. In this case, the condemnation and judgement in this tattooed idiot\u2019s face made me want to slam my fist into it and break his already imperfect nose. It had a little bump near the bridge that should have marred his good looks, but instead just added to his ruggedness.</p><p>I bit my tongue before I did something out of character, and let my eyes fall to his tattoos. On his right forearm was beautiful black script \u2013 two words I couldn\u2019t make out without giving away that I was trying to read them. On his left arm was a colourful and detailed image. It looked like a dragon, but I couldn\u2019t be sure, and Becca moved closer to Cameron\u2019s side, obscuring it from sight.</p><p>For a moment I wondered how Becca could go from dating thirtysomething Malcolm in his tailored suits to twentysomething Cameron with his seventies aviator watch and leather bracelets, a Def Leppard T-shirt that had been run through the wash too many times, and ratty Levi\u2019s.</p><p>\u2018Mal, did you ask Jo about the job?\u2019</p><p>Bemused, I looked up at my boyfriend. \u2018Job?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Becca, it\u2019s fine, really,\u2019 Cameron insisted, his deep voice sending a shiver of something I didn\u2019t want to admit to through my body. My eyes swung to collide with his and I saw him staring back at me, his expression blank.</p> <p>\u2018Nonsense,\u2019 Malcolm answered good-naturedly and then eyed me thoughtfully. \u2018You\u2019re still looking for another bartender at the club, aren\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>We were. My friend and colleague (and my only one-night stand \u2013 I\u2019d been a mess after Callum), Craig, had left us for Australia. Tuesday had been his last night and our manager, Su, had been interviewing for a new bartender for a week now. I\u2019d miss Craig. Sometimes his flirting got to be a bit much, and I never had the balls to tell him to shut up (Joss did), but at least he was always in a good mood. \u2018Yeah, why?\u2019</p><p>Becca touched my arm and I looked into her pleading face. It suddenly occurred to me that even though she was a few years older than me, she looked and sounded like a little girl, with her wide blue eyes, smooth skin and high-pitched voice. The two of us couldn\u2019t have been any more different. \u2018Cam is a graphic designer. He worked for a graphics company that does all the marketing and branding for household names around the country, but they had budget cuts. Last in, first out sort of thing, and Cam just started with them a year ago.\u2019</p><p>I shot Cam a wary but sympathetic look. It wasn\u2019t easy losing your job.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what I or the bartending position had to do with it, though.</p><p>\u2018Becca.\u2019 Cam sounded annoyed now. \u2018I told you I\u2019d deal with this myself.\u2019</p><p>She flushed a little under his penetrating gaze and I suddenly felt a connection to her. I wasn\u2019t the only one he intimidated. Good. \u2018Cam, let me help.\u2019 She turned back to me. \u2018He\u2019s struggling \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m struggling to find graphic design work.\u2019 Cam cut her off, his blue eyes burning with frustration. It suddenly occurred to me that his apparent bad mood might have nothing to do with me and everything to do with his situation. \u2018Malcolm said there was a full-time position open at Club 39 and I have experience bartending. I need something to get me through until I can find another job. If you could get me an application form, I\u2019d appreciate it.\u2019</p> <p>Why I decided to be helpful considering I didn\u2019t very much like him, or his attitude, remained a mystery as I replied, \u2018I\u2019ll do one better. I\u2019ll speak to my manager and I\u2019ll give her your number.\u2019</p><p>He stared at me a moment and I couldn\u2019t for the life of me work out what was going on behind his eyes. Finally, he nodded slowly. \u2018Okay, thanks. My number is \u2013\u2019</p><p>At that moment my phone vibrated in my hands and I lifted it to stare at the screen.</p><p>I\u2019m home from Jamie\u2019s house. Stop panicking. Cole.</p><p>The tension melted from my body and I sighed, quickly texting him back.</p><p>\u2018Jo?\u2019</p><p>I glanced up and noted Malcolm\u2019s raised eyebrows.</p><p>Damn. Cam\u2019s number. I flushed, realizing I\u2019d completely blanked on him when I got Cole\u2019s message. I sent him a sheepish smile of apology, one that ricocheted off his steely countenance. \u2018Sorry. Your number?\u2019</p><p>Unamused, he rattled it off for me and I typed it into my phone.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll give this to her tomorrow.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, sure,\u2019 he responded in a bored tone, suggesting he didn\u2019t think I had the brain cells to remember to do that.</p><p>His attitude towards me pricked, but I decided not to let it bother me, snuggling more happily into Malcolm\u2019s side now that I knew Cole was tucked in safe in our flat on London Road.</p><p>2</p><p>While Becca no doubt tried to talk Malcolm into extending the lease on the gallery, I wandered off towards the coat rail, my back to the room as I called Cole.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>I made a face at the way my little brother had taken to answering the phone lately. Apparently, becoming a teenage boy meant that the carefully seeded manners I\u2019d tried to plant in him were no longer applicable. \u2018Cole, you answer the phone like that to me again and I\u2019m selling the PS3 on eBay.\u2019 I\u2019d dipped into our savings to buy him the video console for Christmas. It had been worth it at the time. Apparently becoming a teenager meant Cole no longer had the ability to show excitement. I tried to make Christmas as thrilling as possible for Cole when he was a kid, and I got all juiced up on how crazy happy he got when Santa was coming. Those days had disappeared somewhere, and I missed them. However, the sight of Cole\u2019s shy grin when he opened his PS3 had given me that feeling back for a moment. He\u2019d even patted me on the shoulder and told me I\u2019d done good. Condescending little shit, I thought affectionately.</p><p>Cole sighed. \u2018Sorry. I told you I was home. I got a lift off Jamie\u2019s dad.\u2019</p><p>I breathed an inward sigh of relief. \u2018Have you done your homework?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m trying to do it just now but someone keeps interrupting me with paranoid texts and phone calls.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, if you contact me at the time you say you will I won\u2019t bug you so much.\u2019</p><p>He just grunted. This was a response I was becoming familiar with.</p><p>I nibbled on my lip, feeling my stomach flip unpleasantly. \u2018How\u2019s Mum?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Out for the count.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You had dinner?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Pizza at Jamie\u2019s.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I left you a Pop-Tart if you\u2019re still hungry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cheers.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You going to bed soon?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Promise?\u2019</p><p>Another big sigh. \u2018Promise.\u2019</p><p>I nodded, trusting him. He had a small group of friends he played video games with and didn\u2019t get into trouble with; he was studious, and helpful around the house on occasion. As a little boy he\u2019d been the sweetest thing to ever come into my life. He\u2019d been my shadow. As a teenager things like being openly affectionate with your big sister were uncool. I was learning to adjust to the transition. I refused, however, to ever let a day pass without him knowing how loved he was. Growing up, I\u2019d never had that in my life and I was going to make damn sure that Cole did. No matter how goofy he thought I was. \u2018I love you, baby boy. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u2019</p><p>I hung up before he could grunt at me again and spun around, only to inhale sharply.</p><p>Cam stood before me. He looked at me as he pulled Becca\u2019s phone out of her coat, which was hanging on the rail. His gaze skimmed down my figure again before coming to rest on the floor as he said, \u2018You don\u2019t have to ask about the job for me.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I narrowed my eyes at him, my hackles rising. What was with this guy? What was with my reaction to him? Like I gave a crap what he thought about me. \u2018You need the job, right?\u2019</p><p>Those deep blue eyes of his met mine again. I watched the muscle in his jaw flex along with his biceps as he crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>I had a feeling it was just pure muscle underneath his shirt.</p> <p>He gave me no verbal answer, but with body language like that I didn\u2019t need one.</p><p>\u2018Then I\u2019ll ask.\u2019</p><p>Without a word of gratitude \u2013 not even a nod \u2013 Cam turned away and I felt the tension begin to drain out of me. Then, as he stopped and slowly turned back, the tension built up again, as though someone had stuck a plug in my sink.</p><p>Although Cam\u2019s lips weren\u2019t full, the upper lip had a soft, expressive curve to it, giving him this perpetually sexy curl. That expressiveness seemed to vanish whenever he directed dialogue my way. His lips thinned. \u2018Malcolm is a good guy.\u2019</p><p>My pulse picked up speed, having had enough experience of people\u2019s perception of me to know where this was going. I just didn\u2019t want it to be going there with this guy. \u2018Aye, he is.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Does he know you\u2019re seeing someone behind his back?\u2019</p><p>Okay ... I hadn\u2019t expected it to be going there. I found myself mirroring him, my arms crossing over my chest defensively. \u2018Excuse me?\u2019</p><p>He smirked, his eyes running the length of me for the fifteenth time. I saw a flicker of interest he couldn\u2019t quite hide, but I guessed his disgust for me overruled any masculine appreciation for my body. His eyes were hard when they met mine. \u2018Look, I know your type well. I grew up watching a parade of gorgeous bimbos walk in and out of my uncle\u2019s life. They took what they could and then fucked around on him behind his back. He didn\u2019t deserve that, and Malcolm doesn\u2019t deserve some empty-headed footballer\u2019s-wife-wannabe who thinks that texting on her phone during an adult conversation is socially acceptable or that planning to meet up with another man tomorrow while her boyfriend is standing across the room isn\u2019t morally and emotionally bankrupt.\u2019</p><p>I tried to ignore the twist in my gut at his unwarranted assault. For some reason this asshole\u2019s words penetrated. However, instead of waking up the shame that only I knew existed within me, his words ignited my outrage. Usually, I swallowed my irritation and anger at people, but for some reason my voice wouldn\u2019t listen to my brain. It wanted to spit his words right back at him. I was determined, however, not to approach him in the \u2018empty-headed\u2019 manner he expected.</p><p>I frowned at him instead. \u2018What happened to your uncle?\u2019</p><p>At the darkening of Cam\u2019s face, I braced myself for more insult. \u2018Married a version of you. She took him for everything. He\u2019s now divorced and in debt up to his eyeballs.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018So that would explain why you think it\u2019s okay to judge me? A person you don\u2019t even know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t need to know you, sweetheart. You\u2019re a walking clich\u00e9.\u2019</p><p>Feeling the anger boil, I reined it in and turned it down so it simmered carefully, taking a step toward him as I laughed softly, humourlessly. As our bodies closed in on each other, I tried and failed to ignore the crackling of electricity between us. I felt my nipples harden unexpectedly and was glad for the placement of my arms over my chest so he wouldn\u2019t see. He inhaled sharply at my closeness, his look searing, and I felt it like pressure between my legs.</p><p>Ignoring the absurd sexual attraction between us, I glowered. \u2018Well, I guess that makes us a pair. I\u2019m a brainless, morally corrupt, money-grabbing bimbo and you\u2019re a jumped-up, pretentious, artsy-fartsy know-it-all dickhead.\u2019 Fighting to cover the trembling coursing through me \u2013 a reaction to the adrenaline spiked by my actually standing up for myself for once \u2013 I took a step back, satisfied at the flare of surprise in his eyes. \u2018See, I can judge a book by its cover too.\u2019</p><p>Not leaving him a chance to make a smart-ass retort, I put a swing into my hips to overcome the trembling, and sashayed across the gallery and around the wall until I found my boyfriend. Becca had been monopolizing Malcolm\u2019s time for too long. I sidled up to him, sliding my hand along his back and dangerously close to his delicious bottom. His attention was immediately wrenched from Becca as he stared into my now glittering eyes.</p><p>I licked my lips provocatively. \u2018I\u2019m bored, babe. Let\u2019s go.\u2019</p><p>Ignoring Becca\u2019s huff of annoyance, Malcolm congratulated her once more on a great show, and then ushered me out of there, eager to receive the promise in my eyes.</p><p>Malcolm groaned in my ear, his hips moving against mine in staccato jerks as he finally came. The muscles in his back relaxed beneath my hands and he collapsed on me for a second as he tried to catch his breath. I tenderly kissed his neck and he pulled back, his own affection for me clear in his eyes. It was nice to see.</p> <p>\u2018You didn\u2019t come,\u2019 he observed quietly.</p><p>No, I hadn\u2019t. My brain was too switched on, thoughts of the evening, of Cam and the argument refusing to let me out of their clutches. \u2018I did.\u2019</p><p>Malcolm\u2019s mouth twitched. \u2018Sweetheart, you don\u2019t have to fake it with me.\u2019 He kissed me softly and pulled back, grinning. \u2018I\u2019ll get you there.\u2019 He made to move down my body and my hands tightened on him, stopping his descent.</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t have to.\u2019 I began to sit up and Malcolm pulled out of me fully, leaning back on his side to let me move. \u2018You\u2019ve had a long day. You should get some sleep.\u2019</p><p>His large hand came down on my naked hip, stopping me from getting out of the bed. I glanced back at him and saw concern in his eyes. \u2018Did something happen? Are you okay?\u2019</p><p>I decided to lie. \u2018When I called Cole earlier it sounded like Mum was having some trouble. I\u2019m just worried.\u2019</p><p>Malcolm sat up now, his brows drawn together. \u2018You should have said.\u2019</p><p>Not wanting to upset him, or our relationship, I leaned over and pressed a firm kiss to his mouth, pulling back to gaze into his eyes so he\u2019d know I was sincere. \u2018I wanted to be with you tonight.\u2019</p><p>He liked that. He smiled at me and gave me a quick kiss. \u2018Do what you\u2019ve got to do, sweetheart.\u2019</p><p>I nodded and threw him a smile before I hurried to clean up so I could leave. I had never once spent the night with Malcolm. I left after we had sex because I guessed that\u2019s what he\u2019d want. I guessed that\u2019s what would make him happy. And since he\u2019d never asked me to stay, I assumed I\u2019d guessed right.</p><p>By the time I was ready to leave, Malcolm had fallen asleep. I stared at his strong, naked body flung across the bed, and I prayed that this was the relationship that was going to make it. I called a taxi and when it rang my phone twice to let me know it had arrived, I left silently, trying to ignore the disquiet that had settled over me.</p><p>Almost a year ago I\u2019d moved my family from our large flat on Leith Walk to a smaller flat off the Walk, on London Road, technically on Lower London Road. It doubled my travel from work, meaning I had to get a bus into town most days instead of walking. It was worth it for what we saved on rent, though. My mum had rented our flat on Leith Walk when I was fourteen years old, but before long it had fallen to me to make the payments, just as it was up to me now. This new flat had been in a right sad state of affairs when we took it, but I\u2019d actually managed to persuade our landlord to let me decorate it out of my own pocket. Something I could do on a small budget.</p><p>Less than ten minutes after I left Malcolm\u2019s, the taxi driver dropped me off at the flat and I let myself into our building, immediately going up on my tiptoes so my heels wouldn\u2019t make a noise. As I took the narrow, dark spiral staircase up towards our flat I didn\u2019t even see the dank, graffiti-covered concrete stairwell anymore, I was so used to it. Our old stairwell had been like that too. You could hear everything in those spaces and since I knew how annoying it was to be woken up by drunken neighbours in their clattering heels and alcohol-soaked joviality, I took care not to make any noise as I made my way up to the third floor.</p><p>I let myself quietly into the dark flat and slipped my heels off, tiptoeing down the hall to Cole\u2019s room first. I cracked open his door and from the light spilling in under his curtains I could make out his head buried nearly all the way under his duvet. The worry I always felt for him eased a little now that I could see with my own eyes that he was safe and sound, but that worry never, ever completely disappeared \u2013 partly because parents never, ever stop worrying about their kids and partly because of the woman who slept in the room across the hall from him.</p><p>I slipped into my mum\u2019s bedroom, only to find her sprawled across her bed, the sheets twisted around her legs, her nightdress rucked up so I could see the pink cotton underneath. I was just thankful she was wearing underwear. Despite everything, I couldn\u2019t let her freeze, so I covered her quickly with her duvet and then clocked the empty bottle by her bed. I quietly reached for it and left the room to take it into our small kitchen. I placed it with the others, and noted it was time to take the box of bottles down to the recycle bin.</p><p>I stared at them a moment, feeling exhausted, and that exhaustion turned to resentment for the bottle and all the troubles it had caused us. As soon as it had become clear that Mum no longer had an interest in anything, including authority over her own home, I took over from her. These days I paid the rent on our three-bedroom flat on time every month. I\u2019d saved a lot, I worked a lot of hours, and best of all, my mum couldn\u2019t get anywhere near my money. That never used to be the case, though. There was a time when money was a worry, when feeding and clothing Cole was a deep worry. I\u2019d promised myself we would never go back to that. So even though there was money in the bank, I knew it was money that would stretch only so far.</p><p>I\u2019d tried to erase much of our former life. When I was growing up, my uncle Mick \u2013 a painter and decorator \u2013 used to take me with him on the jobs he did for friends and family. I worked with him right up until he moved to America. Uncle Mick had taught me everything he knew and I\u2019d loved every minute of it. There was something soothing about transforming a space, something therapeutic in it. So every now and then I\u2019d go bargain hunting and I\u2019d redecorate the flat \u2013 just as I had done when we\u2019d moved into the new one. Only a few months ago I\u2019d wallpapered the main wall in the living room in this bold chocolate paper with grand teal flowers on it. I\u2019d painted the other three walls cream and I\u2019d bought teal and chocolate scatter cushions for our old cream leather sofa. Although in the end it wouldn\u2019t be us benefiting financially from the change, the first thing I\u2019d done when we moved in was strip the hardwood flooring, restoring the floor to its former glory. That had been the biggest expense, but it had been worth it to feel proud of our home, no matter how temporary. Despite the lack of expense on the rest of the decor, the flat looked modern and clean and well cared-for. It was a home Cole wouldn\u2019t be ashamed of bringing friends back to ... if it weren\u2019t for our mum. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Most days I coped with the hand that Cole and I had been dealt. Today I felt emotional. I felt further than ever from the peace and security I strove to find. Perhaps it was the weariness causing my blood to heat.</p><p>Deciding it was time to catch some sleep, I strolled quietly down to the end of the hall, ignored the drunken snoring from my mum\u2019s room, and slipped silently behind my door, closing the world out. I had the smallest room in the flat. Inside it was a single bed, a wardrobe \u2013 most of my clothes, including my eBay pile, shared space with Cole\u2019s in the wardrobes in his bedroom \u2013 and a couple of overflowing bookshelves. My collection ranged from paranormal romances to nonfiction history books. I would read anything. Absolutely anything. I loved being transported somewhere else, even back in time.</p><p>I stripped out of the Dolce &amp; Gabbana and put it into my dry-cleaning bag. Only time would tell if I got to keep it or not. The flat was freezing, so I hurried into my warm pyjamas and dived under the covers.</p> <p>After such a long day, I thought I\u2019d fall asleep instantly. But I didn\u2019t.</p><p>I found myself staring up at the ceiling, playing Cam\u2019s words over and over inside my head. I\u2019d thought I was used to people thinking I was worthless, but his attitude for some reason stuck in my side like a knife. And yet there was no one else to blame but myself.</p><p>I chose this path.</p><p>I turned on my side, pulling the duvet up to my chin. I didn\u2019t think I was unhappy.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if I was happy, though.</p> <p>I supposed it didn\u2019t matter as long as the end result was that Cole was happy. Our mum was pretty rubbish at being a mum \u2013 and fourteen years ago I\u2019d promised myself to watch out for my baby brother. As long as he grew up with self-worth and I had the means to get him whatever he needed to start out right in life, that was all that mattered.</p><p>3</p><p>Staring at the electricity bill in frustration, I decided I\u2019d have to look at it again when I wasn\u2019t so tired. I\u2019d had a few hours of sleep before I had to get up for Cole in the morning, which I always did because I liked to see him off to school. And then I\u2019d come home and spent the day cleaning the flat, rousing Mum long enough to help her get washed and dressed, and then I\u2019d left her watching some daft talk show while I went off to do the food shopping.</p><p>I squinted at the electricity bill. I doubted I\u2019d be able to figure it out; I could never understand how the tariffs worked. However they were calculated, they put me out of pocket. \u2018Assholey scumsuckers,\u2019 I hissed, throwing the bill on the coffee table and ignoring the startled look from Cole, who was still wearing his school uniform. Ever since he got old enough to start emulating me, I\u2019d watched my language around him. I hated slipping up.</p><p>If I pretended I hadn\u2019t said it, then maybe he would too.</p><p>I flopped back on the couch and closed my eyes against the light in hopes that it would ease the headache behind my eyes.</p> <p>I heard Cole shuffling around, followed by the sound of a drawer being opened seconds before something small landed on my chest. I peeled my eyes open and glanced down at the tiny missile.</p><p>Nicorette Gum.</p><p>I felt my mouth quirk up at the corner and looked up at Cole from under my lashes as he stared down at me. \u2018I don\u2019t need the gum any more.\u2019</p><p>Cole gave me the grunt and shrug that were becoming all too familiar this year. \u2018You swore a lot when you were trying to quit smoking.\u2019</p><p>I arched an eyebrow. \u2018I quit over three months ago.\u2019</p><p>He gave me that damn shrug again. \u2018Just saying.\u2019</p><p>I didn\u2019t need a cigarette. I needed sleep. Okay, sometimes I really wanted a cigarette. The desperation had finally gone \u2013 that jittery rawness inside my body where every nerve ending felt like it was screaming at me for a cigarette. I swear I could have ripped someone\u2019s face off for a cigarette during those first few weeks after quitting. I\u2019d like to say that I was motivated to quit smoking because it was the right thing to do. But no. I\u2019d seen some of my friends attempt to quit and had not fancied going through the ordeal of it. I had enough going on in my life without adding squashing an addiction to the list. No, I quit smoking for the one thing in the whole world that meant anything to me, and right now he was folding his tall body back on to the floor, where his own comic book drawings were scattered in front of the television.</p><p>Cole had asked me to quit years ago when he first found out that cigarettes \u2018were bad\u2019. I hadn\u2019t done it then because he\u2019d never really pursued the issue, being that he was seven years old and more interested in Iron Man than in my bad habits.</p> <p>Then a few months ago his health class was shown a pretty disgusting video of the damage smoking did to the lungs and the consequences ... such as lung cancer. Now, Cole is a smart kid. It\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t know that smoking killed. Since every cigarette packet had a bold print label over it that said SMOKING KILLS, I\u2019d be pretty worried if he hadn\u2019t known.</p><p>However, I don\u2019t think it had occurred to him until then that smoking could kill me. He came home in a belligerent mood and flushed all my cigs. I\u2019d never seen him react so strongly to anything before \u2013 his face almost purple with emotion, his eyes blazing. He demanded that I quit. He didn\u2019t have to say anything else \u2013 it was written all over his face.</p><p>I don\u2019t want you to die, Jo. I can\u2019t lose you.</p><p>So I quit.</p><p>I got the patches and the gum and went through the horrendous withdrawals. Now that I didn\u2019t have to pay for the patches and gum, I was saving money, especially since the price of cigarettes just kept climbing. It seemed to be socially unacceptable to smoke anyway. Joss was absolutely ecstatic when I told her I was quitting, and I had to admit it was nice not having to put up with her wrinkling her nose at me every time I returned from break smelling like cigarette smoke. \u2018I\u2019m fine now,\u2019 I assured Cole.</p><p>He kept sketching a page in the comic book he was creating. The kid was seriously talented. \u2018What\u2019s with the swearing, then?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Price of electricity has gone up.\u2019</p><p>Cole snorted. \u2018What hasn\u2019t gone up?\u2019</p><p>Well, he would know. He\u2019d been watching the news avidly since he was four. \u2018True.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Should you not be getting ready for work?\u2019</p><p>I grunted. \u2018Aye, okay, Dad.\u2019</p><p>I was awarded another shrug before he bent over his sketch pad again, the signal that he was preparing to tune me out. His strawberry blond hair slid over his forehead and I fought the urge to brush it back. His hair was getting too long, but he wouldn\u2019t let me take him to the barber\u2019s to get it cut.</p><p>\u2018You done your homework?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mmm-hmm.\u2019</p><p>Stupid question.</p><p>I eyed the clock on the mantelpiece of our fireplace. Cole was right. It was time to get ready for my shift at Club 39. Joss was on shift with me tonight, so it wouldn\u2019t be too bad. There were perks to working with your best friend. \u2018You\u2019re right, I\u2019d better \u2013\u2019</p><p>Crash! \u2018Aw, fuck!\u2019</p><p>The crash and the curse word lit up the apartment and I thanked God that our neighbour downstairs had moved out and that the flat below was empty. I dreaded the day a new tenant moved in. \u2018Jooooo!\u2019 she shrieked helplessly. \u2018Johannaaaaa!\u2019</p><p>Cole stared at me, defiance burning in his eyes despite the tight pain in his boyish features. \u2018Just leave her, Jo.\u2019</p><p>I shook my head, my stomach churning. \u2018Let me get her settled so you don\u2019t have to worry about her tonight.\u2019</p><p>\u2018JOOOOOO!\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m coming!\u2019 I yelled and threw my shoulders back, bracing myself to deal with her.</p><p>I threw open her door, not surprised to find my mum on the floor beside her bed, gripping the sheets as she tried to pull herself up. A bottle of gin had smashed across her bedside table, and pieces of glass had fallen to the floor beside her. I saw her hand drop towards the glass and I rushed at her, jerking her arm roughly. \u2018Don\u2019t,\u2019 I told her softly. \u2018Glass.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I fell, Jo,\u2019 she whimpered.</p><p>I nodded and leaned down to put my hands under her armpits. Hauling her skinny body on to the bed, I pulled her legs up and slid them under the duvet. \u2018Let me clean this up.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I need more, Jo.\u2019</p><p>I sighed and hung my head. My mother, Fiona, was a severe alcoholic. She had always liked a drink. When I was younger it hadn\u2019t been as bad as it was now. For the first two years after we moved from Glasgow to Edinburgh, Mum managed to hold on to her job with a large private cleaning company. Her drinking had worsened when Uncle Mick left, but when her back problems started and she was diagnosed with a herniated disc, the drinking became excessive. She quit her job and went on disability allowance. I was fifteen years old. I couldn\u2019t get a job until I turned sixteen, so for a year our lives were pretty much shit as we lived off welfare and the little savings that Mum had put away. Mum was supposed to keep active \u2013 to at least walk around \u2013 because of her bad back. But she only made the pain worse as she became more of a hermit, vacillating between long periods of bedridden drinking and short bursts of angry, drunken stupors in front of the television. I dropped out of school at sixteen and got a job as a receptionist in a hair salon. I worked crazy hours to try to make ends meet. On the plus side, I\u2019d never had really close friends at high school but I made some good friends at the salon. After reading some vague article about chronic fatigue syndrome, I began to make excuses for my schedule \u2013 always having to be at home to look after Cole \u2013 by telling people my mum had chronic fatigue syndrome. Since I knew very little about the complicated condition, I pretended to find it too upsetting to really talk about. It felt, however, much less shameful than the truth.</p><p>I looked up from under my lashes, the resentment in my gaze burning through the woman on the bed and not even causing her to flinch. Mum had once been a stunning woman. I got my height, trim figure and colouring from her. But now, with her thinning hair and bad skin, my forty-one-year-old mum looked closer to sixty.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve got no gin left.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her mouth trembled. \u2018Will you go get me some?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I never would and I\u2019d forbidden Cole from getting alcohol for her as well. \u2018I have to get ready for work anyway.\u2019 I braced myself.</p><p>Her lip immediately curled up in disgust, her bloodshot green eyes narrowing hatefully. Her accent thickened with her venom. \u2018Cannae even get yer mam a fuckin drink! Yer a lazy wee slut! Don\u2019t think I dinnae know what yer up to oot there! Whorin around. Spreadin those fuckin legs fur any man that\u2019ll have you! I raised a whore! A goddamn whore!\u2019</p><p>Used to my mum\u2019s \u2018split personality\u2019, I shuffled out of the room, feeling Cole\u2019s fuming anger as I passed the door to the sitting room and wandered into the kitchen for a sweeping brush. Her voice rose, her insults coming quick and fast, and I glanced at Cole as I passed, saw his fist crumpling around a piece of paper. I shook my head at him to let him know I was okay, and continued on into our mum\u2019s room.</p> <p>\u2018What are you doin\u2019?\u2019 she stopped her tirade long enough to ask me as I bent to clean up the broken bottle.</p><p>I ignored her.</p><p>\u2018You leave that there!\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll cut yourself if I leave it, Mum.\u2019</p><p>I heard her whimper again and felt the change. I\u2019d been dealing with her long enough to know which side of her I was about to be subjected to. There were only two choices: the pitiful sweetheart or the acerbic bitch. The pitiful sweetheart was about to make an appearance. \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 Her breath hitched and she started to cry quietly. \u2018I didn\u2019t mean it. I love ye.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I know.\u2019 I stood up. \u2018But I can\u2019t get your drink for you, Mum.\u2019</p><p>She sat up, her eyebrows drawn together, her fingers trembling as she reached for her purse on the bedside table. \u2018Cole will get it. I\u2019ve got money.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mum, Cole\u2019s too young. They won\u2019t serve him.\u2019 I\u2019d rather she believe that it didn\u2019t have anything to do with him being unwilling to help. I didn\u2019t want him having to deal with her bile while I was out at work.</p><p>Her arm dropped. \u2018Will you help me up?\u2019</p><p>This meant she was going out herself. I bit my tongue to stop myself from arguing with her. I needed to keep her sweet if I was going to be gone. \u2018Let me get rid of the glass and I\u2019ll be back to help you.\u2019</p><p>When I stepped out of her room, Cole was already waiting by the door. He held out his hands. \u2018Give me that.\u2019 He nodded at the glass. \u2018You help her.\u2019</p> <p>An ache gripped my chest. He was a good kid. \u2018When you\u2019re done, take your comic book into your room. Stay out of her way tonight.\u2019</p><p>He nodded, but I saw the tension in his body as he turned away from me. He was getting older and more frustrated with our situation and his inability to do anything about it. I just needed him to get through the next four years. Then he\u2019d be eighteen and legally I could get him out of here and away from her.</p><p>When Joss discovered the truth about my situation, she\u2019d asked me why I didn\u2019t just take Cole and leave. Well, I hadn\u2019t done that because Mum had already threatened to call the police if I ever did \u2013 it was her guarantee that she\u2019d have us around to keep her fed, to keep her company. I couldn\u2019t even petition the courts for custody because there was the risk I wouldn\u2019t get him, and once the social services found out about our mother, they\u2019d probably put him into care. Moreover, they\u2019d have to contact my dad and I really didn\u2019t want him back in our lives.</p><p>I spent half an hour getting Mum into a decent enough state to leave the house. I didn\u2019t have to worry about her wandering in and out of the pubs or restaurants on our busy street, because she seemed to be just as ashamed of her condition as we were. The need for drink was the only thing that compelled her to go out, and even then she\u2019d taken to buying it online so she didn\u2019t have to go out for it too often.</p><p>By the time I was washed and dressed for work, Mum was back in the flat with her bottles of gin. She\u2019d sat herself in front of the television, so I was glad I\u2019d told Cole to head into his room. I popped my head around the door of his room and told him, like I always did, to call me at work if he needed me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t say goodbye to Mum when I left. There would be no point.</p><p>Instead, I stepped out of the building and braced myself for the night, compartmentalizing my worry and anger so I could focus on my work. In the mood to walk, I\u2019d left the flat early. I marched briskly down London Road, turning the fifteen-minute stroll into ten, but as soon as I got to the more familiar Leith Walk, I slowed. The wonderful smells coming from the Indian restaurant beneath our old flat along with the crisp, cold night air woke me up a little. I strode up the street, the busy, wide street with its restaurants and shops, passing the Edinburgh Playhouse and the Omni Centre, and wished I was dressed up for a night out at the theatre or the movies. I crossed the street near the top of the Walk, turning on to Picardy Place and as I headed towards George Street, I prayed I could put the scene I\u2019d left back at the flat behind me.</p><p>Our manager, Su, worked odd hours. She rarely worked the weekends during opening hours, trusting her long-standing staff members and the security guys to take care of the place. Sometimes she worked Monday through Wednesday at night, foregoing Thursday through Saturday, which happened to be the busiest nights. I didn\u2019t mind. It was actually nice not to have a manager breathing down my neck, especially since my boss at my day job was such an irritant.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t occur to me not to give Su Cam\u2019s number. He\u2019d been an asshole to me, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel for him being out of a job. I guess fate felt the same way, because for the first time in a long time, I caught Su just before she left. We met on George Street, at the top of the steps to the bar, and I literally had to stand in her path to stop her escaping, she was so clearly desperate to be away from the club.</p><p>\u2018Jo, what\u2019s up?\u2019 she asked, almost bouncing on the balls of her feet as she tilted her head back to meet my gaze. At five one, Su was this tiny, curly-haired, energetic forty-something whose mind always seemed to be on anything but what it was supposed to be on. It amazed me that she managed Club 39, but the owner, some elusive person named Oscar, was one of Su\u2019s closest friends.</p><p>I smiled down at her brightly. \u2018Are you still looking for a bartender?\u2019</p><p>Su sighed heavily, jamming her hands into her coat pockets. \u2018Yeah, I am. I want another guy like Craig, so obviously I get a ton of girls applying and no guys as hot as Craig.\u2019</p><p>Charming.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t escaped my notice that the bartending staff at Club 39 were all attractive, but to hear it put so bluntly without any regard to ethics in the workplace made me choke on a snort. I covered it quickly with a rueful smirk. \u2018Well, I may have the answer to your problem.\u2019 I pulled out my mobile phone. \u2018His name is Cam, he has bartending experience, he can start immediately, and he\u2019s pretty hot.\u2019 A total dick, but a good-looking one.</p><p>Su took his number with a wide, infectious smile. \u2018Sounds promising, Jo. Cheers.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No problem.\u2019</p><p>We bade each other goodnight and I hurried down the basement steps, smiling a bright hello to Brian, the security guy, and Phil, our doorman for the night.</p><p>\u2018Evenin\u2019, Jo.\u2019 Brian winked at me as I passed.</p><p>\u2018Evening. Did the missus forgive you for forgetting her birthday?\u2019 I asked, slowing down as I turned to wait on his answer. Poor Brian had arrived at work on Saturday night in the worst mood. He\u2019d forgotten his wife\u2019s birthday, and rather than being angry, Jennifer, his wife of ten years, had been hurt. There had been tears. Brian, who looked like a grizzly bear but was more the cuddly kind, was distraught.</p><p>Not so much now, if his grin had anything to do with it. \u2018Aye. I had that movie set up like you said. Worked like a charm.\u2019</p><p>I chuckled. \u2018I\u2019m glad to hear it.\u2019 I\u2019d suggested that Brian talk to Sadie, one of the students who worked at the bar and was in the film club at Edinburgh University. I thought she might be able to get permission to use one of the uni\u2019s projectors so Brian could take Jennifer to a private screening of her favourite movie \u2013 An Officer and a Gentleman \u2013 on the big screen.</p><p>\u2018You still dating that lottery winner, Jo?\u2019 Phil asked, his eyes running the length of me. Not that there was anything to see \u2013 I was wrapped up in my warm winter coat.</p><p>I tilted my head to the side, my smile flirtatious now. Phil was just a few years older than me, single, cute, and perpetually asking me out to no avail. \u2018I am, Philip.\u2019</p><p>He sighed heavily, his dark eyes glittering under the twinkle lights around the club door. \u2018You let me know when that ends. I\u2019ve got a big shoulder here for you to cry on.\u2019</p><p>Brian snorted. \u2018Maybe you\u2019d have a chance with her if you didn\u2019t spew shite like that.\u2019</p><p>Phil huffed and swore at him. As this was almost a ritual now, I laughed and left them to their bickering.</p><p>\u2018There she is.\u2019 Joss grinned at me as I wandered into the empty club. She was leaning against the bar, and her expression changed when she saw my face. \u2018Something happen?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I had\u2019 \u2013 I glanced around to make sure we really were alone \u2013 \u2018a difficult time with Mum tonight.\u2019 I took the steps down to the bar and ducked under it. After I brushed past her, I heard her footsteps following me into the small staff area.</p><p>\u2018What happened?\u2019 Joss asked quietly as I shoved my bag in my locker.</p><p>I turned to her, shrugging off my coat to reveal the same uniform she wore \u2013 a white tank top with CLUB 39 scrawled across the right breast and black skinny jeans that made my long legs look even longer.</p><p>Joss stood before me in all her attitude. Her thick mane of blonde hair was pulled back into a messy ponytail and she gazed at me in concern with her exotic grey feline eyes, her full lips pursed. Joss wasn\u2019t a traditional beauty, but she was sexy. I could see why Braden had fallen for her. Her cool smartassery was so at odds with her unintentional but overt sexuality, any guy would be intrigued. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yeah. We made a pair. And we got good tips.</p><p>\u2018Mum fell out of bed, broke her last bottle of gin, and took her usual tantrum when I said I wouldn\u2019t get more for her. Once she calmed down I had to help her get ready so she could leave the flat to get some booze.\u2019 I snorted bitterly. \u2018Then I had to leave Cole there.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019ll be fine.\u2019</p> <p>I shook my head. \u2018I\u2019ll worry about him all night. You mind if I keep my phone on me?\u2019</p><p>Joss\u2019s brow puckered in consternation. \u2018Of course not. But you know what the solution to that is, right?\u2019</p><p>\u2018A fairy godmother?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019 Her mouth tilted up on one side. \u2018Except instead of a fairy godmother, he\u2019s a suit-wearing fairy caveman.\u2019</p><p>I didn\u2019t get it.</p> <p>\u2018Braden! He\u2019s offered you a job so many times, Jo. Part-time or full-time. Just take it. If you took a full-time position, you\u2019d be working during the day so you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about working nights away from Cole.\u2019</p><p>I tried to feel only gratitude as I strode past her and into the bar and tried very hard to ignore the irritation. \u2018Joss, no.\u2019</p><p>She followed me and I didn\u2019t even have to look at her to know she\u2019d be wearing the mulish expression she used to reserve for when people asked her questions she didn\u2019t want to answer. \u2018Why tell me these things unless you want a solution?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s not a solution,\u2019 I replied quietly, tying the short white apron around my waist. \u2018That\u2019s a handout.\u2019 I shot her a smile to soften the blow of my words.</p><p>My friend clearly wasn\u2019t having any of that tonight. \u2018You know, it took me a long time to figure out that we can\u2019t do everything on our own.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not on my own. I have Cole.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Okay.\u2019 Joss shook her head and took another step in my direction. I turned towards her slightly, my stomach flipping at the edge in her voice. \u2018I\u2019m just going to say it.\u2019</p><p>Brace yourself, Jo.</p><p>\u2018How can you take Malcolm and all those other guys\u2019 help but not a friend\u2019s?\u2019</p><p>Because it\u2019s a totally different thing! \u2018It\u2019s different,\u2019 I told her softly. \u2018It\u2019s just part of being in a relationship with a guy who has money. I\u2019m not good at many things, Joss. I\u2019m not a scholar like Ellie or a writer like you. I\u2019m a girlfriend. I\u2019m a good girlfriend and my boyfriend likes to show his appreciation by being generous with his money.\u2019</p><p>I was surprised by the utter fury that flashed in Joss\u2019s eyes, and I automatically stepped back. \u2018One: there\u2019s much more to you than that. Two: do you realize you pretty much described yourself as a glorified whore?\u2019</p><p>She might as well have punched me. Hurt cut me deep as I reared back from her words, feeling the sting of tears in my eyes. \u2018Joss ...\u2019</p><p>I saw regret pass over her face, and she ducked her head, shaking it. \u2018There\u2019s so much more to you, Jo. How can you be happy to let people think these shitty things about you? Before I knew you, I thought you were a cool girl but a mercenary gold digger. I had you pegged all wrong \u2013 and so does everyone else. And you let them think that. Do you know how many times I wanted to kick Craig in the balls for the way he talked about you? No one respects you, Jo, because you don\u2019t ask for that respect. I\u2019ve only known the truth for a year and I\u2019m finding it hard to hack it. I don\u2019t know how you hack it. I don\u2019t even think you do.\u2019</p><p>Laughter and chatter filtered into the bar from the door and Joss moved away from me in preparation for our first customers. I watched her, feeling shell-shocked and raw ... like someone had scrubbed off the top layer of my skin and I was exposed and bleeding.</p> <p>\u2018I respect you,\u2019 she told me softly. \u2018I do. I know why you do what you do, and I get it. But from one ex-martyr to a current martyr ... get over your bullshit and ask for help.\u2019</p><p>The customers entered the club and I turned to serve them with a bright fake smile, pretending my closest friend in the world hadn\u2019t just called me out on all the things I feared about myself.</p><p>As the night wore on, I was able to push Joss\u2019s opinion to the back of my thoughts, and I flirted with good-looking customers, leaning across the bar to whisper in their ears, giggling at their jokes \u2013 good or inane \u2013 and generally pretending to have the best time in the world.</p><p>The tip jar filled up fast.</p><p>Two seconds after an attractive thirtysomething guy wearing a Breitling sports watch slipped me his number before he left the bar, Joss was at my side shaking up a cocktail.</p><p>Her eyebrow was quirked up in question. \u2018Weren\u2019t you just telling me last night how much you like Malcolm?\u2019</p><p>Still feeling sore from her earlier flaying, I shrugged nonchalantly. \u2018Just keeping my options open.\u2019</p><p>She sighed heavily. \u2018I\u2019m sorry if I hurt your feelings back there.\u2019</p><p>Not acknowledging the apology, not sure I was even ready to, I nodded down the bar. \u2018Your customer is waiting.\u2019</p><p>For the rest of the night I avoided conversation with her and constantly checked my phone in case Cole tried to contact me. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>When the club closed and we\u2019d cleaned up, Joss cornered me as I shrugged my coat on.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re a huge headache, you know that.\u2019 She huffed as she pulled on her own coat.</p><p>I snorted. \u2018That\u2019s the worst apology I\u2019ve ever heard.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry what I said came out so bluntly. But I\u2019m not sorry for saying it.\u2019</p><p>Pulling my bag out of my locker, I shot her a weary look. \u2018You used to let people get on with their lives. You never butted in where you weren\u2019t wanted. I liked that about you.\u2019</p><p>It was Joss\u2019s turn to snort. \u2018Yeah, I know. I liked that about me too. But Braden\u2019s rubbing off on me.\u2019 Her mouth twisted into a grimace. \u2018He has this thing about sticking his nose into the lives of the people he cares about whether they want his nose there or not.\u2019</p><p>I felt some of the hurt from our earlier encounter recede, a warm balm spreading gently over it. \u2018You saying you care about me?\u2019</p><p>Joss grabbed her own bag and strode over to me. Her defiant grey eyes had softened with a surprising amount of emotion. \u2018You\u2019ve turned out to be one of the best people I know and I hate that you\u2019re in such a shitty situation and you won\u2019t let anyone help you. A few months after I met Ellie, she told me she wished I\u2019d trust her more. I finally get how frustrating that must have been for her \u2013 to see that I needed someone and I wouldn\u2019t let her be that person. I feel that way about you, Jo. I see a good person with all her life ahead of her and she\u2019s taking a path to inevitable misery. If I can stop you from making the same mistakes I did ... well, I will.\u2019 She grinned cockily. \u2018So be prepared to be corralled. I\u2019ve learned from the master.\u2019 Her eyes glittered with anticipation. \u2018And he\u2019s waiting outside for me, so I better go.\u2019</p><p>Joss left before I could respond to her threat. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what she meant, but I knew that when she wanted to be, she was the most determined person on the planet. I did not want to be someone she was determined to save.</p><p>It sounded exhausting.</p><p>4</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry, Malcolm. I can\u2019t.\u2019 I felt my heart rate speed up as anxiety crawled into my gut to play kickboxer. I hated turning down his generous offer. Once I started throwing the word \u2018no\u2019 around, things usually went downhill from there.</p><p>\u2018Are you sure?\u2019 he asked quietly on the other end of the line. \u2018It\u2019s not until April. That gives you plenty of time to find someone to look after your mum and Cole for the weekend.\u2019</p><p>Malcolm wanted to take me to Paris. I wanted to be taken to Paris. I\u2019d never been out of Scotland, and I imagined I was like most people my age in that I wanted to see a bit of the world outside the one I\u2019d been raised in.</p><p>But it wouldn\u2019t happen.</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t trust anyone else to look after them.\u2019</p><p>Thankfully, Malcolm\u2019s sigh didn\u2019t sound exasperated and to my surprise it was followed by, \u2018I understand, baby. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019</p><p>Of course I still did. \u2018Are you sure?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Stop worrying.\u2019 Malcolm laughed softly. \u2018It\u2019s not the end of the world, Jo. I like how much you care about your family. It\u2019s admirable.\u2019</p><p>A flush of heat, of pleasure, rose from my chest all the way into my cheeks. \u2018Really?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really.\u2019</p><p>For a moment I didn\u2019t know how to respond. I was relieved that he was being so laid-back about my \u2018no\u2019, but I was still anxious. Only now I was anxious for a different reason.</p><p>My affection for Malcolm was growing deeper by the day. So was my hope.</p><p>The past had taught me that hope was far too fragile a thing to cling to.</p><p>\u2018Jo?\u2019</p><p>Oops. \u2018Sorry. Woolgathering.\u2019</p><p>\u2018About me, I hope.\u2019</p><p>I grinned, and let the purr enter my voice. \u2018I can come over after work tonight to make it up to you.\u2019</p><p>Malcolm\u2019s own voice deepened. \u2018I look forward to it.\u2019</p><p>We hung up and I stared at the phone in my hand. Dammit. I was hoping.</p><p>Hoping that this time it really was going to work out.</p><p>\u2018According to Braden I ambushed you.\u2019</p><p>I glanced up in surprise as I pushed my bag into the locker. It was Friday night and the bar was already in full swing. I was late for work, so I hadn\u2019t had time to really chat with Joss and Alistair, who was covering Craig\u2019s shift and was already manning the bar. I\u2019d ducked out during a lull in the crowds to get a drink of juice and some chewing gum from my bag. \u2018Pardon?\u2019</p><p>Joss leaned against the doorway to the staff room, the music from the bar beating loud behind her. She had a disgruntled look on her face. \u2018I told Braden what I said to you last night and he said I ambushed you.\u2019</p><p>I smiled. \u2018Maybe a little.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He told me I have a lot to learn.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That earned an eyebrow raise. \u2018Apparently so has he.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019 Joss huffed. \u2018He\u2019s sporting a bruise the size of my fist on his upper arm. Condescending asshat.\u2019 She shrugged. \u2018He also, maybe, was kind of, possibly, a little bit right.\u2019</p><p>She looked so uncomfortable it was almost funny. \u2018Joss, you were trying to be a good friend.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Braden says I have to be stealthy. That includes not using the word \u201cwhore\u201d in any capacity.\u2019</p><p>I flinched. \u2018Aye, that would be good.\u2019</p><p>Joss took a step towards me, all her self-assurance seeming to have disappeared. \u2018That came out all wrong last night. You know that, right?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Does this mean you\u2019re keeping your nose out of my business, by any chance?\u2019</p><p>She scoffed. \u2018Yeah, okay.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Joss ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m just going to be better at it. Less ambushing, more corralling.\u2019</p><p>There was that word again. \u2018You know, I would think if you were trying to be \u201cstealthy\u201d you wouldn\u2019t tell me about your intentions to veer me from my \u201cpath of misery\u201d.\u2019</p><p>Joss crossed her arms over her chest, her eyes narrowed on me. \u2018Don\u2019t you air-quote me, woman.\u2019</p><p>I held up my hands in surrender. \u2018Hey, I\u2019m just saying.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ladies!\u2019 Alistair\u2019s head appeared at the doorway into the bar. \u2018A little help!\u2019</p> <p>I grabbed my gum and brushed past Joss. I smiled as I guessed at what was really bothering her. \u2018I\u2019m not mad at you, you know.\u2019 I looked over my shoulder to see her following me.</p><p>She nodded, giving a little shrug as if she didn\u2019t care when she obviously did. Which was why I wasn\u2019t mad at her. \u2018Okay, cool.\u2019</p><p>We hit the bar to see the customers standing all along it.</p><p>\u2018So, you and Cole are still coming to dinner on Sunday?\u2019</p><p>I grinned at her, thinking of the Nichols family and Elodie\u2019s mouthwatering roast dinner. \u2018Wouldn\u2019t miss it.\u2019</p><p>The Nicholses\u2019 home was the kind of home I\u2019d wished Cole and I had been brought up in. Not for the fact that it was this gorgeous period flat in Stockbridge \u2013 although that certainly would have been nice \u2013 but because it was full of warmth and real familial solidarity.</p><p>Elodie Nichols was Ellie\u2019s mum. When she was younger she\u2019d fallen hard for Braden\u2019s dad, Douglas Carmichael, and she\u2019d then fallen pregnant. Douglas had broken things off but offered financial help and a lackadaisical impersonation of a father. Braden had stepped up to the plate, taking his younger half sister under his wing and playing man-child dad/big brother. The two were close \u2013 so close in fact, that Braden was closer to Elodie and her husband, Clark, than he was to his own mother. As for Douglas, he\u2019d died a few years ago, leaving money to Ellie and his businesses to Braden.</p><p>Ellie had two adorable half siblings \u2013 Hannah, who was a year and a half older than Cole, and Declan, who was eleven. Not surprisingly, the two shy teens didn\u2019t spend time with each other when I brought Cole to these dinners. Declan always monopolized Cole\u2019s time anyway \u2013 Declan had a large collection of video games for them to zombify themselves in front of.</p> <p>About eight months ago, Joss had taken me on a night out with Ellie. After five minutes I got the distinct feeling I was being taken under their wing. Ellie immediately asked me to her family\u2019s Sunday dinner (while Joss smirked happily at someone else getting the \u2018Ellie treatment\u2019), insisting that I bring Cole. After two months of dodging the invitation, I finally got to the point where I felt rude declining. I dragged Cole along and we both enjoyed ourselves so much, we tried to make Sunday dinner at the Nicholses\u2019 house whenever we could.</p><p>I loved it because it was the only time Cole and I really got to be ourselves. Whatever Joss had said to the Sunday gang, no one ever asked about Mum, and Cole and I could relax for a few hours each week. Plus, Elodie was the epitome of a mother hen, and having never had that, both my brother and I enjoyed being taken care of for once.</p><p>Sunday dinner included the Nicholses, Ellie and her boyfriend, Adam, Braden and Joss.</p><p>While we waited for dinner to be ready, I usually hung out with Hannah. Looks-wise, Hannah was a smaller version of her gorgeous big sister. Tall for her age, and if she was going to be following exactly in her sister\u2019s footsteps, Hannah had already reached her full height at five foot nine. She was absolutely stunning with short pale blonde hair, wide velvet brown eyes that peered out from under a stylish fringe, and delicate features including an adorable pointed chin. She was going to be a little fuller-figured than I ever would be, already sporting a decent cleavage and a nice curve to her hips. At fifteen-going-on-sixteen she could pass for eighteen, and if it hadn\u2019t been for her shyness, she\u2019d probably have had boys beating down her door and causing Clark no end of aggravation.</p><p>As big a bookworm as I was, Hannah was an even bigger one, hiding behind literature and her schoolwork. I thought it was a shame that she wasn\u2019t more outgoing, since she had an amazing personality. She was sharp as a tack, kind, funny, and a little snarkier than her big sister. I\u2019d taken to sitting in her large bedroom, going through her piles of books while she chatted away to me about everything and nothing.</p><p>\u2018That was a good one,\u2019 Hannah observed and I turned around from her bookshelf to see that she was looking up from her laptop. Apparently I\u2019d done something more interesting than her friends on Facebook.</p><p>\u2018This?\u2019 I waved the teen book at her. I didn\u2019t really read young adult books, but Joss had waxed lyrical about them so I decided to give them a try. Hannah saved me a ton of money, acting as my own personal library.</p><p>She nodded and smiled, a dimple dipping in her left cheek. She really was adorable. \u2018There\u2019s a hot guy in that one.\u2019</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u2018Age?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Twenty-four.\u2019</p><p>Pleasantly surprised, I smiled, flipping through the pages. \u2018Nice. Who knew teen fiction had got so risqu\u00e9?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The main character is eighteen. It\u2019s not gross or anything.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good to know.\u2019 I stood up from my kneeling position and wandered over to her huge bed to flop down beside her. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t want you corrupting my innocence.\u2019</p><p>Hannah chortled. \u2018I think Malcolm\u2019s already done that.\u2019</p><p>I gave a wee huff of amusement. \u2018What would you know about that stuff? A boy caught your eye yet?\u2019</p><p>Of course, I\u2019d expected her to shake her head, frowning like she always did when I asked her this question. To my utter surprise, her pale cheeks flushed red.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>I sat up and pushed her laptop off her lap on to the bed so I could have her full attention. \u2018Tell me everything.\u2019</p><p>She slanted me a look. \u2018You can\u2019t tell anyone. Not Ellie or Joss or Mum \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I promise,\u2019 I replied hurriedly, feeling a bubble of excitement for her. First romances were so exhilarating.</p><p>Making a face at my obvious anticipation, Hannah shook her head. \u2018It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going out with anyone.\u2019</p><p>I grinned. \u2018Then what is it like?\u2019</p><p>She shrugged uncertainly, her eyes suddenly filled with dismay. \u2018He doesn\u2019t like me the same way.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Who doesn\u2019t? How do you know?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s older.\u2019</p><p>Worry stabbed me in the gut. \u2018Older?\u2019</p><p>Hannah must have heard the note of reproach in my voice because she waved my concern away quickly. \u2018He\u2019s just eighteen. He\u2019s in the last year at school.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So how did you meet?\u2019 Although I was willing to be a friend to Hannah, I also wanted the details so I could figure out whether there was reason to be concerned or not. Hannah was a young fifteen when it came to boys and I didn\u2019t want anyone taking advantage of her.</p><p>Relaxing, Hannah turned towards me, getting more comfortable with confiding her boy story to me. \u2018Last year these boys started to make fun of me and my friends. We didn\u2019t really bother when we were together. It was just names, and they\u2019re just a bunch of idiots who skip school and bully everyone who actually likes school.\u2019 She rolled her eyes at the stupidity of the young male species. \u2018Anyway, one day last year I missed the bus, so I began walking home. They followed me.\u2019</p><p>I gripped her duvet cover, my eyes wide. \u2018Di\u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s okay.\u2019 She cut me off, reassuring me. \u2018Marco stopped them.\u2019</p><p>My lips twitched as I tried to contain my smile at the dreamy way she said his name. \u2018Marco?\u2019</p><p>She nodded, her smile more than a little bashful. \u2018His dad is African American but his mum\u2019s family is Italian American with family in Scotland. He\u2019s from Chicago but he moved here last year to live with his aunt and uncle. He was with a couple of friends and he saw the boys following me and taunting me. He scared the guys off, introduced himself, and then walked me home even though it was in the opposite direction from his place.\u2019</p><p>So far, so good.</p><p>I nodded, encouraging her to continue.</p><p>\u2018He told me anytime I missed the bus he would walk me home. He started hanging around with his friends at the end of school and waiting to see if I got on the bus. The couple of times I missed it, he was true to his word and walked me home.\u2019</p><p>What was this kid after? \u2018So has he asked you out?\u2019</p><p>Hannah heaved a dramatic sigh. \u2018That\u2019s the thing. He really is just looking out for me, like I\u2019m a wee sister or something.\u2019</p><p>Okay, maybe he really was just a good kid. \u2018Is it your shyness? Do you not talk to him?\u2019</p><p>Hannah laughed, such a grown-up sound of tart amusement I had to remind myself for a second I was talking to a teenager. \u2018That\u2019s the thing. I clam up around other boys, and you\u2019d think with how hot he is, I wouldn\u2019t be able to talk to him. But he makes it really easy. He\u2019s really down to earth.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How do you know he doesn\u2019t fancy you?\u2019</p><p>Her cheeks flushed a deeper red than before and she bit her lip, her eyes flickering away from mine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Hannah?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I may have mmmhed imm,\u2019 she mumbled.</p><p>I leaned closer, suspecting I already knew the answer to my next question, \u2018What was that?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I may have kissed him,\u2019 she answered grumpily, her cheeks brightening again.</p><p>I grinned teasingly. Little Hannah had her sister\u2019s impulsiveness when it came to her crushes. Ellie had told me all about the night she\u2019d thrown herself at Adam. Adam was Braden\u2019s best friend, and out of respect to Braden had held Ellie at arm\u2019s length for a long time. Ellie had not made it easy on him. \u2018How did that go?\u2019</p><p>Hannah\u2019s brow puckered as she stared at the ground. \u2018He kissed me back.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yay!\u2019 I punched the air like a goofy idiot.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 Hannah shook her head at me. \u2018He then pushed me away, didn\u2019t say a word, and has avoided me for the last month.\u2019</p> <p>Feeling my chest ache at how crestfallen she looked, I slid my arm around her shoulders and hugged her to my side. \u2018Hannah, you are beautiful and funny and smart and there are going to be a ton of boys who won\u2019t push you away.\u2019</p><p>I knew how empty my words were. There were no words that helped ease the pain of teenage unrequited love, but Hannah hugged me back, appreciating my efforts nonetheless.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 Ellie\u2019s worried voice brought our heads up. She stood in the doorway, her slender arms crossed over her chest, her eyes creased in concern. Her blonde hair was much shorter than it used to be. For weeks after her surgery she\u2019d worn head scarves to cover the patch of hair that had been shaved. As the hair grew in, she\u2019d chopped it all off into a sexy pixie cut that she absolutely hated. It was now chin length and as \u00fcber chic as Hannah\u2019s.</p><p>I felt Hannah tense against me, obviously afraid that I would share the news about her secret crush on the elusive Marco. I sympathized with her. He did sound intriguing. It was bad enough moping after a mysterious African American, Italian American, Scottish Italian hottie, without your annoying family knowing all about it. \u2018I was just telling Hannah all about my first love, John, and how he broke my heart. She was giving me a hug to say she was sorry.\u2019</p><p>Hannah\u2019s fingers squeezed my waist in thank-you as Ellie\u2019s eyes grew round. \u2018You\u2019ve never told me about John.\u2019</p><p>Not wanting to actually get into it, I sat up on the bed, pulling Hannah with me. \u2018Another time. The smell of food is wafting up the stairs, which means it\u2019s almost ready.\u2019</p> <p>Ellie looked a little disappointed as she led us out of the room. \u2018I know! We\u2019ll have a girls\u2019 night in this month and we can talk about our first loves.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aren\u2019t you and Joss dating yours?\u2019</p><p>Her mouth turned down at the corners. \u2018Just yours, then?\u2019</p><p>I grimaced. \u2018Sounds like a real good time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Every time you hang out with Hannah, you get a little more sarcastic. I\u2019m banning you from her company.\u2019</p><p>Hannah grinned happily at the thought that she might have influenced me, and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh, affection filling my chest with warmth. \u2018Only wild horses, Ellie. Only wild horses.\u2019</p><p>Once we were seated around the table, Elodie clucked around us, making sure we all had what we needed.</p><p>\u2018Are you sure you don\u2019t want any more gravy, Jo?\u2019 she asked, the gravy boat hovering precariously in the air in her light grasp.</p> <p>I smiled around a potato and shook my head.</p><p>\u2018Cole?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, thank you, Mrs Nichols.\u2019</p><p>He made my heart hurt with his beautiful manners, and I nudged him with an elbow, grinning at him. Cole flicked me a look that clearly said, \u2018You\u2019re such an idiot\u2019 and continued to eat.</p><p>\u2018What were you and Hannah talking about in her room for so long?\u2019 Elodie asked as she settled back in her seat at the end of the table. Clark sat at the opposite end. Ellie, Adam, Joss and Braden sat across from me, while I was between Cole and Hannah, and Declan was on Cole\u2019s other side. I could tell Elodie was pretending she didn\u2019t really care what we had been talking about but in truth was dying to know.</p><p>\u2018Books,\u2019 Hannah and I answered in unison, causing Clark to chuckle.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t about books.\u2019 Adam threw Hannah a boyish smile and she blushed. These girls and their susceptibility to a roguish Scotsman ... I was suddenly thankful Malcolm wasn\u2019t the least bit roguish. All that angst and drama? Does he like me, doesn\u2019t he? Is he just flirting? No, thank you!</p><p>\u2018How cannily deduced, Adam.\u2019 Braden\u2019s mouth twitched as he took a sip of coffee.</p><p>Joss smiled around her fork.</p><p>Adam shot an unimpressed look down the table at his friend. \u2018I think we need to come up with a child-friendly phrase for f-u-c-k off.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Duck off?\u2019 Cole suggested.</p><p>\u2018Exactly.\u2019 Adam gestured with his fork. \u2018Braden, duck off, you sarcastic dastard.\u2019</p><p>Ellie giggled. \u2018Dastard?\u2019</p><p>\u2018 \u201cBastard\u201d with a \u201cD\u201d,\u2019 Hannah supplied helpfully.</p><p>Clark\u2019s laugh was cut short by Elodie\u2019s huff of outrage. \u2018Hannah Nichols.\u2019 She sucked in her breath. \u2018Don\u2019t you dare say that word again.\u2019</p><p>Hannah gave a long-suffering sigh. \u2018It\u2019s just a word, Mum. It means a person whose parents weren\u2019t married when they were born. We only make the word offensive by implying that there is something morally wrong about that. Are you suggesting it\u2019s morally wrong to have a child out of wedlock?\u2019</p><p>Silence reigned around the table as we all looked at Hannah in mischievous glee.</p><p>Elodie made a little spluttering sound, breaking that silence as she turned sharply to skewer Clark to his seat with her blazing gaze. \u2018Say something, Clark.\u2019</p><p>Clark nodded at his wife and then turned to his daughter. \u2018I think you should have joined the debating team after all, sweetheart.\u2019</p><p>Braden\u2019s deep laugh was a catalyst for the rest of us. We all chuckled and Elodie\u2019s grimace melted as our good humour got to her. She sighed wearily. \u2018My fault for raising a clever girl, I suppose.\u2019</p><p>She was more than clever. Hannah was a superstar and I was glad she was surrounded by people who told her every day how special she was.</p><p>Chatter filled the room as we broke off into separate conversations. I was just asking Cole if he\u2019d finished the comic he\u2019d been working on when Joss said my name.</p><p>I looked over at her and saw her eyes dancing with mischief. I immediately went on the defensive. \u2018Yeah?\u2019</p><p>She smiled saucily. \u2018Guess who was at the bar last night.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019d always been crap at guessing games. \u2018Who?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hot guy from the shitty art show.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hot guy?\u2019 Braden turned from his conversation with Clark.</p><p>Joss rolled her eyes. \u2018Nothing more than an adjective and a noun put together, I promise.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What hot guy?\u2019 Ellie peered past Adam to look at Joss, completely cutting off whatever her mum had been saying to her.</p><p>\u2018There was this hot \u2013\u2019 She caught herself. \u2018I mean a guy who may or may not have been marginally attractive. I wouldn\u2019t know because I don\u2019t notice the hotness of any guy but my wonderful and oh-so-handsome boyfriend, who fills me with such \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, no need to lay it on so thick.\u2019 Braden bumped her with his shoulder and she fluttered her eyelashes at him in mock innocence before turning back to Ellie.</p><p>\u2018There was this guy at the art gallery thing that you missed and he was checking out Jo.\u2019 Joss\u2019s gaze swept over the table to land back on me. \u2018Turns out Cam was in need of a job and Jo got him one at the bar. I was showing him the ropes last night.\u2019</p><p>Well, that had been fast. I felt my stomach flip at the thought of having to work with Cam, at having to see him again. \u2018He\u2019s Becca\u2019s boyfriend. She asked it as a favour.\u2019</p><p>Joss nodded. \u2018He told me. He seems like a really nice guy.\u2019 No one could miss the enthusiasm in her voice and I knew exactly what she was up to. Was this part of Joss\u2019s corralling? Trying to play matchmaker with some random guy just because she saw us checking each other out? I blamed Ellie. This was clearly her influence.</p><p>\u2018Should I be worried?\u2019 Braden asked the table, and I laughed, some of the tension easing out of me.</p><p>Joss waved him off as if his question was idiotic. \u2018I\u2019m just saying that our new colleague was very cool and it will be nice for Jo to have someone new to work with.\u2019</p><p>Ellie frowned. \u2018Why are you speaking like that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s trying to set me up with Cam even though I have a boyfriend. And he has a girlfriend. Not to mention that when we talked Cam treated me like I was a piece of dirt.\u2019 There. I\u2019d said it.</p><p>Braden\u2019s brows drew together, a dark glint in his eyes that I\u2019m sure I\u2019d see in Adam\u2019s too if I took the time to look. \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019 Joss leaned forward on her elbows, her \u2018whose ass do I need to kick?\u2019 face on. \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019</p><p>I shrugged, suddenly uncomfortable with all the attention. I was especially uncomfortable with how tense Cole had got. I could feel his expectant gaze on me. \u2018He just wasn\u2019t very nice.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And yet you got him a job?\u2019 Elodie asked, clearly confused.</p><p>\u2018He needed it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, he seemed perfectly nice last night and he said he was grateful to you for giving Su his number.\u2019</p><p>Now it was my turn to frown. \u2018He did?\u2019</p><p>Joss nodded, relaxing back into her chair. \u2018Maybe you misunderstood.\u2019</p><p>No, I hadn\u2019t misunderstood Cam\u2019s attitude, but since I now found myself surrounded by two overprotective men, one overprotective wee brother and an overprotective best friend, I\u2019d decided it was better to go along with that. \u2018Yeah, you\u2019re probably right.\u2019</p><p>Silence fell over the table for a second and then ...</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s very interesting,\u2019 Joss murmured, chewing on a piece of succulent chicken. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Who?\u2019 Ellie asked.</p><p>\u2018Cam.\u2019</p><p>Braden choked on a sip of coffee.</p> <p>\u2018Joss,\u2019 I groaned. \u2018Stop. I\u2019m dating Malcolm.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, is Joss trying to play matchmaker?\u2019 Elodie finally caught on. When I nodded, she wrinkled her nose at Jocelyn. \u2018You\u2019re not very good at it.\u2019</p><p>Affronted, Joss sniffed. \u2018Well, give me a break, it\u2019s my first time.\u2019</p><p>Hannah giggled into her water. \u2018That\u2019s what she said.\u2019</p><p>We all froze again in silence and then Adam spluttered, choking on his laughter. Just like that, he set us all off like dominoes around the table. All except Elodie, who sat back in her chair with a totally bemused look on her face. \u2018What? What did I miss?\u2019</p> <p>5</p><p>By the time my shift came around on Tuesday night, I\u2019d managed to work myself into a bit of a state. As always, it was a rush to get home from my day job, scarf down the macaroni cheese Cole had made, get washed and changed into my bar uniform, make sure Cole had done his homework and Mum was still alive, and then head off to the bar.</p><p>I\u2019d been dreading it the entire day.</p><p>Butterflies flurried in my stomach as I gave Brian and our doorman a tight smile. I didn\u2019t stop to chat with them, desperate to get the first meeting with Cam over with. I passed through the entrance and braced myself to enter the club. As soon as I did, I stopped, my gaze frozen on the guy behind the bar.</p><p>Cam.</p><p>He stood, leaning his elbows on the black granite countertop and his head was bent over a napkin he appeared to be sketching on. His messy dark blond hair fell carelessly into his eyes. I watched as he brushed it away and I noticed a masculine Indian silver ring on the ring finger of his right hand as it winked under the lights. He looked just the same as the last time I\u2019d seen him \u2013 same unkempt sexiness, same aviator watch and leather bracelets. His T-shirt was the only change. He wore the slim-cut white T-shirt with CLUB 39 scrawled across the chest that all the guys had to wear. It was the chest and shoulders, even when hunched over, that seemed much broader than I remembered.</p> <p>I took another step and the sound of my boot on the floor brought Cam\u2019s head up.</p><p>My breath hitched as our eyes collided.</p><p>Heat suffused my cheeks at my body\u2019s instant reaction to this man\u2019s attention. I could feel my breasts swell and my lower belly squeeze, and as we continued to stare at each other in intense silence, my mind and body went to war. My body was panting, \u2018He\u2019s hot. Can we have him?\u2019 while my mind was screaming, \u2018Oh, dear God, what the hell are you thinking?\u2019</p><p>Everything had blurred around me \u2013 the only thing in sharp focus was Cam and all the places where I wanted to feel his touch.</p><p>Malcolm\u2019s face suddenly floated before my eyes and I flinched, breaking whatever bizarre spell we\u2019d fallen under.</p><p>I gave Cam a tight smile and strode towards him, my eyes glued in front of me and very deliberately nowhere near him.</p><p>Cam had other plans. As I lifted the counter to join him behind the bar, he stepped in front of the doorway to the staff room, blocking my way. I stared at his black engineer boots for a second and then, realizing I must look like a total idiot, I let my gaze travel north. His arms were crossed over his chest as he leaned against the doorframe and I couldn\u2019t work out what his expression meant at all. He was worse than Joss. If Joss didn\u2019t want you to know what she was feeling, she\u2019d slam down this blank mask over her face. It seemed Cam had bought his mask from the same store as Joss.</p><p>\u2018Hullo.\u2019 I waved.</p> <p>I actually waved.</p><p>Oh Jesus, let the floor open up and swallow me.</p><p>Cam\u2019s lips twitched. \u2018Hi.\u2019</p><p>Why was this so awkward? Usually, I could flirt and charm the pants off any man. I\u2019d suddenly reverted to acting like a reticent seven-year-old. \u2018So you got the job, then?\u2019 No, Jo, he\u2019s just here for the banter. I rolled my eyes inwardly at myself.</p><p>If he had an equally sarcastic thought, he was gracious enough not to verbalize it. \u2018I did.\u2019</p><p>What was with the one-word answers? My mouth twisted as I remembered his wordy assault on me last time we\u2019d met. \u2018You were a lot more loquacious last time we spoke.\u2019</p><p>Cam raised an eyebrow. \u2018 \u201cLoquacious\u201d? Does someone have a Word of the Day calendar?\u2019</p><p>So much for gracious. I tried to ignore the wince of hurt at his teasing remark. But that was hard to do when someone\u2019s teasing felt a lot more like mocking. I glared at him. \u2018I do.\u2019 I brushed past him, my elbow hitting him in the arm as I headed into the staff room. \u2018Yesterday\u2019s word was \u201casshole\u201d.\u2019 As I opened my locker I felt a sense of pride at having stood up for myself with him again. My body still trembled, though. I was not good at confrontation and I didn\u2019t want to have to be. I resented his presence in my life already.</p><p>\u2018Okay, I deserved that.\u2019</p><p>I shot a look over my shoulder and saw that he\u2019d followed me into the room. In the brighter light, his cobalt blue eyes glittered at me enigmatically. He was sporting stubble. Did the man ever shave? Damn him. I dropped my gaze and turned away from him.</p><p>\u2018I actually wanted to thank you for giving Su my number.\u2019</p><p>I nodded, balancing my bag half in, half out of my locker, pretending to riffle through it for something.</p><p>\u2018She said you recommended me.\u2019</p><p>My bag was exceptionally interesting. Receipt for Mr Meikle\u2019s sandwich and soup, chewing gum, tampons, pen, a leaflet a street person had given to me about some band ...</p><p>\u2018She said, and I quote, \u201cJo\u2019s right \u2013 you are hot.\u201d \u2019</p><p>I flushed, just barely choking back the groan of embarrassment. I shoved my bag in the locker and slipped my phone into my pocket. Taking a deep breath, I told myself I could do this. I could work with this annoying asswipe. I spun around and almost lost my footing at the playful grin on his face. It was quite possibly the \u2018nicest\u2019 look I\u2019d received from him yet.</p><p>I hated him then.</p><p>Not once in my life had I ever been physically attracted to a guy who was so utterly horrible to me. I knew, though, that once I spent more time with him, his bad attitude would shave the attraction down to nothing. It was just a matter of patience. For now, I threw back my shoulders, inserting a little flirtation into my smile as I passed him. \u2018I said \u201cpretty hot\u201d.\u2019</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s a difference?\u2019 he asked, following me into the bar.</p><p>It occurred to me that it was Tuesday night. A slow night. That meant it would be just the two of us working together.</p><p>Great.</p><p>\u2018 \u201cPretty hot\u201d is a few levels lower on the scale than \u201chot\u201d.\u2019 I didn\u2019t look at him as I tied the tiny apron around my waist, but I could feel his gaze warm on my face.</p><p>\u2018Well, whatever you said, I appreciate it.\u2019</p><p>I nodded but still wouldn\u2019t look at him. Instead I slipped my phone out of my pocket just to double-check that I didn\u2019t have a message from Cole. Nothing.</p><p>\u2018Are you allowed to have that?\u2019</p><p>I glanced over at him now, a furrow of confusion between my eyebrows. \u2018What?\u2019</p><p>Cam gestured to my phone.</p><p>\u2018I keep it on me. It doesn\u2019t seem to bother anybody else.\u2019</p><p>He smirked and reached for the napkin and pen he\u2019d left on the counter. He tucked the napkin into his jeans pocket before I could see what he\u2019d been drawing, and slid the pen behind his ear. \u2018Oh, of course. Wouldn\u2019t want to miss the latest gossip.\u2019</p><p>I grunted, and grabbed a dishcloth to give my hands something to do. Otherwise I was going to wrap them around his bloody neck.</p><p>\u2018Or sexting from Malcolm \u2013 also known as the cash point.\u2019</p><p>My blood ignited. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019d been this mad at anyone. Oh, wait. Yes I could. It had been at Cam only a week before. I spun around to face him, my eyes narrowed as he leaned back against the bar, his expression taunting and arrogant. \u2018Has anyone ever told you, you are the most despicable, judgemental, self-righteous, obnoxious fuckwit that ever existed?\u2019 My chest rose and fell with my rage.</p><p>Cam\u2019s expression darkened, his gaze flickering over my chest before trailing back up to my face. His scrutiny just made me flush even more. \u2018Careful, sweetheart. You\u2019ll use up your entire calendar of words in a night if you keep this up.\u2019</p><p>I closed my eyes, my hands clenched into fists at my sides. I had never been a violent person; in fact I abhorred violence. Since my dad had been too handy with the slaps and punches when I was a kid, I always froze when someone got too aggressive with me. Despite all that, I had never wanted to throw something at someone as much as I wanted to throw something at Cam.</p><p>\u2018A heads-up.\u2019 Cam\u2019s deep voice washed over me. \u2018So you\u2019re not too disappointed that Disney lied \u2013 no matter how much you wish it, I\u2019ll still be here when you open your eyes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I forgot to say condescending,\u2019 I muttered unhappily. \u2018Despicable, judgemental, self-righteous, obnoxious, condescending fuckwit.\u2019</p><p>At the warm sound of his laughter, my eyes popped open. He was smiling again. He must have noted my surprise because he shrugged. \u2018So I might have been wrong about you being stupid.\u2019</p><p>No, I wasn\u2019t stupid. But I wasn\u2019t educated. I hadn\u2019t finished school or gone to university. And that just made me even more uneasy around him. If he found out, it would be just the ammunition he needed to torment me more. I was saved from having to continue our conversation as voices filtered into the club. The first customers arrived and we were soon too busy serving them to say anything more to each other. I watched Cam out of the corner of my eye to see how he was doing, but he was absolutely fine. An old pro at bartending.</p><p>A couple of times our bodies brushed each other and I felt like I\u2019d been hit with a bolt of electricity. I also finally got a good look at his tattoo. It was a fierce black and purple dragon \u2013 the body and wings curled around his biceps, the long scaly neck and head inked on the top half of his forearm. The artistry on it was amazing. However, I couldn\u2019t make out the script on his other arm without drawing attention to the fact that I was looking. Not that I thought he wasn\u2019t aware of my attention. Nor was I unaware of his. The worst moment came when I poured a draught of lager at the taps, and Cam leaned past me for some napkins that sat on the lowest shelf behind the bar. It brought his body up against mine. I inhaled the masculine scent of bay rum and soap as he leaned down, and then I stopped breathing altogether. His face was at eye level with my chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My whole body tensed, I was so hyperaware of him.</p><p>Prolonging the torturous moment, Cam\u2019s fingers missed the napkins and he had to lean back in, his cheek brushing my right boob.</p><p>I sucked in a breath and he froze momentarily.</p> <p>When he straightened, I chanced a glance up at him from under my lashes and the darkly sexual glint in his eyes felt like a physical caress down my stomach towards my sex. My sensitive nipples peaked against my bra. Uh-oh. Oh, my.</p><p>Cam\u2019s jaw clenched and he backed away. I finally came to my senses, only to discover the draught had overflowed over the glass and my fingers, and I had to start again.</p><p>After that I tried to avoid any sort of physical contact with him. I\u2019d never felt so intensely attracted to someone before. Usually, it took me a while to get to know a guy before I felt that kind of deep tingling in all my good-for-nothing places. Why did this guy have to cause such a visceral reaction in me?</p><p>The night plodded on, broken up between bursts of customers and quiet lulls. It was during one of those lulls that I slipped my phone out and checked it again. I had a text from Cole telling me the fuse in the plug for the toaster had blown and we didn\u2019t have any in the flat. I texted him back to let him know I\u2019d get one tomorrow. I just hoped I remembered.</p><p>\u2018Is it the guy from the other night or Malcolm?\u2019</p> <p>I shoved my phone back out of sight and when I looked up Cam was sneering at me.</p><p>Well, if he wanted to believe the worst in me, let him. \u2018It\u2019s the guy. His name is Cole.\u2019</p><p>The sneer morphed into a glower. \u2018How can you be so brazen?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Probably the same way you can be such a prick.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Whoa, Jo!\u2019</p><p>Startled, my head whipped to the side, following the familiar voice. Joss stood on the other side of the bar with Ellie at her back. The two girls stared at me open-mouthed, although Joss\u2019s lips were beginning to curl up at the corners. She looked at Cam. \u2018You must have really pissed her off. It takes a lot to make Jo insult someone.\u2019</p> <p>Cam grunted. \u2018That\u2019s funny. I\u2019ve lost count of her insults.\u2019</p><p>Joss looked back at me, her grey eyes glowing with pride. \u2018Johanna Walker, you just hit a new level of awesome.\u2019</p><p>I chuckled, my cheeks still flushed with embarrassment that I\u2019d been caught swearing at Cam. \u2018Only you would praise me for calling someone a prick.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, no, I would too,\u2019 Ellie added, sliding closer to the bar, her eyes more assessing as she looked at Cam. \u2018Especially if the person deserved it.\u2019</p><p>I almost laughed at Joss and Ellie\u2019s role reversal. Ellie was usually the one who gave everyone the benefit of the doubt, but she looked a little wary of Cam. I could only assume it was because she\u2019d never seen me get riled up at someone before and thought there must be a good reason for it. She\u2019d be right.</p><p>Joss\u2019s eyes danced as they searched my face and then Cam\u2019s. \u2018Els, this is Cameron MacCabe. Just call him Cam. Cam, this is my friend Ellie.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your boyfriend\u2019s sister?\u2019 Cam asked casually, as he stepped towards them.</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019</p> <p>He stuck his hand out to Ellie, a friendly, gorgeous smile on his face that made my heart thump. A painful ache pierced my chest. He hadn\u2019t smiled at me like that. \u2018Nice to meet you, Ellie.\u2019</p><p>Apparently, Ellie wasn\u2019t immune to his charm \u2013 she beamed back at him, all her wariness disappearing. She shook his hand. \u2018Joss says you\u2019re a graphic designer?\u2019</p><p>A customer came up to the bar, so I served him while Cam spoke with my friends. I managed to listen to the customer with one ear and to Cam with the other.</p><p>\u2018Aye, but I\u2019m struggling to find a job here. If I don\u2019t get one soon I might have to leave Edinburgh.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, that would be a shame.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Any luck finding an apartment?\u2019 Joss asked him, and I suddenly realized that the two of them must have got along well enough on Saturday night to manage a real conversation during the busy hours.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve seen a few I\u2019m interested in. None as nice as the place I have now, but you have to live where you can afford to, right?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What about Becca?\u2019 I asked before I could stop myself. I handed my customer his change and waited for Cam\u2019s answer.</p><p>Cam\u2019s brows drew together as he looked at me. \u2018What about Becca?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019d been to Becca\u2019s flat for a party. It was a huge place in Bruntsfield and she shared it with three other people. Still, I thought there must be room for Cam. \u2018She\u2019s got that big old place on Leamington Terrace. Surely there\u2019s room for you.\u2019</p><p>He gave a sharp jerk of his head in rejection to the suggestion. \u2018We\u2019ve only been dating a month.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How did you meet?\u2019 Ellie asked. I wasn\u2019t surprised. Ellie was a hopeless romantic and looked for a love story wherever she could.</p><p>My stomach flipped unpleasantly as I thought of Cam and Becca creating a love story together.</p><p>What was wrong with me? I was with Malcolm and Cam was a bloody pain in the butt.</p><p>\u2018A party a friend hosted.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You must get on well, what with Becca being an artist too?\u2019</p><p>His mouth quirked up at the corner. \u2018We have a difference of opinion on what constitutes art, but aye, we get on well enough.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Meaning you\u2019re just as condescending to your girlfriend as you are to me?\u2019 I grumbled and subsequently ignored Joss\u2019s little noise of amusement.</p><p>Cam flashed me a surprisingly coaxing smile. \u2018You were there, Jo. Don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t think her art was shit.\u2019</p><p>Joss laughed outright while I just shook my head, trying not to encourage him with an answering grin. \u2018You\u2019re supposed to be her boyfriend. You\u2019re supposed to support her, not take the piss out of her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve met Becca, right? Like she needs anyone else blowing smoke up her arse. The girl\u2019s the most arrogant person I\u2019ve ever met.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wait \u2013\u2019 Ellie looked confused. \u2018You don\u2019t sound like you like her very much.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course I do,\u2019 Cam grunted. He shrugged and shot Ellie a roguish smile. \u2018I find her arrogance sexy ... as well as amusing.\u2019</p><p>I looked away, pretending interest in the customers out on the small dance floor. I wondered if Malcolm felt that way about Becca. And if he did, how did I fare in comparison? Unexceptional and insecure?</p><p>God, I hoped not.</p><p>\u2018You okay, Jo?\u2019 Joss asked, bringing my gaze back to them. They were all staring at me, including Cam.</p><p>I nodded, giving Joss a soft, reassuring smile. \u2018Sure.\u2019</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u2018Is Cole okay?\u2019</p><p>I flinched inwardly, aware of Cam\u2019s body tensing at the mention of Cole\u2019s name. I didn\u2019t want him to know the truth about Cole. If he was so determined to see what everybody else saw when they looked at me, then I didn\u2019t want to change his misconception. \u2018He\u2019s fine.\u2019 I didn\u2019t elaborate, hoping she\u2019d drop the subject.</p><p>Of course Joss didn\u2019t. \u2018He seemed quieter than usual on Sunday. Is everything okay with him?\u2019</p><p>Yes, now shut up! \u2018Of course.\u2019</p><p>Ellie threw me a sympathetic look. \u2018When Hannah hit fourteen she went into classic teen mode. Moody and quiet. It\u2019s worse when they\u2019re shy like Hannah and Cole because when they\u2019re feeling down about something they become so introverted.\u2019</p><p>Crap.</p><p>Cam straightened to his full height so that he stood a few inches taller than me. His eyebrows were raised in question. \u2018Fourteen?\u2019</p><p>Thank you, Joss and Ellie.</p><p>\u2018Cole,\u2019 Joss explained to him, seeming way too eager to share information about me with him. I was seriously considering giving both Ellie and Braden a lump of coal for their Christmas present this year as a thank-you for turning Joss into a normal person who annoyed her friends with her terrible matchmaking skills. \u2018Jo\u2019s little brother. She takes care of him.\u2019</p><p>Cam\u2019s gaze sliced to me, his eyes sharp as he took me in, in all my new colours.</p><p>Yes, Cam, I read and write and I have a pretty good vocabulary. I\u2019m not cheating on my rich boyfriend. I\u2019m being a responsible adult to the teenager under my care. There go all your little preconceived notions. Asshole.</p><p>I shrugged at the questions in his eyes.</p><p>As for Joss, she could not be stopped. \u2018We all let Jo keep her phone on her in case Cole needs her, so cut her a little slack if you see her checking it obsessively. She\u2019s a little overprotective. She\u2019s a really good sister.\u2019</p><p>Would you stop pimping me out! I threw an accusatory look at Ellie, whose eyes grew round with confusion. \u2018I blame you,\u2019 I told her.</p><p>Ellie sighed, the confusion melting from her gaze as understanding dawned. \u2018Would it help if I trained her better?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It would help if you hit the RESET button on her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hey,\u2019 Joss protested.</p><p>Ellie shook her head vehemently. \u2018No, I like the new Jocelyn.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, I\u2019m lost.\u2019 Cam\u2019s gaze bounced back and forth between us.</p><p>Yeah, if only you\u2019d stay lost. \u2018Never mind.\u2019 I shook my head and looked at Joss. \u2018What are you doing here tonight anyway?\u2019</p><p>Joss smiled wickedly. \u2018Just checking in.\u2019</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help the irritation that settled into my eyes and Ellie choked on her laughter. \u2018I think it\u2019s time we checked out.\u2019 She took hold of a reluctant Joss and tugged on her arm.</p><p>\u2018Fine,\u2019 Joss muttered, her calculating gaze shifting between me and Cam. \u2018Jo, tell Cam about Cole\u2019s comic books.\u2019</p><p>I groaned inwardly. \u2018Goodnight, Joss. \u2019Night, Els.\u2019</p><p>Ellie waved and ushered Joss out of the bar.</p><p>Even though the conversation around us was a wordless babble of noise above the music, silence reigned within the bubble containing me and Cam behind the bar. No noise could penetrate the thick tension between us.</p><p>Finally Cam took a step towards me. For the first time since I\u2019d met him (and it was weird to realize that I\u2019d met him only twice, since it seemed like we\u2019d known each other a lot longer), Cam looked uncomfortable. \u2018So ... Cole\u2019s your wee brother, then?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Screw you. I stared at him blankly, trying to decide what I should say. Finally, I came to the conclusion that it would be better if Cam and I remained at a distance. No matter how much Joss wanted him to see me in a different light, I didn\u2019t want him to. He\u2019d jumped to his conclusions like everyone else, and frankly I didn\u2019t want to be on friendly terms with someone who had taken to tearing me down, and that was before he had got to know me. I sighed and strode past him. \u2018I\u2019m going on my break.\u2019</p><p>Cam didn\u2019t answer me.</p><p>And for the rest of the night he endured my cold-shoulder treatment in tight-lipped silence.</p> <p>6</p><p>As I had been on every Wednesday that had come before it, I was shattered the next day. My Tuesday shift at Club 39 followed by my Wednesday day shift at Meikle &amp; Young was the worst part of my week. I shared the job as personal assistant to Mr Meikle with another girl called Lucy. I had never met Lucy, but we left little messages all the time to let each other know what had been done and what still needed to be done, so I felt like I knew her. She always put smiley faces at the end of any request so it didn\u2019t come off as a demand. I thought that was nice and often wondered if Mr Meikle was pleasant to the girl with the smiley faces. I hoped so.</p><p>He certainly wasn\u2019t pleasant to me.</p><p>That morning I\u2019d almost managed to get everything right. With three hours to go in the workday, I had been sitting franking mail that was to go out that night, trying to get Cam\u2019s stupid, arrogant voice out of my head, when Mr Meikle came out of his office and obnoxiously waved a letter in my face.</p><p>As I gazed up at him from my seat I wondered for a second if his problem with me had something to do with my height. I was a good three inches taller than he was, and he always looked rather nonplussed when we were standing together, and smug whenever I was sitting and he was standing over me. \u2018Sir?\u2019 I asked, my eyes crossing as I tried to make out what the bloody hell he was dangling before me.</p> <p>\u2018I was about to sign the letter you were sending out to this client, Joanne, when I discovered two errors.\u2019 His face was red with frustration as he pulled the paper back to shove two fingers in my face. \u2018Two.\u2019</p><p>I blanched. Damn my lack of sleep. \u2018Sorry, Mr Meikle, I\u2019ll fix that right away.\u2019</p><p>He harrumphed and slapped the letter on my desk. \u2018It had better be perfect. Lucy can always manage it, for goodness\u2019 sake.\u2019 He strode back to his office and then snapped around, his eyes narrowed behind his glasses. \u2018I thought I had two appointments this afternoon, Joanne?\u2019</p><p>I had worked for Mr Meikle for almost two years now, so it was long past the appropriate time to correct him on my name. He\u2019d called me Joanne instead of Johanna since the beginning, despite the fact that he was the one who handed me my wage slip every month. The wage slip that clearly said \u2018Miss Johanna Walker\u2019 on it. Numpty.</p><p>\u2018Yes, sir.\u2019 In fact one of his appointments was with Malcolm. \u2018You have Mr Hendry in fifteen minutes and a four o\u2019clock appointment with Mrs Drummond.\u2019</p><p>Without another word he slammed back inside his office. I stared at his door and then at the letter he\u2019d slapped on my desk. Turning it over, I noted he\u2019d circled the two errors in red pen. I\u2019d missed the apostrophe in \u2018Meikle &amp; Young\u2019s\u2019 and had missed the colon after \u2018telephone number\u2019. \u2018Pedantic twit,\u2019 I muttered, pushing my chair back to the desk. It took me only seconds to find the file on the computer, fix the errors and print the corrected version off. I left it with him without a word and closed his office door behind me.</p> <p>The firm rented its space on the first floor of one of the old Georgian buildings on Melville Street. The street was quintessential Edinburgh \u2013 picture-perfect period properties with their black wrought-iron fencing and shiny big doors. Mr Young\u2019s office and reception area were in the front of the converted flat, and two other accountants\u2019 offices were across the hall from Mr Meikle\u2019s. Meikle\u2019s reception area had a large window that looked down over the street. So did his office. It was a pity his personality didn\u2019t match the refined elegance of the firm\u2019s residence.</p><p>When Malcolm walked in, I hurriedly clicked the solitaire game off my screen so he couldn\u2019t see I was mucking around, and I beamed at him, pleased to see him. This was where I\u2019d met him.</p><p>After breaking up with Steven, I\u2019d dated a few duds. Then several months later, Malcolm had walked into Meikle\u2019s office for a consultation. While he waited for Meikle to call him in to his office for his appointment Malcolm charmed the pants off me with his self-deprecating humour and great smile. He\u2019d asked for my number, and the rest, as they say, was history.</p><p>\u2018Hi, baby.\u2019 Malcolm grinned at me, and I watched him with pleasure as he approached my desk. He wore another beautiful grey suit from Savile Row, his face cleanly shaven, his skin tanned even in winter. Such a distinguished, classy man, and he\u2019s mine, I thought appreciatively.</p><p>And he came bearing gifts.</p><p>He held out a coffee cup and a brown bag. \u2018Latte with chocolate sprinkles and a white chocolate chip cookie.\u2019 His warm lips brushed mine slowly, gently, seductively. I was disappointed when he pulled back, but he\u2019d brought my favourite coffee and cookie, so I wasn\u2019t complaining. In fact, my insides melted. \u2018Thought you might need the pick-me-up. You work too hard.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 I bestowed my most grateful smile on him. \u2018I really needed this.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank me later.\u2019 He winked at me and I made a face, unable to stop the laughter bubbling up at his boyish grin.</p> <p>Shaking my head, I waved him towards the seats. \u2018I better let Mr Meikle know you\u2019re here.\u2019</p><p>A few seconds later, Meikle came out to greet Malcolm and they disappeared inside his office. I sat back with a contented sigh to enjoy my latte and cookie.</p><p>I smiled down at the cup and slid a glance towards the office door.</p><p>You\u2019ve done well for yourself this time, Jo.</p><p>Don\u2019t mess it up.</p><p>Feeling a little more awake now, I stared at the computer in boredom. I\u2019d done everything that needed to be done today. I glanced at the filing system. It hadn\u2019t been looked at in a while and it always needed reorganizing. I grabbed my coffee and took it over to the filing cabinets, where I slowly began to work my way through the system. Sure enough, there were misfiles. Mine or Lucy\u2019s? Probably both.</p><p>When Malcolm appeared twenty minutes later, he stepped out of the office alone.</p><p>His eyes warmed as they travelled over the length of me. I was wearing a black pencil skirt with a high waist and a pale pink silk blouse tucked into it. I wore black kitten heels so as not to tower over Mr Meikle. Malcolm sauntered over to me and I turned into him, not caring how unprofessional it was to let him kiss me. My lips tingled as he pulled back, his eyes drowsy with heat now. \u2018We still on for shopping tomorrow?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How about Saturday? Are you free? Becca wants to take us out to dinner as a thank-you to me for the gallery show and to you for getting Cam the job at the bar.\u2019</p><p>I had to stop myself from tensing against him. \u2018What? The four of us?\u2019</p><p>Malcolm nodded, brushing a loose strand of hair behind my ear. \u2018I could pick you up this time?\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t think so. My throat almost closed up at the thought. Malcolm had never been to the flat. He\u2019d never met Cole. And for now it would stay that way. \u2018I can meet you there,\u2019 I insisted.</p><p>He trailed his fingers down the thin fabric of my sleeve, as his lips curled in amusement. \u2018I have to meet your family sometime, Jo.\u2019</p><p>There was a part of me that was really happy that Malcolm was interested enough in me to want to meet my family, but there was this bigger part that wanted to erase all knowledge of London Road from his mind so he\u2019d never be able to find the flat and my mum. Ever.</p><p>I feigned an enthusiastic smile. \u2018Hmm. Soon.\u2019</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if he believed me or not, but he pressed a hard kiss to my lips that promised more of the same to come later and left me to the rest of my workday.</p><p>Cold latte in hand, I was still standing by the filing cabinets when Mr Meikle stepped out of his office minutes after Malcolm\u2019s departure. I looked over at him warily. He just stared at me. Almost passively. Where was the glare?</p><p>Still staring.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>This is officially creepy.</p><p>Meikle cleared his throat. \u2018I didn\u2019t realize you were in a relationship with Malcolm Hendry.\u2019</p><p>Oh, balls. Thank you, Malcolm! I cleared my own throat. \u2018Yes, sir.\u2019</p><p>\u2018For three months now?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well.\u2019 He shifted, looking decidedly uncomfortable. I couldn\u2019t help my eyebrows as they rose to new heights. I\u2019d never seen my boss as anything but self-assured and pompous. \u2018Well, then. I, um, well, I, um, appreciate your professionalism.\u2019</p><p>Hold the phone.</p><p>What?</p><p>\u2018Sir?\u2019</p><p>He commenced with more throat clearing, his eyes shifting around, unable to meet mine directly. \u2018Mr Hendry is an important client.\u2019 As his meaning dawned on me, his gaze finally met mine. \u2018You could have used that to make your position here more comfortable and you didn\u2019t. I appreciate your professionalism and discretion.\u2019</p><p>It was the first time Mr Meikle had rendered me speechless because of something positive he\u2019d said to me. Usually, I was choking back irritation at his high-handed arrogance and condescension. It was also the first time my boss had ever looked at me without a grimace or pre-emptive disappointment, as though, no matter what, he knew I would never live up to his exacting standards. I\u2019d grown used to that look, so it was strange to be on the receiving end of a compliment from him.</p><p>I eventually found my voice. \u2018I like to keep my personal business just that, Mr Meikle. Personal.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, well, good for you.\u2019 His eyes filled with irritation. \u2018Lucy is always chattering on about that fianc\u00e9 of hers. As if I have time to listen to such piffle.\u2019 And with that he disappeared back into his office and I suddenly felt sorry for Lucy. Perhaps it was time to start leaving her smiley faces. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cole had told me he had a presentation for English the next day, so I didn\u2019t want to interrupt his work by asking him to make dinner. Instead, I texted him earlier in the day and told him I\u2019d bring him home a bag of fish and chips. I got Mum a haggis supper just in case she felt like eating. I hurried home with the dinner since I\u2019d bought it from a shop on Leith Walk and didn\u2019t want it to get cold. As soon as I got in the door, I headed for the kitchen, switching on the kettle and pulling out plates.</p><p>Cole appeared in the doorway, his hungry eyes fixated on the fish and chips bag. \u2018Can I help?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tell Mum I got her a haggis supper if she feels like coming out into the living room to eat with us.\u2019</p> <p>His eyes narrowed at my request, but he did as he was told. After that he sat himself down on the floor at the coffee table and waited for his food, switching the television to a comedy show.</p><p>I had just put the dinner out on the table, along with a glass of juice for Cole, tea for me, and water for Mum, when she appeared. The dark grey long johns she wore were actually loose on her, and she shuffled towards us as though she was in pain. She probably was.</p><p>She sat down on the edge of the couch, the bruised circles under her eyes so prominent I could barely take in anything else. She didn\u2019t make a move for her food \u2013 she just looked at the plate with the battered haggis and chips on it. I pushed it towards her, chewing on a chip. \u2018Dinner.\u2019</p><p>At her grunt, I turned away and stared at the telly. My brother and I pretended to be watching the show, but I could tell by the stiffness of Cole\u2019s body that he was just as hyperaware of Mum as I was.</p><p>Five minutes later the tension had only just begun to slowly drain from us as Mum managed to eat some of her food, even if it was at the pace of a moonwalker, when she ruined it.</p> <p>Like always.</p><p>Focused now on the TV show, Cole had laughed at a joke and turned around to see if I was laughing too. He\u2019d done this since he was a toddler. Anytime he found something funny, he\u2019d look to me to make sure I found it just as amusing. I smiled at him as I always did.</p><p>\u2018Pfft.\u2019</p><p>My muscles immediately grew rigid at the sound, as did Cole\u2019s.</p><p>A \u2018pfft\u2019 from Mum was usually followed by something unpleasant.</p><p>\u2018Look at him,\u2019 she sneered.</p> <p>I was sitting on the floor like Cole, so I had to look over my shoulder to see what she was bitching about. My blood heated when I saw she was glaring at Cole.</p><p>\u2018Mum ...\u2019 I warned.</p><p>Her face scrunched up into a hateful, ugly expression. \u2018Laughs like that fuckin useless bastard of a man.\u2019</p><p>I shot a look at Cole and a burst of pain exploded in my chest at his downcast expression. He stared at the rug, as if trying to block her words out.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019ll turn out just like his dad. A piece of shit. Looks just like him. A piece of \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shut up,\u2019 I snapped, twisting around to face her, my eyes flashing furiously. \u2018You can either sit here and finish your dinner in total silence or go back to your bed and drown yourself in drink. Either way, you keep your nasty, gin-soaked thoughts to yourself.\u2019</p><p>Mum blustered incoherently and threw the plate on to our table, sending some errant chips flying. As she pushed herself up off the couch, she began muttering under her breath about ungrateful kids and no respect.</p><p>As soon as she had disappeared into her room, I let out a sigh of relief. \u2018Cole, ignore her. You\u2019re nothing like Dad.\u2019</p> <p>Cole shrugged, refusing to look at me, the colour on his cheeks high. \u2018I wonder where he is.\u2019</p><p>I shuddered at the thought of ever finding out. \u2018I don\u2019t care, as long as he\u2019s far away from here.\u2019</p><p>Later that night, after I\u2019d cleaned up the flat, done the dishes and sprayed the sitting room and kitchen with air freshener to get rid of the fish-and-chips smell, I flopped down beside Cole on the couch. He\u2019d finished his presentation and was now surrounded by pieces of a comic he was working on.</p><p>I handed him a mug of hot chocolate as I squeezed on to the other end of the couch, skirting his drawings. I squinted at a piece of paper that was upside down, trying to make out the image. \u2018What\u2019s this one about?\u2019</p><p>Cole shrugged, his eyebrows drawn together. \u2018Don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening with this one.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why not?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jamie and Alan were helping me with it, but ...\u2019</p><p>Uh-oh, the irritation in his voice did not sound good. \u2018But ... ?\u2019 I frowned. Now that I thought about it, it had been a week since Cole had asked me if he could hang out at Jamie\u2019s. \u2018Have you two fallen out?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Maybe.\u2019 At least that\u2019s what I thought his mumble translated into.</p><p>Oh, boy. Cole was a laid-back guy and a fight with his friends rarely happened, so I didn\u2019t even know if I wanted to be made aware of why they were fighting. But it was Cole ... \u2018What happened?\u2019</p><p>The blush on his cheeks made me even warier.</p><p>Oh, crap, this better not be teenage-boy gross. \u2018Cole?\u2019</p><p>He shrugged at me again.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s it. I\u2019m getting you weights to wear on your shoulders so you can\u2019t do that to me any more. I thought I told you shrugging does not equate to an answer. Neither does grunting.\u2019</p><p>My brother rolled his eyes at me.</p><p>\u2018Or that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter, all right?\u2019 he bit out, flopping back against the couch to sip at the hot chocolate, refusing to meet my eyes.</p><p>\u2018It matters to me.\u2019</p><p>His huge, long-suffering sigh could have filled up a hot-air balloon. \u2018He just said something that pissed me off.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oi,\u2019 I admonished. \u2018Watch the language.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He annoyed me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What did he say?\u2019</p><p>The muscle in Cole\u2019s jaw flexed and for a moment I could see him older, a man. My God, where had the time gone? \u2018He said something about you.\u2019</p><p>I winced. \u2018Me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah. Something sexual.\u2019</p><p>Oh, Christ. I flinched. There were just some words you didn\u2019t ever want to hear coming out of your baby brother\u2019s mouth. \u2018Sexual\u2019 was definitely one of them. \u2018Okay.\u2019</p><p>Cole looked up at me from under his lashes, his mouth twisted into a frustrated grimace. \u2018All my mates fancy you, but Jamie went too far.\u2019</p><p>I did not want to know what that meant.</p><p>Instead I thought about how close the two of them were. \u2018Did Jamie apologize once he realized he\u2019d gone too far?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, but that\u2019s not the point.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It is the point.\u2019 I leaned forward so I could catch his gaze, so he could see how much I meant what I was about to say. \u2018Life is too short to hold on to silly grudges. Jamie was man enough to apologize. Be man enough and gracious enough to accept the apology.\u2019</p><p>For a moment he held my gaze, processing my advice. Finally he nodded. \u2018Okay.\u2019</p><p>I smiled and sat back. \u2018Good.\u2019</p><p>Once he\u2019d turned his attention back to the comic, I reached for my latest paperback, readying myself to escape into someone else\u2019s world for a while.</p><p>\u2018Jo?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mmm-hmm?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I googled that guy you\u2019re dating. Malcolm Hendry.\u2019</p><p>My head snapped up from my book, my pulse racing a little faster all of a sudden. \u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>Cole shrugged. Again. \u2018You haven\u2019t said much about him.\u2019 He scowled at me. \u2018He\u2019s a bit old, do you not think?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not really.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s fifteen years older than you.\u2019</p><p>I really didn\u2019t want to be having this conversation with Cole of all people. \u2018I like him a lot. You will too.\u2019</p><p>Cole snorted. \u2018Yeah, like I\u2019m going to meet him. I met Callum only a handful of times and you dated him for two years.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to introduce you to someone who might not stick around. But I have a good feeling about Malcolm.\u2019</p><p>His next question was asked softly but with a hint of disdain that shot me right in the heart. \u2018Is it because he\u2019s loaded?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 I answered tightly. \u2018It\u2019s not.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You date a lot of wankers, Jo, and I know it\u2019s because they\u2019ve got money. You don\u2019t have to.\u2019 His face was starting to colour now with frustrated anger. \u2018She makes you miserable enough \u2013 you don\u2019t need to be going out with some tool just so we don\u2019t have to worry about money. As soon as I turn sixteen I\u2019m getting a job so I can help.\u2019</p><p>I think it was the longest Cole had ever spoken in one sitting in about a year. And his declaration felt like a punch in the gut. I sat up straight, my own cheeks blazing hot with annoyance. \u2018Don\u2019t use the \u201cw\u201d word. And to answer your question, I\u2019m dating a guy I really care about, and he just happens to have money. And you are not getting a job at sixteen. You\u2019re finishing high school and you\u2019re going to uni or art school or whatever the hell it is you want to do. But I\u2019ll be damned if you end up in some crap job because you\u2019re a bloody high school dropout!\u2019 I was breathing hard with fear at the thought of it.</p><p>Cole stared at me, his green eyes round with astonishment at my outburst. \u2018Jesus, chill, Jo. It was just an idea.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It was a bad idea.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aye, I\u2019m getting that.\u2019</p><p>I relaxed at the teasing in his voice and leaned back into the couch, pulling my paperback up to my face. \u2018Just draw, you pain in the ass.\u2019</p><p>He choked back his laughter and put down his mug to start drawing again.</p><p>After a minute, I looked at him over the top of my book. \u2018Just so you know ... I love you, baby boy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mmm-hmm, lu uu uu.\u2019</p><p>I deduced that was \u2018Mmm-hmm, love you too\u2019 in teenage muttering.</p><p>My lips twitched against an answering grin, a warm contentment settling in my chest as I stared down at the pages of my book.</p><p>7</p><p>Even though it was the end of February, and March was but a day away, Edinburgh was still freezing. The frigid sea air rushed up towards New Town, blasting those who were unfortunate enough to find themselves walking north towards it, unprotected by the buildings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Malcolm and I stayed out of the direct lambasting of icy wind as we strolled along George Street, going in and out of dress shops, and then down Frederick Street and on to the cobbled Rose Street, one of my favourite lanes in Edinburgh. It was packed with restaurants and pubs and boutiques, and we had lunch in a pub before carrying on to Harvey Nichols on St Andrew Square.</p><p>\u2018No, no, this is awful,\u2019 I told Malcolm through the curtain of the changing cubicle. By this point I\u2019d tried on at least fifteen dresses and neither of us could agree on one that we both liked. Becca was treating us to dinner at the Michelin Star restaurant Martin Wishart and Malcolm insisted on buying me something new to wear.</p><p>\u2018Why? What\u2019s wrong with it?\u2019 he asked, his voice coming closer to the curtain.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t believe he wasn\u2019t bored out of his mind yet, but he seemed to be pretty patient with shopping. In fact, I got the distinct impression he enjoyed it. Or at least, he enjoyed spoiling me ... which was lovely.</p><p>Staring at my reflection in the mirror, I wrinkled my nose in distaste. The dress was so sheer you could almost see my nipples through it. Add the fact that it had a cut-out back and a short hemline and I might as well pin a piece of paper to my chest that said FOR SALE.</p><p>\u2018Let me see.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 i moved to hold the curtain closed, but i was too late.</p><p>Malcolm\u2019s face appeared in the gap he\u2019d created and his dark eyes glittered mischievously as they ran down the length of me and then came to rest on my chest. The mischief slowly disappeared and when he looked back up at me there was heat in his eyes. \u2018If we weren\u2019t in a changing room right now ...\u2019</p> <p>I felt a niggle of something in my gut and wondered if it was disappointment. I imagined that if this was Joss and Braden or Adam and Ellie, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered if they were in a changing room. Braden and Adam would have pounced on their girlfriends with no thought to the consequences.</p><p>I shook myself for those thoughts. So Malcolm and I didn\u2019t have an all-encompassing passionate relationship. It didn\u2019t mean what we had wasn\u2019t great.</p><p>I forced myself to grin incredulously. \u2018You think this is hot?\u2019</p><p>\u2018For the bedroom, yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t think that was the intent here.\u2019 I looked down at it dubiously.</p><p>\u2018Try on the green one. It\u2019s the same colour as those gorgeous eyes of yours.\u2019</p> <p>I pressed my mouth to his lips for the compliment and let the curtain fall back so I was alone again in the cubicle.</p><p>He was right. The green shift dress by Lanvin was stunning.</p><p>Malcolm got a cab to a development site he wanted to visit, detouring to drop me off at home. He knew I wouldn\u2019t invite him inside. I was all set for dinner with Becca and Cam on Saturday night. Well, ready in that I at least had designer armour to wear and Malcolm to act as a buffer.</p><p>Tonight at work there would be no designer armour and no Malcolm.</p><p>I despised the flurry of butterflies that awoke in my stomach at the thought of working with Cam and all the things he might say to damage my already fragile ego.</p><p>It seemed I still needed to grow a thicker skin.</p><p>There was a kaleidoscope of butterflies in my belly by the time I got to the bar and when I stepped into the main room and saw Cam and Joss laughing about something as they cleaned glasses, the butterflies swarmed upward to my chest and I couldn\u2019t breathe for a moment.</p><p>What was that all about?</p> <p>I took the stairs down to the bar and ducked under the counter, throwing a smile of hello their way before hurrying into the staff room. Two seconds later, Joss was at my back and the music on the stereo system blasted on. I heard Brian yelling at someone to turn it down and the noise muted to a bearable level.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s up? You looked like you had swallowed a very sour lemon when you came in just now,\u2019 Joss observed.</p><p>I shrugged out of my jacket, smirking. \u2018Did I? I can\u2019t imagine why.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re afraid I\u2019m going to try and set you up with Cam.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Am I? I can\u2019t imagine why.\u2019</p><p>Joss made a face. \u2018Okay, enough with the sarcasm. Look. I\u2019m not going to.\u2019</p><p>I turned towards her, shoving my phone in my back pocket. \u2018What? The matchmaking is over before it\u2019s even really started?\u2019</p><p>She clenched her jaw for a second before replying, \u2018Yes. And that\u2019s a promise.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What brought on this change of heart? Not that I\u2019m complaining,\u2019 I hurried to assure her.</p><p>Completely deadpan and traumatized, Joss held my curious gaze. \u2018Ellie made me watch an adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s Emma so she could show me the dos and don\u2019ts of matchmaking. This was followed by a redundant showing of the teen movie Clueless, which happens to be based on Jane Austen\u2019s Emma.\u2019 She let that sit with me, clearly urging me to find it as horrifying as she had.</p><p>I tried to stifle my laughter. I really did.</p><p>Just not hard enough.</p><p>I threw my head back, falling against my locker in a fit of giggles. I couldn\u2019t get the image out of my head and I could just imagine how seriously Ellie had taken the whole thing. \u2018Oh, my God,\u2019 I gasped through my laughter. \u2018That must have been so painful for you.\u2019</p><p>Renewed excruciation flickered across her face as though she was having a flashback. \u2018Painful does not even cover it. You know what\u2019s worse than watching a romantic drama?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Analysing one.\u2019</p><p>Well, that set me off again.</p><p>\u2018Stop laughing. It\u2019s not funny.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, it\u2019s so funny. And just what you deserved.\u2019</p><p>Joss groaned. \u2018Yeah, probably.\u2019</p><p>After I\u2019d stemmed my laughter, I shook my head, wiping the tears from my eyes. \u2018I still can\u2019t understand why someone who rolls her eyes at romance films is writing a romance novel.\u2019</p><p>She glowered at me. \u2018It\u2019s not a romance. It\u2019s my parents\u2019 story.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, your parents who had a flaming, passionate romance.\u2019</p><p>Joss\u2019s eyes narrowed dangerously. \u2018Do you want me to go back to matchmaking?\u2019</p><p>I shuddered at the thought. \u2018Definitely not.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Be quiet, then.\u2019</p><p>At her belligerent expression, I snorted. Clearly she was mad that her attempts to lead me from my \u2018path of misery\u2019 had failed so soon. \u2018You know, if it makes you feel any better, I really do care about Malcolm. And I\u2019m not actually miserable.\u2019</p><p>Her eyes dimmed a little, any air of teasing between us dying out immediately. \u2018My worry, Jo, is that you\u2019re not happy either.\u2019</p><p>For a moment, I felt breathless again. I stared over her shoulder at the wall where our shift schedule for the week was pinned to a notice board surrounded by staff memos, cocktail recipes and contact numbers. When I could breathe again, I dragged my gaze back to hers. \u2018I know that Malcolm will make me happy.\u2019</p><p>She threw me a look that clearly screamed, Are you serious? \u2018How lukewarm of you. You\u2019ve been together for over three months. I think you\u2019d know by now whether or not you\u2019re in love with him.\u2019</p><p>I slammed my locker shut, preparing to go into the bar for opening. I thought about today in the changing room at Harvey Nichols and found myself getting defensive. \u2018Look, not all relationships are like you and Braden, or Ellie and Adam. They aren\u2019t all passionate sex and absolute adoration. Sometimes it\u2019s slow and secure and warm. That doesn\u2019t make it any less meaningful.\u2019</p><p>Joss passed me, her nose wrinkled with irritation. \u2018Slow, secure and warm? We\u2019re not talking about an old guy in a Zimmer with a lap blanket. We\u2019re talking about sex and love.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Who\u2019s talking about sex and love?\u2019 Cam\u2019s deep, raspy voice tugged at my lower belly.</p><p>As I stepped behind the bar, I couldn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>I had hoped those last few times in his company were a complete anomaly, but it was clear they weren\u2019t \u2013 my body seemed to vibrate and come to life around him, and I was beginning to feel guilty about my attraction towards him.</p><p>\u2018Jo and I were,\u2019 Joss answered, her voice still gruff with frustration. She leaned back against the bar and stared at me, her expression unreadable in the dim light.</p><p>Cam raised an eyebrow, shooting me an equally unfathomable look. \u2018Trouble in paradise?\u2019</p><p>Since he hadn\u2019t asked me with a sneer in his voice this time, I shook my head and deigned to answer him. \u2018No, we\u2019re fine. Joss is just having \u201ca moment\u201d.\u2019</p><p>She grumbled under her breath, but customers started trickling in, and then pouring in, and soon we were too busy to have much of a conversation.</p><p>For the first two hours, I somehow miraculously managed to avoid Cam\u2019s end of the bar. I worked at the opposite end and Joss worked in the middle. I chatted sporadically with her about nonsense anytime we were close enough to hear each other over the music. Braden, Ellie and Adam came in and took their usual table directly across from us so that Braden and Joss could screw each other with their eyes. I, on the other hand, did a good job of pretending that my entire body wasn\u2019t aware of every single move Cam made, of every wicked smile he flashed at an attractive customer, at the way his jeans cupped his bite-worthy ass every time he bent over for something, or that when he reached up for a new bottle of Jack Daniel\u2019s his T-shirt rode up to show a slab of taut abs.</p><p>It was just pure muscle under there.</p><p>I wondered what it would be like to have him stretched out naked on a bed, his hard body and golden skin laid out for me to savour. I would start with the sexy V cut of his hips, licking along the definition, pressing wet kisses up his sculpted torso, then flick his nipples and feel him harden against me \u2013</p><p>\u2018Jo!\u2019</p><p>I jolted out of my daydream, spilling the fresh orange juice I\u2019d just taken out of the fridge. I gaped at Joss, my cheeks flushed with embarrassment.</p><p>She was gazing at me with a quizzical smile. \u2018You were gone for a minute there. Where did you go?\u2019</p><p>The red in my cheeks deepened and I cast a quick look at Cam, who was busy serving a customer. I was thankful for the low lighting that hid my cherry red cheeks, but unfortunately Joss must have caught the embarrassment in my eyes and the quick, not so surreptitious look I\u2019d shot Cam. She glanced down the bar at him and then back at me. \u2018Oh, okay.\u2019 She grinned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I groaned inwardly and turned back to serve my customer her Alabama Slammer.</p><p>Two minutes later the crowd around the bar started to wane. I was readying myself to be teased mercilessly by Joss when I heard her swear under her breath.</p><p>Snapping my eyes over at her, I saw the clench to her jaw and followed her narrow-eyed gaze across the bar. A curvy brunette had taken a seat next to Braden and engaged him in conversation. Braden didn\u2019t look like he was being anything but polite, but the brunette was sitting awfully close to him. My eyes met Ellie\u2019s and she threw me an \u2018uh-oh\u2019 look.</p> <p>Joss was too classy to get into a bitch fight, especially with someone who was just sitting a little too close to her boyfriend. The girl would have to \u2013</p><p>Oh, no. The brunette\u2019s hand had landed on Braden\u2019s thigh.</p><p>\u2018Be back in a second,\u2019 Joss muttered furiously as she passed me.</p><p>She was too busy leaving the bar area with cool eyes and a burning rage to notice that Braden had already removed the woman\u2019s hand from his thigh. I leaned against the bar with my elbows, settling in for the show. It was a shame I was too far away to hear Joss. She could flay someone alive with her words and do it with a great deal of self-possession. I was eternally envious of her ability to confront an aggressor without turning into a chalk-faced gibbering idiot.</p><p>A customer approached the bar, and I reluctantly drew my gaze away from the scene. As I was pouring the guy his whisky, Cam\u2019s familiar and sexy scent infiltrated my olfactory senses and I could swear I swayed a little.</p> <p>At the feel of his warm breath on my ear, my fingers trembled and I froze as I pulled the bottle away from the glass. I could feel the heat of his body all the way down my left side, as though he was actually pressed tight against me.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry for being a dick,\u2019 he murmured, his voice deep with sincerity.</p><p>The vibration of his words against my skin caused a shimmer of delicious shivers down my spine. It completely turned me on. I only just managed to stifle my surprised gasp.</p><p>Feeling off balance, I glanced at him over my shoulder, only to find he was very definitely almost pressed up against me. It took a minute for his apology to register with me.</p><p>Cam sighed, his chin dipping so that our noses were close to touching. My eyes tangled with his and I knew that I wouldn\u2019t be able to move even if I wanted to. \u2018I don\u2019t know you,\u2019 he continued, his eyes searching my face. \u2018And I shouldn\u2019t have presumed to.\u2019 That searching look of his finally came to rest on my lips, and as his eyes turned molten with sexual awareness another rush of unexpected tingles awoke between my legs. I licked my lips, wondering what his mouth would taste like, and his breath hitched.</p><p>He leaned away from me, his eyes wary as they met mine. I saw the consternation in them and my whole body tensed.</p> <p>Cam was just as attracted to me as I was to him, but he didn\u2019t want to be.</p><p>Why? Was I \u2018beneath\u2019 him?</p><p>A sharp pain sliced across my chest and I pulled my gaze away and back to the drink I was making. And because I had just spent the previous evening preaching to my wee brother about being gracious, I nodded. \u2018Apology accepted.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So why do you have to look after your brother? Where are your parents?\u2019</p><p>I turned away, brushing past Cam to slide the drink over to my customer. I took the money for it, hit the till, and then handed back the customer\u2019s change. Just as I glanced around to answer Cam, another customer appeared.</p><p>The bar got busy again, and Joss skipped down the stairs and under the counter to help us out. I watched, while I served a customer, as Ellie, Adam and Braden left. I gave Joss a teasing smile. \u2018You kicked him out?\u2019</p><p>She shrugged. \u2018If he\u2019s going to be attracting hot women who don\u2019t care if he has a girlfriend or not, then, yeah, I\u2019m kicking him out.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What if he goes to another bar? There are more attractive women out there who will come on to him.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yeah, but I don\u2019t have to see it this way.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good point,\u2019 I murmured, eyeing Cam as he leaned over the bar so a female customer could say something in his ear.</p><p>The unexpected explosion of jealousy that ripped through me when he pulled back and smiled at her with blatant sexual cockiness nearly floored me.</p><p>What was I doing? What was my body doing?</p><p>I was with Malcolm. I was happy with Malcolm.</p><p>Deciding it was time to go on break, I gave Joss the heads-up and hid out in the staff room for ten minutes. Berating myself for a good portion of that, I managed to get myself together enough to return to work. When I came back out, the bar had hit another lull of quiet and Joss and Cam were leaning against the bar, talking to each other. I drew a deep breath and decided to be a grown-up.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019 I asked congenially as I approached them.</p><p>Joss gave me a surprisingly uneasy look. \u2018Cam asked about your family. I thought you\u2019d already told him. Sorry.\u2019</p><p>My heart flipped in my chest, a rush of queasiness making my skin prickle. \u2018Told him \u2013\u2019</p><p>Realizing what I thought she meant, she rushed to clarify. \u2018About your mum\u2019s illness and how you have to take care of her and Cole.\u2019</p><p>An immediate rush of relief overwhelmed me and I let out a deep breath. \u2018Right.\u2019</p><p>Unfortunately, I\u2019d given away too much. When I chanced a look at Cam, I saw his suspicious gaze flickering between me and Joss. He had just opened his mouth, presumably to ask another question, when Joss derailed him. \u2018So what about you, Cam? Your family from here?\u2019</p><p>Although his eyebrows were still drawn together in curiosity, he nodded. \u2018My parents live just outside Edinburgh. Longniddry.\u2019</p><p>Nice, I thought. Longniddry was this lovely village situated near the water. It was a beautiful place with rough beaches and old cottages. I wondered what it must have been like to grow up in such a place.</p><p>\u2018No overbearing brothers or sisters?\u2019 Joss continued her interrogation. \u2018No car crashes or drug addicts or medical problems?\u2019</p><p>I tried to contain my snort.</p><p>Cam shrugged good-naturedly. \u2018Not that I\u2019m aware of.\u2019</p><p>Looking nonplussed, Joss eyed him warily. \u2018Are you telling me you\u2019re actually a well-adjusted individual?\u2019</p><p>He threw her his hot grin and I succumbed to another heated flare of sexual attraction. \u2018I like to think so.\u2019</p><p>Joss shot me a look that said, Well, at least I\u2019ve got you before she shook her head at Cam as though she were disappointed in him. \u2018And here I thought we could be friends.\u2019</p><p>Cam laughed. \u2018I could invent a tragic past if that helps?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Or unearth some deep, dark family secret I can turn into a book.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll get back to you on that.\u2019 He smiled and then looked at me carefully, his gaze lowering a little under his eyelashes. He had sickeningly long eyelashes for a man. \u2018I made the mistake of telling Becca I had this Saturday off and I hear she\u2019s booked a table for four at Martin Wishart.\u2019</p><p>Yeah, I\u2019m sure the last thing you want to do is sit down for a meal with me. \u2018Malcolm told me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So I guess we\u2019re having dinner together.\u2019</p><p>Joss chuckled, and as she turned to serve a customer she rather unhelpfully advised, \u2018Try not to kill each other.\u2019</p><p>I smirked and shot a look at Cam, then immediately wished I hadn\u2019t. He appeared to be trying to work me out, as though I was this mysterious puzzle he was drawn to solving.</p><p>My body flushed with pleasure at his attention, but my brain screamed at me to run as far away from him as possible.</p><p>8</p><p>As much as Joss acted as a buffer between me and Cam, the tension between us refused to dissipate. Friday night I danced around him like an idiot, desperate not to have a repeat of the previous evening. Joss kept eyeing me as if expecting me to hatch an alien at any moment, I was acting so strangely.</p><p>When Malcolm had phoned me during the day I\u2019d felt this whoosh of guilt at the sound of his voice, as though I had cheated on him in a way with my impure thoughts about Cam. I wasn\u2019t perfect. It wasn\u2019t as though I hadn\u2019t been ruthless when going after men. I tried not to think about the girls who had been hurt by their defection, and I tried to rationalize that somehow it was okay to have been party to such a betrayal because Cole needed me to marry someone like Malcolm. There was no truth in that. That somehow suggested there hadn\u2019t been a choice for me, but of course there was a choice. I had chosen. And I had chosen selfishly.</p><p>I drew the line at physically cheating on someone, though. I particularly drew the line at being the direct betrayer.</p><p>Lusting after Cam seemed like one step too close towards that.</p><p>Thankfully, as always, Friday was really too busy to make much conversation with my colleagues. Cam cracked a few jokes, made us laugh, and Joss, as always, was her witty self. I, on the other hand, decided to try to diminish my awareness of Cam by focusing on filling up the tips jar.</p><p>I flirted my ass off and ignored the way Joss rolled her eyes at my girlish giggling. She\u2019d once told me I had a fake giggle and a real giggle. My real giggle was apparently \u2018adorable\u2019, but my fake giggle \u2013 the one I used to convince a guy that I thought he was the funniest man I\u2019d ever met \u2013 drove her up the wall.</p><p>If only she knew that just made me want to do it more.</p><p>I was serving drinks to three guys who weren\u2019t mind-blowingly attractive but were charming and sexy in their own way, and I was enjoying their attention.</p><p>\u2018Seriously, you should just jump over the bar and come spend the rest of the night with us,\u2019 one of them insisted, flashing me a crooked smile. I could usually read when a guy was being lascivious, but these guys were just having fun.</p><p>I leaned my elbow on the bar, handing the shortest guy his change with one hand while resting my chin thoughtfully in the palm of my other. \u2018Hmm, where would you take me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I heard Fire is a pretty good nightclub,\u2019 the one in the middle suggested, his eyes glinting with hope.</p><p>I snorted and gestured around the bar. \u2018Leave one club for another. No, you\u2019ll have to do better than that.\u2019 I smiled slowly and watched the three of them lean in closer, their eyes dipping to my mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018The Voodoo Rooms.\u2019 The short one nodded at his mates as if it was a great idea.</p><p>I shook my head sadly in response. \u2018Expand your horizons, boys.\u2019</p><p>The one with the crooked and very hot smile leaned on the bar so that our faces were only an inch apart. My eyes smiled into his as he stared at me intensely. I suddenly realized he\u2019d stopped playing and was serious, and my smile wilted a little. His gaze dropped to my lips. \u2018I\u2019ll take you anywhere, darling, anywhere in the world, if you\u2019ll give me your number.\u2019</p> <p>I heard the clearing of a deep throat before a warm hand pressed against my belly. I jolted in shock and twisted my head around to see Cam leaning into me.</p><p>It was his large, warm hand pressed to my belly.</p><p>He put pressure on me and eased me back off the bar. \u2018Excuse me,\u2019 he muttered, his expression blank except for the muscle jumping in his jaw. Cam\u2019s touch set off sparks in my body, my skin prickling with excited heat, and in my dumbfounded reaction I let him push me back from the bar, his body curling into mine as he reached past me. His hand slid around to my waist, nudging my tank top up so his callused hand gripped my bare skin, holding me in place as he bent down for a bottle of liqueur. When he straightened, our eyes met, and it took everything in me not to reach for him too.</p><p>As if it suddenly occurred to him that he was still touching me, he leaned back and nodded at me, then strode down to his end of the bar. I stared after him too long, wondering why he\u2019d felt the need to touch me, to move me rather than just ask me to move. Usually, I would read that as interest, as an invitation, but Cam was sending me a whole bunch of mixed signals. I stared so long that when I turned back to the guys I had been diligently flirting with, they were gone. And so was their prospective tip.</p><p>Crap.</p> <p>Bloody Cam.</p><p>The rest of the shift flew by and as I had taken to doing the last few nights, I hurried out of the bar as soon as we\u2019d cleaned up at closing, desperate to get away from Cam.</p><p>It was a freezing-cold, brisk walk back to the flat, avoiding drunks who took one look at a single female and decided she\u2019d make great target practice. Joss hated me walking home alone after our shift, but I was used to it, and had a rape alarm on my key ring and a small can of pepper spray in my bag as a precaution.</p><p>I hurried quietly up the damp stairwell of my building, and almost melted against our front door with relief and exhaustion. Home at last. Deciding that a cup of tea would be nice to take with me to my room I headed for the kitchen to switch on the kettle but was stopped dead in the doorway.</p><p>A haggard resentment rippled through me at the sight of my drunken mother passed out on the kitchen floor. Thankfully, she was wearing pyjamas. There had been times I\u2019d discovered her like this and she\u2019d been naked.</p><p>I wondered how long she\u2019d been there and feared that she\u2019d not only got a chill from the cold kitchen tiles but hurt her bad back. Shaking my head, biting back the tears of frustrated exhaustion, I shrugged out of my jacket and took a minute as I decided how I was going to carry her back to her room without waking up Cole and without doing any more damage to her back. I supposed I could drag her as carefully as I could manage.</p> <p>Attempting to move quietly, I did just that. I lifted her under the arms and began to slide her body out of the kitchen. Her foot hit the edge of the door, slamming it back against the wall and I winced, frozen on the spot. I hoped I hadn\u2019t woken up Cole.</p><p>Unfortunately, I\u2019d just begun to drag her again when I heard his bedroom door open. I twisted around to find him standing in the hallway staring at me with bleary eyes.</p><p>\u2018Sorry, sweetheart. Go back to bed,\u2019 I whispered.</p><p>But Cole just grunted and shook his head, stumbling towards me. \u2018Need a hand?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m okay.\u2019</p><p>He grunted at that again and came around to the other end of Mum. With ease he lifted her feet and we began to carry her towards her room. I eyed him as much as I eyed where we were going. Cole was my height and still growing. He was a smart kid, and one who hadn\u2019t had it easy in the parent department. It had given him this weary glint in his eyes that made him look more mature than he was. I was saddened that my wee man had had to grow up so fast.</p><p>This of course was not the first time he\u2019d helped me carry our mum to her bed.</p><p>Once we had her on the bed, I set about tucking her duvet around her, trying to offset any damage she may have caused to herself from lying on the cold floor. Assured that she was warm enough, I slipped out of her bedroom and met Cole in the hallway.</p> <p>I gave him a smile that trembled with my tiredness, with my sadness.</p><p>He saw it and his own sorrow flickered across his expression before he killed it with a smirk. \u2018I\u2019ve had an idea for a new workout fad. It\u2019ll make us loads of money.\u2019</p><p>My lips twitched. \u2018And what\u2019s that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s called Drunk Mum. It involves heavy lifting and some cardio.\u2019</p><p>I stared at him a moment, letting his joke sink in, and then I burst into giggles, pulling him to me for a hug. I felt the tears creep into the corner of my eyes as he hugged me back.</p><p>He was my saving grace.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without him.</p><p>9</p><p>By the time I woke up it was midmorning. I lay under my duvet refusing to get out. To save on our heating bill, I had the heat set on a daily timer. It came on for two hours in the morning and then back on at five o\u2019clock in the evening. The air outside my warm cocoon in the bed was freezing and I moaned at the unfairness of having to get up.</p><p>Cole had woken me for a second a few hours earlier to remind me he was going to Jamie\u2019s and would be staying there all day and night. I remembered grumbling at him to take twenty pounds out of my purse in case of an emergency, before falling back asleep.</p><p>My eyes rolled to the side to check the time on my bedside table alarm clock. It was ten thirty. I really needed to get up and get some food shopping done before I had to get ready for my big, horrible night with Becca and Cam.</p><p>Euch.</p><p>\u2018Okay. One, two, three,\u2019 I counted. On \u2018three\u2019 I threw back my covers and jumped out of bed. It was the only way to get me out of it. I couldn\u2019t do that slow, sliding out from under the sheets thing or I\u2019d fall asleep in mid attempt. Shivering, I gazed longingly down at my mattress.</p><p>With a pout, I hurried into the hall to flip the hot water on for my shower. A cup of tea kept me warm while I waited, and I opened Mum\u2019s door to check on her.</p><p>She was awake.</p><p>\u2018Morning.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Morning,\u2019 she mumbled, clutching her blankets closer to her. \u2018It\u2019s bloody cold.\u2019</p><p>That\u2019s because you passed out on the kitchen floor for God knows how long. \u2018Do you want a cup of tea and some toast?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aye, that would be good, darling.\u2019 She slipped farther down so she was curled into a ball.</p><p>After I\u2019d made her tea and toast, waiting around to make sure she ate it, I left her alone and got ready for the day. Besides getting food, I needed to get a birthday card for Angie, my friend from the salon I worked at years ago. Before Joss, I didn\u2019t have close friends because of ... well ... my secretiveness, but Angie and Lisa from the salon had been girls I\u2019d hit the town with and the closest thing I\u2019d had to best friends. I hadn\u2019t seen either of them in months, although we still exchanged regular text messages.</p><p>I shrugged on my wool jacket that cinched in at the waist, wrapped an oversized scarf around me, and pulled my knit Uggs up over my skinny jeans. My freshly washed hair fell around my shoulders and down my back in thick tumbles and I knew I should tie it up, but I shivered at the thought of leaving my ears naked to the cold. I grabbed my gloves and bag and I was all set.</p><p>Shouting a goodbye to Mum, I hurried out the door, as always looking forward to being anywhere but stuck in the flat with her. I took the stairs slowly as I began to pull on my gloves and at the sound of male laughter I stilled at the corner of the staircase that would take me down to the floor below us.</p><p>The empty flat directly beneath my flat didn\u2019t appear to be empty any more.</p><p>The door to it had been thrown open, and I watched wide-eyed as two guys carried a coffee table up the last few steps and on to the landing.</p><p>\u2018You hit the leg.\u2019 The extremely tall, dark-haired guy in a rugby shirt smirked at his companion as they levelled out on the landing.</p><p>The other guy was a little shorter, with broad shoulders and messy dark hair squashed under a beanie hat. When he turned to smile cheekily at his friend, I knew I was in the presence of a player. The guy was gorgeous and that smile told me he knew just what to do with it. \u2018He\u2019ll never notice.\u2019</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s a bash in the wood.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ach, it gives it character.\u2019</p><p>I took another step down and my movement drew both of their gazes. I felt an uneasy squirm in my stomach as I glanced at the open door to the flat. We had a new neighbour. A new neighbour who would have to endure my mum\u2019s wailing drunkenness.</p><p>Great.</p><p>The beanie hat guy grinned appreciatively at the sight of me, his eyes drinking me in from my boots to my head. I flicked a quick look at his friend and discovered I was under his smiling perusal too. My automatic flirt kicked in and I gave them a half smile back and a wave of my fingers. \u2018Hey.\u2019</p><p>Beanie Guy adjusted the weight of his side of the coffee table as he asked, \u2018You live here?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The flat above you.\u2019</p><p>He made a huffing sound and shook his head as he stared at his friend. \u2018Cam\u2019s always been a lucky fucker.\u2019</p><p>I instantly tensed at the name.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s taking so long?\u2019 a deep and very familiar voice asked from inside the flat.</p><p>My mouth was already falling open when Cam stepped out of the flat to greet his friends.</p><p>\u2018Cam?\u2019 I squeaked in disbelief.</p><p>Startled, Cam looked up at me, astonishment slackening his features. \u2018Jo?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Eh ...\u2019 The tall friend\u2019s head turned from me and Cam to Beanie Guy. \u2018The lucky fucker already knows her.\u2019</p><p>I ignored them, my heart hammering in my chest now as my eyes pinned Cam to the landing. He stood before me in one of his worn T-shirts and jeans, his engineer boots on, his hair a mess and his eyes dark with lack of sleep. Despite his obvious tiredness, he seemed to hum with an energy that sucked me in. When he stepped into a room, you felt his vitality, his strength. There were few people in this world who had that kind of presence about them. Braden Carmichael was one. Cameron MacCabe was definitely another. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And he was moving into the flat beneath mine?</p><p>I couldn\u2019t get my pulse to slow at the thought of Cam being so close to all my secrets and shame. \u2018You\u2019re moving in?\u2019</p><p>His eyes flew past me to the floor above us. \u2018You live here?\u2019</p> <p>The rocks settled heavily in my stomach. \u2018The flat above you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jesus.\u2019 Cam sighed, seeming as unhappy about the revelation as I was. \u2018Small world.\u2019</p><p>More like small city. \u2018Very,\u2019 I murmured. How had this happened? Did fate just hate me? Of all the coincidences in the world, why did I have to be landed with such a huge and very crap one?</p><p>\u2018Eh, this is getting heavy,\u2019 Tall Guy complained, nodding at the coffee table.</p><p>I eyed the size of his biceps and doubted he found it at all heavy.</p> <p>Cam gestured to the flat. \u2018Take it in, guys. Thanks.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, no.\u2019 Beanie Guy shook his head, smirking, his eyes still on me. \u2018First introduce us to Miss Scotland.\u2019</p><p>I felt my cheeks heat at the compliment, hating that it somehow added substance to Cam\u2019s opinion of me.</p><p>Cam\u2019s body tensed and he crossed his arms over his chest. \u2018Just take it in the flat.\u2019</p><p>My God, I was so unworthy that he couldn\u2019t even introduce me to his friends. Ignoring the hurt that had gripped my chest, I smiled at Beanie Guy. \u2018I\u2019m Jo.\u2019</p><p>Beanie Guy and Tall Guy\u2019s mouths dropped open. \u2018Jo?\u2019 they asked in surprised unison ... as if they\u2019d heard of me.</p> <p>My brow puckered in confusion as I slid a questioning look at Cam. His whole body was rigid now as he gave his friends the tiniest shake of his head.</p><p>His friends didn\u2019t take whatever hint Cam was sending them. \u2018Jo from the bar, Jo?\u2019</p><p>Cam had spoken about me? I shifted uneasily, not sure in what light I\u2019d been painted. \u2018That\u2019s me.\u2019</p><p>The two of them grinned and Beanie Guy gave me a nod of hello. \u2018I\u2019m Nate and that\u2019s Peetie.\u2019</p><p>I eyed the tall guy incredulously. \u2018Peetie?\u2019 Not the kind of name you\u2019d expect for someone of his size.</p><p>Peetie had a nice face, friendly and open. \u2018Gregor. My surname\u2019s Peterson.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ah, I see.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cam\u2019s told us all about you, Jo,\u2019 Nate continued, avoiding Cam\u2019s glower.</p> <p>Feeling a little shaken that Cam had spoken about me to his friends and far too curious about how he\u2019d spoken about me, I decided it was time to move along so I could wrap my head around the fact that Cam was my new neighbour.</p><p>Come to think of it, he had been speaking to Joss about finding a cheaper flat.</p><p>Again ... of all places, why did it have to be in my building?</p><p>I decided to pretend like I didn\u2019t care what Cam had said. \u2018Well, don\u2019t believe a word of it.\u2019 I ignored Cam as I passed him, and smiled at his friends. \u2018Cam has the unfortunate habit of forming an opinion before he really gets to know someone.\u2019</p><p>Nate nodded. \u2018Yeah, he told us what a remarkable dick he was to you.\u2019</p><p>That stopped me in midstride, and I twisted around to stare at Cam.</p><p>He shrugged at me, his expression still deadpan. \u2018I told you I was sorry.\u2019</p><p>My eyes swung to his grinning friends and then back to him. \u2018Well, then, I guess I might actually believe you now. Neighbour.\u2019 And with a nod of goodbye to them all, I started descending the stairs carefully.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s Jo?\u2019 Nate asked loudly, as I disappeared from view, his voice carrying all the way down to me, and I couldn\u2019t help but prick my ears up to listen.</p><p>\u2018Shut up,\u2019 Cam hissed. \u2018Let\u2019s get the rest of the stuff in.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Christ almighty, you weren\u2019t kidding, were you? How fucking long are those legs?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nate ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018How can you stand it, mate? If you\u2019re not having a crack at her, I am.\u2019</p><p>Cam\u2019s growl reverberated down to me. \u2018Get in the fucking flat!\u2019</p><p>His door slammed and I jumped, stalling on the last landing. What the hell had all that meant? What had Cam said about me?</p><p>The simple style of the restaurant with its soft wood and soothing beige and cream decor should have at least added a semblance of calm to the situation.</p><p>But nope.</p><p>I sat across from Becca and Cam, Malcolm at my side, and prayed that I was the only one feeling the cloying tension at the table. We\u2019d ordered and eaten our appetizers, and all the while Becca and Malcolm kept the conversation afloat. As we waited for our main course to arrive, I shifted uncomfortably under the silence that had fallen over the group.</p><p>Since the moment I\u2019d arrived with Malcolm, I\u2019d been desperately avoiding looking at Cam. He\u2019d been on my mind all day, and I swear my pulse had not slowed since discovering he was our new neighbour. All the worst scenarios played out in my head. Cam hearing my mum, Cam discovering why my mum was so bloody noisy sometimes, Cam letting it slip to someone important to me ... say, Malcolm.</p><p>And yes, if I was honest with myself, I was also worried that Cam\u2019s already low opinion of me would be completely obliterated by the truth of my mother\u2019s situation. Why I cared what he thought, I couldn\u2019t work out. I didn\u2019t know him. I didn\u2019t really know what kind of man he was.</p><p>\u2018I love your dress, Jo. Malcolm has such good taste, doesn\u2019t he?\u2019 Becca smiled over the top of her wineglass.</p><p>I managed a small smile in return, not sure if she was being catty or genuine. \u2018I love your dress too.\u2019 I was being genuine. Becca was wearing a dark gold sequined dress with a high neckline and short skirt. It looked expensive and classy.</p><p>Malcolm was dapper as always in a three-piece suit with an emerald green tie to match my dress and Cam ...well ... Cam was Cam.</p><p>Although I avoided his direct gaze, I couldn\u2019t help but check out his attire. His only concession to formal wear was a pair of black suit trousers \u2013 black suit trousers he had worn with a printed tee, a worn black leather biker jacket and his engineer boots. Out of politeness, he\u2019d taken off the leather jacket at the dinner table.</p><p>Somehow I couldn\u2019t help but admire him. He was dressed the way he wanted to dress and he didn\u2019t give a damn what anyone else thought. That\u2019s probably why he was so bloody attractive no matter what he wore.</p><p>\u2018Your shoes are cute too.\u2019 Becca grinned. \u2018I was eyeing them as you walked across the room.\u2019</p><p>Cam snorted, pushing his fork into his napkin in absent-minded boredom. His mouth tilted up at the corner. \u2018Malcolm, I just love your tie. It does magnificent things for your eyes.\u2019</p><p>Malcolm grinned at his drollness and pointed at Cam\u2019s tattoos. \u2018I like the art. What does the black script say?\u2019</p><p>I leaned forward. I\u2019d wanted to know this from the moment I\u2019d met him.</p><p>\u2018 \u201cBe Caledonia\u201d,\u2019 Becca answered, eyeing Cam\u2019s arm in irritation. \u2018And don\u2019t bother asking him what the hell that means, because he won\u2019t tell you.\u2019</p><p>I wasn\u2019t even surprised any more at the warm shock of tingles between my legs at the way Cam\u2019s lips curled in amusement. Apparently, anything he did turned me on. Our eyes met for a second and I lowered mine quickly, flushing.</p><p>\u2018Well, what about the dragon?\u2019 Malcolm continued. \u2018Does that have significance?\u2019</p><p>Cam nodded. \u2018I was significantly drunk when I got it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, no.\u2019 Malcolm laughed. \u2018One of those.\u2019</p><p>\u2018One of those. I was twenty-two, dating an older woman who happened to be a tattoo artist. We got drunk, I ended up in her chair, she asked me what tattoo I wanted, I said surprise me ...\u2019 He shrugged.</p><p>I laughed at the thought of him coming out of the chair to find he had a fierce dragon on his arm. \u2018So she gave you a black and purple dragon?\u2019</p><p>Cam flashed his knickers-dropping smile at me. \u2018She was big into fantasy. I should have remembered that before I agreed to sit in her chair.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s an amazing piece of artwork.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, Anna was an amazing artist.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Stop, or I might get jealous,\u2019 Becca interrupted, laughing, but her laugh sounded fake. There was no \u2018might\u2019 about it. She took a sip of her wine and turned her direct gaze from her boyfriend to me. \u2018So, Cam told me about the happy coincidence.\u2019</p><p>Malcolm glanced at me. \u2018What happy coincidence?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, Cam\u2019s new flat ... It\u2019s in Jo\u2019s building. The flat below hers, in fact.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 Malcolm shot me a teasing look before smirking at Cam. \u2018You\u2019ll have to tell me what it\u2019s like. Jo refuses to let me near it.\u2019</p><p>I squirmed under Cam\u2019s curious look, his eyes asking, What in the hell kind of relationship do you two have? \u2018It\u2019s just like anywhere in Edinburgh.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Very informative, Cam, thank you. You\u2019re as bad as Jo.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did it take you long to move your things in?\u2019 Becca asked just as the second course arrived.</p><p>Cam waited until we\u2019d all been served and had begun to tuck in before he replied. \u2018All day.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You know, it might have taken less time if you\u2019d bothered to get rid of all those comic books.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve already said no to that suggestion,\u2019 Cam replied to her lazily.</p><p>Becca shook her head and turned to us, clearly frustrated. \u2018He has hundreds of them in plastic seal, in box after box. It\u2019s ridiculous. I know I should get it, because I\u2019m an artist, but I totally don\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>Malcolm nodded at her. \u2018I admit to never understanding the fascination with comics.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 I found myself speaking up, thinking about the worlds Cole had created, and the worlds he had shared with me through his love of comics and graphic novels. \u2018I think there\u2019s something compelling about them. Most of them are really just about ordinary people rising to the extraordinary. We read books like that every day. These ones just have cool pictures to illustrate what the words can\u2019t.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wanted to avoid Cam\u2019s reaction to my opinion, but the heat of his gaze drew mine and when our eyes met they held. And locked. I felt my breathing grow shallow at his soft smile, his warm, inquisitive eyes. \u2018Joss says your brother draws and writes his own.\u2019</p><p>The thought of Cole loosened my lips into a more relaxed smile. \u2018He\u2019s very talented.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019d love to take a look at them sometime.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think Cole would like that.\u2019 I didn\u2019t know why I said that. I didn\u2019t want Cam anywhere near Cole or my flat. It was the way he was looking at me. Like he saw something he liked and it had nothing to do with my pretty face, long legs or perky boobs. Words that had tumbled out of my mouth had pleased him and I was basking in his good opinion.</p><p>I was such an idiot.</p><p>\u2018Jo?\u2019</p><p>My gaze was ripped from Cam\u2019s at the voice.</p><p>No. I tensed. It can\u2019t be.</p><p>I shifted around in my seat and looked up into the eyes of someone very familiar. An unexpected ache flared in my chest as a rush of memories exploded over me.</p><p>Oh, God. Was someone just being particularly cruel today? I mean, how many coincidences could a person deal with in one day?</p><p>\u2018Callum?\u2019 My eyes searched my ex-boyfriend\u2019s handsome face. I hadn\u2019t seen him for about a year. We\u2019d bumped into each other a number of times since breaking up three years ago but never somewhere where we could talk.</p><p>I noted a couple of lines around his eyes that hadn\u2019t been there when we\u2019d dated, but they only added to his attractiveness. Not a strand of his silky dark hair was out of place, and his suit was cut exquisitely for his perfect physique. The short brunette at his side was a fresh-faced beauty about my age.</p><p>\u2018Jo, it\u2019s good to see you.\u2019 He took a step away from his date and I thought I saw a momentary flicker in his eyes. I stood up from the table and was immediately enveloped in his hug. He hadn\u2019t changed his cologne and it sparked sensual memories. Sex with Callum had been the best I\u2019d ever had \u2013 nothing kinky or exceptionally adventurous, but earthy and satisfying. Sadly, I wondered if that was what had kept us together so long.</p><p>Callum\u2019s hands had slid familiarly around my body as he drew me into the hug and now one of them was pressed low on my back and the other just touching my ass. \u2018I\u2019ve missed you,\u2019 he murmured, giving me a squeeze.</p><p>I laughed nervously, pulling out of his embrace. \u2018I\u2019ve missed you too.\u2019</p><p>A throat cleared and I twisted my head to see Malcolm staring up at us, his eyebrows elevated to his hairline.</p><p>\u2018Oh, Malcolm, this is Callum Forsyth. Callum, this is my boyfriend, Malcolm Hendry.\u2019</p><p>Malcolm half stood so he could lean over and shake Callum\u2019s hand. Callum eyed him carefully, murmuring a polite \u2018Hello\u2019 before sliding his gaze back to me.</p><p>\u2018You look amazing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 I flicked a look at his date, wondering if he was going to introduce her. Following my gaze, Callum seemed to suddenly realize she was there. \u2018Oh, this is Meaghan. My fianc\u00e9e.\u2019</p><p>Wow, what a way to greet an ex-girlfriend in front of his fianc\u00e9e. I almost sent him a chiding look. \u2018Nice to meet you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You too,\u2019 she answered politely, smiling sweetly up at Callum.</p><p>If I was her I\u2019d have been pissed off if my fianc\u00e9 had just had his hand on another woman\u2019s ass. If I was her I\u2019d be \u2013</p> <p>Rubbish, Jo. I chastised myself. You\u2019re talking absolute rubbish. If it had been you, you would have pretended you hadn\u2019t seen anything so it wouldn\u2019t cause an argument and upset him.</p><p>As I stared at my ex-boyfriend and his new fianc\u00e9e I saw that nothing had changed. She might be short and brunette, but she was likely just another version of me. That look of longing in Callum\u2019s eyes perhaps attested to our great sex life and nothing more, because ... he hadn\u2019t known me.</p><p>I was the perfect girlfriend. Thinking back, I couldn\u2019t remember a time we\u2019d ever got into a fight. Why? Because I never argued. I always agreed with him or curbed my tongue. I didn\u2019t care what we did as long as it made him happy. I was the epitome of congenial blandness. And when I finally hadn\u2019t catered to his every whim, when I\u2019d put my family\u2019s needs over his, he\u2019d kicked me to the kerb.</p><p>A shudder rippled through me and I took a step back from Callum, all those warm memories evaporating. Did Cam see that when he looked at me with Malcolm? Was I like that with Malcolm? We never argued. I always agreed ... but that was the way to keep him, right? I shot a look down at him and saw he was frowning at me. I wanted this man to propose one day, right? It didn\u2019t matter whether he was proposing to the real me or not.</p><p>My gut churned.</p><p>Right?</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>... right?</p><p>I looked back at Callum with a tight smile. \u2018I\u2019d better get back to dinner. It was nice seeing you after all this time, and nice meeting you, Meaghan.\u2019 I nodded at them and slipped back into my chair.</p><p>I knew they were gone when Malcolm\u2019s gaze returned to me. \u2018Are you okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Who was that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ex-boyfriend.\u2019</p><p>Becca choked on a giggle. \u2018A handsy ex-boyfriend.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Too handsy,\u2019 Cam muttered, and I looked up, only for our eyes to clash. I couldn\u2019t tell what was going on behind his. Was he angry?</p><p>\u2018Yes, well,\u2019 Malcolm replied tightly now. \u2018He certainly didn\u2019t care that his fianc\u00e9e was standing right next to him.\u2019</p><p>Did you care? Malcolm, did you care? I shot him a look and almost swore at the way he was looking at Cam. Not Callum. Cam. I frowned, totally confused. \u2018Are you angry?\u2019</p><p>With that careful look at Cam, Malcolm smiled at me and slid his arm around the back of my chair. \u2018It\u2019s my bed you end up in at the end of the night, sweetheart. I\u2019ve got nothing to be mad about.\u2019</p><p>I smiled weakly at him, taken aback by his uncharacteristic comment, and then chanced another look at Cam. His plate seemed to hold a great deal of interest for him, and since I couldn\u2019t read his eyes, I read his body. His jaw was locked tight, his fist was curled around his fork until his knuckles were white, and his shoulders had tensed.</p><p>Cam was mad now?</p><p>Jesus, what were we playing at with each other?</p><p>10</p><p>\u2018Where are you going?\u2019 Malcolm slid his arm around my waist and halted my progress out of his bed.</p><p>I grew still, confused. This was the part at the end of the night when I always left.</p><p>\u2018Stay. Stay with me tonight.\u2019</p><p>Dinner had been a strange affair after Callum\u2019s appearance. Malcolm seemed off, his behaviour taking a surprising turn as he acted both cocky and proprietary towards me, and Becca\u2019s mood had soured along with Cam\u2019s. I was grateful when Malcolm called it quits, taking me home to his flat. However, as soon as we were in the door, he was on me, his kisses hard and demanding, his need immediate and intense.</p><p>We ended up having sex on his living-room couch. It was the first time we\u2019d had sex outside of his bed.</p><p>I wanted to find it exciting, but it hadn\u2019t been. It had felt like a claiming, and with my mind all over the place, it was not a claiming I\u2019d been into. After months of praying for this moment, I couldn\u2019t believe I was questioning whether I wanted it or not.</p><p>Malcolm had carried to me to his bed after the couch sex, where he\u2019d made love to me tenderly, sweetly ... but no matter how much I tried, I couldn\u2019t switch my brain off, my thoughts buzzing around in my head like too many trolleys in one supermarket aisle \u2013 they were relevant, but they weren\u2019t going anywhere that made sense.</p><p>\u2018I feel like you\u2019re someplace else tonight.\u2019 Malcolm tugged on my waist, pulling me closer. \u2018I\u2019d feel better if you stayed, but only if you want to.\u2019</p><p>I took a deep breath, trying to remind myself that this was exactly what I wanted. So Malcolm didn\u2019t know me as well as he thought he did. That was a good thing. And anyway, Cole was staying at Jamie\u2019s. The only one I had to worry about was Mum, and really that was just a case of hoping she didn\u2019t burn down the flat.</p><p>I relaxed, cuddling into Malcolm. \u2018Okay.\u2019</p><p>He wrapped his arms tighter around me, stroking my arm soothingly. \u2018I wish you\u2019d tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u2019</p><p>I tensed. \u2018Nothing is wrong.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You keep saying that, but I don\u2019t believe you.\u2019</p><p>I scrambled around for some excuse. \u2018Things are just difficult with Mum at the moment.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You could let me help.\u2019</p><p>At his kindness, I melted against him, pressing a tender kiss to his throat. \u2018You are helping. Being with you helps.\u2019</p><p>He kissed my hair. \u2018You weren\u2019t with me tonight. Not the first time or the second time. And altogether that would be the third time.\u2019</p><p>Oh, God. He knew I hadn\u2019t come again. If sex with me was terrible, would Malcolm dump me? I tensed.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not criticizing. I\u2019m worried.\u2019 He pulled away from me and tipped my chin up so he could look into my eyes. \u2018I care about you, Jo. I hope you care about me.\u2019</p><p>I nodded quickly, sincerely. \u2018I do care about you. It\u2019s just been a difficult few weeks, but I promise it\u2019s going to get better.\u2019</p><p>He pressed a soft kiss to my lips and snuggled us down under his duvet. \u2018Let\u2019s start with getting you a proper sleep. You work too hard.\u2019</p><p>I held on to him, letting his patience and kindness act as a balm to my harried nerves. I was just drifting off when he said quietly, \u2018You seem to get on okay with Cam?\u2019</p><p>My eyes popped open at the question. \u2018Not really.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hmm.\u2019 His hand slid down to cup my hip, pulling my body into his. \u2018I\u2019m not sure about him. I don\u2019t like the way he looks at you. And I don\u2019t like that he\u2019s living in such close proximity to you.\u2019</p><p>My body wanted to grow tense at the suspicion in Malcolm\u2019s voice, and it took everything I had to remain relaxed. His behaviour tonight had been so strange. \u2018You were a little off tonight. I thought it was because of Callum\u2019s appearance ...\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Malcolm grunted. \u2018No. You were uncomfortable around him. Anyone could see that. No, that didn\u2019t bother me.\u2019</p><p>However, Cam had. Malcolm\u2019s slight possessiveness tonight and the claiming of me on his living-room couch hadn\u2019t been about Callum. It had all been about Cam. He\u2019d seen the way Cam had been looking at me and it had ignited his inner Alpha. And although Callum had touched my ass in front of Malcolm, that hadn\u2019t bothered him because I hadn\u2019t reacted.</p><p>But Cam had bothered him.</p> <p>Because I had reacted.</p><p>I nuzzled against Malcolm, trying to force my pulse to slow. \u2018He rubs me the wrong way too.\u2019 I tried to cover up my attraction, making excuses for my response to Cam. \u2018To be honest, we barely speak a word to each other at work.\u2019</p><p>I hadn\u2019t even realized Malcolm had been tense until I felt his muscles relax against me. \u2018I\u2019m going to see about getting him a job in graphic design. For Becca\u2019s sake.\u2019</p><p>Yeah. For Becca\u2019s sake.</p><p>It took a while for me to fall asleep after that conversation.</p> <p>My eyes slammed open, my heart beating hard against my ribs. I had sensed something was wrong.</p><p>Where was I? I tried to blink the fog of sleep from my eyes so I could focus.</p><p>Why was I so bloody warm?</p><p>Malcolm. I was in his room.</p><p>My eyes travelled down to the arm that was slung over my waist, and I turned my head over my shoulder to see Malcolm sleeping soundly behind me.</p><p>My eyelashes fluttered against the bright light streaming in through the crack in his blinds.</p> <p>What time was it?</p><p>Lifting his arm as gently as possible, I eased out of the bed and tiptoed over to where my watch lay on his black lacquered Oriental cabinet.</p><p>\u2018Balls,\u2019 I hissed, gaping at the time. It was past noon. On a Sunday. Cole would have come home early in hopes that I was taking him to the Nicholses\u2019 for Sunday dinner. And I wasn\u2019t there. Where was my phone? Where was my dress?</p><p>Shit, shit, shit.</p><p>\u2018Jo?\u2019 Malcolm mumbled and my gaze flew back to the bed, where he was staring at me sleepily. \u2018Where are you going?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I slept in. I\u2019m supposed to be home for Cole and my mum by now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fuck,\u2019 he mumbled. \u2018What time is it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Quarter past twelve.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018It feels earlier.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, it\u2019s not,\u2019 I replied, exasperated. I wasn\u2019t quite sure at whom. I dashed across the room and planted a quick peck on his cheek before hurrying away. \u2018I\u2019ll phone you later!\u2019 I called, grabbing my dress from his bedroom floor. I found my shoes, knickers, bra and bag in his living room, and as I hurriedly dressed I called for a taxi on speakerphone.</p><p>It was there in no time, and I dashed out of the duplex, shivering against the blast of cold air coming off the water, before I dived into the warm confines of the cab. I took the opportunity to check my messages.</p><p>I had one from Joss asking if I would be at lunch today.</p><p>And, bloody hell, I also had a text from Cole that he\u2019d sent hours ago. I\u2019d missed it. It seemed Jamie\u2019s parents had had a huge argument, so Cole had got a taxi home last night.</p><p>Balls!</p><p>In the flustered, muddled mess I was in, Sunday lunch was not a good idea. I texted Joss back to let her know we\u2019d be skipping it this week.</p><p>When the taxi pulled up to the flat, I tore up those stairs in my five-inch heels, not caring about the noise clacking like nails against steel all the way through the building. I shot a glower at Cam\u2019s door as I passed, and then threw myself up the last few stairs, bursting through my front door, only to be welcomed by the sound of Cole\u2019s laughter. Laughter that was followed by deep masculine laughter.</p><p>\u2018Cole?\u2019 I stormed from the hall into the living room and stopped dead in my tracks.</p><p>My little brother was sitting on the floor, surrounded by his drawings, laughing up into Cameron MacCabe\u2019s face. Cole\u2019s eyes were lit up in a way I hadn\u2019t seen in a long time, and for a moment all I could think was how much it hurt that he didn\u2019t look that happy more often.</p><p>And then the fact that Cam was in my flat registered.</p><p>Cam was in my flat.</p><p>My flat, where my mother lived.</p><p>I felt sick.</p><p>\u2018Jo.\u2019 Cole jumped to his feet, his eyes dimming. \u2018I was worried.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 I shook my head, gesturing with my phone. \u2018I didn\u2019t get your text until twenty minutes ago.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s okay.\u2019 He shrugged. \u2018Everything\u2019s okay.\u2019</p><p>Cam stood up, smiling at Cole. That expression completely dissipated when he turned to face me, the softness melting into absolute nothingness. \u2018Jo.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cam, what are you doing here?\u2019 I asked breathlessly, my eyes darting towards the hall, thinking of Mum hidden away in her room. Maybe I could get him out before she made an appearance.</p><p>He strode past Cole, patting his shoulder almost protectively, before moving towards me. \u2018Let\u2019s talk. Out in the hall.\u2019</p><p>Dumbfounded, I watched him pass me.</p><p>\u2018Now, Jo.\u2019</p><p>I flinched at the demand in his voice, annoyance taking over my bemusement. How dare he speak to me that way? I wasn\u2019t a bloody dog. I narrowed my eyes on Cole. \u2018What happened?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Johanna, now,\u2019 Cam snapped.</p><p>My spine straightened. He might as well have whacked me across the ass with a belt. I gave Cole a look that promised retribution for letting Cam into the flat, and then I turned on my heel and followed Cam out into the hall. He\u2019d walked down the first flight of stairs.</p><p>I threw my hands on my hips, giving him attitude as I glared down at him. \u2018Well?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Would you come here?\u2019 His authoritative voice drew my gaze to his features \u2013 they were tight, his blue eyes blazing sparks at me. Someone was seriously pissed off. \u2018I\u2019m not shouting up there to you.\u2019</p><p>With a huff of annoyance I tore off the heels that were hurting me and threw them back into the flat. My bare feet touched the icy concrete as I hurried down the stairs towards him, and that seemed to wake me up. It also made me fully aware of what a dishevelled mess I was. \u2018What? Why were you in my flat?\u2019</p><p>Cam leaned into me, our faces almost on eye level. That soft curl of his upper lip was gone again, pinched against his lower lip. His gorgeous cobalt eyes were bloodshot today, and he looked even more tired than he had yesterday. Despite his obvious and mysterious irritation with me, I couldn\u2019t help but want to fall against him, feel those strong arms wrap around me, and inhale the scent of Cam and bay rum.</p><p>\u2018Maybe first you\u2019d like to tell me what kind of sister leaves her wee brother alone all night to deal with an alcoholic mother who\u2019s a bit too quick to raise a hand against him. Hmm? What kind of sister would leave a kid to that so she can spread her legs for someone who probably doesn\u2019t know the first thing about her,\u2019 he hissed, his eyes flashing with disgust. \u2018Just when I think I\u2019m completely wrong about you, you prove me right with your utter selfishness.\u2019</p><p>I couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>What did he mean she was quick to raise her hand against Cole?</p><p>\u2018I had to help Cole out last night. I heard shouting coming from the flat and I went up to see if you were okay. You were gone. And he was left alone with that.\u2019 Cam couldn\u2019t have looked more disappointed in me if he\u2019d tried. In fact, he seemed enraged by the disappointment of me. \u2018You should be fucking ashamed.\u2019</p><p>Words failed me.</p><p>I could feel the tears welling up inside me and I pushed them back, refusing to let him make me cry. His attack seemed to boomerang around my head and it took me a moment to gather myself, to come to a decision about how to react.</p><p>My first thought was of Cole.</p><p>What does Cam mean? Fear and a sleeping anger burned in my stomach.</p><p>As for Cam, he was going to think what he liked about me. He had a proven record of jumping to conclusions and ripping me apart. As much as I was attracted to him, I knew without a doubt that I wouldn\u2019t be able to like this man. He so easily hurt me.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t deserve a response.</p><p>I turned away with what I hoped was a quiet dignity, but Cam wouldn\u2019t even give me that.</p><p>His grip pinched my upper arm as he tugged me back to face him, and the blood drained from my face as the forceful aggression triggered memories.</p><p>\u2018Useless little bitch, give me that.\u2019 Dad grasped my arm, his fingers bruising as he pulled me towards him, ripping the TV remote from my hand.</p><p>I froze in fear, anticipating the next blow.</p><p>\u2018Always in the fucking way.\u2019 His breath stank of beer as he leaned into my face, his own face red with alcohol and anger. His eyes flashed. \u2018Dinnae you look at me like that!\u2019 His hand raised and I braced myself, my bladder letting go in fright before he backhanded me, sending me flying against the floor, my cheek blazing with red-hot pain that stung my eyes and nose. I felt wetness soak my pants. \u2018Get out of my sight before I give you a proper leathering.\u2019</p><p>I whimpered, trying to see through the tears.</p><p>\u2018Get up!\u2019 He moved towards me and I scrambled along the floor ...</p><p>\u2018Let me go,\u2019 I whispered in panic. \u2018Please let me go.\u2019</p><p>Cam\u2019s hand immediately fell from me. \u2018Jo?\u2019</p><p>I shook my head, my eyes refocusing on him. I could see he\u2019d paled too, the disgust gone from his eyes and replaced with a frustrated concern.</p><p>\u2018Jo, I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u2019</p><p>I made a scoffing sound. Too late. \u2018Stay away from me, Cam,\u2019 I managed shakily and this time when I turned to leave him, he let me.</p><p>I found Cole standing in the hallway, and from the undiluted anger in his boyish features I knew he\u2019d heard every word of my tongue-lashing from Cam. He shook his head, his fists clenched at his side. \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 he said as I shut the door behind me. \u2018He helped with Mum and then ... he was interested in my work, my comics. It was stupid. I thought he was cool. I\u2019m really sorry, Jo.\u2019</p><p>I leaned back against the door, still trembling. I had questions and I wasn\u2019t sure I really wanted to hear the answers to them. \u2018Why did you let him in?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cole heaved a sigh, running a hand through his hair. \u2018I got home late and I must have woken her up. She was in one of her moods. She was yelling and I couldn\u2019t get her to stop. And then I heard a banging at the door and then Cam was calling your name. He was going to wake up the whole building, so I answered the door to see who the hell he was.\u2019</p><p>My jaw clenched. Cam knew the truth about Mum.</p><p>Could my life get any crappier? \u2018Well, now he knows everything about me.\u2019</p> <p>As if remembering what he\u2019d overheard Cam saying to me, Cole\u2019s eyes narrowed in vengeful slits. \u2018He knows fuck all.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Language.\u2019</p><p>Cole just stared at me, and while he did I searched his face for marks. Was that redness on his cheekbone or just the light? My chest tightened with the weight of my emotions. \u2018He says ...\u2019 I struggled, flexing my shaking fingers. \u2018He says she hit you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It was nothing.\u2019 Cole shrugged.</p><p>He shrugged and my entire world tilted dangerously. \u2018Mum hit you? Has she hit you before?\u2019 I felt the angry tears prick the corner of my eyes and Cole caught sight of them.</p> <p>This time when he answered me, his mouth quivered a little. \u2018Just slaps, Jo. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle.\u2019</p><p>I clutched my stomach, feeling sick, and the tears spilled over my lids.</p><p>No. No! NO!</p><p>I sobbed and fell back against the door.</p><p>I thought I\u2019d done everything that was in my power to protect him from the physical and emotional pain of a parent\u2019s abusive hands. And it seemed I hadn\u2019t done nearly enough.</p><p>\u2018Jo.\u2019 I felt Cole approach me tentatively. \u2018This is why I didn\u2019t say anything.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You should.\u2019 I tried to breathe through my tears. \u2018You should ha-have told me.\u2019</p><p>His arms came around me and as so often of late, I found myself being comforted by my baby brother instead of the other way around.</p><p>Eventually the tears stopped and I moved to the living room, where Cole brought me a cup of tea. As the hot drink spilled into my stomach, it seemed to stoke the flames of my seething rage against my mother.</p><p>It had been one thing to neglect Cole.</p><p>It was another thing entirely to have physically abused him.</p><p>\u2018How many times?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jo ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cole, how many times?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018It\u2019s just been the past year. A few slaps here and there. She says I look like Dad. I haven\u2019t hit her back, though, Jo, I promise.\u2019</p><p>I remembered the muttered comments of late about Cole\u2019s resemblance to Dad \u2013 the bitterness in those comments, the blame, the resentment. I should have seen it. Worse, I remembered a bruise he\u2019d had around his right eye and cheekbone months ago. He\u2019d told me Jamie had clipped him when they\u2019d got overly exuberant during a video game fight. I stared at his cheek. \u2018The bruise?\u2019</p><p>He knew what I was talking about. His gaze dropped to the floor, his shoulders hunched. \u2018She was hysterical. She kept hitting at me and I was trying to get away without hurting her back, but I fell against the corner of the kitchen unit.\u2019</p><p>Growing up with an aggressive father had made me skittish of confrontation, of arguments, of anger. I became passive. I didn\u2019t anger easily. Until I met Cam.</p><p>Even then, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever felt the kind of rage I was feeling now.</p><p>Cole had always felt like my kid. He was my kid.</p><p>And I hadn\u2019t protected him.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to watch some TV for a while,\u2019 I told him quietly, trying to deal with this new information.</p><p>\u2018Jo, I\u2019m really okay.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019</p><p>He sighed and got up. \u2018I take it we\u2019re not going to the Nicholses\u2019 today.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nope.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay. Well ... I\u2019ll be in my room if you need me.\u2019</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I sat there staring blankly at the television, vacillating between walking into my mother\u2019s room and smothering her with a pillow and just packing Cole\u2019s and my bags and running for it, hoping that Mum\u2019s threats were empty. At a sound behind me, I blinked and turned around. Nothing was there.</p><p>I thought I\u2019d heard the front door open.</p><p>Now I was going crazy.</p><p>Exhausted by the tumult of emotions I\u2019d gone through in the last twenty-four hours, I flopped back against the couch and closed my eyes. I needed to shower and change, but I was afraid to move towards my mum\u2019s room. I was afraid that passive old me was about to lose my cool \u2013 big time.</p><p>A while later, the worst happened.</p><p>Mum\u2019s door creaked open and I sat up, my muscles growing taut as I watched her appear in the hall. Her hair was all over the place and she was clutching her fuzzy pink robe around her as she shuffled into the kitchen holding an empty bottle and a mug.</p><p>Blood whooshed in my ears as my body stood up with no command from me to do so. It was as if I was stuck inside my head but no longer in control of what my limbs did. With my heart slamming against my ribs, I followed her into the kitchen.</p><p>She turned at the sounds of my footsteps, and leaned against the counter, putting the mug down. Her smile was weak as she said, \u2018Hi, sweetie.\u2019</p><p>Looking at her, all I could recall was the utter humiliation I\u2019d felt at the hands of my father with his quick fists and hateful words. I lacked any self-worth because of that man.</p><p>How dare she try to do the same to Cole \u2013 try to undo all I\u2019d done to protect him from ever having to feel that way? It was a singular kind of pain to have your parents find you worthless, find you so unlovable that they could hurt what nature told them they should protect. I\u2019d never wanted Cole to feel that pain ...</p><p>... and this bitch had gone and done it.</p><p>With an animalistic cry of deep, gnawing rage, I flew at her. My body slammed hers against the counter, her head snapping back against the upper kitchen unit, and I took satisfaction in her wince of pain.</p><p>How does it feel? How does it FEEL?</p><p>My hand reached up to grip her loosely but threateningly by the throat and she stared into my face with round, appalled eyes.</p><p>I leaned into her, trembling from my reaction, shaking with betrayal.</p><p>Yes, betrayal.</p><p>She\u2019d betrayed us for gin.</p><p>She\u2019d betrayed me by hurting what I loved most.</p><p>I sought to catch my breath, my chest rising and falling rapidly, and I flexed my hand around her throat. \u2018If you ever ...\u2019 I shook my head in disbelief. \u2018If you ever touch Cole again ... I will kill you.\u2019 I pushed against her. \u2018I will fucking kill you!\u2019</p><p>Her eyes flared and she nodded rapidly, gulping in fear. I glared into her eyes, somehow unable to remove my hand from her throat.</p><p>I felt a touch on my arm. \u2018Jo?\u2019</p><p>Slowly but surely, the world came back to me and I shuddered, relaxing my grip as I turned to my left.</p><p>Cole stood at my side, the colour leached from his face, staring at me as if he\u2019d never seen me before.</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>I looked over his shoulder only to find Cam standing in the kitchen doorway, his expression grim.</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>When I turned, Mum was cowering against the kitchen counter.</p><p>What am I doing?</p><p>Shame flooded me ... and I ran.</p><p>I flew past Cole, pushed past Cam, ignoring him as he called out to me. Throwing myself out the door, I hurried down the stairs in my bare feet, not knowing where I was going, just knowing I had to get away from the person I\u2019d just become in that kitchen.</p><p>Something gripped my arm, wrenching me to a stop.</p><p>Cam\u2019s face blurred before me, and I pulled away from him, trying to escape, but his arms seemed to be everywhere. I struck out at him, grunting and swearing at him, and the more I struggled, the more soothing his voice became.</p><p>\u2018Cam, let me go,\u2019 I pleaded, exhaustion draining the strength from my limbs. \u2018Please.\u2019 The sob broke before I could stop it, and then I was crying, my hard, pained, loud, tear-filled cries muffled quickly against his throat as he enfolded me in his warm arms.</p><p>I fell against him, letting him hold me, my tears soaking his T-shirt and his skin as his arms hugged me tight against him.</p><p>\u2018Let it out,\u2019 he whispered comfortingly in my ear. \u2018Let it out.\u2019</p><p>11</p><p>In their own time my jagged tears stopped, and my breathing became easier as Cam\u2019s body heat and strong embrace provided a balm against the pain I was in.</p><p>It occurred to me that I\u2019d had an emotional breakdown in front of the one person in the world I hadn\u2019t ever wanted to.</p><p>And he had been kind.</p><p>I pulled back, abruptly letting go of Cam, but his hands still clasped my upper arms lightly. Not quite able to meet his gaze yet, I looked to the left, and movement drew my attention. The gasp caught in my throat as I tilted my head up to find Cole standing on the stairs, deep lines furrowing his forehead and his eyes dark with concern.</p><p>Cam\u2019s hands rubbed up and down my shoulders in a gesture of comfort and I could no longer avoid his gaze. Our eyes met and I felt overwhelmed with emotion.</p><p>Humiliation.</p><p>Shame.</p><p>Anger.</p><p>Gratitude.</p><p>Anxiety.</p><p>Fear.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 I mumbled, my eyes sliding back up to Cole. \u2018I better take Cole inside.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019</p><p>Surprised, I found my gaze drawn back to Cam. His expression was troubled but determined as he shook his head at me. \u2018Come into my flat. I\u2019ll make you some coffee.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I have to talk to Cole.\u2019 My little brother had witnessed my attack on our mother. I was terrified of what he must think of me, and I needed to somehow explain.</p><p>\u2018You can talk to Cole later. First you\u2019re going to take a minute for yourself.\u2019</p><p>I thought of Cole in the flat alone with Mum and my stomach flipped. \u2018He\u2019s not going back in there without me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Here.\u2019 Cam finally let go of me so he could pull his wallet out of the back pocket of his jeans. I watched warily as he removed a twenty-pound note and held it up to Cole. \u2018You think you could phone some pals to come and join you at a movie at the Omni Centre?\u2019</p><p>Eyes pinning Cam in place, Cole took the stairs down to us with an air of authority that stunned me. Every day was another progression into manhood \u2013 especially days like this. When he reached Cam, his eyes were full of understanding and maturity, and he took the note carefully. \u2018Aye, I can do that.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018But \u2013\u2019 My protest was cut off by Cole, who shook his head at me like a parent to his child. My mouth slammed shut more from surprise than anything else, and I watched with a mixture of pride and worry as he narrowed his eyes on Cam.</p><p>\u2018Can I trust you with her?\u2019</p><p>Cam heaved a deep sigh, but he answered Cole as if he was speaking to a man on equal footing. \u2018I know I deserve that, but I promise from now on I\u2019ll treat your sister with the respect she deserves.\u2019</p> <p>I was truly dumbfounded by the exchange. The fact that I was already a shell-shocked mess didn\u2019t make it any easier to understand what was passing between them, and it was probably why I allowed Cole to take money that I knew Cam must need and walk out of our building. That\u2019s also why I let myself be manhandled into Cam\u2019s flat.</p><p>His flat, like ours, was a rental, and although decorated in neutral colours it was definitely in need of a repaint. Cam\u2019s furniture was practical and comfortable, with very little thought to style, except for his huge black suede couch and matching armchair. I found myself ushered to the couch and I sat down numbly, staring around at the space that was still cluttered with packing boxes.</p><p>\u2018Tea? Coffee?\u2019</p><p>I shook my head. \u2018Water, please.\u2019</p><p>When Cam returned with a glass of water for me and a coffee for him, I watched him settle into the armchair just across from me and my heart began to gallop.</p> <p>What was I doing here? Why was Cam being so nice all of a sudden? What did he want? I should get back up to the flat and face the consequences.</p><p>\u2018Jo.\u2019 His deep, raspy voice brought my chin down. I\u2019d been staring at the ceiling and hadn\u2019t really even realized it. When I looked at Cam, I felt my body tense. His eyes were searching my face as if he was desperate to dive inside me and unearth all my secrets. My breath caught at the intensity of his look. \u2018What the hell happened to your life, Jo? How did you get here?\u2019</p><p>A bubble of bitter laughter escaped from my lips and I shook my head at him. I asked myself that question every day. \u2018I don\u2019t trust you, Cameron, so why would I tell you anything?\u2019</p><p>Regret replaced his concern, and there was no denying the genuine remorse in his eyes. \u2018That\u2019s fair. And I can\u2019t even begin to tell you how shit I feel about going off on you about Cole. He came down here to set me straight.\u2019 He suddenly threw me a rueful grin that kicked my heart into high gear. \u2018I swear I thought he was going to take a swing at me.\u2019</p><p>That wasn\u2019t particularly good news to my ears, which Cam must have sensed, because he grew sombre quickly. \u2018You never have to worry about that kid being disappointed in you, Jo. He loves you to bits. And what we just witnessed in the kitchen \u2013 that\u2019s nothing for you to be ashamed of. That was a mum protecting her kid. Because that\u2019s what you are to him. More of a mum than a sister \u2013 I realize that now.\u2019 He made a sound heavy with regret. \u2018I feel awful about the way I spoke to you. I feel shit that you found out about your mum hitting Cole that way.\u2019</p><p>My eyes dropped to the floor and I couldn\u2019t speak. I couldn\u2019t respond to his apology \u2013 partly because the ungracious side of me was thinking, Good. I\u2019m glad you feel like shit.</p> <p>\u2018You need to talk to someone. Out in the hall, that was because you\u2019ve been bottling up God knows what for months ... years? Jo, please talk to me.\u2019</p><p>Instead I took a sip of water, my fingers trembling \u2013 from adrenaline or my emotional fear of Cam, I couldn\u2019t tell you.</p><p>\u2018Fine.\u2019 Movement from Cam drew my gaze back to him and he was leaning forward in his chair, his expression seeming more open than I\u2019d ever seen it. \u2018Maybe it\u2019ll help if you get to know me a bit better.\u2019</p><p>My response was a humourless snort. \u2018What? Were you a therapist in another life?\u2019</p><p>Cam made a face. \u2018I\u2019ve never been accused of that before. You know, usually it\u2019s the woman asking me to open up to her? The first one I\u2019m actually interested in hearing about and she\u2019s shutting me down. Not good for my ego.\u2019 He gave me a coaxing smile and I remembered the night I\u2019d first seen him, watching him give Becca that smile and thinking I\u2019d do anything that smile asked of me.</p><p>Funny how a couple of weeks could change it all.</p><p>Cam saw my eyes darken and his expression fell. \u2018Okay, Jo, ask me anything. Anything you want to know.\u2019</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. Anything? So he was serious about wanting to help, was he? Well, I knew one way of finding out. My eyes fell to the tattoo on his arm, the one with the black script that read BE CALEDONIA. Becca\u2019s lilting voice echoed in my head ...</p> <p>\u2018... don\u2019t bother asking him what the hell that means, because he won\u2019t tell you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jo?\u2019</p><p>I looked up from the tattoo to his rugged face. \u2018What does the ink mean? \u201cBe Caledonia\u201d?\u2019</p><p>The left side of his mouth tilted up as his eyes glittered at me. \u2018Well played.\u2019</p><p>I was already braced for disappointment. There was no way Cam cared enough about me to divulge the secret behind his tattoo. My question would prove that his interest was mere curiosity and then I could go back to hating that he knew more about my life than he should.</p><p>So when he relaxed back into his armchair, his eyes never leaving mine, I was more than taken aback when he replied, \u2018It\u2019s something my dad said to me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Your dad?\u2019 I asked a little breathlessly, still astonished that he\u2019d offered up an answer. What did that mean?</p><p>Cam nodded, taking on a faraway look that told me he was back somewhere in his memories. \u2018I grew up in Longniddry with a doting mum and a caring dad. I\u2019ve never met two people who loved each other more, or who loved their kid more than they loved me. Not to mention that my dad\u2019s brother, my uncle I once told you about, was like a second father to me. He was always there for me. We were a close-knit group. When I hit my teens, though, I went through what everybody goes through. You\u2019re trying to find out who you are and you\u2019re struggling to stay true to that person when the people around you seem so different from you. You\u2019re asking yourself, is it me? Puberty makes you a really moody fucker, but for me it was only exacerbated when my parents sat me down when I was sixteen and told me I was adopted.\u2019</p><p>That I had not been expecting. My mouth dropped open, \u2018Cam ...\u2019 I muttered sympathetically, drawing his sharp gaze.</p><p>He gave me a small shake of his head, as if to say, \u2018I\u2019m fine now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It messed me up then. Suddenly, there were two people in the world who had abandoned me, who for whatever reason, didn\u2019t love me enough to want to keep me. And who were they? What were they like? If Mum and Dad weren\u2019t my real parents, then who the fuck was I? The way I laughed had nothing to do with Dad like I thought it did ... Their dreams, their talents ... the possibility of all their kindness, intelligence and passions passing on to me was gone. Who was I?\u2019 He gave me a sad smirk. \u2018You don\u2019t realize how important it is to feel like you belong somewhere, that you\u2019re part of a family legacy, until you don\u2019t have it. It\u2019s a huge part of your identity growing up. It\u2019s just a huge part of your identity full stop, and I guess I was in quite a bit of pain for a while after I found out the truth.</p><p>\u2018I acted like a dick \u2013 skipped school, got high, almost destroyed my chances of graduating with the qualifications I needed to get into the College of Art at Edinburgh Uni to do graphic design. I insulted my mum, ignored my dad. I constantly thought about finding my birth parents. I couldn\u2019t think of anything else, and in the interim I seemed intent on destroying everything I had been, in the hopes of finding who I reckoned I was supposed to be.</p><p>\u2018A few months later I took my dad\u2019s car for a joyride. Luckily, the police didn\u2019t catch me, but a wall did. I totalled the car and my dad had to come out and get me. I was drunk. Shaken up. And once my dad finished verbally annihilating me for putting my life and everyone else on the road\u2019s life in danger, he took me for a walk on the beach. And what he said to me that day changed my life.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Be Caledonia,\u2019 I replied softly.</p><p>\u2018Be Caledonia.\u2019 Cam grinned, love in his eyes for the man who was his dad. \u2018He said that Caledonia wasn\u2019t a name we\u2019d given to our land, to Scotland, but the name the Romans had. I was used to him spouting off random stuff about history, so I thought I was in for some boring lecture. But what he said that day changed everything for me \u2013 he put it all in perspective.</p><p>\u2018You know, the world will always try to make you into who it wants you to be. People, time, events, they\u2019ll all try to carve away at you and make you think you don\u2019t know who you are. But it doesn\u2019t matter who they try to make you, or what name they try to give you. If you stay true, you can chip off all their machinations and you\u2019re still you underneath it all. Be Caledonia. It might be the name someone else gave the land, but it didn\u2019t change the land. Better yet, we embraced the name, keeping it but never changing for it. Be Caledonia. I had it inked on my arm when I was eighteen to remind me every day of what he said.\u2019 He smiled ruefully. \u2018If I\u2019d known how many people were going to ask me what it meant, I wouldn\u2019t have put it somewhere so bloody visible.\u2019</p><p>My eyes had welled up again as I watched Cam\u2019s face relaxed with humour. My chest ached with a fullness I\u2019d only ever rarely felt, and I realized that it was gladness. I was glad for him. I was glad he had that kind of love in his life. \u2018He sounds like a great dad.\u2019 I knew if I\u2019d had that kind of love in my life I would have turned out so differently.</p><p>Cam nodded, his eyes lifting to smile into mine. \u2018I have a wonderful mum and dad.\u2019 His gaze drifted upward to the ceiling, and even at that angle I could see it darken. \u2018Sometimes it takes days like today to remind me of that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re going to phone them as soon as I leave, aren\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>He threw me a shy grin, and my chest squeezed at the little splotch of colour high on his cheeks. \u2018Probably,\u2019 he muttered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I\u2019m happy for you, Cam.\u2019 I nervously straightened the dress I was still wearing from last night\u2019s dinner. \u2018I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like to wonder who your real parents are. But to a certain extent I understand feeling abandoned by the two people in the whole world who are supposed to want me. It\u2019s not the best feeling, is it? I would have swapped what I had for what you had in a second.\u2019</p><p>Cam\u2019s eyes pinned me to the couch again. \u2018And what exactly did you have?\u2019</p><p>My hands trembled as I smoothed my dress over my legs again. \u2018You know, the only person who knows anything real about my life is Joss.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Not Malcolm? Not Ellie?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No. Just Joss. I don\u2019t want anyone else to know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That is a helluva lot to be carrying around by yourself.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cam.\u2019 I leaned forward, my watery eyes searching his face, my pulse speeding as I struggled to come to a decision on whether to trust him or not. \u2018I ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jo.\u2019 He leaned forward too and my whole body tensed under his sober regard. \u2018What I just told you, about the adoption and about the tattoo \u2013 only a handful of people in this world know about them. Mum, Dad, Peetie and Nate. And now you. You and I are starting over today. I\u2019m not some asshole who has judged you over and over again and got you wrong every single time. Trust me. Please.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Why?\u2019 I shook my head, completely confused by his interest. I mean, I knew that we were sexually attracted to each other, even if we wouldn\u2019t admit it out loud, but this was something else. This was different ... more intense \u2013 and I hadn\u2019t thought anything could be more intense than the way my body came alive around Cam.</p><p>He gave a jerk of his head. \u2018Honestly, I don\u2019t know. All I do know is that I\u2019ve never treated anyone the way I\u2019ve treated you, and I\u2019ve never met anyone who deserved it less. I like you, Jo. And whether you want to admit it or not, you need a friend.\u2019</p><p>Those bloody tears swam towards the corners of my eyes again, threatening to spill over. I sucked in a deep breath, looking away from him, my eyes catching on the large desk in the corner of the room. A drawing board was propped up on it. There was a sketch on it, but I couldn\u2019t make out what it was. I squinted at it as I procrastinated over whether or not I should tell him anything.</p><p>\u2018Where\u2019s your dad, Johanna? Why are you raising Cole?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know where he is.\u2019 I glanced back at him, wondering if my eyes were as haunted as I felt inside. \u2018He was abusive.\u2019</p><p>Cam\u2019s jaw immediately clenched, and I saw his fingers grip his coffee mug tighter. \u2018To you and Cole?\u2019</p> <p>I shook my head. \u2018I protected Cole. Cole doesn\u2019t even remember him or know that he was abusive to me.\u2019</p><p>Cam swore under his breath, dropping his gaze so I wouldn\u2019t be subjected to the full force of his anger. Somehow that anger felt nice. It was nice to have someone else feel it. What I was telling him, not even Joss knew. \u2018How long?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Since I was little.\u2019 The words seemed to pry open my lips and spill down my chin. Although confused, I didn\u2019t dare stop them. \u2018Until I was twelve. He was aggressive, violent and stupid. That\u2019s definitely the way to sum up Murray Walker. He spent a good time away from the house, which allowed us to breathe a little, but when he was there he\u2019d hit me and Mum. But Cole ... I always got Cole out of the way when Dad was in a mood or I\u2019d distract him from Cole so he\u2019d go for me instead.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jesus, Jo ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cole was two. Dad could have killed him with one blow, so it was all I could do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What happened to him? Your dad?\u2019 Cam almost spat the word, as if the man had no right to carry the title. And he didn\u2019t really, did he?</p><p>I curled my lip in disgust as I thought about Dad\u2019s greatest moment of stupidity. \u2018Assault and armed robbery. He got ten years in Barlinnie Prison. I don\u2019t know if he served all his time, or when he got out \u2013 all I know is that by the time he did we\u2019d already left Paisley with no forwarding address. Mum never told anyone from the old life where we were going. Neither did I.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Was your mum always the way she is?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018She drank, but not like this. She still functioned.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I take it she started after your dad went to prison?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I scoffed bitterly, knowing exactly why she\u2019d started. \u2018Not that she was a great mum or anything, but she was better than she is now. No.\u2019 I closed my eyes against the dull pain in my chest. \u2018She went downhill for another reason.</p><p>\u2018Growing up I had one person in my life I trusted. My uncle Mick. He wasn\u2019t my real uncle. He was my dad\u2019s best friend when they were kids. Uncle Mick was a good guy, though. Straight as an arrow \u2013 made a good living as a painter and decorator. But he was friends with my asshole of a father. I never really found out why they were friends, but I got the impression they went through a lot together as kids. Although Dad pissed him off, Uncle Mick couldn\u2019t seem to let go. Whenever he could, he\u2019d check in with us. He used to take me to work with him sometimes.\u2019 The ache intensified as I felt the loss of him again. \u2018He didn\u2019t know Dad hit me. Dad was careful in front of him. I think he was always a little wary of Uncle Mick. That changed when I was twelve.\u2019 I shuddered as the memories washed over me.</p><p>\u2018It was a Saturday and Dad was drinking while watching the football. Mum was at work. I made the mistake of walking past the television at an important point in the game. He backhanded me and I was on the floor ...\u2019 I sucked in a breath, staring at Cam\u2019s carpet, feeling the pain all over again. I\u2019d never felt anything like it. The bite, the sting, the heat ... \u2018He took off his belt and hit me ... I can still see the look on his face, like I wasn\u2019t human to him, let alone his daughter.\u2019 I shook myself and lifted my gaze to Cam\u2019s. He had grown pale, his features stretched taut with emotion he was trying to control. \u2018I guess I was lucky that Uncle Mick turned up when he did. He heard me screaming and came crashing in. Uncle Mick was a big guy and, well ... he put Dad in hospital that day. He was arrested, but neither of them mentioned Dad\u2019s assault on me for fear the social services would get involved. Dad just dropped the charges and Uncle Mick walked away with a fine.</p><p>\u2018Dad disappeared. Next thing we heard was that he\u2019d been jailed for armed robbery. While he was inside, Uncle Mick was around a lot more, helping out. For the first time in my life I had an almost twenty-four/seven parent who really cared. He even had a good influence on Mum.\u2019 I huffed, the resentment welling up again. \u2018Too good.\u2019</p><p>Cam guessed. \u2018Your mum was in love with him.\u2019</p><p>I nodded. \u2018I think she always had been, but as far as I know nothing ever happened. Uncle Mick cared about her but not like that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So what happened?\u2019</p><p>Someone took him away from me. \u2018Just a little over a year later, Uncle Mick left for America.\u2019</p><p>\u2018America?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Years ago he\u2019d had an affair with an American student. She was studying at Glasgow University for a year and they were together for a good few months. But she left and Mick didn\u2019t follow. Fourteen years later Mick was contacted by his thirteen-year-old daughter, a daughter he never knew he had. He flew over there to meet her, get DNA testing rolling, hash it out, I imagine, with his kid\u2019s mum. He came back for a while, but the results came in and the kid was his ... so he left everything behind to be with her.\u2019</p><p>Seeming to sense how much that had ripped me up inside, Cam whispered, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, Jo.\u2019</p><p>I nodded, feeling the emotion claw at my throat. \u2018He told me he would have taken me and Cole if he could have.\u2019 I coughed, trying to force the pain back down. \u2018He e-mailed me, but I stopped responding and eventually his e-mails stopped.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And your mum fell apart?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aye. I think he broke her heart. She started drinking more than normal, but things didn\u2019t get really bad until we moved here. She was fine for a while, had a good job, but then she put her back out of commission and couldn\u2019t work. So she got drunk instead, and then she got drunker. Until eventually she wasn\u2019t even a functioning alcoholic.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And you can\u2019t take Cole away from her because he\u2019s not legally yours and if the social services ever found out about your family situation they\u2019d most likely put him into care rather than let you have him ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Or worse ... they\u2019d contact my dad.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fuck, Jo.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, you can say that again. I dropped out of school at sixteen, got a job, tried to keep us afloat, but it was really rough. There were days it took everything I had to buy Cole a tin of beans. We were checking down the sides of the couch for lost coins, measuring out how much milk we were using. It was ridiculous. Then ... I met someone. He helped me pay the rent and put some money aside for a rainy day. However, he got bored after six months, so it wasn\u2019t really all I\u2019d thought it had been.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But it showed you a new life. You started dating men with money to get by?\u2019 Cam\u2019s body tensed as he asked the question.</p><p>I turned my head from him and even though there was no longer any censure in his question, I still felt ashamed. \u2018I\u2019ve never dated a guy I wasn\u2019t attracted to, or that I didn\u2019t care about.\u2019 My eyes found his and I prayed for him to believe me. \u2018I cared about Callum. I care about Malcolm.\u2019</p><p>Holding up his hands, Cam stopped my worries with a gentle look. \u2018I am not judging you. I promise.\u2019</p><p>I raised an eyebrow.</p><p>He grunted. \u2018Any more. Or ever again.\u2019 He shook his head, his brows dipped in consternation. \u2018You must have thought I was such a self-righteous prick.\u2019</p><p>I chuckled. \u2018I do believe I may have actually called you that.\u2019</p><p>His eyes brightened. \u2018Good girl, by the way,\u2019 he said approvingly. \u2018Giving me what for.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I smiled a little shyly. \u2018I usually hate confrontation, but I did quite enjoy putting you in your place.\u2019</p><p>My words had the opposite effect of what I\u2019d intended. He didn\u2019t laugh. Instead he was grave. \u2018Earlier in the hall, I grabbed your arm ...\u2019</p><p>I looked away as I remembered my reaction. \u2018I tend to freeze if someone gets aggressive with me. Just a reflex from years with my dad.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I didn\u2019t mean to be aggressive.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You know I\u2019m a martial artist.\u2019</p><p>As my eyes ran over his lean but roped physique, I was so busy checking him out that I didn\u2019t call him on his seemingly abrupt change of subject. \u2018Makes sense.\u2019</p><p>His answering smile was more than a little cocky and I rolled my eyes, making him laugh. He shook his head, trying to return to being serious. \u2018Judo. Nate and I both go to classes. You should come with me, Jo. Learning self-defence might help \u2013 it could give you back a little control.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 My stomach jumped uneasily at the thought. \u2018I work during the day Monday to Wednesday anyway. I don\u2019t have a lot of spare time.\u2019</p><p>I had surprised him again. \u2018You have another job?\u2019</p><p>I gave a huff of laughter, thinking I understood his surprise. \u2018Believe it or not, I never ask Malcolm for anything he gives me. I accept gifts he chooses to give me, but that still leaves me with bills to pay. Plus I have to put money aside for when Cole decides what university he\u2019s going to. Oh, speaking of \u2013 let me get my purse so I can pay you back the money you just gave Cole.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Forget it.\u2019 Cam shook his head, and catching the stubborn tilt to my chin, he narrowed his eyes. \u2018I mean it.\u2019</p><p>Hmm. I would just have to find a way to pay him back later in such a way that he couldn\u2019t say no.</p><p>As if he was reading my thoughts, our eyes locked in a battle of wills, and slowly but surely the familiar tension thickened, heat creeping between us. My eyes dipped to his mouth, to that soft, curling upper lip I wanted to nip ... amongst other things. I wondered what his mouth tasted like, how it would feel brushing butterfly kisses down my neck, tugging my nipple into its heat ...</p> <p>My body tightened, fire tingling in my cheeks and between my legs. I snapped my gaze back up and found that Cam\u2019s own eyes had darkened, his body coiled with the tension.</p><p>I stood up abruptly. \u2018I\u2019d better go.\u2019</p><p>Cam smoothly got to his feet as well. \u2018Are you going to be okay going back up there?\u2019</p><p>For a while he\u2019d actually managed to make me forget that I\u2019d attacked my mum not too long ago. I found myself shocked all over again. \u2018How do I even ... ?\u2019</p><p>\u2018First ...\u2019 Cam approached me carefully and I had to contain the little shiver of want that rolled over me again when his rough hand grasped my chin to lift my eyes to his. When our eyes met, the pull between us grew stronger. I wanted to curl my nails into his skin, latch on and never let go, and the overwhelming need shook me to my very core. How had it happened that one conversation had changed everything? This Cam in front of me was someone new, someone good, someone I felt close to \u2013 closer to than anyone. And I found that I wanted in deeper, not satisfied with merely \u2018close\u2019.</p><p>The realization made me a little dizzy.</p><p>\u2018You get that guilt out of your head,\u2019 Cam ordered softly. \u2018Don\u2019t dare apologize to her. Anyone would have done what you did. Look at what your uncle Mick did when he found out your dad was beating you. It\u2019s instinct to protect those we care about. Sometimes instinct makes us do things we\u2019d never imagine we\u2019re capable of doing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Violence should never be the answer.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Aye, in a perfect world. But sometimes animals don\u2019t understand anything but their own language.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want Cole to think what I did was right.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He doesn\u2019t,\u2019 Cam assured me. \u2018What you did was human. He thinks what you did, you did out of love.\u2019 His hands dropped to curve around my shoulders and he tugged me a little closer, causing my breath to hitch. The expression in his eyes, the one I couldn\u2019t quite understand, didn\u2019t help my frayed nerves. \u2018That kid could have been brought up like you \u2013 without a parent, without proper care and affection. Jo, you saved him from that. And he bloody well knows it.\u2019</p><p>I felt the weight of today\u2019s revelations settle on me, and I suddenly, desperately, wanted my bed. \u2018Thank you, Cam.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nothing you told me leaves this room. I promise.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ditto with what you told me.\u2019 I stepped back, needing a little physical distance from him. Something awful suddenly occurred to me. \u2018I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to ever be able to leave Cole alone with her again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s a strong kid. He\u2019ll be fine.\u2019</p><p>I blew out a breath. \u2018Yeah, but will I?\u2019</p><p>Cam smiled at me as if I was completely clueless. \u2018Jo, you are now officially the strongest woman I know. Have a little faith in yourself.\u2019</p><p>Silence stretched between us as I processed his words. It was the nicest thing anyone had ever said to me, and I wondered how someone who had been so unpleasant to me could do such a three-sixty. \u2018Why were you really such a dick to me?\u2019</p><p>Cam\u2019s chin lifted a little, telling me he hadn\u2019t expected the blunt question after our \u2018heart-to-heart\u2019. \u2018I don\u2019t know ... I just ...\u2019 He ran a hand through his messy hair, his ring glinting in the light. He had such beautiful, masculine hands. \u2018At first when I saw you with Malcolm, I just assumed you were like my uncle\u2019s ex-wife.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p><p>He grinned and gestured to me. \u2018Because I didn\u2019t think a girl like you would be interested in an older guy like Malcolm unless he had money.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A compliment and insult in one. Well done, Cam.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I do try.\u2019</p><p>I made a face at him. \u2018So after that ... ?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, I realized pretty quickly you weren\u2019t stupid, and it just pissed me off that a bright, attractive woman didn\u2019t think she was worth anything more than being some rich guy\u2019s fancy piece.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And then?\u2019</p><p>He gave me an unamused look at my interrogation. \u2018Then I thought I was wrong. You genuinely seemed to care about Malcolm. However, Callum turned up at the dinner and I took one look at him, a younger version of Malcolm, and I realized you had done this before.\u2019</p><p>I glanced away. \u2018I see.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But really \u2013\u2019 My eyes flew back to his at his softened tone. \u2018It just pissed me off that you\u2019re this completely different person around those guys.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A different person?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, with Joss and everyone, with me, you\u2019re someone else, someone real. With Malcolm, with Callum, with the guys you flirt with, you\u2019re different. You\u2019re less than you really are. And that fucking giggle ...\u2019</p><p>I laughed outright.</p><p>Cam\u2019s lips twitched. \u2018You\u2019re aware of it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Joss made me aware of it. It drives her nuts. Sometimes I do it just to annoy her.\u2019</p><p>Cam laughed. \u2018Well, it works. It\u2019s irritating as hell.\u2019</p><p>A feeling I couldn\u2019t quite name took hold of me then. Cam really did like me. For me. Sans fake giggle. Just like Joss. \u2018I\u2019m going to go, Cam. But thank you for today.\u2019</p><p>He eyed me warmly, hope glittering a little mischievously in his gaze. \u2018I\u2019m forgiven, then?\u2019</p><p>I nodded without needing to think about it. I was already feeling more free for having confided in him, and since we both had done some confiding it felt like a balanced exchange. I wasn\u2019t anxious about having trusted him, and that just blew my mind. \u2018Clean slate.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Friends?\u2019</p><p>I almost laughed at that paltry description of what I felt for this stranger who had become my confidant. \u2018Friends.\u2019</p><p>12</p><p>I had showered and changed into my pyjamas and was feeling a little better \u2013 Mum hadn\u2019t come out of her room \u2013 by the time Cole returned home. He stopped by the couch and squeezed my shoulder before heading into the kitchen to grab a snack.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re okay?\u2019 I asked as he came back in to flop down on the floor.</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re okay.\u2019 He shrugged, staring at the television with a casualness I was sure he wasn\u2019t feeling. \u2018Are you okay? Was Cam okay?\u2019</p><p>I smiled, ignoring the stupid flutter of butterflies in my stomach at the thought of Cam. \u2018He was great. What did you say to him earlier? He mentioned something about you looking like you were going to hit him?\u2019</p><p>Cole grunted. \u2018If I had, he would have deserved it. Didn\u2019t need to, though. Dude\u2019s a decent guy \u2013 felt like shit when I told him how wrong he was about you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Language.\u2019 I threw a cushion at him and he batted it away with a murmured apology. \u2018And why did you go down there to set him straight? It wasn\u2019t like I was desperate for him to see me in a better light.\u2019</p><p>Cole looked at me, and I saw his green eyes had gone a forest colour from some unnamed emotion. \u2018Nobody gets to think that about you, let alone say it out fu\u2013\u2019 He caught himself before he swore. \u2018Out loud.\u2019</p><p>I wanted to cry, because right then my brother was making me feel pretty loved and pretty cool, but I thought crying would just make Cole roll his eyes. \u2018Okay,\u2019 I whispered and he gave me a little nod before turning back to the television. \u2018Comedy Channel?\u2019</p><p>I changed the channel for him just as my phone rang. Handing Cole the remote, I got up and followed the ringtone into the kitchen where I\u2019d left my purse.</p><p>It was Joss. I felt a little relieved it wasn\u2019t Malcolm \u2013 I didn\u2019t even want to touch on why. \u2018Hi,\u2019 I answered quietly.</p><p>\u2018Hey, you.\u2019 Joss\u2019s rich, husky voice was soothing to my nerves and I realized I\u2019d missed seeing her at lunch today. \u2018I\u2019m just checking in. You okay?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Um, not really.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You sound like shit.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well ...\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Okay, I\u2019m coming over.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Joss, you don\u2019t have to.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I have a bottle of wine here. Are you going to argue with me and a bottle of wine?\u2019</p><p>I smiled. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Smart lady. I\u2019ll be there in ten.\u2019 She hung up and I rolled my eyes. I always knew there was a secret \u2018momma bear\u2019 hiding underneath all Joss\u2019s prickliness.</p> <p>When she arrived, she took one look at me and shook her head, her brows drawn together. \u2018Jesus C, Jo, what\u2019s happened now?\u2019</p><p>I stepped aside to let her in, nodding at the bottle of wine in her hand. \u2018Let\u2019s crack this open first. We\u2019re both going to need it.\u2019</p><p>Cole greeted Joss with a brusque nod and headed into his room to give us some privacy. Joss got comfortable on the end of the couch. \u2018Hit me with it.\u2019</p><p>My mouth twisted at the irony of her word choice. \u2018Well, now that you mention it ...\u2019</p><p>When I was finished, I had to body tackle her to the couch so she couldn\u2019t barge into my mum\u2019s room and give her a beatdown, and then I had to spend five minutes assuring her that Cole and I were okay.</p><p>Her eyes were still flashing a little wildly as she took a sip of wine. \u2018So Cam was there for you?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yeah. He was very kind, actually.\u2019</p><p>Her eyebrows rose at my expression and then she gifted me with one of her gorgeous smiles. \u2018Oh, I recognize that look. I see that look on Ellie\u2019s face every time she gazes at Adam.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Whatever,\u2019 I muttered, refusing to let her catch sight of my eyes in case they just confirmed her suspicions.</p><p>\u2018You are so crushing on Cam and I didn\u2019t even have to do anything.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not crushing on Cam.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know what that look means.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re just friends.\u2019 I stared at her now. \u2018Joss, I like him, but we have partners, and I ...\u2019</p><p>Joss sighed. \u2018You still want the security that Malcolm can give you.\u2019</p> <p>I didn\u2019t need to answer \u2013 we both knew she was right.</p><p>\u2018Does Cam give you butterflies?\u2019</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u2018Are you aware of every move he makes?\u2019</p><p>Another affirmative.</p><p>\u2018Does he enter your thoughts at the slightest provocation?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mm-hmm.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You are so screwed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I am not.\u2019 I huffed indignantly. \u2018I\u2019m perfectly in control of the situation.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019 Joss snorted. \u2018So was I until I found myself pinned to Su\u2019s desk. Eighteen months later and I\u2019m picking out bedsheets with Braden and worrying if he doesn\u2019t text me at least once from work to let me know how his day is going \u2013 as if he can\u2019t tell me when he gets home. I can\u2019t get to sleep without him beside me. Me? Can\u2019t sleep without a guy in my bed? I\u2019m addicted, Jo. And it started out with that look you\u2019ve got.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad for you, Joss. I really am. But it\u2019s not the same thing. I care about Malcolm. I\u2019m just physically attracted to Cam. It\u2019s nothing.\u2019</p><p>Joss burst out laughing and I watched in complete bemusement as she shook with her own hysterics.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>She waved me off, trying to catch her breath. \u2018Oh, man, nothing. Nothing.\u2019 She looked at me again and then gave a furtive chuckle as if she knew something I didn\u2019t. \u2018I\u2019m just having d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\u2019</p><p>For the first time ever, I pretended to be sick at work. I told Mr Meikle I was coming down with a migraine, and since I was pale with worry for Cole, it didn\u2019t take much convincing for him to let me leave early, although he grumbled the entire time I packed up my things.</p><p>I managed to get back to the flat just as Cole was getting home from school. He stopped in the hallway when he stepped inside the flat, his lips pinched as he watched me kick off my work shoes.</p><p>\u2018Well, you can\u2019t pull a sickie every day,\u2019 he said, deducing exactly what I\u2019d done and why. \u2018You\u2019ll just have to trust that I can take care of being in the flat alone with her. Plus, I really think you scared the crap out of her.\u2019</p><p>At that exact moment Mum\u2019s bedroom door opened. She peered out at us, her lip curling in hostility as her eyes clashed with mine. She made a grunting noise before using the wall to help her along to the bathroom. As soon as the door shut, I turned back to Cole.</p><p>\u2018Apparently, I can\u2019t trust you to be alone with her.\u2019</p><p>He winced at the reminder that he had kept her abuse from me. \u2018I just didn\u2019t want to upset you.\u2019</p><p>I harrumphed at that and strode into the kitchen for a cup of tea. By the time I\u2019d made it and nestled into the couch with my book, Cole had settled down on the armchair with his homework and Mum had gone back into her bedroom.</p><p>We sat there for an hour before I decided to get up and put on some dinner. I was just coming out of the kitchen when I heard a knock at the door. For an awful moment I thought maybe I\u2019d finally stretched Malcolm\u2019s patience and he\u2019d turned up at the flat. He\u2019d texted me today and I\u2019d texted back, but I hadn\u2019t encouraged conversation. Had he decided to show up to see what was going on?</p><p>My heart was pounding stupidly hard as I reached for the door, and it flipped over in my chest when I saw who stood on the other side of it.</p><p>\u2018Cam.\u2019 I smiled, more than happy to see him.</p><p>He was wearing his usual uniform of print tee and jeans and I wanted to haul him in out of the freezing-cold stairwell. He gave me a quick smile. \u2018All right?\u2019</p><p>I stepped aside. \u2018Come in.\u2019</p><p>His smile widened and he slid past me, his shoulder brushing mine and causing inappropriate thoughts to tumble through my overworked brain. \u2018Can I get you a coffee?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aye, that would be great.\u2019 He followed me, throwing a wave to Cole. \u2018Hey, bud, how are you?\u2019</p><p>Cole grinned at him. \u2018Good. You?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, not bad.\u2019 He trailed me into the kitchen.</p><p>\u2018What do you take?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Milk, no sugar.\u2019</p><p>I set about making it, fully aware of his eyes on my every movement. My cheeks felt incredibly warm under his perusal, and I hurried to get his drink ready. \u2018You\u2019re working tonight, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 I said, handing him the mug.</p><p>\u2018I am. But I wanted to drop something off first.\u2019 He took a sip of his drink. \u2018Mmm, good coffee.\u2019</p><p>I laughed softly. \u2018The way to a man\u2019s heart.\u2019</p><p>His grin was wicked. \u2018Only an easily pleased man,\u2019 he retorted, suggesting he was anything but easy to please.</p><p>\u2018Yeah, I can guess what it takes to please you, Cam, and this is a PG-rated household.\u2019</p><p>He threw back his head and laughed, causing another flutter in my chest and my own smile to widen. \u2018Good thing the flat downstairs is open to X-rated situations.\u2019</p><p>I flushed and shook my head. \u2018Moving on ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018What? Punters in the bar say worse than that to you and your comebacks are always good.\u2019</p><p>He had been paying attention. I shrugged. \u2018They\u2019re not my friends.\u2019</p><p>His eyes softened. \u2018I\u2019m still your friend, then? You haven\u2019t changed your mind?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, I haven\u2019t changed my mind.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good.\u2019 He pulled something out of his back pocket. \u2018Because I want you to trust me enough to give this to Cole.\u2019 Cam held out a key. I raised an eyebrow at it. \u2018A spare key to my flat. I want him to use my place when you\u2019re not around. It\u2019s a safe place for him to be so you\u2019re not worrying every second of every minute that you\u2019re not with him.\u2019</p><p>That key was the best present anyone had ever given me.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>\u2018Cam\u2019 \u2013 I looked from the key up to him \u2013 \u2018are you sure? I mean, it\u2019s not too much of an imposition?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not if it helps you out.\u2019</p><p>I reached for the key, but instead of just taking it, I curled my hand around it and his fingers. He tensed with awareness and I poured my gratitude into my eyes. \u2018This is the best present I\u2019ve ever had.\u2019</p><p>Cam\u2019s eyes roamed my face, his mouth curled up at the corners. \u2018A key: the way to a woman\u2019s heart.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Only an easily pleased one.\u2019</p><p>He laughed again.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s so funny?\u2019 Cole\u2019s voice snapped us out of our little bubble. I pulled my hand back from Cam\u2019s and held up the key to Cole.</p><p>\u2018Present.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll explain in a minute.\u2019 I turned to Cam. \u2018Would you like to stay for dinner? Macaroni cheese.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How can I say no to that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You can\u2019t. I won\u2019t let you.\u2019 I handed the key to Cole. \u2018Take Cam into the sitting room \u2013 he\u2019ll explain. Dinner will be ready soon.\u2019</p><p>They left me to it and for a moment I could only stare at the cupboard, my insides all trembling and fluttering from my interaction with Cam. He was thoughtful and considerate and trying to prove what a good friend he could be, and that just made his hotness even hotter. I wondered, not for the first time, what he\u2019d be like in bed. His grin alone made me tingle \u2013 imagine what his tongue could do.</p><p>My phone buzzed, snapping me out of my sensual haze.</p><p>Malcolm.</p><p>Guilt immediately washed over me as I pressed the ANSWER button. \u2018Hey, Malcolm.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sweetheart. How are you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just about to put out dinner for me and Cole.\u2019 I winced at the omission of our guest. \u2018Can I call you back?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course. Talk to you soon.\u2019</p><p>I hung up and shoved my phone in my back pocket with shaking fingers.</p><p>Seriously. What was I playing at?</p><p>Cam stopped by early before work the next day and walked me to the bar. I found that now we understood each other Cam was pretty easy to talk to. He tried once more to persuade me to go to judo with him, but I put him off, still not keen on the idea of having someone slam me into a mat or whatever it was judo involved. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Can you imagine me?\u2019 I scoffed as we neared the bar. \u2018I\u2019d be screaming about breaking a nail within five seconds.\u2019</p><p>Cam gave me a look as he held the wrought-iron gate to the basement stairs open for me. \u2018See, that\u2019s the kind of bullshit other people believe. I know better.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, you do, do you?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You were sitting chewing a nail last night after dinner.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, but I filed it and repainted it for work this morning.\u2019</p><p>He flashed his teeth at me. \u2018Whatever, Walker. I know the truth.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Evenin\u2019, Jo, Cam,\u2019 Brian greeted us as we came down the stairs. He stood beside Phil, who was grinning at me like always.</p><p>\u2018Hi, guys.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Brian, Phil.\u2019 Cam nodded at them.</p><p>As I made to pass them, Phil stopped me with a hand on my arm. He ran his eyes down my body. \u2018Still with Malcolm?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Persistent Philip, I am still with Malcolm.\u2019</p><p>He winked at me. \u2018Persistence will win in the end.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And so will an STD,\u2019 Cam put in drolly, gently pushing me forward with his hands on my back so that Phil had to let me go. \u2018But you already know that, right, Phil?\u2019</p><p>I tried to stifle my giggle as we walked into the bar to the sounds of Brian howling with laughter and Phil swearing at him. \u2018It was only that one time. Fuck! I\u2019m never telling you anything again, Bri.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Euch,\u2019 I whispered to Cam. \u2018That was more than I needed to know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Correction: that was the one thing you needed to know.\u2019</p><p>I laughed again and we sauntered into the staff room, barely getting a \u2018hello, goodbye\u2019 out of Su, who came racing out of her office at the sight of us and disappeared as quickly as she\u2019d materialized.</p><p>\u2018It amazes me that anything gets done around here,\u2019 Cam said, shrugging out of his jacket. \u2018She\u2019s never here when she should be.\u2019</p><p>I grunted at that, completely used to Su\u2019s physical absence and as always grateful for it.</p><p>The bar soon started to fill up. As usual on a Tuesday, there weren\u2019t many customers, but we were kept relatively occupied.</p><p>We weren\u2019t busy enough to diminish our attraction to one another, however. For some reason, being behind the bar together seemed to heighten the tension. Was it the confined space? I didn\u2019t know. All I did know was that I spent half the time with one eye on my work and the other on Cam.</p><p>Joss was right. I was absolutely aware of every move he made.</p> <p>And speaking of Joss, I wasn\u2019t at all surprised when she stopped in at around nine thirty. I was surprised she was alone, but she explained that Braden was working late and Ellie and Adam were on a date.</p><p>\u2018So you were bored and thought you\u2019d come to work?\u2019 I asked, sliding her a Diet Coke as she settled on to a stool at my end of the bar. I didn\u2019t think so. I thought she was worried about me.</p><p>Joss just smiled and then nodded in greeting to Cam, who had just noticed her presence, but he was too busy talking to a customer to come over. No, not a customer. My eyes focused more carefully on the girl he was grinning at so flirtatiously. Becca and a friend. She handed him his aviator watch and Cam leaned over and pressed a soft kiss to Becca\u2019s lips.</p><p>I felt an ache rake across my chest, unfamiliar and brutal.</p><p>My eyes slid back to Joss and she had one eyebrow raised at me. \u2018What you\u2019re feeling ... it\u2019s called jealousy. It\u2019s a vile emotion, I know. However, it also tells you that Cam is definitely more than just someone you\u2019re attracted to.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We barely know each other.\u2019</p><p>\u2018From what you\u2019ve told me, you know each other better than almost anyone else does.\u2019</p><p>Somehow, this was the truth. I leaned forward on the bar, frowning at my friend. \u2018Yeah, how did that happen?\u2019</p><p>\u2018How did what happen?\u2019 I turned my head to see Cam approaching, fastening his watch on his wrist. Becca and the other girl were gone. He waited for an answer, his eyes curious on mine.</p><p>I decided to hedge. \u2018You really are a nosy bugger, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 I teased.</p><p>Cam tipped his head to the side, contemplating me. \u2018Deflection?\u2019 His eyes glittered as if something had just occurred to him. \u2018You were talking about me, weren\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>I wanted to wipe that cocky smile off his face.</p><p>Joss groaned. \u2018You and Braden should be forced to join a club for men who need to get over themselves.\u2019</p><p>My eyes slid to her in amusement. \u2018Blatant displays of egotism will be punished in the form of making them wear Speedos in freezing-cold conditions.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And possibly withholding food.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No. Sex. Withholding sex.\u2019</p><p>Joss bit her lip. \u2018I don\u2019t know if that would work for me.\u2019</p><p>I eyed her incredulously. \u2018Are you telling me you couldn\u2019t go without sex for a few days?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t think so.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Where is your willpower?\u2019</p><p>My friend took a swig of her Diet Coke. \u2018Hey, you haven\u2019t had sex with Braden Carmichael.\u2019</p><p>No, I hadn\u2019t, although I almost blushed remembering I\u2019d definitely tried to get myself into the position to do so. \u2018Yeah, but I\u2019ve had perfectly good sex and I could still abstain for a few days.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Perfectly good sex?\u2019 Cam interrupted us, drawing both our gazes. His voice was low with some unnamed emotion. \u2018Abstain?\u2019 His now heated eyes ran the length of me before returning to meet mine. \u2018Then he isn\u2019t doing it right.\u2019</p><p>My heart puttered to a stop before choking and wheezing. When it got back up to speed, it took off in a drag race. All that sexual heat rolled over me and I felt my knickers grow damp with want.</p><p>\u2018Jesus C,\u2019 Joss croaked. \u2018Now I\u2019m turned on.\u2019 She jumped off her stool, checking her phone. \u2018I think I\u2019ll go home and see if Braden\u2019s back from work.\u2019</p><p>And just like that she left us simmering in our sexual chemistry.</p><p>I smiled weakly at Cam. \u2018How\u2019s Becca?\u2019</p><p>A few customers approached the bar and we both moved to serve them. As we were preparing their drinks Cam answered tightly, \u2018Becca\u2019s fine. How\u2019s Malcolm?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine.\u2019 He\u2019d taken me for lunch during my break from work that day and I\u2019d managed to convince him that everything was hunky-dory.</p><p>\u2018Cole text yet to say if he\u2019s home?\u2019</p><p>I found myself grinning like an idiot at his concern, and my customer grinned back at me, clearly thinking the look was for him. I quickly handed him his change and turned to Cam. \u2018Yeah, he\u2019s home.\u2019</p><p>His eyes crinkled at the corners, adding another one of his expressions to my favourites. \u2018Good.\u2019</p><p>The rest of the night flew by. We worked, we talked, we joked, but the sexual undercurrent remained. When we walked home after our shift, we did so in utter silence. I could say it was just tiredness, but my whole body was vibrating like a tuning fork just strolling beside him. We said goodnight at his door, and as I took the stairs to my flat with his eyes on my back, I wished, not for the first time, for a different life \u2013 that Cam was single, that Malcolm wasn\u2019t a part of my life that I cared about, and that for once I could do what I really wanted to do.</p><p>And what I really wanted to do was Cameron MacCabe.</p><p>I checked on Cole and found him sleeping peacefully in his room. I even checked on Mum just to make sure she hadn\u2019t choked on her own vomit or anything like that, and I found her snoring away. That done, I changed into my PJs and crawled into bed. But I couldn\u2019t fall asleep.</p><p>My blood felt as if it was on fire in my veins, my nerves were sparking at the very ends, and I couldn\u2019t get the smell of Cam\u2019s cologne out of my nostrils.</p><p>I was so turned on, it wasn\u2019t funny.</p><p>How different would my night have been if Cam had followed me into Su\u2019s office when I\u2019d gone in there to leave her new stock information? What if he\u2019d come up behind me, pushed my hair off my neck, and pressed his hot mouth to my skin as his hand skimmed around my waist and down to the buttons on my jeans ...</p><p>... if he\u2019d undone them, his long fingers sliding inside, beneath my underwear ...</p><p>My own hand smoothed over my stomach, slipping under my pyjamas and knickers so I could bring myself to climax, fantasizing about Cam screwing me against Su\u2019s desk.</p><p>I muffled my moan as I came and once the tremors stopped, I curled into my side, guilt cascading over me once again.</p><p>I was a terrible girlfriend.</p><p>13</p><p>A truth I hadn\u2019t been willing to face pushed its way to the forefront of my life over the next few weeks. The truth was, for a number of years now every day had been the same \u2013 had been constrained, dulled, vivid colours muted beneath the shadow of a wall. And behind that wall I walked in the same uniform every day \u2013 if I wanted to be really melodramatic, I\u2019d call it a dull orange jumpsuit. But as the days of those few weeks flew by, I felt that uniform melting away, shredding into tatters and scraped from my body as I climbed the wall to the other side.</p><p>The wall was moving further away now, the shadow lifting, the colours brightening.</p><p>All because I was spending time with Cam.</p><p>We hung out as much as possible on weekdays. Every night, in fact, he\u2019d stop by for coffee or dinner before his work shift, even if I was out with Malcolm. We walked back and forth to work together, and had a laugh with Joss during our shifts. I didn\u2019t see him at the weekends because he worked, trained at judo class with his friends and hung out with Becca. Last time, he\u2019d taken Cole to watch the class, encouraging Cole to do more physical activity, and surprisingly, my brother was embracing the idea. My ears were bleeding from hearing about judo.</p><p>For me, Cam was a confidant. I told him more about my life and my hopes for Cole\u2019s future. For Cole, Cam was a soul mate. They drew comics together, they discussed comics together, they liked the same music, the same movies, and from what I could read between the lines, Cam also answered all those questions Cole wouldn\u2019t dare ask me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We became this family unit, bonding quickly and strongly.</p><p>My feelings for Cam only grew deeper and I was in a constant battle with my conscience, arguing with it, pretending that it didn\u2019t mean anything. Along with the emotional stuff, my body was almost at breaking point for want of him. I don\u2019t know how I managed to hide it from him, but I did. I didn\u2019t want anything to destroy our friendship.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t find other outlets for my pent-up sexual frustration, and that outlet only added a whole other level of guilt and shame to my already considerable stack. I hadn\u2019t seen Malcolm as much as I usually did, but three of the four times I did see him, we had sex ... and the three times we had sex I ...</p><p>... I did the unthinkable. I closed my eyes and imagined Cam.</p> <p>I came each time.</p><p>Malcolm took this to mean he and I were back on track and whatever had been bothering me before was dealt with.</p><p>I was an awful, awful person.</p><p>Yup. My world was full of colour. Red for want. Yellow for shame.</p><p>Green for jealousy.</p> <p>Yes, the green-eyed monster had also reared her ugly head in the last few weeks. Every time Cam mentioned Becca\u2019s name I felt that little ache in my chest, an ache that ruptured into a full-blown bleed on Sunday.</p><p>Cole and I had had lunch with the Nicholses and had come home in a good mood. Cole had gone downstairs to invite Cam up for coffee and I was humming away like an idiot, my stomach already a riot of fluttery winged creatures in anticipation of seeing him, when Cole came back into the flat unaccompanied.</p><p>I frowned at him as I poured Cam\u2019s coffee. \u2018Is he just coming?\u2019</p><p>Cole shook his head, his brows drawn together in what I took for bemusement.</p><p>\u2018Not in?\u2019</p><p>He shrugged.</p> <p>Oh, dear God, the shrugging had returned. \u2018Well?\u2019</p><p>He leaned against the kitchen counter and sighed before he shot me a questioning look. \u2018Are you and Cam just friends?\u2019</p><p>I coughed up the lie quite easily these days. \u2018Of course. I\u2019m with Malcolm. Why?\u2019</p><p>Two spots of colour appeared high on Cole\u2019s cheeks and his mouth quirked up at the corners in amusement. \u2018Because it definitely sounds like Cam\u2019s too busy shagging some noisy bird to want to have coffee with us.\u2019</p><p>My whole body froze as I stared at my brother, my heart pounding, a horribly uneasy feeling in my stomach as jealousy seized hold of me.</p><p>\u2018Jo?\u2019</p><p>I frowned, grasping at a reason for my freeze. \u2018Don\u2019t say \u201cshagging\u201d and don\u2019t say \u201cbird\u201d. Not \u201cbird\u201d, \u201cchick\u201d, \u201cpiece\u201d. We\u2019re \u201cwomen\u201d or \u201cladies\u201d or \u201cgirls\u201d.\u2019</p><p>Cole grunted. \u2018Thanks for the vocab lesson.\u2019</p> <p>I stared after him as he took off for the living room, my good mood annihilated by the thought of Cam and Becca having sex.</p><p>I guess in the end I couldn\u2019t really cope with all the colour, and the following Thursday, before the crack of dawn, I stripped the wallpaper in the sitting room. I was taking time to find some calm. The night before I went on a date with Malcolm, but I ended up getting him to drop me off early at the flat, after making up some excuse about not feeling well. I hurried upstairs to check the Internet, found the sale I was looking for, reserved what I needed from the local store, and began priming the walls.</p><p>When Thursday morning broke, I got Cole ready for school, ignoring his grumblings about the stripped walls, and then I headed out to pick up what I\u2019d reserved: three rolls of wallpaper. I also bought some paste and a box of doughnuts.</p><p>As soon as I changed into my paint-covered jeans and tee, scraped my long hair back into a ponytail, and put on my headscarf, I felt better. Calmer already. I was just putting up my pasting table when Mum appeared in the doorway.</p><p>We stared at each other.</p><p>We hadn\u2019t spoken since my attack in the kitchen almost three weeks before.</p><p>Her tired eyes swept the living room \u2013 the dust sheets, the rolls of wallpaper, the bucket of paste. She grunted. \u2018Again?\u2019</p><p>Taking my cue from Cole, I shrugged in reply.</p><p>Mum sighed and shook her head wearily. \u2018Any food?\u2019</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s leftover pasta from last night. Can you heat it up without burning down the flat?\u2019</p><p>She waved off my caustic comment and moved towards the kitchen a little unsteadily. \u2018I\u2019ll eat it cold.\u2019</p><p>A little while later she returned to her room. That was good. Despite what I considered my civility in light of the circumstances, I still found it hard not to throw a punch anytime I thought of her hitting Cole. Honestly, that\u2019s all I really saw now when I looked at her.</p><p>I switched on my music but kept it low so as not to disturb alco-mum and began to hang the new wallpaper. It was cream with very faint champagne, silver and chocolate stripes. I\u2019d have to get new cushions for the couch and change the floor lamp, but I didn\u2019t care. Decorating always zoned me out and I needed to zone out big time. I started at ten and by eleven I was feeling completely relaxed and sated from having eaten two doughnuts. I was in the middle of hanging a sheet of wallpaper, thinking that the kitchen cabinets could do with a repaint, when there was a knock at the door.</p><p>Turning on my stepladder, my hands high above me holding the wallpaper away from the wall, I yelled, \u2018Who is it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cam!\u2019</p><p>Nope. He wasn\u2019t going to destroy my calm. I took a deep breath and looked back at what I\u2019d accomplished so far. I was on my last piece of wallpaper and the room looked brighter and fresher already. \u2018Come in!\u2019 I lined up the paper and used the brush to smooth the top of it to the wall.</p><p>Two seconds later I heard him ask behind me, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019</p><p>Ignoring the effect of his voice on my body, I slid the paper slightly, checking its position before smoothing down another section. \u2018I\u2019m wallpapering.\u2019</p><p>\u2018By yourself?\u2019 I could hear the incredulity in his voice.</p><p>I nodded, taking a step down the ladder so I could smooth the middle section. It was lining up exactly. Practice did make perfect. \u2018Who do you think decorated this place? The wallpaper, the paint, the sanded floors ...\u2019 I finished off the piece and stepped back, smiling at the new look.</p><p>Turning to Cam, I was surprised to find a slightly dumbfounded look on his face as his eyes searched the room and then came back to me. \u2018Do you know how bloody hard it is to hang wallpaper? You just did it like a pro.\u2019</p><p>I made a face at him. I didn\u2019t see what the big deal was. \u2018Uncle Mick taught me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018When you were ten?\u2019 he asked, smiling in curiosity. \u2018When did you start this?\u2019 He nodded at the folding table.</p><p>\u2018An hour ago.\u2019</p><p>Those gorgeous eyes of his widened. \u2018And you\u2019re done already? Jo, this place is really nicely put together. It looks professional. You know that, right?\u2019</p><p>I grinned at the compliment, feeling a flush of pleasure that he thought so. \u2018Thank you. It drives Cole nuts. He almost had a fit when he saw the stripped walls.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Actually\u2019 \u2013 Cam took a step towards me \u2013 \u2018The reason I came by was because of Cole. I got this weird text from him saying, \u201cJo\u2019s wallpapering. She only does that when something\u2019s up. Do you know what\u2019s going on?\u201d \u2019</p><p>Traitor. I sighed, looking away from Cam. So it had got to the point where Cole was now going to our neighbour for help, even when it concerned me. Was I to have no secrets?</p><p>\u2018Well?\u2019</p><p>I shrugged. \u2018Every now and then it helps me relax.\u2019 I tried to placate him with a smile. \u2018Cam, you of all people know my life is stressful. I just do this to relieve it.\u2019</p><p>Seeming to have mercy on me, Cam gave me a slow nod. \u2018Right.\u2019 He looked at the floor now, his eyes running along it to the paintwork on the skirting board. Without saying a word he disappeared and turned towards the kitchen. I heard him in the kitchen and then watched him appear, passing the doorway to head along to the bedrooms and bathroom. I heard three doors open. Bathroom, Cole\u2019s room and my room.</p><p>Cam returned to the living room to encounter my \u2018look\u2019, featuring raised eyebrows and arms crossed over my chest. His lips twitched at it. Mine did not. \u2018Are you done, you nosy bugger?\u2019</p><p>He grinned. \u2018You have a lot of books.\u2019</p><p>I harrumphed.</p><p>\u2018Explains the vocab.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Excuse me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re very articulate. Well read.\u2019</p><p>Why did Cam\u2019s compliments always have to be the best? It was very irritating to someone who was trying to get him out from under her skin.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re also talented.\u2019</p><p>Astonishment jolted through my body. \u2018Me? Talented?\u2019 Was he high?</p><p>His arm swept around the room. \u2018Jo, you should be doing this for a living.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Um, doing what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Painting and decorating.\u2019</p><p>I laughed at the absurdity of it. \u2018Oh, okay. Who in their right mind would hire a high school dropout with no experience to be a painter and decorator? Let\u2019s face facts. I\u2019m useless, Cam.\u2019</p><p>His eyes instantly hardened, narrowing on me and pinning me in place. \u2018You are not useless. Don\u2019t talk about yourself like that in front of me. It pisses me off.\u2019 It was lucky he had no intention of waiting for me to speak, since I didn\u2019t know how to reply or react to the warm fuzzies in my chest. \u2018You\u2019re good at this. Really good. I think Nate knows someone with his own company. I could see about getting you an apprenticeship.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No. I\u2019m twenty-four. No one hires a twenty-four-year-old apprentice.\u2019</p><p>\u2018They do if it\u2019s a favour for a friend.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cam, no.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jo, come on, at least think about it. You enjoy it and you\u2019re good at it. It\u2019s better than working two jobs and dating \u2013\u2019 He stopped himself, blanching when he realized he\u2019d almost crossed the line.</p><p>Well, not really \u2018almost\u2019. He had crossed it. I clenched my jaw, forcing back the sting of tears in my eyes as I realized he still saw me that way \u2013 the bimbo after the rich guy\u2019s wallet. I wiped the paste off the folding table, deciding to ignore him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Jo, think about it.

I sighed heavily and dumped the paste brush back in the bucket. \u2018Cam, stay. I\u2019ll see to Mum, you make yourself a coffee. Maybe get me a tea while you\u2019re at it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jo!\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m coming!\u2019 I shouted and Cam seemed taken aback. \u2018What?\u2019 I asked as I moved to pass him.</p><p>He smirked. \u2018Never heard you raise your voice.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve obviously never seen me approached by a spider.\u2019</p><p>Laughing, Cam waved towards the door. \u2018I\u2019ll get the coffee.\u2019</p><p>Feeling relieved that he\u2019d decided to stay I hurried to get whatever Mum needed over and done with.</p><p>To my surprise she was lying in her bed, not seeming to be in any kind of \u2018situation\u2019 after all. Oh, God, I hoped she hadn\u2019t lost control of her bladder. That had happened before. \u2018What?\u2019 I asked, hovering in the doorway.</p> <p>\u2018Who is that?\u2019 she asked loudly, nodding her head to indicate behind me. \u2018I\u2019ve heard his voice lately. Who is it?\u2019</p><p>It was the first time Mum had really ever taken an interest in anything outside of her gin-soaked, wasted existence and I couldn\u2019t help but reply, \u2018That\u2019s Cam. He\u2019s a friend.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You fucking him?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mum,\u2019 I snapped, flinching at how loudly the question had been asked.</p><p>\u2018Well?\u2019 she asked with a sneer. \u2018Look at you! Standing there, judging me. Get that look oot yer eyes, girl. You think yer better than me. Accusing me of hitting Cole, thinking I\u2019m nothing. Well, look in the mirror, girl, \u2019cause yer nothing too!\u2019 As her eyes sparked with her contempt, I knew this was what she\u2019d been waiting for. This was her payback for my attack. Humiliating me in front of Cam. \u2018Yer useless and that piece oot there will walk away when he gets bored with what\u2019s between yer legs!\u2019</p><p>I slammed the door shut, my whole body shaking as I leaned my forehead against it, trying to control my breathing. A few seconds later I heard her start to cry.</p><p>\u2018Jo?\u2019</p><p>I sucked in my breath at his voice and turned slowly around to find him standing in the hallway, his eyes glittering with anger. He took the few steps he needed to be close to me and he said loudly, so Mum would hear, I imagine, \u2018You are not useless. You are not what they say you are.\u2019</p> <p>I glanced down at his tattoo.</p><p>Be Caledonia.</p><p>When my eyes travelled back up to his and I saw pain in his eyes for me, I knew that Cam was the only guy who had ever seen me. And even more important, he saw beyond what I could see. I was more to Cam.</p><p>I wanted to grab his hand, lead him down the hall to my room, strip myself bare before him, and let him take everything I could give him.</p><p>And take everything he could give me.</p><p>Instead of doing what I really wanted to do, I gave him a platonic but grateful smile. \u2018Let\u2019s have that coffee.\u2019</p><p>14</p><p>The following Saturday everything I was avoiding feeling, everything that wasn\u2019t being admitted out loud, came to a head.</p><p>The week before, Malcolm had invited me to a party that Becca\u2019s flatmate was hosting. The party was to be held in their place in Bruntsfield and Malcolm had said he\u2019d put in an appearance. However, he didn\u2019t want to feel like a fish out of water, so he\u2019d practically begged me to accompany him. I wasn\u2019t really looking forward to seeing Cam and Becca in action together, but since I\u2019d been unfaithful to Malcolm in my head, I thought it was the least I could do for him.</p><p>The morning of that Saturday I was up early because Mum had woken us up smashing empty bottles of gin in the kitchen sink. I\u2019d got to her before she did too much damage, wrapped a few plasters around little cuts on her hands, held her while she curled into me and bawled like a baby, and finally accepted Cole\u2019s help getting her back into bed. The muscles in her legs were wasting away \u2013 it was a wonder she could even walk. Cole and I had given up trying to get her out and about, and seeing the damage I began to feel guilty.</p><p>Trying to shake off the grim sadness that always overwhelmed me when Mum found a way to let us know she was just as angry at her addiction as we were, I thought I\u2019d spend a rare Saturday morning reading while Cole hurried down to Cam\u2019s flat. Since I was still trying to weigh whether we could afford the expense of Cole taking up a martial art, Cam had started training lessons with him on Saturday mornings. Cole loved every minute of it, and honestly, I think Cam was enjoying teaching what he\u2019d learned.</p><p>I was immersed in the translation of a romance novel by one of my favourite Japanese writers when the doorbell rang.</p><p>It was Jamie, Cole\u2019s friend.</p><p>As soon as I opened the door, the short, slightly chubby kid turned beetroot. I bit my lip, trying not to smile. \u2018Hi, Jamie.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hi, Jo.\u2019 He gulped, his eyes looking anywhere but at my face. \u2018Is Cole in? He was supposed to meet me outside fifteen minutes ago.\u2019</p><p>Clearly Cole had lost track of the time. I stifled my aggravated sigh and stepped out of the flat, shutting the door gently behind me \u2013 I had been at a really good part in my book. \u2018Let me take you to him.\u2019</p><p>After I knocked on Cam\u2019s door, he yelled for me to come in. I left Jamie waiting outside and entered the flat to find Cam and Cole standing in the centre of the living room beside a mat. All of the furniture had been pushed to the edges of the room. Cole was grinning, perspiration running down his neck, damp patches all over his T-shirt. Cam was wearing a T-shirt and joggers, not looking that much the worse for wear.</p><p>I raised my eyebrows at Cole. \u2018Did you forget about something?\u2019</p><p>He frowned instantly. \u2018No.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tell that to the kid on Cam\u2019s doorstep.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, sh\u2013\u2019 He stopped himself. \u2018I forgot Jamie.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s waiting.\u2019</p><p>Cole hurried to grab his socks and trainers. \u2018Cheers for the lesson, Cam.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No probs, bud.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You better wash and change your clothes before you go out!\u2019 I called after him as he disappeared into the hall. \u2018And text me to let me know what you\u2019re doing \u2013\u2019 I slammed my mouth closed at the sound of Cam\u2019s front door shutting. I turned back to Cam. \u2018Why do I bother?\u2019</p><p>He threw me a crooked smile \u2013 my fourth favourite after the lip twitch \u2013 and curled a finger, beckoning me to him. \u2018Care to take up where he left off?\u2019</p><p>I immediately took a step back, shaking my head. \u2018I don\u2019t think so.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Come on.\u2019 He suddenly grew serious. \u2018I\u2019ve seen the way some of the customers are with you, and Joss told me she\u2019s had to rescue you more than once in the past from an over eager punter. This will help you learn to deal with the way you freeze up.\u2019</p><p>I imagined it might be pretty nice to be able to handle aggressive assholes by myself rather than relying on protective friends. But training with Cam? No. That would be fanning the flame.</p><p>\u2018No, thanks.\u2019</p><p>Cam sighed but gave in. \u2018Fine. You want a cup of tea?\u2019</p><p>I nodded and followed him into his kitchen, trying to keep my eyes on anything but his muscled shoulders and tight ass. I didn\u2019t try very hard.</p><p>Standing by his kitchen counter, I was lost in thought about the evening ahead of us as Cam made the tea and coffee, when I caught movement out of the corner of my eye. I glanced towards it and nearly had full-on heart failure at the size of the spider clinging to Cam\u2019s kitchen tiles.</p><p>\u2018Oh, my God!\u2019 I squealed, skittering back away from it, a lump of fear in my throat the size of Canada.</p><p>\u2018What \u2013 what?\u2019 Cam spun around, his eyes wide on me.</p><p>I stared round-eyed at the spider. \u2018Get rid of it or I won\u2019t be able to move.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t kidding. I was literally frozen with fear. I don\u2019t know where my phobia of spiders originated, but it was bad enough that we had to invest in spider repellents that plugged into the sockets in our flat. We got the rare few spiders nevertheless and Cole always took care of them.</p><p>Cam looked from me to the spider and then back to me again. I could see the beginning of a smile start to curl the corners of his mouth.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t even think about laughing. It\u2019s not funny.\u2019</p><p>His gaze softened as he seemed to finally realize the extent of my fear. \u2018Okay. Stop panicking. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u2019 He reached into a cupboard and pulled out a pan.</p><p>I scowled. \u2018What are you doing? Don\u2019t kill it!\u2019</p><p>Cam froze, cocking his head in bemusement as he gazed at me. \u2018Why don\u2019t you want me to kill it? I thought you were frightened of it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I am terrified of it,\u2019 I corrected him. \u2018But what does it say about humans as a species if we go around killing things just because we fear them?\u2019 Not anything good, that\u2019s what.</p><p>Cam\u2019s gorgeous eyes warmed even more and I found myself forgetting the fear and falling into his gaze.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I whispered, feeling my chest swell at the way he was looking at me. No one had ever looked at me like that before.</p><p>He shook his head. \u2018Nothing. You just ... Nothing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cam?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mmm-hmm?\u2019</p><p>\u2018The spider.\u2019</p><p>He blinked a little rapidly before pinning the spider with his gaze. \u2018Right.\u2019 He lifted the lid of the pan. \u2018I\u2019m not killing it. I just needed something to put it in.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As he rescued the spider from me and me from the spider, I crammed myself into the corner of the kitchen, scared that Cam wouldn\u2019t move quickly enough and the spider would somehow launch itself across the room at me. I had no reason to fear. Cam had the spider in the pan in record time and I watched with growing relief as he took it to the kitchen window and deposited it outside.</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 I breathed.</p><p>Cam didn\u2019t reply. Instead he shut the window carefully, put the pan by the sink, and turned around to gaze at me.</p><p>Suddenly the air felt electric between us, like it always did while we worked side by side at the bar. I\u2019d done my darndest to make sure those moments were confined to the bar, trying to feign ordinary interaction outside in the real world.</p> <p>Today there would be no feigning.</p><p>I held my breath at the intensity in Cam\u2019s eyes as he slowly began to make his way towards me. When he closed the distance that would be considered socially acceptable between two friends who both had partners, I was just about to question him, stall him, but then my breasts brushed his chest and the words got sucked right back into my mouth along with all the air in the room. I felt his hands in a gentle embrace around my upper arms, his aftershave familiar and intoxicating, and the heat of his body made mine languid.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been able to meet his eyes, and so I was looking at his throat when he leaned in and pressed the sweetest kiss to my forehead. A yearning, deep and expanding, burst open in my chest and I melted into him, feeling his lips chase a delicious shiver across my skin. He replaced his mouth with his own forehead. I closed my eyes as he closed his and we rested against one another, breathing each other in.</p><p>I was filled with such longing, a longing only intensified because I knew it was reciprocated.</p><p>\u2018Cam,\u2019 I whispered, wanting him to pull away and needing him to never leave.</p> <p>He groaned and gently slid his forehead down the side of mine, his nose skimming my cheek, following my jaw, and coming to rest in a nuzzle against my throat.</p><p>I held my breath, waiting.</p><p>His hot lips touched the skin there. One brush. Two.</p><p>And then I felt the wet, erotic touch of tongue and I shuddered, falling against him. My nipples pebbled against my thin shirt, begging him to go further.</p><p>A sharp, piercing ringtone shattered the air between us and I jerked back, coming to my senses. Cam cursed, his jaw clenched so tight it was close to shattering. He reached for his phone on the counter beside us and then blanched as he read the caller ID. He shot me an unfathomable look. \u2018Becca,\u2019 he stated grimly.</p><p>I gulped, not believing that I\u2019d let him touch me, that we\u2019d been seconds from hurting two people who didn\u2019t deserve to be hurt. More than that, I was shocked at how much I hadn\u2019t even cared \u2013 my need for Cam was that selfish.</p> <p>This was not good.</p><p>If it was anybody else, I would have suggested it was time to put some distance between us. But this was Cam. I needed Cam.</p><p>\u2018I better go. Malcolm is picking me up in a few hours.\u2019 I straightened my shirt and tightened the band holding my ponytail in place. I couldn\u2019t meet his gaze.</p><p>\u2018So we\u2019re back to pretending there\u2019s nothing between us?\u2019</p><p>My spine stiffened at his curtness and I looked up, only to flinch at the anger I saw in his eyes.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t lose Cam\u2019s friendship. It was the best thing that had happened to me since Cole. \u2018Cam, please don\u2019t. I\u2019m with Malcolm and you\u2019re with Becca.\u2019</p><p>His mouth opened to respond, but I fled his presence before I was forced to hear what he had to say.</p> <p>All day I felt I might be sick at any moment. I could barely do anything, really only taking time to reply to Cole when he texted me that he was staying at Jamie\u2019s house that night. I dressed uncharacteristically casually for the party, pulling on a skintight black miniskirt and a print tee from Topshop. I paired them with knee-high boots with a fleecy lining so my legs wouldn\u2019t freeze and a dark faux fur jacket I\u2019d got at a sale and usually wore with something dressier.</p><p>Tonight I wasn\u2019t in the mood to sparkle. I wanted comfort, youth \u2013 I wanted to be me in some tiny way. I shook the entire time I was dressing, wondering what Cam was doing, wondering if he was ever going to speak to me again. I could still feel his hot mouth against my throat, burned there along with the tingling sensation of his tongue. Why did he want us to face our attraction when we were both with other people? Did he want to leave Becca? Did he want me to leave Malcolm?</p><p>And the biggest question of all was, could I?</p><p>Could I walk away from a man who cared about me, who could provide me with security and safety? Could I risk it for Cam? If I did, what would happen if it just turned out to be physical between us? No emotion, just spark.</p><p>My head pounded from overload.</p><p>Malcolm waited outside my building, beside our cab, and I almost came to a standstill at the look on his face as he eyed my outfit. When he was done with the once-over, he gave me a small smile before pressing a quick kiss to my lips.</p><p>\u2018What is it?\u2019 I asked, frowning, sensing that something was off and not liking it. My stomach was already in upheaval over facing Cam again; I didn\u2019t need to worry about Malcolm too.</p><p>Malcolm ushered me into the cab and as we pulled away, he perused my legs before looking back up at my face. \u2018You look very young tonight.\u2019</p><p>I glanced down at my outfit and pursed my lips. I looked my age tonight. I looked like me. \u2018You don\u2019t like it,\u2019 I muttered.</p><p>He gave a huff of laughter. \u2018Sweetheart, you look sexy as hell, but you look like a young wild child dating a grumpy older man.\u2019</p><p>Something in his voice drew my gaze and I caught the flicker of unease in his eyes. He seemed worried. Cam\u2019s face hovering so close to mine flashed across my eyes and the guilt was crushing. \u2018You\u2019re not a grumpy older man. You\u2019re my sexy older man.\u2019</p><p>His shoulders relaxed. \u2018As long as you think so.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I won\u2019t wear this again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good,\u2019 he murmured, leaning down to kiss my cheek. \u2018I prefer you in the dresses we bought. They make you look older, sophisticated.\u2019</p><p>I would never have let a comment like that bother me before, but tonight it rubbed me a little raw. I faked a smile and let him squeeze my hand, wishing like hell I was back in my flat alone with a good book.</p><p>When we pulled up to Becca\u2019s building my stomach almost revolted and I sucked in a gasp to hold back the queasiness. Malcolm turned sharply to me, his brows drawn together. \u2018Are you okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You know, I\u2019ve been feeling off,\u2019 I lied. \u2018I think I\u2019m fighting a bug or something.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do you want to leave?\u2019</p><p>YES, YES, YES!</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I nodded at the bottle of wine in his hand. \u2018Let\u2019s at least go up and have a drink.\u2019</p><p>The party was in full bloom when we arrived. The huge flat had the rough needs-a-good-repaint-scrub-and-tidy-up look that many of the old student flats in Edinburgh had. Becca didn\u2019t seem to mind the clutter, or the ripped carpets, chipped woodwork and yellowing walls, and neither did her guests. Her artwork was plastered across as much of the wall space as possible, and the guests didn\u2019t seem to mind that either.</p><p>I admit to having to blink a little against all the stripes and splashes and colours. They reminded me of those nonsensical images you\u2019re supposed to stare at until a real image appeared in them.</p><p>\u2018Mal, Jo!\u2019 Becca called as we entered the large open living space. She rushed past her friends and threw herself into Malcolm\u2019s arms. When she pulled back she clapped her hands like a little girl. \u2018You brought the good wine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I did.\u2019 Malcolm grinned at her as he handed it over to her.</p><p>I eyed Becca carefully, analysing her like I had never done before. There she stood before me, with her wide, pretty smile, her intelligent eyes full of sparkle. What was it about her that made someone like Cam take notice? Suddenly I was uncomfortably aware of all Becca\u2019s positive attributes and I hated the jealousy they elicited in me.</p><p>Becca\u2019s own eyes flickered over my outfit and she smiled brightly. \u2018Jo, you look great.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 I replied softly, feeling guilty as sin for almost ... well ... whatever it was Cam and I had almost done.</p><p>\u2018Cam!\u2019 She twisted around and gestured through the crowd. \u2018Come say hello.\u2019</p><p>I felt the pulse in my neck start to throb as Cam approached. I must not have masked my reaction sufficiently, because Malcolm slid a hand around my waist, curling me into him. He bent to whisper in my ear, \u2018What\u2019s going on? You look tense.\u2019</p><p>Oh, crap. Oh, hell. I was blowing this. I sucked in a deep breath and then turned to him, deciding it best to play it like I was worried I\u2019d upset him. \u2018I shouldn\u2019t have worn this.\u2019</p><p>Malcolm grimaced and touched my cheek affectionately. \u2018Don\u2019t worry. I would never have said anything if I thought it would make you uncomfortable. You look beautiful. You always do.\u2019</p><p>As I gazed up into his kind eyes I felt even worse about myself. I decided to make him happy as recompense, even at the sacrifice of my own self-respect. \u2018I don\u2019t like disappointing you.\u2019</p><p>His eyes warmed at that \u2013 in fact it was safe to say they heated and I felt myself drawn tighter against him. \u2018You haven\u2019t. But I will look forward to undressing you later.\u2019</p><p>More than ever I felt choked by my own lies. I\u2019d created this person I thought Malcolm wanted me to be \u2013 I was who he wanted me to be. In other words, I wasn\u2019t me. And even as unhappiness crashed over me at the thought, I faked a giggle and he grinned.</p><p>\u2018Uh, hullo.\u2019 Becca chuckled and we both whipped our heads around to face her and Cam. \u2018Need a room much?\u2019</p><p>Cam\u2019s eyes bored into me with barely leashed fury, his features stretched taut with his discomfort. I felt that look like a punch in the gut and found myself wanting to pull away from Malcolm and fall to my knees in apology before Cam.</p><p>Or run like hell from both of them.</p><p>In other words, I was a bloody mess. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To my relief, Cam was distracted by Becca as she urged him to help her greet more guests. I was left alone with Malcolm, left alone to try to assure him that I was all right. That we were all right. I laughed at his jokes, I touched him affectionately, and I gave him my whole focus, even when we found ourselves in a group talking with Cam and Becca. Even when I felt the heat of Cam\u2019s gaze on me, I devoted my attention to Malcolm.</p><p>An hour later I felt exhausted by the effort and excused myself to use the bathroom in the hallway near the front entrance. I had just slipped inside and was shutting the door behind me when it was forced open again. I stumbled back, astonished, as Cam quickly stepped inside and slammed the door behind him. He locked it and then faced me.</p><p>I wished I\u2019d worn heels. In my flat boots I was only five ten and Cam had two inches on me. It wasn\u2019t much, but he was built of solid muscle and when he was powered by seething anger, he might as well have had a whole foot on me.</p><p>Trembling, I gestured to the door with a jerky hand. \u2018What are you doing? Someone could have seen you.\u2019</p> <p>His blue eyes snapped cold fire at me. \u2018Malcolm, you mean.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Or Becca,\u2019 I reminded him through clenched teeth. \u2018Remember her? Your girlfriend?\u2019</p><p>Cam ignored me and I shivered as his gaze drifted slowly down my body, then climbed back up. I tingled all over. His lips quirked up at the corner as our eyes met. \u2018You look gorgeous tonight. I\u2019ve never seen you like this.\u2019</p><p>As we continued to stare at each other in silence I felt my heart race and my breathing speed up. I had to get out of there before I did something unbelievably stupid. Hoping I looked suitably determined and pissed off, I closed the distance between us. \u2018Let me out of here, Cameron.\u2019</p><p>He held his hands up in surrender and stepped aside, but as soon as I reached for the lock I found my back flattened against the door, Cam\u2019s body pressed against mine, and his hands braced on either side of my head, imprisoning me.</p> <p>\u2018Wha\u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hush.\u2019 His breath whispered against my lips and he lowered his hands until they circled my waist. \u2018You feel this too. You\u2019ve felt it since the night we met.\u2019</p><p>I couldn\u2019t find my voice, lost in a mixture of exultation that I hadn\u2019t been alone in this from the beginning and anxiety that we were doing something wrong and we\u2019d be caught. I licked my lips nervously.</p><p>He took it as an invitation.</p><p>My gasp was swallowed by his kiss, his mouth hot as his tongue slid against mine. Stubble scratched my skin as he deepened the kiss, and his right hand glided up my side, over my ribs, until it came to a rest at my breast. His thumb brushed the underside deliberately. My skin immediately caught fire and I reached for him, my arms curling around his neck, drawing him closer. I moaned into his mouth, my heart hammering as my senses went on overload. I could taste coffee on his tongue, smell the scent of his skin, feel his heat, his strength. I was surrounded. And I wanted more.</p><p>I forgot where we were.</p> <p>Who we were.</p><p>All I cared about was climbing inside of Cam.</p><p>Our grip on each other was almost painful, our kiss hard, wet, desperate.</p><p>Right.</p><p>Cam groaned, the vibration reverberating in my chest and soaring downward between my legs, and I writhed against him. He got the message, pressing his body deeper against mine, his erection digging into my lower stomach as his legs spread mine farther apart. I whimpered with a want that was out of control and Cam pulled back to stare at my swollen lips. I\u2019d never seen a man so lost in a sexual fog and my sex clenched at the knowledge of the power I had over him, my knickers damp as my body grew ready for him.</p><p>Cam nipped at my bottom lip, and then licked the same spot. \u2018I\u2019ve fantasized a million times about this mouth,\u2019 he told me hoarsely before crushing my lips against his again.</p><p>The embrace was even more out of control than the last one, and when I felt his warm fingers against the inside of my thigh, I deepened the kiss, urging him onward to explore. When I felt his fingers go beneath my underwear, I almost exploded.</p><p>His fingers slipped torturously slowly inside me and I cried out against his mouth, my hips jerking against his hand.</p> <p>Cam dragged his mouth from mine, panting against my neck. \u2018If we don\u2019t stop, I\u2019m going to fuck you right here.\u2019</p><p>Those words were like a cold shower and I pitched back under the icy blast \u2013 guilt and shame I\u2019d never felt before spraying down on me as Cam lifted his head to look at me.</p><p>Slowly, as he took in my expression, the sexual haze dissipated from his eyes and I felt the loss of his fingers. \u2018Jo ...\u2019</p><p>I shook my head at him and pushed against his shoulders, trying to fight back the tears. \u2018We can\u2019t do this. What are we doing?\u2019</p><p>The muscle in Cam\u2019s jaw twitched and he abruptly released me, only to grab me by the upper arms, his expression raw with some unnamed emotion. \u2018I\u2019m ending it with Becca. Tonight.\u2019</p><p>Tonight? Now? The blood rushed in my ears as panic set in and I realized what he really meant ...</p><p>\u2018I know. It\u2019s shit, I know. But I can\u2019t go on like this. I\u2019m not the guy who cheats on his girlfriend. And I can\u2019t continue to be the guy who fucks his girlfriend wishing all the time she was someone else.\u2019</p><p>Elation and fear washed over me in equal measure. \u2018Cam, I ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018You want this. I know you do.\u2019 He pressed his forehead against mine and I closed my eyes, breathing him in. \u2018Will you leave Malcolm?\u2019</p><p>My muscles locked and I knew Cam felt it, because his grip on my arms tightened.</p><p>\u2018Johanna?\u2019</p><p>The truth was, I didn\u2019t know the answer to that question. Walking away from Malcolm wasn\u2019t just about me. It was about me and Cole and our future.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re telling me you\u2019re going to stay with that guy?\u2019 Cam asked harshly, shaking me a little. \u2018You\u2019re going to go through the rest of your life standing at his side at parties, laughing that stupid bloody fake giggle, with your eyes contradicting your mouth every time it opens.\u2019 He pulled back and I almost flinched at the distaste in his eyes. \u2018That girl you were out there is not Jo. I don\u2019t know who that is, but she\u2019s an arse who pisses me off. She\u2019s fake, she\u2019s simpering, and she\u2019s a fucking bimbo. She\u2019s not you.\u2019</p><p>We were silent, our breathing uneven and loud as we worked to calm the tension between us. Hurt by his words, and yet in agreement with them, I found my mind whirling as I tried to weigh my options, the consequences, what was right and what was wrong.</p><p>I took too long to answer.</p><p>Cam let go of me and I shivered, feeling instantly cold. I wanted to die at the look he gave me.</p><p>Without another word, he reached past me to unlock the door and I found myself unceremoniously moved aside as he wrenched it open and disappeared into the party.</p><p>Tears clogged my throat, but I refused to let them travel to my eyes, my hands clenching at my sides. I could handle this without the waterworks. I knew I could.</p><p>Moving on shaking legs, I slumped against the sink to stare at my reflection and then gasped in horror. My cheeks were flushed, my eyes bright, and my skirt was still rucked up a little from where Cam had slipped his hand between my legs. I gasped again, remembering his fingers in me, and I gripped the sink so tight that my knuckles turned white. My nipples were peaked against my shirt and the colour was still high on my cheeks.</p><p>I had to get myself under control or everyone would know what I\u2019d been up to.</p><p>I gave myself ten minutes and as I returned to Malcolm\u2019s side, I saw Cam out of the corner of my eye shoving his way through the crowds of people towards the exit. The front door slammed loudly not too long after.</p><p>\u2018You okay?\u2019 Malcolm\u2019s voice pulled my head around.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s a bastard!\u2019 Becca could suddenly be heard over the hum of music and voices. Malcolm and I twisted around to find her. She was in the corner, being comforted by her friends.</p><p>\u2018Do you think he dumped her?\u2019 Malcolm asked in my ear. \u2018While you were in the bathroom they were arguing.\u2019</p><p>Ashamed that I knew the answer all too well, I couldn\u2019t look at him. \u2018Looks like it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You okay?\u2019 he repeated.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not feeling this party.\u2019 I shrugged.</p><p>\u2018Yeah, and it looks like Becca is about to kick off.\u2019 Malcolm sighed. \u2018Would it be awful if we snuck out?\u2019</p><p>I threw him a weak smile. \u2018It would be great.\u2019</p><p>He held my jacket and I shrugged into it. Two seconds later I let him pull me out of the flat. Without a word we walked down Leamington Terrace to the main road on Bruntsfield Place and waited for a taxi to approach with its light on. When we had no luck, Malcolm took out his phone. \u2018I\u2019ll just call us one. We\u2019ll go back to my place for a while, yeah?\u2019</p><p>I thought about heading back to his place with him, of him leading me up to his room like he always did, undressing me slowly and pushing me back on the bed ...</p><p>It left me cold.</p><p>It made me feel sick with guilt.</p><p>Like I was cheating ...</p><p>Malcolm had just put the phone to his ear when I found myself blurting out, \u2018Stop.\u2019</p><p>Taken aback, Malcolm immediately lowered his phone and switched it off. His eyes washed over my face and whatever he saw there made his lips pinch tight together. He took a moment and then he asked, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019</p><p>My practicality had taken a run and jumped off the nearest cliff. My emotions were fully in charge as I replied, \u2018I can\u2019t go back to your place.\u2019</p><p>And then he surprised the hell out of me. \u2018Because of Cam.\u2019</p><p>After working so hard to control them earlier, I felt those blasted tears hit my eyes. \u2018I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019</p><p>Malcolm heaved a sigh and I saw pain flicker in his gaze as it searched my face. \u2018I really care about you, Jo.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I care about you, too.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I see the way he looks at you. The way you look at him. I knew there was something ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>He shook his head, holding a hand up to stop me. \u2018Don\u2019t.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I feel awful.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can see that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I never slept with him.\u2019</p> <p>His jaw clenched and then relaxed enough for him to reply, \u2018I know. You\u2019re not that kind of girl.\u2019</p><p>Fingers quaking, I pushed up the sleeve on my jacket and unfastened the Omega watch he\u2019d given me for Christmas. When he made no move to take it, I lifted his hand and placed the gift in the palm of it, curling his fingers around it. \u2018Thank you for everything, Malcolm.\u2019</p><p>When he looked up from the watch, a piercing ache emanated from my chest at the dejection I saw in his face. \u2018He\u2019s just a kid who doesn\u2019t know what the hell kind of gift he\u2019s getting in you, and when he\u2019s done, when he makes the mistake of throwing you away, I hope you\u2019ll come back to me.\u2019 He stepped towards me and I froze as he dipped his head to press a sweet kiss against my cold lips. \u2018We could be really happy.\u2019</p><p>I didn\u2019t take a breath until he put some distance between us. He threw up a hand and I turned to see he was flagging down a taxi. It did a U-turn and pulled up at the kerb. Malcolm opened the door for me. \u2018I\u2019ll be here when he\u2019s done with you.\u2019</p><p>I left him standing on the street, as the taxi took me back to London Road.</p> <p>I\u2019d broken up with Malcolm.</p><p>Oh, my God.</p><p>I felt heavyhearted. I felt remorseful. I was worried I wasn\u2019t doing the right thing. However, overriding all of that was this desperation to find Cam, to tell him I did feel what he felt. For the first time in as long as I could remember I was going after what I really wanted. Perhaps tomorrow I would lament the decision, but tonight I just wanted a taste of something really good and pure for once.</p><p>I almost threw the fare at the taxi driver, then rushed into the building, my boots slapping carelessly against the concrete as I hurried up the stairs. I was just rounding the stairwell to Cam\u2019s landing when I heard a door open. As I reached the top of the stairs, he came into view, standing barefoot in his doorway, waiting for me.</p><p>Overwhelmed that just the sight of him made my chest so full of emotion that it hurt, I stumbled a little towards him, my boots just clipping the doorstep.</p><p>Cam didn\u2019t say anything. Every inch of him was solid with tension as he looked at me.</p> <p>\u2018Cam \u2013\u2019</p><p>My words were swallowed by motion as his hand clamped around my wrist, wrenching me hard against his body, his mouth slamming down on mine. I instantly wrapped myself around him, and my fingers curled in the hair at the back of his neck as I licked and sucked and flicked my tongue against his, our kiss so deep I didn\u2019t even realize I was inside his flat until the door crashed shut behind us.</p><p>Cam broke the kiss to pull back, his hands shoving my jacket off my shoulders. I let it drop to the floor, exhilarated in feeling \u2013 my breasts were swollen, my skin burned, and I was surprised once more to realize I was already wet for him from just a kiss and anticipation. \u2018Cam ...\u2019 I whispered urgently, needing some part of me touching him at all times. I slid my hand up under the bottom of his tee, feeling silken, hard, hot skin against my palm. \u2018I broke up with him.\u2019</p><p>He nodded, his hands on my waist as he yanked me to him, my breasts brushing his chest deliciously. I shivered and Cam smiled, fully aware of the power he had over me. In reaction to his cockiness, my hand glided back down his six-pack and out from under his shirt and didn\u2019t stop its descent. He sucked in his breath as I rubbed him through his jeans, watching the colour on his cheekbones rise. \u2018I got that, baby,\u2019 he said with a groan. \u2018You wouldn\u2019t be here otherwise.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are we really doing this?\u2019 I whispered against his mouth.</p><p>His hands squeezed my waist, and I looked up into his eyes. They were almost navy with scorching heat. \u2018We\u2019re really doing this. No backing out.\u2019 His lips skimmed my jaw until his mouth stopped at my ear. \u2018I\u2019m going to fuck you so hard, sink so deep inside of you, you\u2019ll never work me out from under your skin. Never.\u2019</p><p>Tingles exploded all over my body at his words.</p><p>I reached for his mouth. I loved the taste of him, the feel, the way he kissed, like I hoped he screwed. I sucked his tongue hard and he shuddered, his growl urging me on, until it descended into the wettest, dirtiest kiss I\u2019d ever experienced.</p> <p>My back slammed up against the wall as he crashed us into it. \u2018I can\u2019t wait,\u2019 he told me breathlessly.</p><p>I shook my head, my chest heaving against his, telling him silently I couldn\u2019t wait either.</p><p>I felt his warm, rough hands on my outer thighs as they brushed my skin, pushing my skirt up to my waist. With an almost animalistic grunt, Cam curled his hands around the fabric of my knickers and tugged, the sound of it tearing away from my body and the sudden air between my legs increasing the heat between us to a combustible level. He\u2019d just ripped my underwear off! Holy hell!</p><p>That was seriously hot.</p><p>I thought I would feel exposed, uncomfortable, standing there with my skirt at my waist, the most private part of me on display for him. I felt neither.</p><p>All I felt was urgency.</p><p>Our lips collided, biting, nipping, licking, as we both reached for the closure on his jeans. He shoved them and his boxers down to his ankles, freeing his cock, and I watched as he took his wallet out of his back pocket and pulled a condom out of it. As he rolled it up his straining dick, I gasped. It was big, but I had had big before. That wasn\u2019t what the gasp was for. The gasp was for the girth.</p><p>\u2018Oh, my,\u2019 I breathed, feeling the trickle between my legs incite my already excited state.</p><p>\u2018Why, thank you.\u2019 Cam flashed me a cocky grin that made me laugh \u2013 laughter that ended with a gasp as he gripped my legs, spread them, and thrust up into me.</p><p>\u2018Cam!\u2019 I cried out in pleasured shock, his throbbing heat overwhelming me. Every feeling, thought, all my focus was on the sensation of his thickness inside me, and I struggled for breath as my body tried to adjust and relax. It was as if every nerve in my body was inflamed, and a minuscule shift between us sparked a tug of delicious tension I immediately sought more of.</p><p>Cam, however, held still against me, breathing heavily as though he was attempting to gain a little control. My body wasn\u2019t for it. I wanted more and I wanted more now. I pushed my hips against him and his grip on my thighs became almost bruising. \u2018Wait,\u2019 he said hoarsely. \u2018Give me a minute. I\u2019ve wanted this for ages and you feel bloody amazing. Just give me a minute.\u2019 As I heard this erotic confession, my inner muscles clamped around his cock and he inhaled sharply. His head drew back in surprise as his eyes collided with mine. \u2018Baby, do that again and I\u2019m not going to last.\u2019</p><p>I shook my head, my fingers digging into the muscles of his back. \u2018I don\u2019t care. Just move, please just move. I need you.\u2019</p><p>His control snapped.</p><p>As he hauled my legs up, my body took his lead and I wrapped my legs around him. Holding tight to him, I panted with excitement as he pounded us into the wall, thrusting into me hard, gliding in and out of my snug channel, the wet slap of flesh against flesh spurring us towards climax.</p><p>I felt his thumb press down on my clit and I blew apart, my cry of release triggering Cam\u2019s. He threw his head back, his eyes on me, his muscles strained as he let out a guttural grunt, my sex pulsing around him as he shuddered inside me in climax.</p><p>He fell against me, his lips on my shoulder, his chest against mine, my arms still locked around him. He turned his head and kissed my neck. \u2018Do you know how many times I\u2019ve imagined these long, gorgeous legs wrapped around me as I fucked you?\u2019</p><p>I shook my head, still not recovered enough to speak.</p><p>\u2018Every day. And none of the fantasies were as good as the real thing.\u2019</p><p>I smiled softly at that as he raised his head to kiss me. He made to pull back, but I chased his mouth, my hands sliding up his back to his nape, holding him to me as I kissed him with an ardour that hopefully clued him in to the fact that I wasn\u2019t nearly done. I leaned back and raised my eyes to his beautiful ones. Someone naughty and a little bit wicked had crept inside me. I wanted him again. And I wanted him just as raw and hard as I\u2019d just had him. \u2018Do you know how many times over the last few weeks I lay in my bed and touched myself thinking about you?\u2019</p><p>His breath sputtered and I felt his dick twitch inside me. \u2018Jesus,\u2019 he breathed, his eyes dilating. \u2018Keep talking and you\u2019re not going be able to walk tomorrow.\u2019</p><p>I grinned up at him, squeezing my inner muscles around him again. \u2018That\u2019s the plan.\u2019</p><p>15</p><p>Cam pressed a soft kiss to my mouth before he leaned back and pulled out of me. The fever hadn\u2019t quite left me, but I did feel the heated fog drift to the edges of my brain, allowing reality to settle in.</p><p>I\u2019d dumped Malcolm tonight.</p><p>And then I\u2019d had sex with Cam against his hallway wall.</p><p>Amazing sex.</p><p>Mind-blowing sex.</p><p>\u2018Going to be a difficult act to follow\u2019 sex.</p><p>Cam-and-I-were-together-now sex.</p><p>The churning worry in my gut was overwhelmed for a moment by giddy butterflies. Weeks of daydreaming about him \u2013 and now it was no longer a fantasy. We were doing this.</p><p>All of a sudden I felt weirdly shy.</p><p>\u2018Keep thinking those thoughts, whatever they are.\u2019 Cam grinned, reaching out to smooth my skirt down for me. His eyes remained trained on mine as he took off the used condom and pulled his jeans up. \u2018Stay right there.\u2019</p><p>Before I could reply, he wandered off down the hall, disappearing into the bathroom. I heard the flush and then he was sauntering back towards me with his jeans still unzipped, his eyes hot on me. \u2018Is Cole staying at Jamie\u2019s tonight?\u2019</p><p>I nodded, my heart banging away in my chest.</p><p>When Cam drew to a stop before me, he held out his hand to me. \u2018Good. You can stay the night, then.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019d never been turned on by a guy with tattoos, but as I drank in the sight of his arm, my eyes following the curling script of his BE CALEDONIA tattoo, I felt a rush of possessiveness over his ink \u2013 that one in particular. Somehow, it was mine too, and I wanted to follow every detail of it with my tongue, laying claim to it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A flare of emotion blazed through my chest as he squeezed my hand, then led me to the back of the flat, to the master bedroom. I looked around as he walked us inside. I hadn\u2019t been in his room before. I was entering his private domain.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much to see.</p><p>A king-sized bed with a pale blue duvet set, mostly bare walls except for a large framed print of two Stormtroopers getting into a DeLorean, a chest of drawers, a wardrobe, and a couple of bookshelves filled with books and DVDs. It was clean and tidy, just like the rest of his flat, I mused, trying to ignore my racing heartbeat. We\u2019d just had sex, so the thought of having more sex shouldn\u2019t have sent my pulse skyrocketing. But it did.</p> <p>Cam let go of my hand as he reached the bed and he turned to face me. In one smooth movement, he pulled his T-shirt over his head and threw it on the floor.</p><p>I swear I started to drool at the sight of him half-naked.</p><p>Yes, I had been right when I fantasized about this moment. Cam was pure, lean, solid muscle. I followed the lines of his six-pack to the sexy cut of his hips, my cheeks blazing.</p><p>I had been waiting for him to drop his jeans and let me ogle the rest of him, but instead, he sat down on the edge of the bed and looked up at me. \u2018So ... what would you like to do with me?\u2019</p><p>Um, that seemed like a silly question, no? Was my panting and drooling not an indication of what I\u2019d like to do with him? \u2018What?\u2019</p> <p>He shrugged casually, as though we were sitting down to tea and not getting ready to repeat the hall sex but this time on a bed. \u2018If we\u2019re doing this, you\u2019re going to be straight with me. In every way \u2013 including in bed. I\u2019m not some guy you\u2019re trying to hold on to for dear life \u2013 accommodating him and forgetting about yourself and what you want. We\u2019re in this together and I just took what I wanted. Now you take what you want. So what do you want?\u2019</p><p>My first thought was to jump on him and ravish him. Everything he\u2019d said was perfect and it took me a moment to remember that this was real. Had I finally found someone who actually gave a shit? Like ... really gave a shit?</p><p>I tried to stop myself from getting carried away on a floating cloud with one oar called hope and the other called dreams, but it was difficult when he was being so bloody wonderful.</p><p>So, okay, I wasn\u2019t some naive girl. I certainly knew Cam wasn\u2019t a perfect man \u2013 he\u2019d proved that when we first met \u2013 but I was beginning to wonder if he might possibly be just a little bit perfect for me. Finally, I\u2019d found a guy who wanted to be with me \u2013 the real me. And not only that \u2013 he was actually encouraging me to be a bit self-indulgent.</p><p>What he\u2019d asked caused me, to my bemusement, some embarrassment. I wasn\u2019t a prude. I\u2019d had plenty of sex with a few different men. However, none of them had ever asked me to talk about sex with them. No questions, no likes, no dislikes. Now Cam wanted me to communicate with him about sex, and I found myself grinning to cover my timidity. \u2018You don\u2019t seem like the kind of guy who lets a girl take the lead much.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not the kind of guy who lets the girl take the lead much. I\u2019m not the kind of guy who talks this much either. But I need to make sure your head is in the right place. It\u2019s too important. So as much as I want to strip you naked and bend you over my desk, tonight I\u2019m leaving it up to you.\u2019 His eyes darkened. \u2018The desk can wait.\u2019</p> <p>I was unbelievably turned on by the thought of Cam taking me against his desk. Sounded orgasmic to me. I licked my lips, eyeing him as he waited patiently for me to decide what we\u2019d be doing next.</p><p>As I drank in his half-nakedness, I tingled all over with anticipation.</p><p>He was right. The desk could wait.</p><p>\u2018Strip,\u2019 I ordered quietly.</p><p>Cam stood up, his eyes never leaving mine as he pushed his jeans and boxers down his legs, his hard-on saluting me as he kicked himself free of his clothes. He stood before me completely unabashed by his nakedness, and I took a moment to sear the sight of him like this into my memory.</p><p>With shaking fingers I pulled off my own T-shirt, and pulled off my boots. My skirt followed them and lastly I unsnapped my bra, dropping it on to the pile of clothes at my feet.</p><p>I shivered as Cam slowly took me in, his dick throbbing, the colour heightened again in his cheeks. When his blue eyes met mine, I inhaled sharply at the raw need in them.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re stunning,\u2019 he whispered hoarsely. \u2018No man can possibly deserve you.\u2019</p> <p>Holy ...</p><p>Wow.</p><p>My stomach actually somersaulted.</p><p>\u2018Cam,\u2019 I whispered back. The sheer emotion provoked by his beautiful words clogged my throat. It seemed that Cameron MacCabe was a bit of a romantic. I shook my head, not knowing how to respond to this side of him. Instead, I gestured to the bed. \u2018Lie down on your back.\u2019</p><p>I noticed a muscle tic in his jaw at my order and had to curb my smug smile. No, Cam was definitely not used to letting the woman take the lead. Since I had a feeling that this was going to be a rare gift from him, I decided to take full advantage. I waited, my eyebrows raised expectantly, and Cam responded by lying back on the bed.</p><p>His hard-on didn\u2019t diminish under my command, though, straining and awaiting my attention. He stared at me, his hands crossed casually behind his head. Well? his eyes asked.</p><p>Ignoring the slight tremor in my hands and legs, I approached him slowly, my slender hips swaying from side to side, my perky breasts bouncing a little, and I kept the feminine satisfaction from my expression at the way his body tensed, all cocky relaxation coiling into anticipation.</p><p>I crawled up his legs, noting that his chest began rising and falling a little faster. My own breathing grew shallow as I stopped at his erection.</p><p>\u2018Jo ...\u2019 He groaned as my head dipped.</p><p>I didn\u2019t dislike going down on a guy, but it had never been my favourite thing. I found, however, that I wanted to taste Cam. I wanted to own him in every way that I could.</p><p>I wanted him to burn with me.</p><p>His scorching hardness passed between my lips and I felt his thighs tense under my fingertips. My tongue trailed along a vein on the underside of his cock and his breathing stuttered before seeming to stop entirely as I began to suck, bobbing my head so my mouth slid excruciatingly slowly up and down his length.</p><p>\u2018Jesus,\u2019 he growled through gritted teeth. \u2018You keep that up \u2013 ahh \u2013 baby, I\u2019ll come and this will all be over.\u2019</p><p>Well, I didn\u2019t want that.</p><p>After a little more teasing, I released him and gazed at him from under my lashes, taken aback by how much I\u2019d enjoyed that, how much my own body had responded to it. Finding the anticipation a total aphrodisiac and wondering where foreplay had been all my life, I kissed the sexy cut of definition in his left hip, my lips tracing a path along his torso as I crawled up his body. Knees on either side of his hips, I shivered as I felt his cock against my inner thigh. I pressed my lips over his right nipple, my tongue flicking, my moan muffled against his body as I felt his rough hands cup my breasts, my own nipples pebbling, eager for his touch. When his thumbs brushed them, I shuddered, a sigh escaping from between my lips.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re sensitive,\u2019 Cam murmured in satisfaction, squeezing my nipples between his fingers and thumbs. I barely had time to recover from the streaks of white-hot lightning that shot towards my groin before his right hand coasted down my stomach, heading between my legs.</p><p>As two fingers slid into my slick passage, my back arched, giving his left hand better access to my breast, and my hips surged against his right. I panted for breath, not caring that Cam had taken over.</p><p>Really, I was astonished he\u2019d lasted as long as he had.</p><p>\u2018Jesus,\u2019 he grunted this time, his lower body bowing up off the bed. \u2018Take me inside you. Condom in the drawer ...\u2019</p><p>I reached blindly through my sensual fog, yanking his bedside drawer open. Once we had him sheathed and ready to go, we guided him together to my entrance, the muscles in my legs shaking with need.</p><p>I slammed down on him and we both cried out, Cam\u2019s hips jerking up in reaction.</p><p>We found a torturous rhythm quickly and with my hands braced on the bed beside his thighs, I leaned back slightly so his cock thrust into me at the most delicious angle. I moved slowly, building towards an exquisite orgasm.</p><p>My gaze never left Cam\u2019s face as I moved, feeling sexy and powerful at his glittering expression, watching the way his blue eyes darkened on my breasts, on my hair swinging across my back. His hands gripped my hips, urging me on; his jaw clenched as the heat between us increased and a light sheen of sweat covered our skin.</p><p>As I approached climax all I was aware of was the coiling pleasure low in my belly, the sound of my uncontrolled breaths and mews of pleasure, the intoxicating smell of sex ... and then I heard Cam hoarsely asking me to come. Pure bliss took me over, and I closed my eyes, revelling in it as my body moved faster up and down his length, rushing towards climax.</p><p>Lights exploded behind my lids as my orgasm shook through my entire body. My muscles clenched around Cam, wave after wave of pleasure pulsing around his cock.</p><p>Cool air whipped over my skin as Cam flipped me unexpectedly to my back, my eyes flying open as he pressed me into the mattress, holding my hands imprisoned above my head. His features were strained with uncontrolled need, and as he crushed his mouth against mine he began to stroke deep inside me, his movements rough and hard. He groaned into my mouth, the noise vibrating through my whole body, and I felt the stirring of another orgasm.</p><p>When his lips left mine, I stared up in wonderment, our gasps seeming to echo all around us as I pushed up against his thrusts. He let go of one of my arms, his hand disappearing between our joined bodies, and as soon as his thumb pressed down on my clit I flew apart, my scream filling the flat.</p><p>\u2018Jo!\u2019 Cam cried out, eyes wide with wonder as my climax drew a staggered, seemingly soul-deep release from him. He collapsed on me, his face buried in the crook of my neck, his hand relaxing around my arm. His cock continued to twitch inside me, and I enjoyed the lingering pleasure it brought.</p><p>It was as though I\u2019d melted into a puddle in the mattress \u2013 I couldn\u2019t feel or move any of my limbs. I was floating on utter gratification. I was sated air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Wow!\u2019 I breathed, wanting to curl my fingers in his hair but unable to remember how to move.</p><p>Cam nodded in agreement against my skin.</p><p>After a little while he pulled up, bracing his weight on his arms beside my head. His features were completely relaxed, his eyes soft and languid. \u2018I\u2019ve never come so fucking hard before,\u2019 he confessed quietly.</p> <p>Sweet satisfaction washed over me and gave me the strength to lift my arm. I stroked Cam\u2019s muscled back, then slid my hand into his hair, running my fingers through it soothingly. \u2018Me neither. In fact, up until now I thought multiple orgasms were a myth.\u2019</p><p>He laughed, his thumb sweeping affectionately across my cheekbone. \u2018You\u2019ll stay here tonight?\u2019</p><p>\u2018If you want me to.\u2019</p><p>His expression changed, becoming more serious \u2013 pensive even. \u2018There\u2019s nothing I want more.\u2019</p><p>Smiling, I realized I believed him.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know if I trusted him completely yet, but at least I knew that in that moment I believed him. I drew his head down to mine, pressing my mouth to his for a kiss sweetened not just by the satisfaction of great sex but by emotion as well. When I let him up for air, I grinned at him, feeling a bit like a kid who\u2019d found out Santa Claus was real after all. \u2018You\u2019ll have to tell me if I snore.\u2019</p><p>He frowned. \u2018No one\u2019s ever told you before?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve had a sleepover once and I didn\u2019t stick around in the morning to ask.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You mean you\u2019ve only stayed with a guy once?\u2019 I knew by the hardness in his eyes that he\u2019d drawn the right conclusion as to why that was.</p><p>I shrugged, turning my head away, embarrassed that I\u2019d brought it up now and worried what he\u2019d think. \u2018Yeah.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jo?\u2019 He touched my chin, turning my head so I had to meet his gaze. \u2018They were dicks. All of them.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Let\u2019s not talk about them.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ll talk, just not now.\u2019 And with that ominous warning, he withdrew from me and went to get rid of the condom. When he returned from the bathroom seconds later he pulled the duvet down underneath me so I could crawl on to the sheets, and he slid in beside me, covering us. I rested on my side, my head on his pillow, my nose inhaling the smell of his cologne, my heart suddenly racing again as I realized I didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>It became quickly apparent that I had no reason to be anxious.</p><p>Cam\u2019s strong arms wrapped around my waist as he snuggled in behind me, my naked bottom pressed to his groin, his legs entangling themselves in mine. \u2018 \u2019Night, baby.\u2019 His voice rumbled in my ear and I felt my stomach flip at the possessiveness in those two words.</p><p>Smoothing my hands down over the arms that held me close, I burrowed back against him and let myself melt. \u2018 \u2019Night.\u2019</p><p>My butterflies actually woke me up, my eyes blinking open to find my cheek pressed against Cam\u2019s bare chest, my arm thrown across his stomach, and his hand resting on the curve of my waist as I lay curled into him. The fluttering in my stomach only worsened.</p><p>Cam must have seeped into my subconscious, all my concerns and exhilaration waking me. There was my excitement at being with him, and yet the anxiety over throwing away a secure relationship with Malcolm for this passionate but nevertheless somewhat shaky relationship I\u2019d developed with Cam. Unlike any man I\u2019d met, he could rile me, piss me off, argue with me until we were blue in the face ... all of which screamed \u2018disaster waiting to happen!\u2019</p><p>Yet I had to weigh that against the unbelievable chemistry between us, the awe-inspiring sex, his concern and consideration once he\u2019d stopped being a prick, his patience, and how down-to-earth he was. I loved that he could admit when he was wrong, that he saw things in me no other man had, and that he had taken time to get to know Cole. I liked Cam. I really liked him, and I knew as I lay there that I would have lost the tiny sliver of self-respect I\u2019d had left if I\u2019d walked away from those feelings, if I had given up on them because of another man\u2019s wealth and what it could bring me and Cole.</p> <p>Cole.</p><p>I tensed a little, fretting at the thought of my brother. I didn\u2019t have nearly enough saved for his future. I needed to go job hunting again, see if I couldn\u2019t find something that paid better than Meikle &amp; Young\u2019s.</p><p>\u2018Whatever you\u2019re thinking, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to like it,\u2019 Cam murmured sleepily.</p><p>I tilted my head back in surprise, my eyes meeting his drowsy gaze. \u2018What?\u2019</p><p>He squeezed my waist. \u2018You were warm and relaxed, and then I felt your whole body get tense. What\u2019s up?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Worrying about my job. Worrying I should try to get something that pays better than Meikle\u2019s.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Never mind better pay. How about someone who treats you better?\u2019</p><p>I made a noise of agreement.</p><p>\u2018So is that what you do first thing in the morning? Worry?\u2019</p><p>Smiling at him, I nodded. \u2018If you\u2019re sticking around you\u2019ll need to get used to it.\u2019</p><p>He tightened his embrace. \u2018If I\u2019m sticking around, I\u2019ll do my best to make bloody sure you never have to worry again.\u2019</p><p>My breath caught. Damn, I hoped it wasn\u2019t going to become a habit of his to say romantic crap that robbed me of speech all the time. \u2018Smooth talker,\u2019 I answered a little hoarsely, and his lips twitched with amusement, as if the arrogant bugger knew that his words liquefied my insides.</p><p>\u2018What time is it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know. I gave Malcolm back the Omega watch.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That was good of you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It was the right thing to do.\u2019 I winced, feeling a wave of remorse wash over me. It somehow didn\u2019t feel right to be luxuriating in the heat of Cam and the happiness he brought me, while Malcolm was home hurting over my betrayal. \u2018Do you feel guilty?\u2019 I mumbled against his warm skin, my fingers absent-mindedly stroking the lines of his abs.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s difficult to feel anything but hard when you\u2019re touching me, baby,\u2019 Cam answered gruffly.</p><p>I chuckled despite myself. \u2018Insatiable, are we?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Apparently around you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018More sweet talk. Am I required to repay you in some way for it?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Now why would you assume you had to pay for it?\u2019</p><p>I grinned teasingly. \u2018Well, you\u2019re not known for being sweet to me, Cam.\u2019</p><p>His chest rose under my cheek as he gave a little huff of annoyance. \u2018How long am I going to pay for being a bastard to you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know. I think it might prove useful as leverage in the future.\u2019</p><p>His playful growl filled the room as he rolled me on to my back. At the sudden move, I giggled up into his now alert eyes, letting him pin me to the mattress. He nudged my legs apart. His face was still relaxed from sleep, the sexy curl of his upper lip soft and begging for attention. \u2018Do you want to know why I was such a bastard?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve already told me why \u2013 ah.\u2019 I ended on a gasp, feeling him hard and nudging insistently between my legs. My legs widened instinctively as he moved slowly against me, teasing me.</p><p>\u2018Truth?\u2019 He lowered his head, kissing softly along my jaw until he found my ear. I shuddered at the tiny nip he gave the lobe, at the lick of his tongue against the bite. My chest heaved and my breasts brushed tantalizingly against his chest. My chest rose and fell in fast, shallow movements.</p><p>At the press of our bodies, Cam froze for a second, a guttural moan falling from his lips to land on a breath against my neck.</p><p>I brought my knees up, inviting him to take what we both so desperately wanted him to. He reached for the chest of drawers and rummaged around, then pulled out a condom.</p><p>As Cam put on the protection his usually cobalt eyes were almost black. \u2018Truth?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Truth,\u2019 I whispered on a nod.</p><p>\u2018I wanted you and I couldn\u2019t have you.\u2019</p><p>My lips parted in amazement at the confession. \u2018That\u2019s why you were a bastard to me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t want to want you so badly, so when it appeared that you were someone I could never respect or want, I held on to that and ran with it. But you kept blowing all my preconceptions to smithereens, and I just kept wanting you more.\u2019</p><p>As Cameron gazed deep into my eyes I felt a weight bear down on us, like a cocoon wrapping around us, protecting the connection that was developing so deep and fast between us. \u2018I guess that means your bastard days are behind you,\u2019 I replied, my words barely audible under the gravity of emotion.</p><p>His brows drew together. \u2018Meaning?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You can stop wanting me now that you have me.\u2019</p><p>Light twinkled mischievously in his eyes as he grinned at me. \u2018I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible. To stop wanting you, I mean.\u2019</p><p>Without warning, before I could even reply to that, he pushed into me and I cried out, my hands digging into the muscles in his back as my body grew reacquainted with his thickness. His breath whispered over my lips just before he kissed me, his tongue teasing mine as he pulled out of me a few inches before sliding back in.</p><p>His kisses were hot and sweet as he slowly made love to me, pushing us towards another shattering release.</p><p>We had just got out of his shower \u2013 where I\u2019d finally found my chance to study the ink on his arms with my tongue \u2013 and we were in the kitchen making tea and toast when my phone rang. I found it in the pocket of my faux fur jacket, still lying in the hall from last night when Cam stripped me out of it.</p><p>A picture of Joss giving someone behind me a sly grin popped up on my phone screen as it rang. I\u2019d taken it at the bar months ago, not realizing Craig was doing some absurd \u2018sexy\u2019 dance behind me as I snapped Joss\u2019s picture. I smiled. \u2018Hullo?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hey, you,\u2019 she answered casually. \u2018How are you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m fine.\u2019 More than fine! I just had life-changing sex with Tattoo Guy! I grinned, trying to contain my giddiness as I wandered back into the kitchen, where Cam stood by the kettle, shirtless and all mine. \u2018You?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Good. You sound weird.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Weird?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah. Weird.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u2019 Cam glanced up at me and smiled, the corners of his eyes crinkling sexily. I grinned again. \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about at all.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hmm.\u2019 Clearly Joss was unconvinced. \u2018Are you and Cole coming to lunch today?\u2019</p><p>I hesitated. I had a lot to do today. I had to tell Cole about me and Cam, and it was time to put the clothes Malcolm had bought me on eBay. Just the thought of it made my stomach lurch with guilt about how things had ended between us.</p><p>\u2018Butter or jam on your toast?\u2019 Cam asked loudly.</p><p>I sucked in my breath.</p> <p>\u2018Was that Cam?\u2019 Joss asked quietly, more than idle curiosity in her tone.</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018At nine thirty in the morning? Asking about toast?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mm-hmm.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, my God, you fucked him.\u2019</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u2018Well, just say it like it is, Joss.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I take it you dumped Malcolm first before you got it on with Tattoo Guy. Poor Malcolm. Oh, well.\u2019</p><p>An unexpected warmth flooded my chest at Joss\u2019s summation of the situation. She hadn\u2019t asked me if I\u2019d cheated on Malcolm. She\u2019d just assumed I\u2019d been good enough to be straight with him. It was nice to know she thought so well of me. \u2018We broke up last night.\u2019 I was suddenly very aware of Cam\u2019s inquisitive eyes on me. \u2018Look, we\u2019ll talk about it later.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Bring Cam to lunch.\u2019</p><p>Okay, what? \u2018What?\u2019 I tried to squelch the hint of hysteria in that question.</p><p>\u2018If you\u2019re seeing him now you should bring him to lunch. Elodie won\u2019t mind.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You never asked Malcolm to lunch.\u2019</p><p>Cam shot me another questioning look.</p><p>\u2018Well, if I\u2019d thought the lunch would be as interesting as this one is definitely going to be, I might have.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018We\u2019re not coming to lunch just to entertain you.\u2019</p><p>Suddenly the phone was whipped from my ear and I watched wide-eyed as Cameron held it up to his own. \u2018Joss, hey, it\u2019s Cam. We\u2019ll be there. Time?\u2019 He nodded at whatever she said. \u2018Cool. See you then.\u2019</p><p>I took the phone from him and gestured between us. \u2018I don\u2019t know what just happened here, but we\u2019ll talk.\u2019 I lifted it to my ear. \u2018Joss.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nice phone voice, huh?\u2019 She chuckled.</p><p>\u2018Funny. Apparently we\u2019ll see you at lunch.\u2019</p><p>\u2018See you then. Oh, and Jo?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Was he good?\u2019</p><p>Laughter fell from my lips before I could stop it, remembering how I\u2019d pestered Joss about Braden after I found out they had slept together. Payback was a bitch. \u2018What was it you said to me? You can have him when I\u2019m done.\u2019</p><p>Her groan caused my smile to widen. \u2018I\u2019m such a bitch. Never tell Braden I said that. Please?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I promise.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good. If you break that promise, I\u2019ll find a way to lock you in a room with Ellie and her romantic drama collection.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You know some of us don\u2019t find that an excruciating prospect.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine. I\u2019ll take up smoking just to drive your cravings nuts.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You have a severely sadistic side. Anyway, I don\u2019t have any cravings.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Even when you smell cigarette smoke?\u2019 she asked smugly.</p><p>Damn. It was true. Anytime I got a whiff of cigarette smoke, my eyes closed in torture and I had to hunt down the nearest stick of gum to quell the need for nicotine intake. \u2018Your point is moot considering I\u2019m not going to tell him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Moot? Nice word choice. The brain is certainly working well for a Sunday morning conversation. He must have really started those engines, huh?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Goodbye, Joss. Oh, and you tell anyone about me and Cam before I get a chance to and I will tell Braden.\u2019 I hung up with a satisfied smirk.</p><p>Cam was staring at me as he held out my mug of coffee. \u2018What was that about?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I have some information she\u2019d like me to keep quiet. She threatened to torture me with cigarette smoke if I ever give her up.\u2019</p><p>He frowned, pushing a plate of toast towards me. There were slices spread with butter and others with jam. I took some sugary goodness. \u2018You used to smoke?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Quit almost six months ago.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thank God,\u2019 he muttered.</p><p>His words caused a pang of anxiety at the thought that something as insignificant as being a smoker would make him less attracted to me. Would it be so easy to diminish his attraction in the future? I covered my insecure thoughts with a forced chuckle. \u2018What? Would that have been a deal breaker?\u2019</p><p>The corner of his mouth quirked up cheekily. \u2018Nah. I\u2019d have convinced you to quit somehow. Just glad I missed the withdrawal. That must have been fun for Cole.\u2019</p><p>My whole body relaxed at his answer and when I laughed it was for real this time. \u2018I wasn\u2019t that bad.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, yeah, I\u2019ll get the real story from Cole.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Speaking of ...\u2019 I muttered and scrolled through my phone until I found his number. Cole\u2019s phone rang three times before I heard his voice.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You on your way home?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Five minutes away.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay. I have something to talk to you about.\u2019 I smiled at Cam, but inside I was a little nervous about Cole\u2019s reaction to me and Cam being together.</p><p>\u2018That doesn\u2019t sound good.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ll see.\u2019</p><p>He grunted and I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u2018See you soon.\u2019</p><p>Another grunt and then he hung up. I sighed. \u2018Someone should have written a book by now about interpreting teen language. I was never that monosyllabic.\u2019</p><p>Cam grinned into his mug. \u2018I\u2019ll bet.\u2019</p><p>I smacked him playfully. \u2018You know what I mean.\u2019</p><p>He shrugged. \u2018He\u2019s a teenage boy. As far as teenage boys go I think you guys have good communication between you.\u2019</p><p>Guessing he was probably right, I nodded and reached for another slice of toast. \u2018Well, let\u2019s see how my communication skills hold up when we try to explain this to him.\u2019</p><p>As Cam dumped his mug in the sink, he flashed me a wolfish grin. \u2018Oh, I\u2019d say from all that screaming you did last night and this morning, those communication skills are pretty sharp.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re such a cocky bugger.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then stop with the screaming. It only inflates my ego. Among other things.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine. From now on I\u2019ll be quiet as a church mouse.\u2019</p><p>Laughing, Cam reached for me, tugging me against his chest as I took the last bite of my toast. He kissed me, getting crumbs and jam on his lips. \u2018I dare you to try to keep quiet. Go on. It\u2019ll make things even more interesting.\u2019</p><p>Resting my hands on his chest, I leaned into him, feeling him harden against me through his jeans. I bit my lip, smiling a little as I stared at his sensual mouth. \u2018I accept that dare.\u2019 My eyes flicked to his, laughing at him. \u2018It\u2019s not like it won\u2019t be a win-win situation.\u2019</p><p>His arms tightened around me. \u2018Going to make me work for it, huh?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ll enjoy the labour.\u2019</p><p>His grin widened and he shook his head. \u2018I can\u2019t believe we waited this long.\u2019</p><p>Still smiling, I nodded in agreement. \u2018It\u2019s definitely fun so far.\u2019</p><p>Although Cam was still smiling back at me, something grave entered his expression as he held my gaze. \u2018Yeah, baby. It\u2019s definitely fun so far.\u2019</p><p>16</p><p>There was a sense of unreality as Cam threaded his fingers through mine and brought my knuckles to his lips. The soft brush against my skin was like a greeting and goose bumps popped up all over my body to say hello back to him. He led me up the stairs to my flat and the whole time I gazed at him in surreal wonder, the concrete steps like marshmallow clouds beneath my feet. How could it be that sex had not had such a \u2018girly\u2019 effect on me but this arbitrary act of handholding did? For a moment, the beauty of it allowed me to forget where he was actually leading me.</p><p>Mum.</p><p>Fiona was sitting on the couch watching television when Cam and I entered the flat. As soon as I heard the muffled sound of voices filtering into the hall from the sitting room, my whole body tensed with the realization that Cam was about to come face-to-face with her since he\u2019d helped Cole out the night I\u2019d stayed at Malcolm\u2019s.</p><p>Yay.</p><p>Seeming to read my body language, Cam pressed a reassuring hand to the small of my back, guiding me into the room.</p><p>She was lounging on the armchair in her ratty robe with her thinning hair wet. To my surprise I realized that she had obviously taken a shower without being coerced by me. She had a hot mug in her hand and it shook as she raised it to her lips, watching us as we slowly made our way farther into the room.</p><p>\u2018Mum.\u2019 I gave her a brittle nod and Cam\u2019s hand coasted around my waist, his strong arm hugging me into his side.</p><p>The slight widening of Mum\u2019s eyes told me she hadn\u2019t missed the deliberate move. \u2018You\u2019ve been here before?\u2019 She asked it quietly, with mild curiosity but no accusation, as I had been expecting. Clearly she\u2019d forgotten Cam and his presence that awful night.</p><p>\u2018Cameron MacCabe.\u2019 Cam acknowledged her gruffly, giving me a squeeze.</p><p>She made a mumbling noise, her bloodshot eyes darting back to me. \u2018No one was here this morning.\u2019</p><p>Burrowing deeper into Cam, my hand clutching the back of his shirt like a little girl, I nodded again. \u2018Cole stayed at Jamie\u2019s.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I fell.\u2019 Her mouth pursed. \u2018I fell. My back is killing me. No one was here to help. If you\u2019re going to be gallivanting around, that little bugger should at least be here to help.\u2019</p><p>The insult to my brother was like a steel rod sliding into my spine. I straightened sharply, taking a step away from Cam. My eyes narrowed on her, and I tried to squelch the hurt in my chest \u2013 the hurt I felt any time she did or said something so selfish and uncaring, so lacking in parental concern. \u2018Did the gin not help you back up, Mum? Funny, it seems to help you with everything else.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her rugged cheeks were peppered with visibly broken veins and the little colour that was in them leached out completely at my comment. \u2018Don\u2019t you get smart with me because he\u2019s here.\u2019</p><p>Taking a deep breath, knowing that if we continued at this pace, we\u2019d end up in a huge argument in front of Cam, I softened my tone. \u2018Cole and I have lives, Mum. You need to watch out for yourself more now, okay?\u2019</p><p>Waiting for a reaction, I stepped back so I could at least feel the heat of Cam behind me. I was grateful to him for keeping quiet and letting me deal with Mum in my own way. She got shakily to her feet, setting her mug on the table. \u2018I just needed a bit of help,\u2019 she answered quietly, hitting me in the chest with her words. Guilt wormed its way inside, despite my urgent battle against it.</p> <p>I sighed heavily. \u2018If you\u2019re really desperate, phone me next time.\u2019 I could have punched myself for giving in.</p><p>\u2018I will, darling.\u2019 She shuffled past us, her eyes on the ground. \u2018Nice meeting you, Cameron.\u2019 It was the nicest she had been to me since I confronted her about hitting Cole. Remembering how much I distrusted her, I felt deep regret at being even slightly polite to her. I shouldn\u2019t have given in, I thought bitterly.</p><p>Cam grunted in response to her, doing a fair impression of Cole.</p><p>I waited until she\u2019d disappeared from the room, until we heard her bedroom door closing, and then my eyes slid to Cam. \u2018Well?\u2019</p><p>His features had hardened. \u2018She\u2019s a manipulative cow and she knows just how to play you.\u2019 At that he turned on his heel and disappeared into the hall, heading towards the kitchen.</p> <p>I followed him, my heart thumping in my chest. \u2018I told you how she is.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, one minute a bloody witch, the next completely normal and nice. It\u2019s deliberate. When she\u2019s a witch, you stand up to her. When she\u2019s nice, you give in and she knows it. She\u2019s playing you.\u2019</p><p>Knowing that he was right and not really wanting to get into it with him on what had started out as the best morning ever, I began helping him make tea and coffee. We returned to the sitting room, having come to an unspoken agreement to put thoughts of my mum aside, and we both sat down on the couch. As soon as I did, Cam pulled me over his lap so that my legs straddled his thighs.</p><p>\u2018What are you doing?\u2019 I asked, my lips twitching with laughter.</p><p>\u2018Getting comfy.\u2019 He reached past me and grabbed our mugs, handing me mine.</p><p>I took it, completely bemused by our proximity. We were so close I could see coppery striations in the cobalt blue of his irises. \u2018You\u2019re comfortable like this?\u2019 I watched him as he casually took a sip of coffee, his other arm around my hip, his hand resting on the curve of my ass.</p> <p>\u2018Extremely,\u2019 he murmured.</p><p>Shrugging, I relaxed into him, taking a sip of tea.</p><p>And that was as long as I got to relax. The sound of the front door opening moved me into instant action. I attempted to dive out of Cam\u2019s arms.</p><p>He stopped me effortlessly with one arm.</p><p>\u2018What are you doing?\u2019 I hissed, my eyes narrowed on him, my heart thumping hard at the thought of Cole walking in on us wrapped around each other without an explanation first.</p><p>\u2018Um, what\u2019s going on?\u2019</p><p>Too late.</p><p>I closed my eyes briefly, shooting Cam a death look when I opened them and then peering past his head to smile apologetically at my brother, who took up a good portion of the doorway with his height and increasing frame. His green eyes were narrowed on the back of Cam\u2019s head. They shifted to me. \u2018Is this what you wanted to talk about?\u2019</p> <p>I nodded and tried once again, unsuccessfully, to clamber off Cam\u2019s lap as Cole strode into the room. He walked past the sofa to the armchair and Cam smiled at him before sipping his coffee, completely relaxed except for the arm that bound me tight to him.</p><p>Cole sighed and dropped into the chair. \u2018You two together, then?\u2019</p><p>We answered in unison.</p><p>Unfortunately not with the same answers.</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ll see.\u2019</p><p>As Cole\u2019s eyebrows rose, his eyes bright with amusement, Cam turned his head sharply to glare at me. \u2018We\u2019ll see?\u2019</p><p>Bugger. Now he thought I didn\u2019t want this. I did want this. I just didn\u2019t want him to feel pressured in case that scared him off. \u2018I don\u2019t want us to feel rushed.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Bullshit. You don\u2019t want me to feel rushed. I thought we talked about that.\u2019</p><p>I gaped at him. Cam wasn\u2019t known for his intuitiveness when it came to me, but apparently the more he got to know me the more he saw. Was I becoming predictable?</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how I felt about that.</p><p>\u2018If you\u2019re looking for my approval, you have it,\u2019 Cole muttered as he stood up again. He shot Cam a quick smile as he passed us. \u2018Seems like you know what you\u2019re doing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, funny.\u2019 I took umbrage at my brother\u2019s droll comment, rolling my eyes at the sound of his chuckle as he disappeared down the hall into his room. My eyes slid back to Cam\u2019s face only to find him grinning at me. \u2018Don\u2019t even think about becoming a tag team.\u2019</p><p>He laughed, his eyes crinkling in the way that melted my insides. \u2018Wouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u2019 He put his mug down and then mine, before wrapping his arms around me. I slid my arms around his neck, settling closer into him. \u2018That went well.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It went how every conversation with Cole goes lately.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And what way is that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Quickly.\u2019</p><p>I felt Cam\u2019s shoulders shake underneath me. \u2018He\u2019s a guy. We like to get straight to the point.\u2019</p><p>Enjoying the mix of contentment and excitement I felt in his arms, I pressed my body deeper into his, feeling his erection grow against my butt. I brushed his mouth lightly with my own, glorying at the hitch in his breathing. \u2018You took a while to get to the point this morning.\u2019</p><p>The glitter in his eyes was the only warning before I found myself thrown back on the couch. Cam gripped my thighs, pushing my legs open so he could settle between them. I wrapped my long legs around him and he kissed me, slow and deep. We made out for a while like two teenagers. It was bloody brilliant!</p><p>As his strong hand glided up my outer thigh, I breathed in his familiar scent and wished we didn\u2019t have to go to lunch. Reading my thoughts, he finally pulled back, and I couldn\u2019t stop myself from tracing my fingers along his lips. He really had the most distracting mouth of any man I\u2019d ever met.</p><p>Continuing our conversation as if five minutes of lip-locking hadn\u2019t just happened, I whispered, \u2018I didn\u2019t mean that as a bad thing. I meant it as a very, very good thing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then I\u2019ll make sure to take my time getting to the point in the future.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I said I was cool with it, not that I wanted to see it,\u2019 Cole grumbled above us.</p><p>We both jerked our heads around to see Cole standing by the couch, glaring down at us, a plate of sandwiches in one hand and a glass of Coke in the other.</p><p>\u2018Oi, what are you doing?\u2019 I huffed at my brother, pushing Cam off of me. \u2018We\u2019re going to lunch. You\u2019re going to spoil your dinner.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Wow,\u2019 Cam said lightly as he sat up. \u2018I just got a glimpse into the future.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>He laughed, shaking his head as he turned to Cole. He gestured to the sandwiches. \u2018I\u2019ll take one of those.\u2019</p><p>Cole held the plate out and Cam casually took a sandwich.</p><p>I stared at them both, munching on their snacks, ruining their appetites. \u2018God. Now there\u2019s two of them.\u2019</p><p>That only made Cam and Cole share amused, secret \u2018guy club\u2019 smiles.</p><p>A sense of warmth \u2013 beautiful, relaxing, contented warmth \u2013 radiated out from my chest, enveloping my entire body in a kind of happiness I\u2019d never felt before.</p><p>The feeling absolutely terrified the bejesus out of me.</p><p>I spent the bus ride to Stockbridge talking. I don\u2019t think I stopped to breathe once. Cole sat behind us with his earphones in, listening to an audiobook, so he was completely oblivious to my record-breaking nonstop chatter at Cam as I laid out the benefits of keeping our relationship on the down low. I honestly didn\u2019t know why I wanted to keep it quiet. I thought it might have something to do with making sure there were few witnesses to my heartbreak if this went south, but I wasn\u2019t going to tell Cam that. Instead I rambled, and rambled, and rambled at him.</p><p>He may have been sick of the sound of my voice by the time we got off that bus, but at least I knew my point had been made. We were keeping our relationship quiet.</p><p>\u2018Jo and I are together now.\u2019</p><p>Ten minutes had passed since we\u2019d got off the bus and we were standing in Elodie Nichols\u2019s living room with the entire Nichols family plus Adam, Braden and Joss staring at us. Cam had made that little announcement in response to Ellie\u2019s \u2018So how are you?\u2019</p><p>As Joss would say, I felt sucker punched. I shot Cam a disbelieving look. \u2018Did you not hear a word I said on the bus?\u2019</p><p>He gave me that wide, appeasing grin that did naughty things to my insides. \u2018I have selective hearing, baby.\u2019 He clutched my hip, trying to pull me close. \u2018Good thing too or my brain might have melted out of my ears. I didn\u2019t know it was possible for a human to say that many words per minute.\u2019</p><p>I looked at my friends, who were all staring at us with sly grins on their faces. \u2018Cam and I just broke up.\u2019</p><p>Cam laughed, hugging me even tighter into his side.</p><p>I huffed, trying to wriggle free. \u2018What are you doing?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Getting back together with you.\u2019</p><p>The sound of barely stifled chortles made my cheeks redden. Oh, God, we were being \u2018cute\u2019 in company. My eyes slid to Joss. Sure enough, she had a superior smile on her face. There was no way to win this round, but I could lessen the cuteness. \u2018Fine,\u2019 I mumbled ungraciously, relaxing against him.</p><p>Elodie and Clark, who had been introduced to Cam only three minutes ago, started firing questions at him about being a graphic designer, about growing up in Longniddry, and about his parents, until I eventually left him sitting beside Cole and enlisted Hannah in making an escape. Since I couldn\u2019t feel the heat of Joss\u2019s stare, I took this to mean that she was just happy Cam and I were together and didn\u2019t need to know the details. Ellie was a different story. She would want to know absolutely everything. Her eyes bored into me, and I could almost hear her telepathic orders for me to look at her. That was when I started shooting Hannah \u2018save me\u2019 looks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My little saviour shot to her feet. \u2018I have to show Jo something. Alone,\u2019 she said pointedly, giving her sister a look that allowed no room for argument. She got that look from Elodie.</p><p>\u2018But \u2013\u2019</p><p>We were already out of the room before Ellie could say a second word.</p> <p>Trying to muffle our giggles, we fell into Hannah\u2019s room. \u2018You are the best person in the whole world.\u2019 I grinned at her.</p><p>Hannah smiled in response as she flopped down on her bed. \u2018You know you\u2019re going to have to face the inquisition soon though, right?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know. I\u2019d just rather face it later than sooner.\u2019</p><p>Suddenly Hannah\u2019s cheeks flushed a little red. \u2018He\u2019s really hot.\u2019</p><p>Laughing, I moved to sit beside her, feeling my own cheeks heat as I remembered this morning and last night. \u2018He is that.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I won\u2019t ask about Malcolm or anything, but ... I heard Ellie speaking with Joss and they said Cam\u2019s not really your usual type. I guess that doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re happy.\u2019</p><p>I loved this kid. Truly and deeply. \u2018I\u2019m happy today. Scared. But happy. Cam has convinced me to do something just for me, rather than for me and Cole.\u2019 I remembered all the security that had walked away with Malcolm last night and I felt a stab of fear and anxiety. In an effort to ignore it, I nudged Hannah with my shoulder. \u2018So how is Marco?\u2019</p><p>Heaving a massive sigh, Hannah fell back on the mattress and stared at the ceiling, avoiding my eyes. \u2018He\u2019s talking to me again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why aren\u2019t you more excited about that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Because the tool is acting like nothing happened. Like we\u2019re just friends. Not to mention there is this girl in the year above me who\u2019s been telling everyone she hooked up with him at a party last weekend. She\u2019s really pretty.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, considering you\u2019re beautiful, I think you have one over on her.\u2019 Hannah made a noise of disbelief and I patted her knee. \u2018One day you\u2019re going to look in the mirror and see what I see.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018A geek who needs an attitude readjustment?\u2019</p><p>I made a face. \u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I got in trouble this week. Mum and Dad aren\u2019t happy.\u2019</p><p>My painfully shy Hannah had got in trouble? \u2018What?\u2019 I repeated in disbelief.</p><p>\u2018My PE teacher had a go at me because I refused to get into an all-girls team against an all-boys team at basketball. I told him that it\u2019s scientifically proven that boys are stronger and faster than girls and that to put all girls against all boys was setting the girls\u2019 team up for failure. He said that I was being unfair to my own sex. I said I was being realistic and that I thought he was deliberately favouring the boys over the girls. He reported me and, while our head teacher told him that all basketball teams during classes should be mixed from now on, the head teacher also called Mum and told her I needed an attitude readjustment.\u2019</p><p>Choking down my amusement as I caught the twinkle of bedevilment in her eyes, I shook my head at her. \u2018What happened to the crippling shyness?\u2019</p><p>She somehow managed to shrug lying down. \u2018I just feel like being shy is getting in my way.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is this because of Marco?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No, not just that. Although I\u2019m getting the impression I\u2019m not really \u201ccool\u201d enough for him \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then he\u2019s an idiot.\u2019</p><p>\u2018\u2013 It\u2019s more that I missed out on joining the debating team because I was too shy to speak up. And I know I\u2019d be really good at debating.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think we all know that.\u2019</p><p>She threw a cushion at me and continued as if I hadn\u2019t spoken. \u2018And I missed out on the Christmas dance this year because my friends and I felt too self-conscious going alone together. And I wrote this poem that really means a lot to me and I wanted to enter it into this regional competition but I didn\u2019t because \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018You were too shy.\u2019 I patted her knee again. \u2018So you what? Just woke up one day and decided not to be?\u2019</p><p>Hannah sat up, her eyes filled with wisdom beyond her years. \u2018No. I kissed a boy I really like and he rejected me. If I can handle that, I\u2019m pretty sure I can handle opening my mouth in front of people I\u2019ve gone to school with for years and saying what I want to say.\u2019</p><p>I nodded slowly and then gave her a reassuring smile. \u2018For what it\u2019s worth, you are the coolest person I know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Even cooler than Cam?\u2019</p><p>Cam was that smart, geek-like, hot guy who marched to the beat of his own drum. Yeah. He was so cool I could die from his coolness, but I wasn\u2019t going to admit to that like a besotted teenager. I snorted, getting up off the bed. \u2018Oh, please, he only thinks he\u2019s cool.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s really cool, isn\u2019t he?\u2019 Hannah grinned at me over her shoulder as she opened her bedroom door.</p><p>I followed her out, all fake superiority gone. \u2018Yeah. Just don\u2019t tell him I said so.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Tell who?\u2019 Ellie was suddenly in my face as if she\u2019d appeared out of nowhere. Within seconds, Hannah and I had been herded back into her bedroom by Ellie and Joss.</p><p>Joss gave me a sympathetic smile. \u2018I tried to stop her.\u2019</p><p>I sucked in a breath, waiting.</p><p>And then Ellie began peppering me with her rapid-fire questions.</p><p>Lunch actually couldn\u2019t have gone any better. Cam was well-mannered, gracious, intelligent, interesting \u2013 all the things I knew he was and could be, but I was glad to see that the Nicholses and Joss and Braden could see that too. I also loved that they noticed how close he was to Cole already. They sat together at the table and whenever conversation wasn\u2019t directed at either one of them, they had their heads together, talking quietly about the book Cole was listening to. Apparently Cam had recommended it.</p><p>Since Cam shared Braden and Adam\u2019s dry sense of humour, I had no worries that the three guys wouldn\u2019t get on. Braden kept shooting me these teasing smiles that somehow translated into \u2018I\u2019m happy for you.\u2019 That was nice. It really was. However, it just amplified the little ghost of anxiety floating around me, groaning at me about what would happen if this \u2018thing\u2019 with Cam fell apart.</p><p>I\u2019d never received that awful pity and sympathy other people did when they broke up with someone, because no one had ever really taken my feelings for my boyfriends seriously \u2013 whether they were serious or not \u2013 yet I knew that in this situation there would be agonizing sympathy if Cam walked away, and I wasn\u2019t sure I could handle that.</p><p>There I was, already imagining the demise of our relationship.</p><p>I needed my head checked.</p><p>With Cam\u2019s strong, slightly callused hand in mine, his body close, his voice full of warmth and affection as we strolled down London Road with Cole, I knew I needed my head checked. This was good. We\u2019d only just started and it was good. I wasn\u2019t going to let my mistrust poison this. I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>I squeezed Cam\u2019s hand as we walked into our building, his deep voice echoing up the stairwell as he told me about a couple of jobs he\u2019d seen advertised in the paper.</p><p>\u2018You should definitely apply for them,\u2019 I responded, frowning at Cole, who walked upstairs ahead of us, his shoelace flapping against the concrete. He was going to get himself killed. \u2018Cole, tie your shoe.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re nearly at the flat,\u2019 he argued.</p><p>\u2018Tie your shoe.\u2019</p><p>We all stopped and waited for him to follow my instruction.</p><p>\u2018Happy?\u2019 he grunted, continuing upward.</p><p>\u2018When you speak to me like that, baby boy, how can I not be?\u2019</p><p>I could hear Cam choke on his laughter behind me, so when we turned on to his landing I was looking back at him. That\u2019s why I slammed into Cole.</p><p>\u2018What the ...\u2019 My voice trailed off as I turned sharply to see what the problem was.</p><p>The problem was Becca, standing in front of Cam\u2019s door with a carrier bag in her hand.</p><p>\u2018I want my stuff back.\u2019 She thrust the bag out at Cam, who stepped in front of us to approach her. \u2018Here\u2019s your shit. You were always careful not to leave much with me, so there\u2019s only a book and your MP3 player.\u2019 Ouch. The hallway fairly echoed with her bitterness.</p><p>Guilt immediately assailed me and I pressed close to Cole, who leaned back into me, his stance almost protective. He\u2019d met Becca only once, but he knew who she was and what this situation meant.</p><p>Cam calmly took the bag from her. \u2018What stuff did you leave?\u2019</p><p>She sneered at him. \u2018You don\u2019t even care, do you? You broke up with me and then you went home with her.\u2019 She pointed at me like I was trash. \u2018Yeah, Malcolm filled me in.\u2019 Her eyes glittered now as she turned to face me. \u2018Don\u2019t worry, slut. Malcolm and I made each other feel better last night. Hope that lessens the guilt.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Enough,\u2019 Cam snapped, stepping into Becca\u2019s space. He bristled with anger and Becca was smart enough to slam her mouth closed. \u2018Don\u2019t ever speak to her like that again. Understood?\u2019</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u2018Just get me my stuff.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll look around the flat and whatever I find of yours I\u2019ll send to you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll send it, Becca. We\u2019re done here.\u2019</p><p>It was cold of him, but I understood his reaction. I imagined he didn\u2019t want a scene in the hallway where our neighbours could hear and, worse, where Cole could hear. Intimidating her into leaving seemed like the safest option. I moved out of her way as she passed me, but she stopped as she reached me.</p><p>\u2018Are you going to fuck every man I fuck?\u2019</p><p>I flinched. \u2018Watch your language.\u2019</p><p>Becca looked at me as if I had just crawled out from under a rock. \u2018You\u2019re an idiot for walking away from Malcolm Hendry for him. Everyone knows Cameron MacCabe only fucks around with a girl for a couple of weeks before moving on. You downgraded big time. But that\u2019s your mistake.\u2019 She shot Cam a snide smile that I knew merely covered her hurt. It had always been clear that Becca was more into Cam than he was into her. \u2018I think I\u2019ll upgrade.\u2019 Her nasty smile was just for me as she leaned in to whisper, \u2018I might give Malcolm a call.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The three of us watched her leave in silence, and finally, trembling a little, I let Cole lead us up to the flat. He shot me a worried look before disappearing into his bedroom, and I felt more than heard Cam follow me into the kitchen.</p><p>The heat of him enveloped me as he pressed against my back, stilling my hand on the kettle before wrapping his arms around my waist. I slid my hands over his and leaned into him. \u2018You okay?\u2019 he asked softly, genuine concern in his voice.</p><p>I shrugged, not really sure what I was feeling. \u2018I guess. I feel bad.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018If it makes you feel any better, I never made any promises to Becca. We were very casual.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Malcolm and I weren\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>Cam\u2019s arms tightened. \u2018Did it bother you? What she said about her and Malcolm last night?\u2019</p><p>I didn\u2019t know. I thought it did. I just wasn\u2019t sure if it was because I still had feelings for him or because my vanity was pricked. \u2018It just reinforced the truth. It wasn\u2019t real between us.\u2019</p><p>The touch of Cam\u2019s warm lips on my jaw sent a delicious shiver down my spine and I momentarily forgot everything. \u2018Where am I sleeping tonight?\u2019</p> <p>My skin grew warm just at the prospect of tonight. \u2018My bed is too small for us to share but I can\u2019t leave Cole alone. Why don\u2019t I come down to see you? I won\u2019t be able to stay, though.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s fine, baby. Listen, I said I\u2019d meet Nate for a drink.\u2019 He pulled back and turned me in his arms. \u2018I\u2019ll see you back at my flat tonight?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah. Around eleven thirty?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll be there.\u2019 He dipped his head to press a light kiss to my lips, but I reached up to cup his jaw, drawing his mouth back to mine. I deepened the kiss, my tongue teasing his, my fingernails scraping gently along his stubbly jawline until my fingers clenched in the hair at his nape. I kissed him until he had to pull back to draw breath.</p><p>Eyes a little wide and unfocused, Cam nodded and reluctantly let me go. \u2018Let\u2019s make it ten thirty.\u2019</p><p>17</p> <p>\u2018I was thinking we should both get checked out so we can stop using condoms. You\u2019re on the pill, right?\u2019</p><p>My hair whispered across the pillow as I turned to look at Cam lying next to me, his skin glistening with a faint sheen of sweat. I was still panting from our exertions and it took me a minute to process what he\u2019d asked. \u2018Yeah. I\u2019ll get checked this week.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Me too. I should be fine. I got checked before Becca and she and I always used protection.\u2019</p><p>\u2018A little friendly advice.\u2019 I sighed, looking up at the ceiling. \u2018Don\u2019t talk about your sexcapades with another woman seconds after having sex with your current woman.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No need to be jealous, baby. You\u2019re a ten \u2013 she was a five. Maybe a six on a good day.\u2019</p><p>I rolled my eyes, pretending not to be satisfied that Cam thought I was a better lay than Becca. \u2018And definitely don\u2019t score them.\u2019</p><p>Cam laughed, rolling on to his side so he could pull me to him. He tried to kiss me, but I was still slightly pissed off that he\u2019d mentioned Becca, so I covered his mouth with my hand. He kissed it and said something, but it was muffled against my skin.</p><p>I pulled my hand back. \u2018What was that?\u2019</p> <p>His eyes roamed my face, a small smile playing on his lips. \u2018I said I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good.\u2019</p><p>Dipping his head, his eyes serious, Cam spoke, his lips grazing mine. \u2018You ever try to keep this mouth from me again and I\u2019ll find very creative forms of use for it as punishment.\u2019</p><p>I shivered. This side of him in bed was a real turn-on. \u2018It\u2019s my mouth. It\u2019s up to me who gets near it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018True,\u2019 he acquiesced, his hand trailing down my hip to wind up between my legs. I jolted involuntarily at the press of his thumb on my clit. \u2018But last night you agreed that we were together, and being together means that mouth belongs to me. I don\u2019t like people hiding my things.\u2019 He ended that pronouncement with a roguish grin. His thumb circled my clit and I gasped, clutching his wrist, urging him on.</p><p>I wanted to call him on his crap, but I couldn\u2019t speak. Couldn\u2019t think. My body had already been treated to a tremendous orgasm and was now positioned on the precipice of another.</p><p>I came quickly, I came hard, and I came with a cry that Cam quieted against his mouth. His kiss was wet and dirty, and its purpose was to swallow my climax and stamp me with his ownership.</p><p>The bastard was lucky I was feeling equally possessive.</p><p>Gripping his head tight, I kissed him back just as voraciously and when he moved to catch his breath, I nipped his lip. Hard.</p><p>He hissed, his eyes widening, his tongue flicking out to lick the hurt.</p><p>\u2018If mine is yours, yours is mine.\u2019</p><p>He liked that. I could tell by the way his eyes crinkled at the corners. \u2018Deal.\u2019</p><p>I liked that too. I liked that I felt comfortable enough to be myself with him. My thumb caught the nip in an affectionate gesture of halfhearted apology. \u2018I need to go.\u2019 I moved to roll away from him, only to be drawn to a halt by his arm across my waist.</p><p>\u2018Stay. Just for a little while.\u2019</p><p>Worry immediately caused my whole body to tense, obliterating all my happy thoughts about us as a couple. This felt an awful lot like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2013 me hurrying home to Cole, leaving an annoyed man lying in bed. Before, it had mattered on some level that I not upset my relationship. With Cam it mattered on every level. My brows drew together in confusion and anxiety. I\u2019d assumed things would be different with Cam. That he understood. Only seconds ago I was \u2018Miss Comfortable\u2019 and now I was back to being who I was suddenly very sick and tired of being.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 He tugged on my waist, trying to urge me closer. \u2018What\u2019s causing this?\u2019 His fingers traced my frown lines.</p><p>\u2018Nothing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not nothing.\u2019 With an effort, he forced me to turn completely back to him. \u2018Your muscles are locked up tight. Why?\u2019</p><p>On the one hand, I wanted us to be okay. To be open. To be real. On the other hand, I didn\u2019t want him to think I was questioning him so soon into this. I didn\u2019t want to leave his bed pissed off at him and vice versa.</p><p>I chewed my lip, taking far too long to think it over.</p><p>\u2018Jesus, Johanna.\u2019 He pulled back before I had a chance to say anything, his eyebrows dipped in anger. \u2018I\u2019m not bloody them.\u2019 He threw the sheets off of us as he moved to leave the bed.</p><p>Dammit! \u2018I\u2019m just worried,\u2019 I huffed, feeling my cheeks heat at the coming confession.</p><p>Cam grew still, twisting his head to look at me over his shoulder. \u2018Go on.\u2019</p><p>I made a face at his bossiness and sat up, drawing my knees to my chest in a subconscious need to protect myself. \u2018I\u2019m worried you\u2019ll get bored with the fact that I can\u2019t ... accommodate you. Because I have Cole and\u2019 \u2013 I braced myself, wondering how he\u2019d react to my next piece of brutal honesty \u2013 \u2018he\u2019ll always come first.\u2019</p><p>In seconds I was flat on my back, Cam looking down at me, his eyes soft again, and better yet, they were filled with understanding. \u2018You never have to worry about that. I get it. I understand. Cole comes first. Of course he does. He\u2019s a bloody kid who needs you. I\u2019m not going to get bored or pissed off. And frankly if I do, you should dump my ass.\u2019</p><p>Something shifted in my chest, something huge and overwhelming and scary. That something was my feelings for Cam. They were settled inside me now, held in place by an immovable anchor. \u2018Are you for real?\u2019 I asked, giving him a weak smile, trying to cover how emotional I felt.</p><p>Cam smiled back at me as he placed a soft kiss on my mouth. \u2018Completely real, baby. But if you need proof ...\u2019 He pressed his knee between my legs, nudging them open, the wicked look in his eyes telling me I wasn\u2019t going anywhere just yet.</p><p>After everything Cole and I had been through, it was almost difficult allowing myself to feel this happy. I was high on Cameron MacCabe, and although most of me loved it, this small part of me, the small part that couldn\u2019t let go of the past, was terrified by it. Fortunately for us both, I\u2019d watched Joss almost destroy her relationship with Braden over that exact thing, and I had no wish to follow in her footsteps. It was only two days in, and I was guessing it would take a small miracle to make me walk away from Tattoo Guy.</p><p>What it would take for him to walk away was a different story, but I was determined to try to kill that kind of negative thinking before it spoiled everything for me. I was also resolved not to rock the boat, so when Malcolm texted me on Monday morning while I was at work, I didn\u2019t tell Cam.</p><p>So of course I also didn\u2019t tell him that I texted Malcolm back.</p><p>Malcolm had proved himself to be a good guy. A gentleman. A friend. It didn\u2019t matter if he\u2019d found solace in the arms of Becca. All that mattered was that he\u2019d been kind to me when we were together. I wasn\u2019t sure I was ready to lose that, so when he asked if I was okay, I told him I was. I apologized again, and I asked him how he was.</p><p>I\u2019ll be fine, sweetheart. I miss you. I\u2019m glad we can still talk. x</p><p>There was no measuring my feelings of guilt when I read that text.</p><p>Friends?</p><p>Of course. Let me know if you need anything. I hope you\u2019re happy, Jo. x</p><p>Cut me to the quick.</p><p>Yeah. You too. x</p><p>Cam may or may not have been okay with Malcolm texting me, but I thought it was too soon to broach that subject, especially after the night before and my little confession and all its drama.</p><p>I saw him later before he had to go to work and I didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>Tuesday night was our first night working together as a couple. We agreed at the outset that we wouldn\u2019t curb our flirtations with customers, since that increased our tips. I wasn\u2019t looking forward to it, but it made sense for us both. Tuesday night was one of the quietest nights we\u2019d ever had. No flirtations, no incidents.</p><p>Thursday night was a little different.</p><p>It started off with Phil working the door.</p><p>Just as he had done Tuesday night, Cam held my hand all the way to work and all the way into the club when we got to work. He led us down the stairs to the entrance, his warm hand tight in mine, and the first thing we heard was, \u2018You\u2019re with this idiot now, eh? I\u2019ve got more money than him.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>While Phil thought this was funny, I tried desperately to ignore the hurt.</p><p>My hand slipped out of Cam\u2019s and with a small smile at Brian, I went on into the club, Cam\u2019s harsh voice echoing down the hall as he growled at Phil. \u2018You. Watch it.\u2019</p><p>I didn\u2019t wait for Phil\u2019s reply. Sufficiently pissed off, I hurried past Joss, ignoring her greeting.</p> <p>\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 she called after me, her light footsteps following mine into the staff room.</p><p>Shrugging out of my coat, I tried to turn the seething down to a simmer.</p><p>\u2018Jo?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You can blame Cam,\u2019 I replied sourly.</p><p>\u2018What did I do?\u2019 Cam marched into the staff room, heading for his locker. His expression was as dark as mine as he turned to face me. Joss sidled up next to him, her eyebrows drawn together in confusion.</p> <p>I glared at them both. \u2018You were right before.\u2019 I directed my words at Joss. \u2018I let people think the worst of me. And I could handle it. But Tattoo Guy came along and told me to ask more of myself, and suddenly snide comments from people I thought liked me \u2013 but it turns out they thought exactly what you said they thought of me \u2013 hurt me. So, thanks, Cam. Now I\u2019m a bloody walking open wound.\u2019</p><p>There were a number of appropriate responses to my rant. Joss grinning at Cam and then smacking him heartily on the back was not one of them. \u2018You are my new favourite person.\u2019</p><p>I gave points to Cam for looking at her like she was nuts. I gave him some more for pulling me into a hug. I wrapped my arms around him, finding the feel of his hard, solid, safe body soothing. I breathed him in and snuggled deeper when his arms tightened around me.</p><p>\u2018Why all the long faces? This is good news,\u2019 Joss insisted, completely serious.</p><p>Moving my chin so I could rest it on Cam\u2019s shoulder and glare at her, I warned, \u2018I am this close to ending our friendship.\u2019</p><p>Nowhere near intimidated by my threats, Joss\u2019s expression turned mulish. \u2018I\u2019m sorry someone hurt you. Point me in their direction and I\u2019ll give them a beatdown they won\u2019t forget in a hurry. But this is good, Jo. Cam has done what I\u2019ve been trying to do for a year. He woke you up.\u2019</p> <p>Cam pulled back, smirking at her. \u2018That\u2019s a little cheesy, Joss.\u2019</p><p>It was like he\u2019d told her she\u2019d stepped in dog poo. Her nose wrinkled and she shuddered, a look of absolute self-disgust falling over her pretty features. \u2018I have got to stop letting Ellie choose what we watch on movie night. It\u2019s causing me to acclimatize to heartfelt emotion.\u2019 She turned on her heel, muttering something under her breath about Jason Bourne.</p><p>\u2018Nicely done,\u2019 I murmured to Cam, impressed at the way he\u2019d so easily dispatched Joss. His lips brushed my cheek in response and I turned to look into his eyes. \u2018You sure you want to be seen with a girl everyone thinks of as one step above a paid escort?\u2019</p><p>It was clearly the wrong thing to say, as evidenced by the tic of the muscle in his jaw as he clenched his teeth. He gripped my chin so I couldn\u2019t look away. \u2018Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t even consider thinking of yourself in those terms. And don\u2019t ask me stupid questions. If anyone ever says anything like that to you ... tell me. They\u2019ll not be saying it for long.\u2019</p><p>Cam had gone all alpha male on me but I wasn\u2019t even processing it. Despite his portrayal of the overprotective boyfriend, I couldn\u2019t forget that only weeks before, he\u2019d accused me of the same thing Phil had. I wanted to forget. I really thought I had. But it seemed it was still there, niggling away at me under layers of denial.</p><p>Eyes dimming of their anger, mouth slackening to exasperation, Cam sighed as he let go of me. \u2018Is this about me? About before?\u2019</p><p>I shrugged, not wanting to lie outright.</p><p>\u2018Are you ever really going to forgive me for what I said when we met?\u2019</p> <p>I shrugged again. Cole would have been so proud. \u2018It\u2019s forgiven.\u2019 Just clearly not forgotten.</p><p>\u2018But not forgotten.\u2019</p><p>Mind reader.</p><p>Heaving another sigh, Cam took hold of my hips and pulled me close, dipping his head to kiss me softly. His right hand coasted up under my tank top, his cool hand on my bare skin sending shivers rippling over me. I felt my nipples pebble as his hand cupped my bra, his thumb tracing the swell of my breast. My knees shook and I gripped Cameron\u2019s waist tightly. \u2018You\u2019ve not forgotten,\u2019 he repeated roughly. \u2018But you will.\u2019 He crushed my mouth against his, his kiss almost painful in its demand. I didn\u2019t care. It was fair to say that at this point I was absolutely addicted to the taste and feel of him.</p><p>\u2018Customers!\u2019 Joss yelled from behind the bar.</p><p>We jolted apart, Cam reluctantly pulling his hand out from under my top and smoothing it back in place. \u2018You go out first.\u2019</p><p>I glanced down at the bulge in his jeans and grinned. \u2018Take your time.\u2019</p><p>He growled at me playfully in response as I passed him, adding a taunting swing to my hips.</p><p>After the first two come-hither smiles Cam sent to customers I stopped looking at him. I was aware of him, as I was always aware of him, but determined to shut out actual hard evidence of the flirting.</p><p>Combating it with my own flirting might have worked, but every time I attempted to flirt with a customer, I could feel Cam\u2019s eyes burning into my skin, and it put me off my game.</p><p>My growing irritation finally came to a head when there was a lull at the bar. I threw a dishcloth at Cam. \u2018Our tips jar is suffering because of you, buddy.\u2019</p><p>Cam had caught the cloth before it hit him and was now laughing as he wiped up some spillage on the bar top. \u2018What did I do?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can feel you watching me. I can\u2019t flirt with you watching me.\u2019</p><p>His deep chuckle tickled all my good-for-nothing places and I hated that I found the cheeky grin he gave Joss so bloody hot. \u2018Was I doing anything?\u2019</p><p>Joss shrugged. \u2018I have no clue what you were doing, but keep it up. The fake giggle\u2019 \u2013 she gestured lazily at me \u2013 \u2018has disappeared, so I\u2019m happy.\u2019</p><p>Another tag team? I crossed my arms over my chest, hoping my body language was a warning to back off. \u2018The fake giggle is not that bad.\u2019</p><p>My friend grunted in disagreement. \u2018It sounds like Miss Piggy has a machine gun stuck in her throat.\u2019</p><p>Roaring with laughter, Cam didn\u2019t even feel the heat of my glower. But watching him laugh as Joss\u2019s apt description took hold of me, I had to stifle my own amusement. I couldn\u2019t encourage them or I\u2019d have Cole and Cam against me at home and Joss and Cam against me at work.</p><p>Harrumphing at them both, I turned to greet our next customer. He was male. Tall. Pretty cute. As I poured him a draught, I asked him about his night, laughing and flirting with him for a good five minutes before his friends called him back to their table. I will note that I did all this minus the fake giggle.</p><p>Since Cam had already provided evidence that he was a fairly possessive guy, my intention was to piss him off and put him in his place.</p><p>I spun on my heel, expecting to face his annoyance. Instead he was leaning back against the bar, smirking at me. \u2018Nice try.\u2019</p><p>Damn. I was dating Mr Unpredictable. The bloody idiot did not respond to any situation the way I expected him to. How on earth was I meant to navigate these waters if I didn\u2019t know the depth of them?</p><p>Bugger.</p><p>This really was going to be a relationship unlike any of my others.</p><p>The next words out of Cam\u2019s mouth just reinforced that realization.</p><p>\u2018Let\u2019s go to my mum and dad\u2019s for a weekend.\u2019</p><p>I blinked rapidly, taken aback by the suggestion, ignoring Joss, who was hovering on the edges of our conversation, pretending to fix the napkin holder.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Three weeks from Saturday, it\u2019ll be my Saturday off work. We\u2019ll go then. Stay the night. You, me and Cole.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dude, he wants you to meet the parents,\u2019 Joss said under her breath. \u2018Think carefully before you give him an answer. The parents. Already.\u2019 She shuddered at the thought.</p><p>\u2018Jo?\u2019</p><p>I glanced back at an expectant Cam. \u2018I can\u2019t leave Mum.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can check in on her,\u2019 Joss offered loudly.</p><p>My mouth fell open as I stared at her in total bafflement. I whispered to her, \u2018I thought you just said to think carefully about meeting his parents.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I did. You didn\u2019t say you didn\u2019t want to. You offered up an impediment and I offered up a solution.\u2019 When she turned away I caught the start of a sly grin on her face.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re twisted,\u2019 I hissed.</p><p>Cam flicked the towel at me, bringing my attention back to him. \u2018Well?\u2019</p><p>I smiled tremulously. \u2018Sure. Why not?\u2019</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>18</p><p>For weeks after discovering Mum had hit Cole, I couldn\u2019t go near her, could barely talk to her, and I swam in a muddy pond of bitter resentment and guilt. However, spending my nights with Cam when I could, whether that time involved the best sex of my life, or quiet time reading a book while he and Cole worked on their graphic novel together, changed me. It chipped away at my bitterness.</p><p>The weight I\u2019d always carried on my shoulders hadn\u2019t disappeared completely, but it was lessened. When I walked down the street my steps felt lighter, my breathing easier. I no longer felt old and tired.</p><p>I felt young. Excited. Charmed. Almost ... content.</p><p>I\u2019d also decided to try to relax more about our financial situation. As difficult as that was, I did give in to the expense of sending Cole to judo lessons with Cam. It meant the boys were out on a Saturday morning, one of the few times Cam and I could actually spend time together, but I didn\u2019t care. It sounded so cheesy, but seeing Cole come through that door, smiling at Cam, being happy and having a guy to talk to ... it gave me a kind of peace I never thought I\u2019d have.</p><p>Cameron MacCabe. You charmer, you. You\u2019re changing my life.</p><p>I rested my hand on the parcel I\u2019d just finished wrapping, smiling stupidly as I remembered last night. Well, technically this morning. Both Cam and I had returned from work, feeling more buzzed than tired, and he\u2019d finally taken me against his desk like he\u2019d been promising. It had been slow, sensual, teasing, bloody fantastic sex. I swear I was getting through my days on a rush of endorphins. I think that\u2019s what made it easier to say goodbye to some very pretty things. I stroked the brown paper of the package. Inside was my favourite Donna Karan dress \u2013 one that Malcolm had bought me. It had sold well on eBay and it was time to send it to its new home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Blowing air out between my lips in boredom, I eyed my eBay pile. I\u2019d sold a few things but I still had to take photographs of a couple of items and post them on the site. The profits were paying for Cole\u2019s judo lessons, so it needed to be done. I had to crack on. Next up, a pair of Jimmy Choos. Staring at them, I realized I was going to need one of the boys to help me with this. The gorgeous six-inch heels were made up of a lot of spaghetti ties. Off the feet, they didn\u2019t look like much. On the feet, they looked sexy as all hell. I\u2019d have to be wearing them in the photographs, which meant I\u2019d need someone to take photographs for me.</p><p>Bundling them into my arms, I left Cole\u2019s room and stopped outside Mum\u2019s door. Loud snoring from within assured me everything was normal with her, and I headed out of the flat and downstairs to Cam\u2019s. Cam and Cole had texted me after their judo class to let me know they were going to Cam\u2019s to work on the graphic novel.</p><p>From the sounds of machine-gun fire coming from Cam\u2019s flat I realized I\u2019d been bullshitted. They were playing Call of Duty.</p> <p>I walked in without knocking and slipped quietly into the sitting room. Cam, Cole and Nate were sitting on the couch, Nate and Cole holding the controllers. Peetie was in the armchair directly facing me. I\u2019d met Nate and Peetie a couple of times since Cam had moved in, but I still hadn\u2019t really spent that much time with them, mostly because when they were over they played video games, only really interacting with me when I took the time to feed them snacks.</p><p>Peetie saw me and waved, drawing Cam\u2019s attention. He turned and flashed me a welcoming smile that hit me in the gut, waking up all those annoying little butterflies fluttering around in there. \u2018Hi, baby.\u2019</p><p>I raised an eyebrow at his flatscreen. \u2018This is working on a graphic novel?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nate and Peetie came over with us after class.\u2019 As if that explained everything.</p><p>\u2018Hi, Jo!\u2019 Nate called over the sounds of gunfire, his eyes flicking to me briefly. \u2018Did you bring sandwiches by any chance?\u2019</p> <p>That was me. Sandwich lady. \u2018No.\u2019 I held my shoes up to an inquisitive Cam. \u2018I need you to take a picture of me wearing these.\u2019</p><p>Cameron eyed them and then raised his eyebrows. \u2018Whoa.\u2019 He held up his hands, gesturing to his friends. \u2018Not in front of the boys.\u2019</p><p>I narrowed my eyes on him. \u2018Not that kind of picture, you sex-craved pervert.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Eh, before anyone says anything else,\u2019 Cole interjected loudly, \u2018remember her wee brother is in the room.\u2019</p><p>Cam grinned and stood up. \u2018Is this for eBay?\u2019</p><p>Handing him my camera, I nodded, and then began taking off my shoes and strapping on the Jimmy Choos. Once they were on, I lifted my leg to eye them, turning my ankle to the side, feeling their loss already.</p> <p>\u2018Baby, if you love them that much, keep them.\u2019</p><p>I pouted. \u2018I can\u2019t. They cost a ridiculous amount of money. It would be stupid to keep them.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fuck, man,\u2019 Nate breathed, his attention suddenly on the shoes and my legs. \u2018Don\u2019t let her sell those.\u2019 His heated eyes devoured me. \u2018Those are shit hot.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I will seriously hit you,\u2019 Cam warned him darkly.</p><p>Nate shrugged, threw me a cheeky grin, and turned back to the television screen. \u2018Not my fault your girlfriend is so bloody fuckable.\u2019</p><p>Cole slammed his shoulder into Nate before Cam could retaliate. \u2018Dude, that\u2019s my sister.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And, dude, watch your language.\u2019 I tried not to blush. Ignoring Nate\u2019s unrepentant smile, I turned my feet so Cam could get a good shot of the shoes. My eyes fell on Peetie, who was texting someone. From what Cam had told me, I figured it was probably his fianc\u00e9e, Lyn. Peetie was wrapped around her little finger, apparently. He seemed like a nice guy. A balance to Nate\u2019s unpredictable, blunt, Jack-the-lad persona. Nate was gorgeous \u2013 not rugged sexy like Cam, or rough-around-the-edges hot like Braden. He was movie-star stunning, with his thick black hair and even blacker eyes, and he knew it.</p><p>My gaze moved to Cole, who was starting to look more and more like our father every day. My dad may have been a brute and an asshole, but he\u2019d been a good-looking one. Once Cole realized he was a good-looking kid, it would depend on the influences in his life as to how he would react to it and to girls.</p> <p>I did not want him to become a Nate.</p><p>\u2018I hope you three aren\u2019t corrupting my brother.\u2019</p><p>Nate huffed. \u2018You kidding? If anyone\u2019s doing the corrupting, it\u2019s him.\u2019</p><p>Cole grinned at that and I felt a weird mixture of happiness and worry. Over the last few weeks I\u2019d noticed a difference in him. He still grunted and shrugged a lot and was definitely destined to be broody, but he\u2019d actually begun to converse with people other than Cam and me, and I took that as a good sign. Hanging around Nate, however, might turn him cocky. Or, hey, hanging around Cam might turn him cocky.</p><p>\u2018Done.\u2019 Cam handed me my camera with a quick peck to the lips.</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019 I had just bent to unhook the strap at my ankle, when Cam\u2019s mouth brushed my ear.</p><p>\u2018Be here tonight, waiting for me in nothing but those shoes.\u2019</p><p>My skin flushed hot at the thought and I quickly glanced over at Cole and the boys to make sure they hadn\u2019t heard. They were completely oblivious. My eyes met Cam\u2019s dark gaze and I nodded in agreement.</p><p>A phone buzzed and we reluctantly broke eye contact.</p><p>Cole held up his phone. \u2018Me. I\u2019ve got to go. Guys are waiting for me at the cinema.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019re not finished,\u2019 Nate complained.</p><p>Peetie chuckled. \u2018Nate, mate, when you try to convince a teenager to spend time with you playing video games, it\u2019s time to re-evaluate your life.\u2019</p><p>We laughed, earning us the middle finger from Nate.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll be home in a few hours,\u2019 Cole informed me with a small smile before he left the flat. That smile warmed me up better than a mug of hot chocolate.</p><p>\u2018Actually, you guys should go too.\u2019 Cam moved towards them, making a shooing gesture.</p><p>Peetie stood up with a knowing grin. \u2018Sure, no problem. Lyn wants me to meet her on Princes Street anyway.\u2019</p><p>Grumbling, Nate switched off the console and telly. \u2018You\u2019re both whipped.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did you see the shoes?\u2019 Cam asked smugly, making me blush. If I didn\u2019t know he had plans to screw me imminently, I did now. And so did his friends.</p><p>Nate did some more grumbling, making me blush harder with a \u2018Lucky bastard\u2019.</p><p>\u2018See you soon, Jo.\u2019 Peetie nodded at me as he passed us.</p><p>Punching Cam on the arm, Nate advised, \u2018Watch those heels on your back. Those fuckers can hurt.\u2019</p><p>I groaned in mortification as Cam laughed.</p><p>\u2018Wear protection.\u2019 Nate winked at me. \u2018And have fun, kiddies.\u2019</p><p>As soon as the door shut behind them I glowered at Cam. \u2018We\u2019re not having sex.\u2019</p><p>His mouth fell open. \u2018Why not? I threw them out. We have a couple of hours of uninterrupted sex time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, but now they know that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And what difference does that make?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know. But it makes some kind of difference.\u2019</p><p>Cam cocked his head to the side. \u2018Female logic. It needs its own decipher code.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We should invite Peetie and Lyn out for dinner with us.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, maybe it\u2019s just Jo logic.\u2019 Cam chuckled at me jumping topics on him.</p><p>I shrugged, heading towards the fireplace to pick up a photo frame Cam had on the mantel. It held a photo of him, Nate and Peetie dressed up as superheroes for Halloween. Cam was Batman. Of course he was. \u2018I just thought it would be nice to get to know your friends better. They are like your brothers.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, that sounds good. I\u2019ll talk to him about it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019d say we should invite Nate, but bringing a girl to dinner with his friends might be the kind of signal he wants to avoid sending out to one of his ... companions.\u2019</p><p>Cam grunted. \u2018And you\u2019d be right.\u2019</p><p>Studying the photo of Nate dressed as Iron Man, I frowned. He really was incredibly good-looking. And there was something about him. Behind all the bluster there was something else. It was in his eyes. They were kind. \u2018Is he completely against all relationships? It\u2019s a shame if so.\u2019 I turned to smile softly at Cam. \u2018He really does seem like a nice guy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He is.\u2019 Cam nodded, seeming very serious all of sudden. \u2018But ... he lost someone.\u2019</p><p>An ache pierced my chest as I processed what Cam wasn\u2019t saying. \u2018A girl?\u2019</p><p>Looking away, I could see that whatever it was that had happened had also affected Cam. \u2018It was a while ago, but it changed him.\u2019</p><p>Stunned, I shook my head, looking back at the grinning Nate in the photo. \u2018You just never know what hurts people are living with, do you? We\u2019re all so good at hiding them.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re the master.\u2019</p><p>Yeah, I wasn\u2019t going to disagree with that.</p><p>Lost for a moment, staring at the photo, feeling a deep sympathy for Nate and for the love that had been taken from him, I didn\u2019t hear Cam move until he was standing right behind me. The heat of him, the smell of him, drew me out of my melancholy thoughts and my fingers fell from the picture frame, my body growing hot in anticipation of him.</p><p>His hands rested on my hips for a moment and that was all I needed to feel a quiver of excitement low in my belly. Strong fingers curled into the hem of my jumper and slowly he began to pull it up. The movement demanded that I raise my arms above my head and I did so, the room silent except for our soft breathing and the rustle of clothing. Darkness descended over me for a second as he tugged the jumper up over my head, cool air whispering across my skin, kissing it into goose bumps.</p><p>I shivered, letting my arms fall slowly as my jumper hit the floor.</p><p>Cam\u2019s warm hand grazed my back gently, sweeping my hair over my shoulder. Tenderly, his fingertips brushed my skin, following the strap of my bra down my shoulder and along my upper back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I felt a slight tug and my bra loosened, descending to the floor with Cam\u2019s slight nudging. Another shiver moved through me and my nipples grew tight with arousal. I shifted a little, my underwear rubbing against me, damp with excitement.</p><p>He tortured me with his touch, his deft fingertips skimming my waist, my ribs, the curve of my breasts. I moaned, my head falling back, my back arching, my breasts begging to be touched. My silent pleading was ignored as Cam\u2019s gentle exploration moved down my stomach, his hands coming to a stop on the waistband of my skirt.</p><p>Taking a step closer, so that his front was pressed against my back, Cam hooked his thumbs in the fabric of my skirt and pants and pushed down. Rather than letting them drop, he kept hold of the material with his palms pressed against it, capturing it against my body, as his fingers trailed down my bare skin. He followed the movement, slowly lowering himself to his haunches, his teasing caress coasting down my outer thighs, past my knees, down my calves, until his thumbs brushed my ankles.</p> <p>Struggling to control my breathing, I shakily stepped out of my clothes. His heat rushed back up my body as he stood.</p><p>He stroked the cheeks of my ass and I would have stumbled forward into the mantel if he hadn\u2019t wrapped an arm around my waist, pulling me back into him. Something hard nudged my buttocks and I didn\u2019t need his sudden stutter of breath to tell me it was his arousal.</p><p>Warm lips barely touched my shoulder, and then his arm was gone but not his warmth.</p><p>The sound of a zipper behind me made me slick with anticipation, my breathing growing louder in the quiet of the room. Clothes whispered and I saw his T-shirt fall to the floor out of the corner of my eye, and then the fabric of his jeans was gone against my behind, the throbbing naked heat of his cock digging into the curve of my butt.</p><p>And then that was gone too.</p> <p>Confused, I twisted my head over my shoulder, my gaze dropping to the rug in front of his empty fireplace. Naked, hard, Cam looked up at me with searing eyes. He lay there, knees bent, arms behind him, palms pressed to the floor.</p><p>He held up a hand, not saying a word, and I turned to take it. Positioning myself over him, I blushed, trembling as I stood there with my feet on either side of his hips, so vulnerable and open to him.</p><p>Cam tugged on my hand, and I followed the motion, lowering myself to my knees, the rug a soft pillow against them. Taking his erection in hand, Cam guided it to my entrance, and as I lowered myself farther, he filled me, sliding into my wet channel with a satisfaction that made us both gasp. I clasped his shoulders and eased back up ever so slightly, the delicious friction causing a pool of coiling tension in my lower belly. My lips parted in a delighted exhalation, and my eyes hooked on Cam\u2019s as my hips began to undulate against his in perfect rhythm.</p><p>It was intense, watching the pleasure escalate in his eyes as he watched it in mine. My skin began to burn and I tried to move faster, chasing climax, but Cam slowed me, gripping my hips to falter my movement. His eyes washed over my face, taking in every tiny detail, making me feel more naked than I\u2019d ever felt before.</p><p>I shook my head, silently telling him to stop. His grip on my hips hardened. I couldn\u2019t look away. I wanted to look away. It was so much. Too much. Feeling tears prick my eyes, I leaned forward, crushing my breasts against him, wrapping my arms around his neck, my lips in his hair as I rode him with torturously slow strokes.</p><p>Feeling a gentle tug on my hair, I let him pull me up, my back arching under his hold. Warm, wet heat captured my nipple as he took my right breast into his mouth, his other hand squeezing and fondling the left, pinching my nipple between forefinger and thumb. A cry fell from my lips as a sharp surge of pleasure shot between my legs, and I clutched the nape of his neck tightly, moving faster whether he wanted me to or not.</p> <p>His mouth moved, pressing wet kisses over my breast, and I slammed down on him, needing more, needing everything. He groaned against my skin, his fingers digging into the muscles in my back.</p><p>\u2018Cameron,\u2019 I breathed as the tension built and built, my hips moving faster against his. \u2018I\u2019m close. So close ...\u2019 Wanting his mouth when I came, I tugged gently on his hair, drawing his face up to mine, my lips falling on his, my tongue sliding deep into his mouth for a kiss made up of eroticism, of pure longing.</p><p>The tension snapped inside me. I came with a muffled cry in his mouth, and my muscles momentarily locked around him as my sex clenched his cock, wave after wave of pulsating pleasure cascading over me. I fell against him completely, my forehead on his shoulder as he pumped into me a few times before the wet warmth of his release exploded inside me, his hard grunt in my ear as he came, causing my inner muscles to pulse around him a few more times.</p><p>We stayed there for a good while, wrapped around each other.</p><p>Not saying a word.</p><p>Not needing to.</p><p>Cam groaned. \u2018I have to move in an hour.\u2019</p><p>We were lying on the rug, the faux fur blanket from his couch that Becca had bought as a moving-in gift now thrown over us. My head rested on Cam\u2019s chest, my legs tangled with his, as his fingers teased through my hair.</p> <p>\u2018Boo to work,\u2019 I said with a pout, tracing the tattooed curlicues on his right arm.</p><p>\u2018I know. I could stay here forever.\u2019</p><p>I smiled against his skin, utterly delighted. \u2018You know, the only thing that would make this more perfect would be a real fire in that fireplace.\u2019</p><p>He gave a huff of laughter. \u2018I\u2019ll light some candles next time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Very nice. Has anyone told you you\u2019re a bit of a romantic?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nope. That\u2019s definitely the first time I\u2019ve been called that.\u2019</p><p>Surprised, I tilted my head to look into his face. \u2018Seriously?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Seriously.\u2019 His lips twitched. \u2018You think I\u2019m romantic? Baby, that doesn\u2019t say much for those assholes you\u2019ve dated.\u2019</p><p>I grinned back at him. \u2018Actually, you have your moments.\u2019</p><p>With soft eyes, he gave my shoulder a squeeze. \u2018You make it easy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018See!\u2019 I cried softly, my eyes glittering with utter contentment. \u2018That was romantic.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It was?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes. Surely, you\u2019ve been romantic with ex-girlfriends?\u2019</p><p>Why oh why did I ask that? Did I really want to hear about the ex-girlfriends?</p><p>Thankfully, Cam sidestepped the question. Unfortunately, he sidestepped it by asking one. \u2018So was Malcolm romantic? That Callum guy?\u2019 There was a definite edge to the question, so I thought I\u2019d best tread carefully. But honestly.</p><p>\u2018Callum could be very romantic. All hearts and flowers and shit like that.\u2019</p><p>Cam grunted. \u2018Shit like that?\u2019</p><p>I shrugged, feeling okay talking about it now that I was wrapped in the arms of something real. \u2018Looking back, it all seems fake. We were together two years. He met Cole a few times. Never met Mum. I saw him every other weekend when I could. He sent me flowers, bought me nice things, went all out on Valentine\u2019s Day. I met his parents but knew very little about them. Hung out with some of his friends and knew even less about them. I don\u2019t know if I even knew Callum. I know for a fact he didn\u2019t know me. So, yeah ... shit like that. I\u2019d take hot sex against a desk with a guy who knows exactly what he\u2019s getting into \u2013 pardon the pun \u2013 over flowers and chocolates any day.\u2019</p><p>I chanced a glance up at Cam and saw him smiling widely at me. \u2018I think I\u2019m having an earthy influence on you, Johanna Walker.\u2019</p><p>I grinned back. \u2018I think so too.\u2019</p><p>He rubbed his calf against mine and pulled me even closer. \u2018And Malcolm?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He had his moments. Again, I didn\u2019t know much about him and he seemed happy with that. I knew he had an ex-wife, that his mum had passed away but his dad was alive. He had a brother he was really close with but not close enough with to introduce me. He didn\u2019t know me at all like he thought he did ... but he was a true gentleman.\u2019</p><p>I felt Cam tense beneath me for a second before letting air out between his lips. \u2018You cared about him.\u2019</p><p>After pressing a reassuring kiss to his chest, I nodded.</p><p>That silence fell over us again, the one that seemed so full of words unspoken, so full of emotion, charging the air between us. Understanding what it meant, I felt my chest compress with the gravity of the emotion. To stop myself from saying the words too soon, I stupidly asked what I didn\u2019t want to know. \u2018Have you ever been in love?\u2019</p><p>When he heaved a huge sigh I tried not to react physically, and when he answered quietly, \u2018Yes,\u2019 I tried not to be sick.</p><p>It was stupid, of course, to feel pain in my chest, to feel my stomach flip and my brain scream Noo!!! but I couldn\u2019t help my reaction. Cameron had been in love.</p><p>Taking a moment to make sure my voice was steady, I sucked in another breath and then asked, \u2018When? Who?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do you really want to know this?\u2019 His voice was gruff.</p><p>\u2018If you want to tell me, I want to know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 he answered gently, his hand sliding down my arm in a caress. \u2018It was a long time ago. I met her ten years ago when I was eighteen. Her name was Blair and we met in our first term of uni.\u2019</p><p>Blair.</p><p>And he\u2019d loved her.</p><p>Already I was envisioning some tall, dark-haired beauty with intelligent eyes and cool self-possession like Joss. I pushed those imaginings aside. \u2018What happened?\u2019</p><p>\u2018We were together for three and a half years. I thought we\u2019d get engaged, buy a house, get married, churn out some kids. I thought she was it.\u2019</p><p>Was that a knife he was twisting in my side? I held still, trying to squash the intense jealousy and hurt I felt at his revelation.</p><p>\u2018However, Blair was offered a placement at a university in France to do her postgraduate degree in French literature. So I broke it off with her. I broke it off with her before she could break it off with me because I knew she was going to choose France and she knew I would never leave Scotland. I couldn\u2019t leave my parents or Nate and Peetie behind. She was going to end it, so I just made it easy for her.\u2019</p><p>There was so much in that confession that my throat closed with anxiety. I didn\u2019t say a word, just threaded my fingers through his and waited for the pain to ease. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It didn\u2019t.</p><p>A while later, we showered together and then Cam left me to go to the bar. I found myself heading up to the flat in a fog of absolute despondency. I\u2019d tried to pull myself out of my gloomy mood, giving him easy smiles and soft kisses, telling myself that he had not once given me reason to believe that he wasn\u2019t in this with me, that he didn\u2019t feel what I felt when we were together.</p><p>I\u2019d almost convinced myself as I entered my flat, but when I shut the door I came face-to-face with Mum. She swayed on her bare feet, her nightdress hanging like a sack on her gaunt frame. Her unfocused eyes and unstable feet told me she hadn\u2019t taken it easy with the drink today. Today she\u2019d wanted to get well and truly pissed.</p> <p>\u2018Whereyebeen?\u2019</p><p>Not in the mood to talk to her, I replied shortly, \u2018With Cam,\u2019 and moved past her, on my way to my room.</p><p>\u2018Where\u2019d go?\u2019</p><p>Assuming she was asking where he\u2019d gone, I looked back over my shoulder. \u2018Work.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Bar,\u2019 she scoffed. \u2018Bit of a loser, eh?\u2019</p> <p>Since I worked at the bar too, I tried not to take that personally. \u2018Actually he\u2019s a graphic designer, Mum.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mmph, fancy bugger, eh?\u2019 She gave a wee laugh and headed towards the kitchen. \u2018What the fuck he doing wi\u2019 you?\u2019</p><p>I froze.</p><p>\u2018Get bored wi\u2019 you, wee lass. No smart enough for him.\u2019</p><p>Backtracking up the hall, I hurried into the bathroom and locked myself in, listening to my insecurities eat away at me. They sounded an awful lot like Mum when she was drunk.</p><p>But she was right, wasn\u2019t she?</p> <p>Cam had been in love with a girl who had been intelligent and interesting, heading off to Europe to do a postgraduate degree in French literature.</p><p>He\u2019d been in love with someone who was obviously my complete opposite.</p><p>Worse, it hadn\u2019t ended because he stopped loving her.</p><p>It ended because of his fucked-up abandonment issues.</p><p>I stared in the mirror, searching for something, something interesting, something unique, something that made me someone that Cam needed to be with.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t find anything.</p><p>A sob rose up out of my mouth and I let the tears fall.</p><p>Today I\u2019d fallen in love with Cameron MacCabe. But how could I ever expect him to love me back when I couldn\u2019t find anything in me worth loving?</p> <p>19</p><p>\u2018I have pancakes,\u2019 Helena MacCabe announced brightly, reaching for her husband\u2019s plate. I immediately put my own clean plate on top of Cole\u2019s and grabbed Cameron\u2019s too.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll help.\u2019 I smiled politely.</p><p>Helena and Anderson MacCabe had been nothing but friendly and open with me and Cole since we\u2019d arrived at their house yesterday, but I still couldn\u2019t shake off my nervousness.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just because they were my boyfriend\u2019s parents and I wanted them to like me. It was because they were Cam\u2019s parents \u2013 parents he adored \u2013 and I wanted them to think I was good enough for their son.</p><p>The last week had been strange. At the beginning of the week I\u2019d still felt insecure and weird over Cam\u2019s announcement that he\u2019d been in love with this exotic-sounding Blair person, but since he spent all his spare time with me, and was even affectionate at the bar \u2013 seeming unable to keep his hands off me for more than five seconds \u2013 those insecurities started to fade into the background until finally I was barely even aware of them.</p><p>As Saturday approached, and Cole and I readied ourselves for a night in Longniddry, I grew more and more anxious about meeting Cam\u2019s parents. I confessed this to him and he thought it was adorable. He appeared to be completely confident that they\u2019d like me.</p><p>So was Malcolm.</p><p>We\u2019d still been texting, and on Wednesday he\u2019d called me to talk for the first time since the split. It had been awkward at first, but tension eased between us when he told me he was dating someone. The said someone was older than me and had a kid, and Malcolm felt a little out of his depth with her. I told him to spoil the working mother of one and he\u2019d win her over in no time. He told me to just be myself and I\u2019d win Cam\u2019s parents over in no time. I had got off the phone wondering which \u2018myself\u2019 he was talking about, since I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever introduced him to the real one.</p><p>On Saturday morning Cam had rented a car to drive us out of the city and before I knew it we were driving down the main street of Longniddry, passing quaint cottages with their beach-coloured bricks and red-slate roofs and the local pub, which looked well-frequented, but I hadn\u2019t been able to enjoy the idyllic prettiness. It was a cool spring day and the sun was out and the little village was fairly busy. But me? I was too busy gnawing my lip. Despite both Cam\u2019s and Malcolm\u2019s assurances, little mini-versions of me had started freaking out together in my stomach. I could feel them kicking and screaming in there.</p><p>We turned left at a roundabout, I knew that, and Cam had pointed out the grand red-stone gatehouse to the Gosford estate, babbling on about something his father had told him about it. Cole had replied, so I gathered he was actually listening. I, on the other hand, was just trying not to upchuck.</p><p>When we pulled into a well-groomed housing estate and parked in front of a medium-sized whitewashed house with a red roof, I lost my ability to breathe. Cam laughed at my reaction, giving me a quick, hard kiss before ushering us out of the car and into his parents\u2019 house.</p><p>They had been lovely so far. Helena, or Lena, as she preferred to be called, was warm, kind and dry-witted, and Anderson \u2013 Andy \u2013 was quiet, friendly and genuinely interested in me and Cole. Their dog, Bryn, was an energetic fourteen-month-old King Charles puppy who immediately fell in love with Cole, and vice versa.</p><p>We\u2019d gone to the local inn for lunch together, where we chatted about work, my work, Cam\u2019s work, their work, and Cole\u2019s talent for drawing and writing. I gathered Cam had told them something about Mum because they trod very carefully around the subject. Surprisingly, I didn\u2019t mind if they knew. Cam was obviously close to them and shared a lot about his life with them. If that included me and my life, I could only take that as a good sign for our relationship.</p><p>That night we\u2019d watched some telly with them and Cole had been drawn into a history programme Andy was watching, finding Andy\u2019s knowledge about historical events completely fascinating. He had multitasked, listening to Andy while tormenting the life out of Bryn, who loved every minute of the attention. I\u2019d sat in the kitchen with Cam and his mum while she pulled out old baby photographs that I giggled over. Cam had been a funny-looking pre-adolescent. It was so cute.</p><p>It was all so normal.</p><p>So perfectly ordinary.</p><p>It was wonderful.</p><p>At bedtime, Cole took the couch and Cam and I crashed in his old bedroom. It had been completely preserved from his teen years: posters of bands looking a decade younger plastered over his walls, cutouts from film magazines, as well as his own drawings. Like his sketches now, they consisted of cool little cartoon paradox people. He tended to draw cartoon people in an action that was completely at odds with their physical appearance. I\u2019d stolen one of his recent drawings, sketched on a napkin at work. It was a cartoon mercenary \u2013 big, bulging muscles, leather vest, motorcycle boots, chains, bullet clips strapped around him, headscarf, guns in holsters and a knife tucked into his boots. In his hands was a big open box of chocolates in the shape of a love heart and as he ate them he wore this dreamy, goofy smile on his face. It was now my bookmark.</p><p>Cam\u2019s old room just exploded with his teenage personality and I loved it. I felt like a teenager myself as we began quietly making out on his bed. I\u2019d stopped before it got too hot and heavy, refusing to have sex under his parents\u2019 roof. He had not been pleased by this, but considering that he had the squeakiest mattress on planet earth I would not be moved on the subject.</p><p>Cuddling up with him to just fall asleep had been nice anyway. Sweet. A little bit emotional. Safe.</p><p>I\u2019d woken up contented, to the smell of breakfast.</p><p>After stuffing us with a huge breakfast that included amazing haggis fritters, Lena was now determined to kill us. Or me. The boys looked perfectly happy with the idea of scarfing down pancakes.</p><p>\u2018Maybe I\u2019ll sit these out,\u2019 I told Lena with a wry smile. \u2018I\u2019m pretty full.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nonsense.\u2019 She grinned back at me as she dumped the plates by the sink. \u2018If you can eat all you want and still keep your beautiful figure, then you should.\u2019</p><p>Glowing under her compliment, I rinsed the plates quickly and then put them in the dishwasher. By the time I turned around, Lena had already piled a mound of pancakes on to two plates.</p><p>\u2018Grab the syrups.\u2019 She nodded to the bottles of golden and chocolate syrup.</p><p>I followed her back into the dining room and sat down, watching as everyone dug in, ignoring Bryn, who wandered from one seat to the next, her gorgeous brown eyes begging someone to drop a piece of pancakey goodness. I took one pancake to be polite, tore a piece off, and dangled it surreptitiously under the table. A gentle doggy mouth gobbled it up, licking my fingers for good measure. I immediately reached for one of the napkins in the centre of the table, ignoring Cam\u2019s knowing smile.</p><p>\u2018Cam said he\u2019s applied for a graphics job in the city,\u2019 Andy told Lena as she settled down at her own place.</p><p>\u2018Oh, that\u2019s good, son. What company is it for?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s a website company,\u2019 Cam replied after swallowing a mouthful of food. \u2018It\u2019s not much more money than the bar, but I\u2019d be doing what I enjoy.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And it\u2019s better than having to commute to Glasgow or move down south,\u2019 I added, my chest squeezing at the thought of Cam leaving.</p><p>\u2018True,\u2019 Lena agreed.</p><p>\u2018I won\u2019t be moving,\u2019 Cam assured us \u2013 or me, rather, smiling at me with heat in his eyes that was unbelievably embarrassing in front of his parents. \u2018I like my neighbours too much.\u2019</p><p>I blushed, smiling.</p><p>\u2018Dude,\u2019 Cole muttered, shaking his head.</p><p>\u2018What do you mean, dude?\u2019 Cam asked, affronted that Cole had insinuated he wasn\u2019t cool. \u2018That was as smooth as you get, bud.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Aye.\u2019 Andy nodded, cutting a hearty bite of pancake soaked in syrup as he winked at his wife. \u2018Learned it from the best.\u2019</p><p>Before we left for the day we decided to take Bryn to the beach. It wasn\u2019t a perfect beach. It was typical of the area, covered in pebbles, mussels, icky seaweed and seagulls. Bryn immediately took off after the gulls, diving into the cold water without a care, doggy tongue dangling from her mouth in absolute delight. It was cute that she thought the seagulls were playing with her when in truth they were barely aware of her presence until she yipped at them to say hello and frightened them into moving along. Almost like what Braden must have thought of me when we first met. I\u2019d gushed all over him like an idiot, so determined to land the perfect man that I\u2019d been blind to his infatuation with Joss.</p><p>As I strolled with Andy at my side, Lena, Cole and Cam off in front, playing with Bryn, I wondered who that person was that had acted like such a fool over a guy. I didn\u2019t recognize her. I didn\u2019t know her and I never wanted to meet her ever again.</p> <p>Thanks to Cam, I didn\u2019t think there was a remote possibility that I would.</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s happy,\u2019 Andy suddenly said, his voice low so it wouldn\u2019t carry on the wind that was whipping my hair past my cheeks.</p><p>I tucked it behind my ear, throwing him a quizzical look. \u2018Cameron?\u2019</p><p>Andy nodded, giving me a smile, one that reached his eyes, one that was full of a surprising amount of affection. \u2018I knew from the way he spoke about you on the phone that you were different. Meeting you, though, seeing you together, I know.\u2019</p><p>Confused, I slowed down while my heart sped up. \u2018Know what?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018My son has always been a private person. He has his family and Nathaniel and Gregor, and that\u2019s always been enough for him. There have been girlfriends, obviously, ones he was close to, but he\u2019s always kept his circle tight, excluding them and not even realizing it.\u2019 Andy grinned again, his eyes on Cam, who was walking with his arm wrapped around his mum\u2019s shoulders, grinning down into her face. \u2018Not you, though. You\u2019re in. And Cameron is ... well, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen him this happy.\u2019</p><p>My heart lurched, my breath stuttering as I focused on Cam, loving the way he moved, powerful, at ease with himself, confident. Not to mention his easy affection with people, his ability to reveal how he felt about someone without caring what anyone else thought. \u2018You think?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yup.\u2019 Andy nudged me with his shoulder, a move Cameron had obviously unconsciously developed from watching his dad. \u2018I\u2019m glad he met you, Johanna.\u2019</p><p>All the tension melted out of my shoulders and I relaxed. \u2018Me too,\u2019 I whispered, unable to mask my feelings.</p><p>Before Andy could ask me whatever probing question was brimming in his eyes, my phone rang. I apologized and tugged it out of my jacket pocket. It was Joss.</p><p>My heart stopped.</p> <p>Mum?</p><p>\u2018Hello?\u2019 I answered a little breathlessly.</p><p>\u2018Hey, you.\u2019 Joss\u2019s voice was quiet, unsteady.</p><p>I felt sick. \u2018Is everything okay? Is Mum okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018God, yes.\u2019 She hurried to reassure me. \u2018I\u2019m actually calling to tell you something.\u2019</p><p>That sounded slightly ominous. \u2018Something?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well ... Braden proposed to me yesterday.\u2019</p><p>WHAT? \u2018Oh, my God.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I said yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 I laughed happily, hearing her throaty and quite obviously pleased chuckle on the other end of the line. \u2018I\u2019m so happy for you! Congratulations, hon, and tell Braden I said \u201cabout time\u201d!\u2019</p><p>Her laughter warmed my frozen cheeks. \u2018I will. Look, Ellie is already planning a dreaded engagement party, so, um, we\u2019ll talk when you get back. Hope \u201cmeeting the parents weekend\u201d has gone well.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Very well. Not as well as your weekend, obviously.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah. Well, he paid a cab driver to be in on it and he proposed in Bruntsfield in the cab just where we met. He pulled out a ring, told me he loved me and that he\u2019d try not to fuck it up if I tried not to fuck it up, so how could I say no?\u2019</p><p>I snorted. \u2018You couldn\u2019t. Sounds like the perfect proposal for you.\u2019</p><p>Her voice softened. \u2018Yeah, it kind of was.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So happy for you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Thanks, Jo. I\u2019ll see you soon?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Soon.\u2019</p><p>We hung up and Andy looked at me with a quirked eyebrow. \u2018Good news?\u2019</p><p>I nodded. \u2018My best friend just got engaged. She doesn\u2019t have any family of her own, so this is amazing for her.\u2019 Suddenly tears pricked my eyes at the thought of everything Joss was gaining, and I laughed a little weepily, feeling like an idiot.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 Cam approached, his eyebrows drawn together in a glower. \u2018Why are you upset?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not upset.\u2019 I waved him off with a goofy smile and held up my phone. \u2018That was Joss. She and Braden just got engaged.\u2019</p><p>Cam grinned, hooking an arm around my neck to draw me into his side. \u2018Come here, sappy girl. The brisk coastal wind will dry those tears.\u2019</p><p>I cuddled into him. \u2018Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s great news?\u2019</p><p>He nodded, his eyes bright on me. \u2018I think it\u2019s brilliant news. She\u2019s a good girl, deserves to be happy.\u2019</p><p>God, he was lovely sometimes.</p><p>\u2018And Braden is a brave man. I\u2019ll need to buy him a pint when we get back.\u2019</p><p>Andy grunted at our side. \u2018A pint for a soldier going off to war.\u2019</p><p>Cam\u2019s shoulders shook beneath my head. \u2018Exactly.\u2019</p><p>\u2018For a general surveying his battlefield and using logic against an illogical foe.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yep.\u2019</p><p>\u2018For a warrior about to head into the mouth of the dragon\u2019s cave.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Definitely.\u2019</p><p>\u2018For \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, okay, funny men,\u2019 I interrupted with a huff. \u2018Who needs a coastal wind to dry the eyes when I\u2019m in the presence of the MacCabe sense of humour?\u2019</p><p>Andy shot me a wry smile and then turned a full-blown grin on Cam as we drew closer to Cole, Lena and Bryn. \u2018You better keep this one, son.\u2019</p><p>20</p><p>\u2018Hello, beautiful.\u2019 A deep, familiar voice brought my head up from the letter I was shoving into an envelope.</p><p>Greeted by the sight of Malcolm standing in the doorway to Mr Meikle\u2019s reception area, I smiled. My heart thudded a little faster as he smiled back affectionately, all class and polish in his designer suit. \u2018Malcolm,\u2019 I replied warmly.</p><p>His dark eyes glittered as he strolled casually into the room towards me. \u2018It\u2019s good to see you.\u2019</p><p>I stayed frozen awkwardly in place for a moment as I decided what I should do, how I should greet him. Malcolm waited on the other side of my desk, his eyebrows raised in question.</p><p>After seeing his name on the appointment sheet today, I\u2019d felt my stomach start to do flips. We\u2019d been texting, but this would be the first time we\u2019d seen each other in person since the break-up. Now that he was here in front of me, I didn\u2019t know how to react.</p><p>Laughing a little at my own nervousness, I pushed back from the desk and rounded it, my arms open. He immediately drew me into a tight hug that I reciprocated, surprised by how glad I was to see him. I had to pull away, however, when his hands started sliding slowly down my back. My cheeks were flushed with guilt for letting Malcolm get close enough to touch me in any way that was remotely more than friendly.</p><p>It had been two weeks since the Saturday with Cam\u2019s parents and Cam and I had been dating each other for just over six weeks. Six weeks didn\u2019t sound like long, but it felt like forever. Long enough for me to know that this was the kind of flirtatious interaction with another guy that would piss my boyfriend off.</p><p>\u2018You look good.\u2019 I gave him another quick smile to cover my abrupt departure from the hug.</p><p>\u2018You too. I take it you\u2019re well?\u2019</p><p>I nodded, and sat back in my chair, looking up at him with genuine interest. \u2018And you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes. I\u2019m good. You know me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And how\u2019s your single mother of one?\u2019</p><p>He laughed drily. \u2018Ah, over. We didn\u2019t quite fit.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And Cameron?\u2019</p><p>My cheeks heated again and I had to force myself to meet his eyes. \u2018He\u2019s good.\u2019</p><p>Malcolm frowned. \u2018Still taking care of you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He is.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good.\u2019 He blew air out between his lips, glancing around, I think attempting to appear casual. \u2018I take it he\u2019s met Cole and your mum?\u2019</p><p>Crap. More guilt washed over me and I found myself choking on the answer. I suddenly felt panicked that if I told him the truth, that Cam knew more about my life than I had ever let Malcolm know, I would hurt this man even more than I already had.</p><p>My silence at his question seemed to provide my answer. His eyes dimmed as he watched me. \u2018I\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Malcolm!\u2019 Mr Meikle boomed as he threw his office door open. \u2018Joanne didn\u2019t tell me you\u2019d arrived. Come in, come in.\u2019</p><p>It was the first time I\u2019d ever been grateful to my harsh employer. He\u2019d saved me from having to answer to that wounded look on Malcolm\u2019s face.</p><p>The entire time Malcolm was in Meikle\u2019s office I watched the door like a hawk, chewing on my lip, my knee bouncing up and down with my anxiety as I waited for him to reappear. I spent twenty minutes building myself up to his reaction and in the end he walked out the door, threw me a casual smile, and told me he\u2019d talk to me soon. Then he left.</p><p>I wilted against my chair, the tension draining from my body.</p><p>\u2018Johanna.\u2019</p><p>I snapped around, surprised not only that Mr Meikle had got my name correct but also that he had uttered it in a tone that was scathing, even for him. He stood in his doorway, his eyes narrowed on me, his expression almost incredulous. \u2018Sir?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You broke up with Malcolm Hendry?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My fingernails bit into the palm of my hands at the inappropriate question while my brain cursed Malcolm to hell. \u2018Sir.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You silly girl.\u2019 He shook his head, almost as if he felt sorry for me. My heart began to thump in preparation for the insult I knew was coming, my blood already heating with anger. \u2018A girl with your limited talents should think more carefully in future before throwing away the opportunity to attach yourself to an affluent man like Malcolm Hendry.\u2019</p><p>His unkind attack slapped me back into the past.</p> <p>\u2018Get out of my way!\u2019 Dad bellowed, kicking out at me, catching my buttocks with his work boot as I passed. I stumbled, humiliation and pain making me whirl around and glare at him in defiance. His face darkened and he took a menacing step towards me. \u2018Dinnae you look at me like that. Dinnae you! You\u2019re nothing. Absolutely worthless.\u2019</p><p>The memory, summoned by Mr Meikle\u2019s condescension, pinned me in my seat. My skin grew hot with renewed humiliation. It\u2019s hard to believe you\u2019re anything but worthless when a parent spends most of your formative years telling you you\u2019re useless. A big nothing. I knew I\u2019d carried that with me. It didn\u2019t take a genius to understand why I had such low self-esteem, or why I had very little belief in myself.</p><p>Or why I probably never would.</p><p>However, I\u2019d grown so used to thinking that way about myself that when others thought it too it didn\u2019t seem wrong. Although Joss had spent the last few months attempting to make me see that it was wrong, it had never fully got through to me.</p><p>Until Cameron.</p> <p>He wanted me to demand more of myself. He got angry when I didn\u2019t, and furious when other people belittled me. He told me in little ways almost every day that he thought I was special. He chipped away at my insecurities about my intelligence, my personality, and although they were still there, they had been suppressed by his support. Every day they were squashed deeper and deeper into the caverns of my worries.</p><p>Cam said I was more.</p><p>How dare anyone who didn\u2019t know me at all try to tell me I was less.</p><p>I pushed back from my desk, my chair careening into the metal filing shelves behind me with the force of the action. \u2018I quit.\u2019</p><p>Mr Meikle blinked rapidly, the colour on his cheeks deepening to a rosy red. \u2018Pardon?\u2019</p><p>Glowering at him, I pulled my bag up off the floor and yanked my jacket off the coat stand near my desk. Standing in the doorway to his reception area, I kept my eyes on him in defiance as I put my jacket on. \u2018I said, I quit. Find someone else to hiss at with your viperous tongue, you short old windbag.\u2019</p> <p>I spun around on trembling legs and left him spluttering in my wake as I hurried out the door, down the stairs, and out the main entrance. Adrenaline pumped through me as I marched down the street fuelled by ire and self-righteous indignation.</p><p>Cool air blew through my hair and across my cheeks until the fire began to wane and my trembling increased.</p><p>I\u2019d just quit my job.</p><p>The job Cole and I needed.</p><p>The breath whooshed out of me and I stumbled against a wrought-iron fence, struggling to get air into my lungs. What were we going to do? We couldn\u2019t survive on my wages from the bar, and jobs weren\u2019t exactly easy to come by. I had some money put away, but that money was for Cole, not for me to burn through while I tried to find a new job.</p><p>\u2018Oh, fuck,\u2019 I muttered, tears pricking the corners of my eyes as I pushed myself off the fence, looking back the way I\u2019d come. I could feel the eyes of passers-by on my face, as they sensed my distress and probably wondered if I needed help. \u2018I need to go back.\u2019 I took two steps back towards the office, then stopped, clenching my fists at my sides.</p><p>I was halted by pride.</p><p>Me? Halted by pride?</p> <p>I gave a huff of hysterical laughter and clutched my stomach, fighting the urge to be sick.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t go back. Meikle wouldn\u2019t even take me back after what I\u2019d just said to him.</p><p>\u2018Oh, God.\u2019 I pushed a shaking hand through my hair, gulping in as much air as I could.</p><p>And then it hit me.</p><p>This was Cam\u2019s fault.</p><p>My attraction to him had caused me to dump a wealthy, kind, handsome man who I knew cared about me. And now I\u2019d quit my job! And for what? Because Cameron was charming enough to make me feel special, to make me feel better about myself? What about something real? What about telling me he loved me, huh?</p><p>It had been only six weeks, but I knew I loved him. Shouldn\u2019t he know he loved me? It wasn\u2019t like he wasn\u2019t capable of it. He\u2019d fucking loved Blair!</p><p>More tears trembled on my eyelashes. I was mucking up my life because of him. Making impulsive, stupid decisions that were going to wreck any hope of a financially secure future for Cole.</p><p>Oh, God ... Cole.</p><p>I\u2019d let him get close to Cole too.</p><p>Who did that?</p><p>Who played Russian roulette not only with their own emotions but with their bloody kid\u2019s?</p><p>I had to do something. Quickly. I needed space. Time to re-evaluate before it was too late.</p><p>I needed to see Cam.</p><p>Despite my alarming pace, the usually forty-minute distance that I covered in twenty-five minutes still seemed to take forever, and I had to stop myself from walking down to Joss\u2019s flat on Dublin Street when I passed it. Perhaps talking this over with a friend would help, would clear up all my confusion, but I feared that Joss, who was Team Cameron, would only convince me I was being hysterical.</p><p>And maybe I was.</p><p>In fact, somewhere inside, I was pretty sure I was, but right now the anger and panic were overruling logic.</p><p>Logic that Joss probably would have used to talk me round. But Joss was hiding out from Ellie at the moment because Els had gone overboard with plans for the engagement party that was to take place in two weeks. With her brain ready to explode from Ellie in celebration mode, Joss had told me the other night at work that she had taken to not answering her door during the day. Five weeks of planning for a party? If I were Joss I\u2019d be in hiding too.</p><p>With no one to talk me down and my emotions rocketing all over the place, I stormed into my building and stomped up the stairs, breathless by the time I reached Cam\u2019s flat. I may have pounded on his door harder than was necessary.</p><p>\u2018Jesus Chr\u2013\u2019 Cam cut his words short at the sight of me as he opened the door to find me there, dishevelled and out of breath. \u2018Jo? What are you \u2013 why aren\u2019t you at work?\u2019</p><p>My eyes skimmed over him. He was kind of dressed up for Cam. The Diesel T-shirt he wore looked new and was a little more tight-fitting than his usual tees, sculpting the lean lines of muscle in his strong body. And were those new jeans? My eyes dropped to the black Levi\u2019s and I was almost relieved to see he was wearing his scuffed black engineer boots. Why was he semi-dressed up?</p><p>He looked hot.</p><p>It was such a turn-on when he gazed at me with those warm blue eyes, even when they were all worried and concerned as they were now. \u2018Jo?\u2019 He stepped out of his flat, reaching for me.</p><p>I wanted to lean into him, to let him hold me against him, to breathe him in, to feel his lips on my skin. I wanted that forever.</p><p>No, dammit! I drew back, taking him by surprise. I needed space. Every time I was near him, he just befuddled my brain.</p><p>He frowned, dropping his arm. \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019</p><p>I suddenly had an overwhelming desire to start crying. I held it at bay and looked anywhere but at him. \u2018I quit my job.\u2019</p><p>Silence fell between us for a moment and then he replied, \u2018That\u2019s good.\u2019</p><p>My glare skewered him to the wall behind him. \u2018No. It\u2019s not good. It\u2019s not bloody good, Cam.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay, baby, calm down. Obviously something has happened.\u2019 He sighed heavily and ran a hand through his hair. \u2018And I\u2019m about to make it either better or worse. I need to tell you something.\u2019</p><p>Shaking my head, I took a step up the stairs that would lead me to my flat. \u2018I don\u2019t want to know. Cam\u2019 \u2013 I took a deep breath, reaching far inside me for the strength to say it \u2013 \u2018I need space to think.\u2019</p><p>He looked stunned, almost like I\u2019d hit him. \u2018Space?\u2019</p><p>I nodded, chewing my lip to hell.</p><p>And then Cam\u2019s eyes darkened, his whole expression growing taut with coming anger. I began to gnaw my lip as he took a menacing step towards me. \u2018Space from me?\u2019</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u2018Fuck that shit,\u2019 he growled, his hands reaching for me before drawing back with restraint. \u2018What the hell happened today?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You did,\u2019 I replied as calmly as I could.</p><p>His eyes only blazed bluer. Apparently my being calm only exacerbated his anger. \u2018Me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I keep making these rash decisions and being completely selfish and that\u2019s not fair to Cole.\u2019</p><p>Cam screwed up his face. \u2018Rash decisions? Am I a fucking rash decision? Is that what you\u2019re saying?\u2019</p><p>\u2018No!\u2019 I cried, aghast at the hurt in his eyes. \u2018No. I don\u2019t know.\u2019 I threw up my hands, so confused I just wanted the floor to open up and swallow me whole. \u2018Are you? Are we? I mean what are we doing here? I keep expecting \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Expecting what?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You to just wake up one day, realize you\u2019re bored out of your skull, and end it.\u2019</p><p>A very tense silence fell between us again, and I watched with growing nervousness as Cam struggled to control his frustration. Finally he met my gaze and asked quietly, \u2018Have I ever given you that impression? That I\u2019m just messing around? I took you to meet my parents, for Christ\u2019s sake, not to mention what I\u2019ve just done today. That bullshit is in your head and I didn\u2019t put it there, so what is going on?\u2019</p><p>I threw up my hands again, tears glistening in my eyes. \u2018I don\u2019t know. I quit my job and being angry at me only took me so far, so I had to be angry at you! And I\u2019m on my period, so I might be a little emotional.\u2019 I sucked back tears.</p><p>His lips twitched now, the anger easing from his expression.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not funny!\u2019 I stomped my foot like a petulant child.</p><p>With a grunt, Cam answered by hauling me off the stairs and into his arms. I automatically wrapped my arms around him and buried my burning face in his neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018No more talk about needing space?\u2019 he asked hoarsely, his warm breath on my ear.</p><p>I nodded in agreement and his arms tightened.</p><p>\u2018Why did you quit?\u2019</p> <p>I pulled back and he eased me to my feet, although he didn\u2019t let go of me. Now that I was this close to him I didn\u2019t want to let go either.</p><p>Jesus, I was such a mess.</p><p>\u2018He found out I dumped Malcolm and he said some horrible things to me.\u2019</p><p>Cam\u2019s face clouded over. \u2018What horrible things?\u2019</p><p>I shrugged. \u2018Basically he said I was stupid for dumping a rich man when that was about as good as my life would get.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m going to kill him. First, you\u2019re going to report him for misconduct, and then I\u2019m going to kill him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want anything else to do with him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jo, he crossed a line.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, he did. But I don\u2019t have the luxury of time to go through the rigmarole of seeing him brought to some kind of meagre justice. I have to find a job.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Braden.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nope.\u2019 I pinched my lips together.</p> <p>Cam shook his head. \u2018You are so bloody stubborn.\u2019 And then he kissed my pinched mouth open, his lips light at first and then pressing harder, drawing me deeper into his demand for more.</p><p>When he finally let me up for breath, his expression was almost pained. \u2018Don\u2019t do that to me again, okay?\u2019</p><p>Feeling ashamed of my behaviour, and vowing to be absolutely sure about a decision before throwing something as important as a break-up Cam\u2019s way, I pressed another kiss to his lips, my hands cupping his bristly cheeks tenderly, hoping he understood more in that kiss than I was willing to say. \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 I whispered.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re forgiven.\u2019 He squeezed my waist.</p><p>Smoothing my hands down his new T-shirt, I puckered my brows in thought. \u2018Why are you dressed up? And what did you mean \u201cnot to mention what I\u2019ve just done today\u201d?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ah.\u2019 Cam pushed me back a little. \u2018There\u2019s someone here to see you.\u2019</p><p>21</p><p>You would think that after witnessing my crazy emotional drama Cam would have been considerate enough to prepare me for who was in his flat waiting for me.</p> <p>But no.</p><p>He wanted it to be a surprise.</p><p>Feeling a little nervous about whatever unknown thing awaited me, I followed him into his sitting room.</p><p>My eyes immediately were drawn to a young woman rising from Cam\u2019s couch. Shorter than me but taller than Joss, she stood there, all curves and ass and amazing hair. For some reason, my immediate thought was that this was Blair. I stared into exceptionally light hazel eyes, so light they were almost gold, and felt my throat close up. Some might say the woman was slightly overweight, but all I processed was the big boobs and curvy ass, which looked good on her. Her jet-black hair cascaded down her back in an amazing riot of soft waves. Thinking this woman was Blair, and hating her on sight, I didn\u2019t realize for a while that the rest of her features were kind of plain. Her hair, eyes and figure gave the impression of extraordinary.</p><p>Then she smiled.</p><p>She had a knee-knockingly great smile. \u2018Jo?\u2019</p><p>And an American accent.</p><p>Uh ... what?</p><p>\u2018Johanna?\u2019</p><p>The gruff voice drew my gaze to the left, and my eyes widened at the sight of the large man standing next to Cam\u2019s fireplace. The weight of his light hazel eyes on me made me stagger back in shock. I\u2019d been so consumed with jealousy, thinking the woman was Blair, that it hadn\u2019t even registered how familiar those exotic eyes were.</p><p>\u2018Uncle Mick?\u2019 I breathed in shock, my eyes running the length of him.</p><p>He looked older now, grey peppering his dark hair and beard, but it was him. A tower of a man, standing at six and a half feet tall with huge shoulders, he still looked as fit and healthy as he had eleven years ago. Everyone had always said Uncle Mick was built like a brick shithouse. He still was.</p><p>What was he doing here?</p><p>\u2018Jo.\u2019 He shook his head, giving me a grin that made me feel homesick. \u2018I always knew you\u2019d be a knockout, lass, but just look at you.\u2019 His accent threw me for a moment, the sharp, abrupt inflection of Scots softened slightly in certain words by an American drawl. His accent was Joss\u2019s in reverse.</p><p>Still dumbstruck, I could only say his name again. \u2018Uncle Mick?\u2019 I glanced back at Cam, my mouth open in wonder, my heart in my throat. \u2018What is going on?\u2019</p><p>Cam stepped forward and took my hand in reassurance. \u2018You told me Mick\u2019s surname, that he\u2019d moved to Arizona, and you showed me old photographs. Mick has a Facebook account, and I tracked him down on there.\u2019</p><p>Facebook? I looked back at Mick incredulously, still not believing he was here. Everything that had been good about my life as a child was standing in front of me and I didn\u2019t know whether I wanted to run facefirst into his chest or turn on my heel and flee.</p><p>\u2018Cam and I got to talking and he told me how difficult things have been for you, darling. I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019 Mick\u2019s voice was low, as though he were talking to a frightened animal. \u2018I\u2019m so sorry I wasn\u2019t here.\u2019</p><p>I gulped and for the hundredth time that day tried desperately not to cry. \u2018Why are you here?\u2019</p><p>\u2018We came back a few years ago to Paisley for a short visit, but no one knew where you\u2019d gone. I saw your dad.\u2019</p><p>I winced at the thought of my father. \u2018He\u2019s still there, then?\u2019</p><p>Mick nodded, taking a step towards me. \u2018I\u2019m glad Fiona got you away from him. I\u2019m glad he has no clue where you went and is too stupid to find you.\u2019</p><p>I felt my nose sting with the tears I could no longer hold back. \u2018So you came all the way here to see me?\u2019</p><p>He grinned. \u2018You\u2019re worth the plane ticket, baby girl.\u2019</p><p>Baby girl. He\u2019d always called me that and I\u2019d loved it. It was why I called Cole \u2018baby boy\u2019. The sob rose out of my mouth before I could stop it, and seemingly done with being patient, Uncle Mick made a rough noise and crossed the room to pull me into a bear hug. I hugged him back, breathing him in. Mick had never been one for aftershave. He\u2019d always smelled of soap and earth. The ache in my chest intensified as I reverted to a ten-year-old in his arms.</p><p>We stood together for a good while, until my crying finally trailed off, and then Mick eased me back, his light eyes \u2013 eyes I\u2019d loved more than any other eyes in the world until Cole came along \u2013 were bright on me. \u2018I\u2019ve missed you.\u2019</p><p>I laughed in an attempt to curb another crying jag. \u2018Missed you, too.\u2019</p><p>Clearing his throat and shifting uncomfortably under the weight of emotion between us, Mick turned to look back at the young woman. Although he introduced her, I no longer needed to be told who she was. Her eyes gave her away. \u2018Jo, this is Olivia, my daughter.\u2019</p><p>Olivia\u2019s eyes were shining with tears as she took a step towards me. \u2018It\u2019s nice to meet you, Jo. Dad has been talking about you for years, so I almost feel like I know you. God, was that as clich\u00e9 as it sounded?\u2019</p><p>I smiled weakly, not quite sure how I felt about her. Watching the way Uncle Mick gazed adoringly at his daughter, I was happy for him. Happy he\u2019d found his own family. But the thirteen-year-old girl inside me resented Olivia \u2013 resented her for being what had taken Mick away in the first place.</p><p>I tried to quash that feeling, knowing it was useless and childish and petty, but it was there no matter how much I didn\u2019t want it to be.</p><p>\u2018After coming to Paisley and not finding you, we tried Facebook too, but you don\u2019t have an account. We thought we\u2019d found Cole, but we couldn\u2019t be sure, and Dad was worried that you didn\u2019t want to hear from him anyway.\u2019</p><p>I looked up at Mick, my hand curling on his arm. \u2018I\u2019m sorry for losing touch. It was childish.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Baby girl, you were just a child.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cam was pretty sure you\u2019d want to see Dad.\u2019 Olivia smiled gratefully behind me and I turned to face Cameron.</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t believe you did this,\u2019 I whispered softly, knowing and not caring at the moment that everything I felt for him was shimmering in my eyes.</p><p>Cam\u2019s knuckles brushed along my jaw affectionately. \u2018Happy?\u2019</p><p>I nodded, choking on the lump in my throat. I was happy. Just having Mick in the room ... I felt safe.</p><p>We settled around Cam\u2019s coffee table while he made us refreshments. I sat between Mick and Olivia, surprised by Olivia\u2019s friendliness and enthusiasm. I\u2019d have thought she\u2019d be mad at me for having had her dad for the first thirteen years of our lives, but she seemed anything but mad. She seemed glad for her dad that they had found me.</p><p>\u2018How long are you staying?\u2019 I asked Mick as he relaxed against the cushions, his long arm draping across the back of the sofa behind me.</p><p>His eyes drifted to Olivia as he replied, \u2018We don\u2019t know yet.\u2019</p><p>When Cam rejoined us the questions just started pouring out of my mouth.</p><p>I was saddened by some of the answers and my resentment towards Olivia began to diminish. I wasn\u2019t the only one who hadn\u2019t had it easy.</p><p>Mick had moved to Phoenix to get to know his daughter, and there his affair with her mother, Yvonne, rekindled. Mick worked for a few contractors over there, he and Yvonne got married, and they were a happy family. Until Yvonne was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer. She passed away three years ago, leaving Olivia and Mick all alone in the world. Yvonne\u2019s mother and sister lived in New Mexico, but they weren\u2019t that close to them.</p><p>\u2018We thought of Cameron\u2019s e-mails as a sign,\u2019 Olivia told me quietly. \u2018Perhaps we just need a break from Arizona ...\u2019 She shrugged. \u2018It just seemed like the right thing to do to come here and see you and take a breath.\u2019</p><p>I frowned. \u2018But what about your lives there? Uncle Mick\u2019s business? Your job?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Things haven\u2019t been the same for us in Phoenix for a long time,\u2019 Mick replied softly. \u2018We both thought a break might do us good.\u2019 I gathered from the sadness buried in the back of his eyes, he meant things hadn\u2019t been the same for them since Yvonne\u2019s death. Mick smiled softly down at me. \u2018Do you fancy coming on a wee walk with me, Jo? We\u2019ll talk.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was the most bizarre day. I walked by Mick\u2019s mammoth side and for the first time in my adult life I felt physically small. He kept close to me, but I could see his eyes drinking everything in as we strolled all the way to Leith Walk and continued on to Princes Street. Uncle Mick stared at the Balmoral Hotel across the road from us as we passed it.</p><p>\u2018I missed this place. Edinburgh wasn\u2019t even my city and I missed it. I missed everything here.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t imagine anywhere more different from Scotland than Arizona.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yeah. Ain\u2019t that the truth.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You were happy, though?\u2019</p><p>I felt his eyes return to my face as we dodged the busy foot traffic. As soon as we were side by side again he began to speak. \u2018When I had Yvonne and Olivia, aye, I was happy. But there wasn\u2019t a day that I didn\u2019t think about you, Cole and Fiona. I have two regrets in life, Jo. One is missing out on the first thirteen years of Olivia\u2019s life, and the second is not being there for you when you needed me. Especially now that I know what you\u2019ve been going through.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Did Cam tell you everything, then?\u2019</p><p>\u2018He told me about Fiona. How hard you\u2019ve had to work. He told me you\u2019ve raised Cole and that he\u2019s a good kid. Things have been tough, but I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve found someone who cares about you, baby girl.\u2019</p> <p>Remembering my earlier freak-out at Cam, I felt another rainfall of guilt begin to drop on my head. I had to make it up to him.</p><p>\u2018I would like to see Fiona.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I need to see for myself. She was never the easiest person, but she was my friend.\u2019</p><p>I sighed, wondering what kind of drama Mick\u2019s appearance would kick off in my tiny flat. However, the man had flown thousands of miles to see us. I couldn\u2019t say no. \u2018All right.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And I\u2019d like to meet Cole.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Okay.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t how long we\u2019re going to be here, but I\u2019d like to spend as much time as possible with you.\u2019</p><p>I threw him a wry but worried grin. \u2018That shouldn\u2019t be a problem, since I quit my job today.\u2019</p><p>Curled up in Cam\u2019s lap on his couch, I stared at his television in silence.</p><p>Uncle Mick and Olivia had left as soon as we returned to Cam\u2019s, and not long after that Cole had arrived home and I\u2019d had to explain everything to him.</p><p>Cam had insisted we have dinner with him and when I\u2019d got up to leave so Cole could shower and do his homework, Cam had insisted even harder that we stay. Since I still wasn\u2019t happy leaving Cole alone in the flat with Mum for any length of time, I\u2019d agreed to stay as long as Cole took his shower at Cam\u2019s.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019ve hardly said a word.\u2019 Cam suddenly spoke up, his fingers trailing a lazy caress down my arm. \u2018Earlier you said you were happy I contacted them. Are you still happy?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aye,\u2019 I assured him. \u2018I feel a kind of peace knowing that he\u2019s okay. And Olivia seems nice.\u2019 I twisted my neck to look into his eyes. \u2018Thank you.\u2019</p> <p>He shrugged and looked back at the telly. \u2018I just want to make you happy.\u2019</p><p>My stomach rolled out another somersault. \u2018You do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really? The earlier drama was definitely just an emotional ... female ... thing ... ?\u2019</p><p>I wanted to laugh, but in the end the crap I\u2019d pulled out in the hall wasn\u2019t funny. \u2018I\u2019m sorry for doing that. It wasn\u2019t nice. I was pissed off at Meikle and at myself and I twisted it all in my head so I could blame someone else. Someone more accessible to my rage.\u2019</p><p>Cam grunted. \u2018So naturally that someone is me?\u2019</p><p>I stroked his chest affectionately. \u2018Sorry.\u2019</p><p>He looked down at me carefully. \u2018Would this be a bad time to tell you I got a job?\u2019</p><p>Taken aback, I pushed up off of him. \u2018In graphic design?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019</p><p>Delight for him surged through me and I found myself grinning like an idiot. \u2018Where?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Here. I got my old job back. Their restructuring hasn\u2019t gone over well and they realized they\u2019d left themselves a man short. They can\u2019t handle the workload without another designer. My boss put in a good word for me.\u2019 He shrugged. \u2018It\u2019s a gamble to go back with them, but it pays well and I\u2019d be doing what I love to do.\u2019</p><p>I leaned into him, placing a soft kiss on his mouth. \u2018Cam, I\u2019m so pleased for you. When do you go back?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Monday.\u2019 His arm tightened around me. \u2018Su\u2019s unhappy with me for not giving two weeks\u2019 notice, but I can\u2019t risk losing this offer.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Su will manage. I\u2019ll probably take on more shifts.\u2019 My mouth turned down at the thought of working more backshifts.</p><p>\u2018You know, if you took Braden up on his offer this wouldn\u2019t even be a problem.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I said no. I\u2019ll find something. Don\u2019t worry.\u2019</p><p>He shifted under me, tensing. \u2018You\u2019re so bloody stubborn. You\u2019re always all concerned about Cole and providing for him and making sure he\u2019s going to be okay. I bet half of what happened out in the hall this afternoon was because of him and you feeling like you\u2019d let him down. If you\u2019re so concerned about him, then take a bloody job when it\u2019s offered to you.\u2019</p><p>I pulled out of his embrace, my cheeks burning at being spoken down to like that. I stretched out on the other side of the couch and reached over for the television remote, bumping up the volume of the sci-fi programme we were watching. Not only was I annoyed by his tone, but I was annoyed that he was absolutely right.</p><p>His weary sigh filled the living room.</p><p>\u2018Fine,\u2019 I grumbled. \u2018I\u2019ll call Braden tomorrow.\u2019</p><p>Silence greeted me, so I shot him a quick look before focusing back on the television. The overbearing bastard was trying not to smile. \u2018Good. I\u2019m glad to hear it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Are you deliberately trying to be a smug bugger?\u2019</p><p>He snorted. \u2018How did I go from being the guy who brought your family back together to being a smug bugger? How did we go from cuddling to you sitting as far from me as possible?\u2019 He grabbed my calf. \u2018Come back.\u2019</p><p>I kicked out at him. \u2018Stop it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine, I\u2019ll come to you.\u2019</p><p>I squealed as he launched himself over me, pinning me to the sofa. \u2018Get off!\u2019 I laughed as he buried his nose in my neck, his fingers tickling my waist.</p><p>\u2018Will you be nice?\u2019 he muttered against my skin.</p><p>I pouted. \u2018I\u2019m always nice.\u2019</p><p>Cam lifted his head and kissed the pout right off my mouth and what had started as playful quickly gained heat. I held him to me, his chest pressing against my sensitive breasts as he deepened our kiss.</p><p>When his hips began to thrust gently against me, his hard-on nudging between my legs, I tore my mouth away from his, feeling as if my whole body was going to burst into flames. \u2018Don\u2019t,\u2019 I breathed, gripping his hips to still his erotic motion. \u2018We can\u2019t do anything and I\u2019m horny as hell. Don\u2019t torture me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah?\u2019 Cam\u2019s grin was wicked as his hand coasted up my waist to cup my breast. He squeezed it, setting off a weird mixture of painful tenderness and a bolt of lust to my sex.</p><p>\u2018My eyes!\u2019 Cole yelled.</p><p>Cam and I jerked apart, and I twisted my head to see my brother standing in the doorway in his pyjamas, his hair falling in wet locks across his forehead. His forearm covered his eyes. \u2018I\u2019m fucking blind,\u2019 he growled and turned around, bumping into the wall before remembering to drop his arm. After that he stomped out of the flat, the door slamming in his wake.</p><p>Horrified, I looked up into Cam\u2019s face, my eyes wide. \u2018I think I should let him get away with using the \u201cf\u201d word on this occasion.\u2019</p><p>Cam snorted, laughter spluttering as he dropped his head to my chest, his whole body shaking with amusement.</p><p>I felt an irrepressible giggle escape me despite my mortification for myself and Cole. \u2018It\u2019s not funny. We\u2019ve scarred him. I better check on him.\u2019</p><p>Cam shook his head, his eyes bright with mirth. \u2018You\u2019re the last person he wants to see right now.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But he\u2019s upstairs with Mum.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019s barricaded himself in his room and is doing anything he can to burn the image of me dry-humping his sister out of his mind.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why do you have to be right about everything? It\u2019s exceptionally annoying.\u2019</p><p>He just smiled.</p><p>\u2018No, I mean it. Either you\u2019re going to have to stop or you\u2019re constantly going to find yourself on the wrong end of the couch.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good.\u2019 He flashed that heated smile at me again. \u2018I like the making-up part.\u2019</p><p>I abruptly kissed him hard, liking that answer and too love-fogged to care that he now knew just how much his cockiness could turn me on. When I finally let him up for breath, I brushed my thumb across his mouth, hoping I got to keep that sexy curl of his lip forever and ever. \u2018I am grateful for today. For everything. For handling me with care and for going out of your way to bring Uncle Mick to me.\u2019</p><p>His eyes lit with affection and sweet tenderness as he searched my face slowly, seeming to memorize each feature. \u2018Anytime, baby.\u2019</p><p>I cuddled him close and we lay in silence for a few moments. Brushing his hair through my fingers, I asked tentatively, \u2018Cam?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aye?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know you said you gave up on the idea of looking for your birth parents, but after seeing what happened today with Mick ... are you sure?\u2019</p><p>\u2018That was different.\u2019 His breath whispered across my collarbone. \u2018You and Mick had a relationship. I don\u2019t know the people who gave me up. Honestly, I no longer need to know them. I have everything I could ever want for in Anderson and Helena MacCabe. I don\u2019t need reasons or excuses because ... well ... no matter how good they are, it\u2019s never going to change the fact that I came second to those excuses. They abandoned me. Doesn\u2019t matter if their reasons are logical, practical ... it will never change how I felt when I found out the truth. So what\u2019s the point?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I ran my hand down his back soothingly, wanting to draw him inside me, where he was loved more than he even knew. \u2018They missed out, baby. They missed out big.\u2019</p><p>22</p><p>Cole had been given the full rundown about Uncle Mick already. He\u2019d been only three years old when Mick left, so he couldn\u2019t remember him, but he seemed okay about meeting him, having learned enough from me over the years to know that I\u2019d once thought the guy walked on water.</p> <p>Telling Mum had been a different story. I\u2019d actually feared telling her, afraid that the news would cause her to kick off. To my surprise, she accepted the news with calm and agreed to come out and speak to Mick when he arrived.</p><p>I thought I even heard her take a shower while I clicked through the job site on Cole\u2019s computer.</p><p>By the time Cole arrived home from school, my palms were sweating. Mum had been unruffled earlier, but that might change when she set eyes on Mick. The knock at the door caused my heart to skip a beat. I don\u2019t know why people described that in romance novels as if it was a good thing. When your heart skips a beat it makes you breathless, you feel a little sick, and definitely out of sorts.</p><p>\u2018You made it.\u2019 I stretched my lips into a weak smile as I opened the door to Uncle Mick and Olivia.</p><p>Olivia chuckled. \u2018Are we that bad?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018No, no, no.\u2019 I hurried to reassure them, stepping aside to let them in.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not us she\u2019s worried about,\u2019 Mick murmured to her, and I threw him a knowing but weary smile over my shoulder as I led them into the sitting room.</p><p>\u2018Just take off your jackets. Make yourself at home. Can I get you tea or coffee? Water, juice?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Coffee,\u2019 they answered in unison.</p><p>I nodded, all nervous energy. \u2018No probs.\u2019</p><p>But Cole\u2019s appearance in the doorway stopped me in my tracks. I put my arm around his shoulders and led him back towards Mick and Olivia. \u2018Cole, this is Mick and his daughter, Olivia.\u2019</p> <p>Mick grinned at him and stuck his hand out. Cole took it tentatively. \u2018Nice to meet you,\u2019 he murmured, letting his hair hang in his eyes so he didn\u2019t have to look directly at them.</p><p>\u2018You too. Jesus, you\u2019re the spitting image of your dad when he was your age.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s nothing like Dad,\u2019 I said tersely.</p><p>Olivia\u2019s eyebrows rose and she shot a look at her father before she said admonishingly, \u2018Way to go, Dad.\u2019</p><p>Looking uncomfortable, Mick sighed. \u2018I didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u2019</p><p>Way to go, Jo. \u2018I know.\u2019 I waved him off, feeling bad for my waspishness. \u2018I\u2019m a little sensitive around that subject.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Understood.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cole, I\u2019m Olivia.\u2019 She stuck her hand out and Cole\u2019s cheekbones flushed a little as they shook hands. \u2018It\u2019s good to meet you.\u2019 She glanced around the sitting room, her eyes brimming with approval. \u2018You guys have a really nice place.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Jo does all the decorating.\u2019 Cole surprised me as he informed her about that almost enthusiastically. \u2018The wallpapering, painting, sanding ... everything.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m impressed.\u2019</p><p>I felt Uncle Mick\u2019s smiling eyes on me. \u2018All my teaching stuck with you, eh?\u2019</p><p>Embarrassed, I shrugged. \u2018I like decorating.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aye, we know.\u2019 Mum\u2019s voice had me sucking in my breath as we all turned to watch her shuffle into the sitting room. \u2018You do it often enough.\u2019 Cole and I exchanged glances, utterly taken aback by her appearance. She hadn\u2019t just showered; she\u2019d gotten dressed. Her hair was blow-dried smooth, she had some make-up on and she was wearing a pair of skinny jeans that were loose on her frail body, and a black silk shirt I\u2019d bought her for Christmas even though I never thought she\u2019d wear it. To us she looked better than she had done in ages, but when I glanced back at Uncle Mick I could see the shock in his eyes at her appearance.</p><p>He stepped past us and towered over Mum, who gave him a small smile. \u2018Fiona. It\u2019s good to see you.\u2019</p><p>She nodded, her mouth trembling a little. \u2018It\u2019s been a long time, Michael.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aye.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You look almost the same.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t, darling,\u2019 he replied softly, something like anguish in his voice.</p><p>Mum lifted her shoulders in a gesture of resignation. \u2018I did what I could.\u2019</p><p>Uncle Mick didn\u2019t say anything, but I could see from the hard set of his jaw that he didn\u2019t think she\u2019d done enough. We would be in agreement on that one.</p><p>\u2018Dad.\u2019 Olivia moved to his side, taking his hand reassuringly, and I felt the last of my resentment towards her disappear. How could I resent someone who so obviously adored Mick?</p><p>Uncle Mick tightened his hand around his daughter\u2019s. \u2018Fiona, this is my girl, Olivia.\u2019</p><p>And just like that it all went to pot.</p><p>Mum pursed her lips as her eyes drifted over Olivia. \u2018Aye, she looks like that American piece you had a thing with.\u2019</p><p>I squeezed my eyes shut in mortification and heard Cole\u2019s low groan beside me.</p><p>\u2018Fiona,\u2019 Mick scolded her.</p><p>\u2018Dad, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Pfft.\u2019 Mum looked past her to me. \u2018You told me it would just be him. I\u2019m going back to bed. Leave me some dinner later.\u2019</p><p>I nodded, my muscles tense as we waited for her to leave. When her bedroom door slammed closed, I sighed. \u2018Sorry, Uncle Mick. That\u2019s about as good as it gets with her. Olivia, I\u2019m sorry ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Forget it.\u2019 Olivia waved me off. \u2018It\u2019s not a problem.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t believe that\u2019s the same woman.\u2019 Mick shook his head as he strode across the room to take a seat, his body seeming heavy with the shock. \u2018I just can\u2019t believe it.\u2019</p><p>I thought of how Mum had actually behaved fairly well, at least until she saw Olivia, but I didn\u2019t want to tell Mick that. \u2018Believe it.\u2019</p><p>Like a turtle that had poked its head out for a little sunshine only to discover that it was raining, Mum retreated back into her shell even worse than before. She rarely left her room, a crate of alcohol was delivered to the flat, and the only way I knew she was alive was that the food I\u2019d leave for her disappeared. Anytime I knocked to check on her, she grunted at me to go away.</p><p>I wanted it to be black and white. I wanted to hate her for hitting Cole and not give a shit whether she lived or died, but I found I just couldn\u2019t abandon her entirely.</p><p>Cam said there came a time when we had to let some people go. There was no helping them, and attempting to would just pull you into the mire with them.</p><p>It was easier said than done. Despite all of our ugly encounters, she was my mum and there was still a part of me that wanted her to care more about us than she did about herself. I knew I had to let her go. I knew it. For Cole and also for me. When it came time to leave her, I would. But I would take the guilt with me.</p><p>Uncle Mick had said he wanted to spend as much time with me as possible and he hadn\u2019t been lying. That Saturday Cole, Cam, Olivia, Mick and I met in the Grassmarket for a pub lunch. I learned that Olivia had been a librarian in the States, but much like Cam, she had been made redundant due to budget issues. Olivia was warm and funny and extremely hard not to like, and I could envision her getting along well with both Joss and Ellie.</p><p>Lunch was fun and I could tell Mick approved of Cole and Cam\u2019s close friendship, as he kept shooting me looks that said as much. We took a stroll down the busy spring streets of the city, wandering up Victoria Street to George IV Bridge, and then taking Olivia down the Royal Mile. I took some photographs of her and Mick standing on the Mile and then more as we travelled back towards New Town. We walked along Princes Street Gardens and I got some great shots of them together by the Ross Fountain with Edinburgh Castle towering over them in the background. It was a good day, a relaxing day, and as I walked behind them, Cam\u2019s arm around my waist, I forgot about all my worries for a while.</p><p>On Sunday, Elodie was in her element. Having heard from Ellie about Uncle Mick and Olivia, she\u2019d invited them for lunch. When we arrived, it was to discover Elodie had found a second table somewhere and placed it at the end of the one that was already there. Their flat was filled with conversation and laughter as everyone chatted away, getting to know them. I watched Olivia and felt a lump in my throat when I saw the delight on her face, the flush in her cheeks, and the spark in her eyes. Ellie had pounced on her almost immediately and I could tell they\u2019d already glued themselves to each other. Ellie had a way of doing that with people.</p><p>Seated at the table next to Joss, she nudged me and leaned in to whisper, \u2018Did you ever think you\u2019d be a part of something like this?\u2019</p><p>I glanced around at all the faces, my eyes coming to a stop on Cam, who was laughing at something Braden had said. I turned back to her, shaking my head. \u2018Never in a million years.\u2019</p><p>She smiled, and I was taken aback by the emotion in her eyes as she looked down at the simple diamond engagement ring on her finger. \u2018Me neither.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You okay?\u2019</p><p>Joss nodded. \u2018More than.\u2019</p><p>I grinned at her and was just about to crack a joke to ease us out of such seriousness when Braden called, \u2018Jo, you need a job?\u2019</p><p>I rolled my eyes and shot Cam an impatient look. \u2018I was going to ask him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, you were taking your time about it.\u2019</p><p>Sighing, I nodded at Braden, my cheeks flushing at having to ask. \u2018If you have a part-time position available, I\u2019d appreciate it.\u2019</p><p>His light blue eyes searched mine and I felt vulnerable under his scrutiny. Braden had a way of stripping a person bare, as if he could see into the very depths of them. I didn\u2019t know how Joss had withstood him so long before eventually owning up to her feelings for him. Surely he\u2019d known all along. \u2018Jo, come to us whenever you need us, please.\u2019</p><p>I gulped but nodded.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll set something up tomorrow, see if we can\u2019t get you started on Tuesday.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 I whispered gratefully.</p><p>When conversation started up again, Joss chortled under her breath. \u2018He\u2019s scary, right?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Braden?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Yeah. He sees more than most people.\u2019 She eyed me carefully. \u2018Is there something going on with you we don\u2019t know about? Are you and Cam okay?\u2019</p><p>I thought of all my insecurities and the fight I was having with them on a daily basis. \u2018Just finding our feet with each other.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sure. Well, I think he\u2019s pretty cool. I mean, before you met him you would never have taken a job from Braden.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, don\u2019t rub it in.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jesus C, woman, I didn\u2019t think anyone was as proud or as stubborn as I am.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Well, you were wrong,\u2019 I answered drily.</p><p>Joss laughed. \u2018Yeah, and now you have your very own caveman to ... shake out some of that stubbornness.\u2019</p><p>I felt my cheeks warm at the thought of Cameron shaking out my stubbornness tonight. Good times ahead.</p><p>Joss snorted. \u2018Just keep that thought to yourself.\u2019</p><p>23</p><p>There are times in life when there is so much going on you may feel as though you don\u2019t even have a chance to take a breath. You wake up, you get washed and dressed, the day is a blur of events, work, activities, chores, and then before you know it, your exhausted body is melting against your pillow and mattress. Then, in what feels like two seconds later, your eyes are forced open at the sound of the alarm clock. That\u2019s how my life was for the next few weeks.</p> <p>Because there was so much going on, I let go of my neurosis for a night and stayed in Cam\u2019s bed until morning. It was the Wednesday after the weekend with Mick and Olivia. As soon as the alarm went off, I groaned, shoved back the covers, and jumped out of bed.</p><p>Apparently Cameron found the way I got out of bed very amusing.</p><p>I watched his naked shoulders shaking as he pressed his face into his pillow.</p><p>My heavy eyelids and nervous anticipation of my second day working at Douglas Carmichael &amp; Co didn\u2019t add up to a whole lot of patience. \u2018It\u2019s not that funny.\u2019</p><p>Cam pulled his sleepy, grinning face out of the pillow. \u2018Baby, you\u2019re hilarious,\u2019 he said in his sexy, sleep-roughened voice. I wanted to dive back under the covers with him, but I had to get ready for work.</p><p>\u2018If I don\u2019t jump out of bed right away I\u2019ll fall back asleep. What you\u2019re doing ... I can\u2019t do that.\u2019</p><p>He pushed himself up to look at me, the tenderness in his eyes stopping me in my tracks. \u2018You\u2019re fucking adorable. You know that, right?\u2019</p><p>His ability to make me blush was ridiculous. No one got under my skin the way he did, or made me feel less like myself and yet more like myself. I looked away as I wandered out of the room to the bathroom. \u2018I\u2019m going to be adorably late.\u2019</p> <p>That was as much one-on-one conversation as we got out of each other over the next two weeks. That first week we\u2019d both started our new jobs (well, Cam had started back at his old job), Mick and Olivia invited us out for dinner, came over to Cam\u2019s for dinner, took the three of us to the cinema, spent alone time with me and Cole while Cam hung out with Peetie and Nate, and generally crammed as much time in with us as they could. I willingly spent that time with them, unsure when they\u2019d be returning to the States. I couldn\u2019t imagine how expensive their hotel bill at the Caledonian was. Mick said Yvonne had inherited money from her grandmother \u2013 part of the contention between Yvonne and her family \u2013 and that she\u2019d left that money to Mick and Olivia when she passed away. It wasn\u2019t \u2018forever\u2019 kind of money, and the trip to Scotland was eating its way through it. I knew Mick well enough to know he wouldn\u2019t want to continue to waste his money on hotel bills.</p><p>As much as I found Olivia easy to be around, it was Mick\u2019s company that I craved. Like a real dad, he refused to let me pay for anything, he gave me fatherly advice, and teased me mercilessly, just as he had when I was a kid. Being around him brought back that feeling of safety, security, and of being accepted for who I was. He also examined all the work I\u2019d done in the flat and re-emphasized Cam\u2019s point that I had a talent for it. I\u2019d never been told by anyone that I had a talent for anything and now two of the most important men in my life insisted I did.</p><p>It was pretty bloody brilliant.</p><p>During the second week I saw less of Mick and Olivia. He had decided that he wanted her to see a bit of her heritage, and so he\u2019d booked them into an inn in Loch Lomond and they\u2019d disappeared for a few days. That left me to focus on getting the hang of my new job. It wasn\u2019t too difficult. Braden had set me up as an administrator and I helped out at reception as well. It was a much livelier place to work, with estate agents in one room and administrators in another. Everyone was always coming and going, and there were a number of young, good-looking guys who worked as estate agents and liked to flirt with the admin staff.</p><p>Their reaction to my arrival had been almost comical. A new toy to play with! Except my inner flirt had lost a lot of her flair since meeting Cameron. Yes, I could smile and banter with the best of them, but the heated come-on in my eyes and the promises in my teasing smile had disappeared. I was no longer constantly looking for a backup plan. I didn\u2019t want a backup plan.</p><p>All I wanted I had, in one annoyingly right, somewhat arrogant, kind, funny, patient, tattooed man.</p><p>As I was working Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday at the estate agency and working my usual Tuesday, Thursday and Friday nights at the bar, I saw Cam very little, as he\u2019d started a new project at work that was eating into all his spare time. He had returned to evening judo classes, and so I saw him when he popped up to the flat to collect Cole for class. I had gone to him on Tuesday night, but he had fallen asleep on top of his drawing desk by the time I\u2019d got there. I\u2019d had to gently wake him up and make sure he made it to his bed. He\u2019d wrapped a surprisingly strong arm around my waist and pulled me down on to the bed with him. I let him, enjoying being close to him even if he was unconscious. When his arm relaxed, I managed to slip out without waking him up.</p><p>By the time Saturday came around, I missed him. I didn\u2019t want to be that needy, cloying girl, and I hadn\u2019t thought I was. But I missed not seeing him as often, and I was used to spending time together talking and laughing, sitting in comfortable silence, or having the most incredible sex.</p><p>It had only been a week.</p><p>Christ, I was addicted.</p><p>That Saturday was the night of Joss and Braden\u2019s engagement party, and since I\u2019d cleaned out my wardrobe by selling most of my nice dresses on eBay, I was going shopping for a new dress on my new, smaller budget.</p><p>To my surprise, Cameron offered to accompany me.</p><p>It became apparent very quickly that he hated shopping.</p><p>\u2018Why did you come?\u2019 I asked him, laughing as I found him brooding in the corner of Topshop.</p><p>He immediately took my hand and led me out of the shop. \u2018Because I miss you,\u2019 he told me, completely unabashed at the confession. \u2018If I have to endure this to spend time with you, then so be it.\u2019</p><p>Deciding his valour deserved a kiss, I laid a hot one on him right in the middle of Princes Street. When his arms wrapped tight around me, holding me as close as I could get, I decided it might have been a bad idea. By the time we pulled back, letting immature catcalls from a group of prepubescent boys insisting that we \u2018Get a room!\u2019 ricochet off us, our skin was on fire. We hadn\u2019t had sex in a week. That was a record for us. A dry spell we both apparently wanted to end, and end soon.</p><p>Now was not the time. \u2018Tonight,\u2019 I whispered against his mouth and reluctantly let him go.</p><p>I tried not to put him through the torture of shopping for too long. We went into one of my favourite high street stores on Castle Street, Cam complaining loudly about the pop music blaring out of the sound system because it was so deafening that it was almost impossible to hear one another, while I grabbed a bundle of dresses to try on. The lady at the changing room entrance tried to stop me from taking Cam in with me, but I charmed her, explaining that I needed my boyfriend\u2019s advice since it was a very special evening, wink, wink. She could take that wink, wink any way she pleased, and she did, grinning and letting us pass. To my delight, I found the largest changing room empty and dumped all the dresses inside. I pointed to the stool outside the curtain. \u2018You can sit there.\u2019</p><p>Cam sighed and folded his tall body on to the stool. When I grinned down at him, his lips twitched. \u2018That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve actually heard you call me your boyfriend.\u2019</p><p>I scrunched up my face in protest. \u2018Uh-uh.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mmm-hmm.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019</p><p>He grinned. \u2018Really.\u2019</p><p>I braced myself as I asked, \u2018How did it sound to you?\u2019</p><p>His smile softened and he nodded. \u2018Very nice.\u2019</p><p>We shared a moment and I found myself growing all glowy inside. \u2018Okay,\u2019 I sighed, attempting not to seem like an adoring teen in love. \u2018I\u2019ll try to be quick.\u2019</p><p>After shutting the curtain, I hurried out of my clothes and into the first dress. I thought it was too short. Cam agreed. \u2018This is easy.\u2019 I smiled and dashed back behind the curtain. There was a succession of \u2018no\u2019 and \u2018maybe\u2019 verdicts until I finally tried on a dark blue lace pencil dress, classy and elegant but so body-forming that it was sexy too.</p><p>\u2018What do you think?\u2019 I twirled around for Cam as I came out from behind the curtain.</p><p>His eyes drifted from the tip of my toes to my face, growing more heated as they did. Then he merely nodded.</p><p>I raised an eyebrow in question. \u2018Good?\u2019</p><p>When he just nodded again, I shrugged and dipped back behind the curtain. I stared at my reflection for a moment. Well, I like it.</p><p>I was just about to reach for the zip, when the curtain ruffled behind me and Cameron slipped inside, pulling it closed behind him. I felt my heart begin to speed up, my skin already flushing with anticipation. I didn\u2019t need to ask him what he was doing. I knew that look on his face all too well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly it didn\u2019t matter that we were in a changing room, in a store, in public.</p><p>Cam slid his hand along my jaw, to the back of my nape, drawing me towards him for a kiss that literally made all my nerves snap. I trembled against him as though it was our first kiss, exhilarating in the deep, wet heat of his mouth, tasting him and the mint he\u2019d been chewing earlier. I clawed at him and we stumbled over my pile of clothing, my back hitting the mirrored wall. Cam pulled back, his lids low, his mouth swollen. \u2018Turn around,\u2019 he demanded in a rough voice in my ear, so I could hear him over the music. The heated coarseness of his tone caused my body to react as though he\u2019d slipped two fingers inside me. My chest rising and falling with excited breaths, I spun around. He yanked the zip on the dress down and began peeling it off my body. I watched him in the mirror as he threw it on to the pile with my own clothing. \u2018Buy it,\u2019 he advised and I shivered at the feel of his breath on my skin as his warm hands coasted around to squeeze my naked breasts. Biting my lip to curb the moan I was desperate to release, I arched into his touch, my hands on his as he pinched my nipples. I could feel his chest against my back, his breathing uncontrolled as he pushed my underwear down. They fell to my thighs and I hurriedly shoved them farther down, kicking them out from around my ankles as the sound of Cam unzipping met my ears.</p><p>While his clothes rustled, his black trousers falling to his ankles, Cam slowly glided two strong fingers into my channel and I leaned against the mirror for support, my eyes on him. He watched his fingers moving in and out of me, fascinated and excited, and it only made me wetter.</p> <p>\u2018Cam,\u2019 I moaned softly, and as if he heard me his head came up, his eyes meeting mine in the mirror. They flashed at the expression on my face.</p><p>He pinned me against the mirror, one hand flat above mine while the other cradled my hip.</p><p>He glided into me with a stifled grunt and I swallowed my gasp. As he began to move, I pushed back against his slow thrusts, and our eyes stayed connected in the mirror as he fucked me.</p><p>As the tension began to build inside me, Cam grasped my hips, his cock so deep inside me it was almost painful. Abruptly he lowered himself to his knees, pulling me down with him. Poised over his lap, my hand still pressed to the mirror, his hands caressing my breasts, I began to move against his strokes. I felt his cheek against my back as we chased climax, my orgasm spurred on by the low, needy, guttural noises he was making in the back of his throat.</p><p>Sensing that I was about to come, Cam drew up behind me, his hand moving from my breast to cover my mouth. The tight heat cocooning my skin and muscles combusted and I exploded around him, my cry of release muffled against his palm.</p> <p>Cam followed me to release seconds later, my eyes watching him in the mirror as he stiffened, the muscles in his neck straining. His mouth opened in a silent groan as his hips jerked against my ass and he came, the warm heat of his release flooding me.</p><p>\u2018Fuck,\u2019 he whispered, resting his head against mine.</p><p>\u2018Um, everything all right in there?\u2019 the shop assistant called loudly. Her sudden interruption filtered through the curtain, so close that we tensed against one another.</p><p>Oh, my holy hell! I\u2019d forgotten where we were. \u2018Yes,\u2019 I answered, my voice breaking with postcoital exhaustion and embarrassment that I\u2019d got so lost in this man I\u2019d forgotten we were screwing each other on the floor of a changing room.</p><p>\u2018Do you need me to fetch another size, or is the dress okay?\u2019</p><p>Go away! My wide eyes met Cameron\u2019s in the mirror and he gave me no indication of what I should do. He was still inside me, for Christ\u2019s sake. I almost laughed at that and glanced back at the curtain. \u2018Everything\u2019s great. In fact ... it\u2019s a perfect fit.\u2019</p> <p>At the innuendo, Cameron collapsed against my back, his laughter muffled in my hair, his shoulders shaking with amusement. It also caused him to jostle inside me, setting off little aftershocks of lust.</p><p>\u2018Okay ...\u2019 Her voice trailed off as she wandered away from the curtain.</p><p>\u2018Do you think they heard us?\u2019</p><p>He gave a low bark of laughter. \u2018I don\u2019t give a shit.\u2019</p><p>And he meant it.</p><p>With tender gentleness, he eased out of me and helped me to my feet. Hands cupping my cheeks, he drew me against him for a languorous, sensual kiss that made my chest ache with emotion.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>I cleared the thought from my eyes as Cam pulled back to gaze at me.</p> <p>\u2018Luckily we finally chose a dress because there\u2019s no way I can try anything else on before I have a shower.\u2019</p><p>Something darkly sexual heated in his eyes and I knew he was thinking it was hot that I had to walk home with his sweat on me and his seed inside me.</p><p>\u2018Joss is right,\u2019 I murmured. \u2018You\u2019re all cavemen.\u2019</p><p>Cam didn\u2019t take offence at that. Instead he took his time helping me dress, his knuckles brushing all my sensitive bits until I had to slap his hand away so I could get dressed without wanting to maul him again.</p><p>My cheeks were blazing as I handed the dresses I didn\u2019t want back to the suspicious sales assistant. I couldn\u2019t look at Cam because every time I did he shot me a wicked grin that made me want to giggle with equal parts exhilaration and mortification. As soon as we stumbled out of the store with my new dress, I fell against Cam\u2019s side, laughing hard as he wrapped his arm around me.</p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t believe we did that,\u2019 I breathed.</p><p>\u2018Aye, can\u2019t say I\u2019ve done that before.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You better not tell Nate and Peetie.\u2019 My warning didn\u2019t hold much of an impact since I was still grinning like a fool.</p><p>\u2018Why not? That\u2019s a bloody good sex story.\u2019</p><p>My cheeks warmed again and Cam laughed, snuggling me against his chest as I giggled. I was so caught up in happy la-la land with him that what happened in the next few moments was even more of a crashing, cold bump back to earth.</p><p>Cam stopped abruptly and I grabbed him to keep my balance, my head pulling back to study his face. The colour had leached from it and his eyes were wide with utter shock. \u2018Cam?\u2019 I whispered, feeling something hard begin to form in my stomach. I followed his gaze to the girl who was standing in front of us, her pretty eyes just as wide as Cam\u2019s.</p><p>\u2018Cameron?\u2019 she breathed, taking a step towards us, apparently not even aware that I was there.</p><p>\u2018Blair,\u2019 he answered hoarsely.</p><p>I felt my head spin at the sound of her name, my eyes immediately examining her, processing everything about her. To my surprise she wasn\u2019t at all what I\u2019d been expecting. I\u2019d pictured her in my mind as this tall, exotic stunner with an air of mystique. Instead she was shorter than Joss, her body slim and petite. She wore a T-shirt with a band on it over a long-sleeved white top, ratty jeans that fit her well and boots quite like Cam\u2019s. She had short black hair that framed her cute pixie face. Her wide brown eyes were her best feature, framed by long black lashes. Shock mixed with longing haunted those pretty eyes, and I felt my hand fist around the material of Cam\u2019s light jacket.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s great to see you.\u2019 She gave him a sweet smile.</p><p>Cam nodded, clearing his throat and shaking the deer caught in the headlights expression from his eyes. \u2018Uh, you too. How long have you been back in Edinburgh?\u2019</p><p>\u2018A few months. I thought about looking you up, but I wasn\u2019t sure ...\u2019 Her voice trailed off as she finally registered that I was burrowed into Cam\u2019s side. She took me in, a crestfallen expression on her face, disappointment in her eyes. Disappointment in Cam? For choosing someone like me?</p><p>I bristled at the thought and Cam\u2019s arm tightened around me. \u2018No, you should have,\u2019 Cam surprised me by saying.</p><p>Blair\u2019s whole face lit up. \u2018Really?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019 Cam dropped his arm from around me to pull his phone out of his pocket. \u2018Here, give me your number and we\u2019ll arrange to catch up.\u2019</p><p>What?</p><p>I watched them as they exchanged numbers, Cam\u2019s head bent over hers, and my brain just started screaming at me. What the hell was going on? He was arranging to get in contact with the ex-love of his life! What effed-up reality was this?</p><p>To make matters worse, he hadn\u2019t even introduced me.</p><p>I stood there, attempting to appear calm and unconcerned.</p><p>He laughed softly at something she said and she gazed up at him like he was some kind of miracle. He was a miracle. He was my miracle and if he didn\u2019t introduce me I was going \u2013</p><p>\u2018Blair, this is my girlfriend, Jo,\u2019 Cam said as he tucked his phone away. He gave me a reassuring smile that I didn\u2019t return.</p><p>\u2018Nice to meet you.\u2019 I managed to give her a small smile while inside I was flinging every swear word I could think of at her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t smile back. \u2018You too.\u2019</p><p>When our gazes met, we had a silent conversation with each other. I resent you, she said. I think I hate you, I replied. He was mine first, she answered. He\u2019s mine now, I growled.</p><p>Thick tension fell between the three of us until Cam broke the silence with a few polite questions.</p><p>After arranging to speak to one another soon, we left Blair to walk home via Princes Street. To my growing panic, Cam didn\u2019t reach for me again. We walked home side by side, not touching and not talking. He seemed to have disappeared somewhere inside himself and I feared that place almost more than I feared anything else.</p><p>24</p><p>Cole knew there was something wrong as soon as I returned to the flat. I kept insisting it was nothing, which pissed him off. I knew this because he told me to my face it pissed him off. I retaliated with a lecture on swearing, which he informed me pissed him off even more, so by the time I was dressed for the party, I was mad at Cam for being an inconsiderate dimwit, terrified that I was facing the end of my relationship, and upset that my wee brother had left to stay with Jamie for the night without saying goodbye to me.</p><p>In other words I was really in the party spirit.</p><p>My depressed thoughts weren\u2019t eased when I hurried down to Cam\u2019s flat to pick him up and he barely registered my dress. The dress he\u2019d found so hot pre-Blair encounter that he\u2019d ravished me in a public dressing room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I felt my chest tighten with anxiety as he remained quiet during the taxi ride with Olivia and Uncle Mick. Even Olivia commented on it, asking him if he was all right.</p><p>Of course he insisted he was, though we all knew (we, as in I) that he had been thrown for a loop by the arrival of his ex-girlfriend, aka the only woman he had ever loved.</p><p>We arrived at Joss and Braden\u2019s flat on Dublin Street to find the party already in full swing. Hannah and Declan were staying with friends tonight, so Elodie and Clark were free to stay as long as they wanted. Elodie was completely smashed already \u2013 and Elodie smashed was just a heightened version of Elodie sober. She kept moving around all the guests asking them if they wanted a refill and when they said yes, she proceeded to overfill their glasses with a loopy \u2018Oopsie!\u2019</p> <p>Cam, Olivia and I settled in a corner with Adam and Ellie. I tried to keep up with the conversation, and attempted to appear as if everything was all right, laughing along with the others as Adam pointed out the growing strain on Joss\u2019s face as she was forced to mingle. At one point we watched as Joss attempted to remove her hand from the grip of the wife of one of Braden\u2019s professional acquaintances as she peered at the engagement ring. Joss tugged politely a few times, but when that didn\u2019t seem to get through, she actually swatted the woman\u2019s hand off hers and then smiled prettily as if nothing had happened, leaving Braden choking on laughter while she excused herself.</p><p>We were all laughing, and I turned to Cam to share a smile with him, only to find his head bent over his phone.</p><p>\u2018You okay?\u2019 I asked, looking down at the text message he was typing and feeling that ugly compression on my chest again.</p><p>He glanced up and gave me a barely there smile. \u2018Yeah, you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine. Who are you texting?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Just Blair. She wanted my address.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hmm.\u2019 I nodded, hoping my fury wasn\u2019t evident in my eyes. I turned away from him, cursing him to the moon and back.</p><p>Come to a party for my friend\u2019s engagement as my bloody date and stand there not paying attention to anything anyone\u2019s saying, tapping away at your bloody phone, talking to an ex-girlfriend you casually mention you were in love with, and expect me not to be bloody well pissed off, you bloody swine, you utter \u2013</p><p>\u2018So, Jo, how are you liking the new job?\u2019 Adam asked me, interrupting my inner diatribe against my boyfriend.</p><p>\u2018Oh, good.\u2019</p><p>Adam waited for me to say more, but I couldn\u2019t make my brain work. While my blood was hot with anger, my chest hurt, and my melancholy thoughts took up all my head space. Realizing he wasn\u2019t going to get anything else out of me, Adam engaged Olivia in conversation and I ignored the worried looks Ellie kept shooting me.</p> <p>I glanced around the room, wishing I could just escape, lock myself in the bathroom and cry. But that seemed awfully melodramatic, considering Cam hadn\u2019t actually done anything wrong. It was my insecurities that were making me feel this way, right?</p><p>I caught Uncle Mick\u2019s eye across the room and smiled. He grinned and then turned back to Clark. The two men were so different, one a scholar, one a manual labourer, and yet they seemed to get on incredibly well with each other. I was glad. It was nice of Joss and Braden to invite Mick and Olivia to their engagement party, but I had worried that they would feel out of place.</p><p>Turned out the only one feeling out of place was me.</p><p>I listened with half an ear as Ellie managed to engage Cam in conversation. Although he chatted with her about the new project he was creating the graphics for, an independent chocolate shop that was opening in Edinburgh, I could hear the lack of enthusiasm in his voice. I knew him too well. I knew his mind was off somewhere else tonight.</p><p>Was it really my insecurities telling me his mind was on Blair? Or was it my instincts?</p><p>I needed the opinion of a blunt, straightforward, honest couple.</p><p>Sweeping the crowded sitting room, I couldn\u2019t see Joss and Braden anywhere. I excused myself and headed out into the empty hallway, then proceeded to check the kitchen, where a large group of people had congregated. They weren\u2019t there either. I checked the bedrooms. Both empty.</p><p>Wondering if they\u2019d gone outside for some fresh air, I headed down the hall towards the door and that was when I heard the deep, rumbling chuckle.</p> <p>I halted, my eyebrows at my hairline as I turned to face the bathroom door.</p><p>No.</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Would they?</p><p>\u2018Oh, wait, I think my leg cramped up.\u2019 Joss snorted and then giggled. Actually giggled. I didn\u2019t know she could do that.</p><p>\u2018How did it cramp up?\u2019 Braden murmured.</p><p>\u2018Well, I don\u2019t know if you know this about me, baby, but my body isn\u2019t a pretzel.\u2019</p><p>My mouth fell open and I muffled a laugh into my hand despite myself. What position had he got her into?</p><p>\u2018Do you want me to massage it?\u2019</p><p>There was a moment of silence and then ... \u2018Oh, yeah, right there,\u2019 she moaned.</p><p>\u2018Fuck,\u2019 Braden huffed. \u2018You\u2019ll set me off again.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Seriously?\u2019 she asked incredulously. \u2018I just moaned.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s all it takes, babe.\u2019</p><p>Joss giggled again. I decided it was a nice sound.</p><p>And then I realized I was creepily eavesdropping on their sex-in-the-bathroom-at-their-own-fricking-engagement encounter. I knocked on the door.</p><p>\u2018Uh, just a minute!\u2019 Joss yelled.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s me,\u2019 I called semi-loudly through the door. \u2018Are you decent yet?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Um, not yet. Wait.\u2019 I heard clothes rustling and then a muffled \u2018oof\u2019 before something clattered to the floor. \u2018Are you trying to kill me?\u2019</p><p>Braden laughed. \u2018You were the one that wanted to fuck in the bathroom.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ssssh!\u2019 Joss hissed. \u2018Jo is outside.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think she knows what we\u2019re up to.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She does,\u2019 I offered helpfully.</p><p>Braden laughed.</p><p>The door swung open. Braden stood over me, his hair ruffled, and his shirt tucked messily back into his trousers. Joss was hopping on one foot behind him, trying to get her shoe back on. Her cheeks were flushed and the French knot in her hair was a little more than worse for wear.</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019 I asked, glancing around to make sure we were still alone. \u2018The bathroom during your engagement party?\u2019</p><p>Joss rolled her eyes at me. \u2018What, like you\u2019ve never done it somewhere a little risqu\u00e9?\u2019</p><p>My cheeks bloomed bright red as I remembered how risqu\u00e9 it had got with Cam just this morning. God, it seemed like a lifetime ago already.</p><p>Bloody Blair.</p><p>Braden scrutinized me and nodded smugly at Joss. \u2018She\u2019s definitely done it somewhere risqu\u00e9.\u2019</p><p>Joss grinned, finally getting her shoe on and coming to a standstill. \u2018I do believe you\u2019re right, Mr Carmichael. Look at those pretty cheeks blush.\u2019</p><p>I sighed impatiently, trying to cover my embarrassment. \u2018I didn\u2019t hunt you down to talk about risqu\u00e9 sex.\u2019 I brushed past Braden and motioned to him to shut the door.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow but complied. \u2018Everything all right?\u2019</p><p>Trying to keep a lid on my emotions I laid it out for them. The story of Cam and Blair, and now her sudden re-entrance into his life and Cam\u2019s troubling reaction to it.</p><p>\u2018Should I be worried?\u2019 I chewed on my lip, glancing from one to the other.</p><p>Joss looked at Braden. \u2018What do you think?\u2019</p><p>Braden winked at her. \u2018I think I\u2019m looking pretty good right now.\u2019</p><p>Joss smacked him across the arm for the both of us. \u2018Not helpful, you smug idiot.\u2019</p><p>He grunted, still smiling cockily, a smile that slipped when he turned to me and saw that I was not in the mood for his humour at the moment. He sighed, his eyes softening. \u2018Jo, you\u2019ve nothing to worry about.\u2019</p><p>It was exactly the reassurance I\u2019d been looking for, but I needed more. \u2018Really?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Look, Cameron just bumped into a girl he has a history with. It\u2019s going to affect him. It doesn\u2019t mean he still has feelings for her. If Joss and I were out for a stroll and we bumped into my ex, I\u2019d probably be feeling a bit off for the rest of the day as well, but not because I\u2019m still in love with the bitch.\u2019</p><p>I raised my eyebrows, wondering what the history was there. I shot Joss a look. \u2018Clearly.\u2019</p><p>Joss caressed Braden\u2019s arm in comfort. \u2018She is a bitch.\u2019</p><p>I sighed this time. \u2018So, you think I\u2019m jumping the gun?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 they answered in unison.</p><p>\u2018I must say, though\u2019 \u2013 Joss shook her head as if in disappointment \u2013 \u2018it shows a serious lack of intuition when it comes to women that Cam wouldn\u2019t realize that him planning to meet with an old girlfriend would bother you.\u2019</p><p>Braden snorted at Cam\u2019s lack of smoothness. \u2018Agreed.\u2019</p><p>I pouted a little. \u2018Agreed.\u2019 I made a face. \u2018Sorry for dumping this on you at your engagement party. That was more than a little selfish. God!\u2019 I threw up my hands. \u2018This relationship is turning me into a schizo!\u2019</p><p>Joss threw me a sympathetic smile. \u2018Welcome to my world.\u2019</p><p>When I returned to the party it was to discover that Cam had got surprisingly drunk, shockingly fast. He never drank to the point of being drunk and as the evening wore on, the little that Braden had done to reassure me was obliterated by the state Cam ended up in. Mick had to help me put him in a taxi and then help me up to the flat with him. I bade Mick and Olivia goodnight, stripped Cam out of his clothes, put water and aspirin beside his bed, and crawled in beside him to stay with him and make sure he was okay.</p><p>I didn\u2019t sleep.</p><p>I felt like I was standing on top of the world\u2019s tallest building, staring out on all that the world had to offer, waiting for that gust of wind to come along and blow me down, ripping me from the best view I\u2019d ever had.</p><p>When I turned my head on the pillow to study Cam sleeping, a part of me thought I might hate him a little. I hated him for making me love him so much and for making me feel this horribly uncertain. I\u2019d spent my whole adult life depending on men for financial security, and now I\u2019d traded it in for Cam. I\u2019d thought I was doing it for all the right reasons, but it seemed to me I\u2019d traded financial security for emotional security and the risk hadn\u2019t paid off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Assured that the drunken twat would be fine, I got up out of his bed and pulled on my boots.</p><p>Maybe I should try just depending on myself for a while.</p><p>25</p> <p>Where are you? x</p><p>I looked down at Cam\u2019s text, sighed a little, and then quickly texted him back.</p><p>Took Cole out to lunch with Mick and Olivia. Hungover? x</p><p>\u2018I know it\u2019s none of my business, but you seem a little out of it,\u2019 Olivia observed softly as she strolled beside me.</p><p>Uncle Mick and Cole walked ahead of us and I could see Mick chatting away quite animatedly to Cole. We\u2019d gone for lunch at the Buffalo Grill, this amazing Tex-Mex place behind the university. Now we were walking off our burgers with a nice Sunday stroll down the Meadows. We weren\u2019t the only ones enjoying the large park behind the uni. Friends and families had descended upon it, playing football and tennis, chasing playful dogs, and in general hanging out and enjoying the fair spring weather while it lasted. I\u2019d decided this morning that I didn\u2019t really feel like facing Cam or our problems. Instead I\u2019d pounced on Cole as soon as he\u2019d got home and then called Uncle Mick to suggest lunch. I\u2019d found myself breathing a little easier as soon as Cole and I stepped out of our building and had been trying to enjoy myself until Cam had intruded upon my thoughts with his text.</p> <p>My phone buzzed before I could respond to Olivia\u2019s comment.</p><p>Cam\u2019s reply:</p><p>A wee bit. You okay? x</p><p>\u2018Just a second, Olivia,\u2019 I muttered apologetically, before replying that I was fine and I\u2019d see him when I got back.</p><p>\u2018Is that Cam?\u2019 She nodded down at my phone.</p><p>\u2018Aye.\u2019 I\u2019d sadistically hoped he was suffering the worst hangover ever. He couldn\u2019t even give me that. \u2018I\u2019ve never seen him that drunk before.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Is he okay?\u2019</p><p>I studied her for a moment. We didn\u2019t know each other all that well, so I didn\u2019t know if I could confide in her. I\u2019d gone to Joss and Braden for help because I trusted them to be honest, but the welcome advice they\u2019d given me had been blown to smithereens by Cam\u2019s dive to the bottom of a bottle last night. I did feel the urge to talk to someone else about it, but Olivia? I just didn\u2019t know her that well.</p><p>As if she sensed the turn of my thoughts, she gave me an understanding smile. \u2018I get it. You\u2019re not sure you can talk to me. That\u2019s cool \u2013 but you should know I\u2019m really good at dispensing advice and keeping secrets. If I hadn\u2019t become a librarian I most certainly would have become an advice columnist by day and a spy by night.\u2019</p><p>I chuckled. \u2018Well, that\u2019s good to know. Truthfully, I don\u2019t even know what to say. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s all in my head or if there really is a problem.\u2019</p><p>Olivia cleared her throat. \u2018You\u2019re obviously distressed about something and ... well ... I learned a hard lesson in the past about ignoring something just because I thought it was all in my head.\u2019</p><p>Momentarily distracted, I asked tentatively, \u2018What happened?\u2019</p><p>Her unusual eyes narrowed and I noted that she unconsciously clenched her hands into fists. \u2018Mom. She was weird for a while before we learned her diagnosis. She was snippy, short-tempered, impatient. This was a woman who was pretty much the most laid-back person I knew. My gut told me something was seriously wrong, but I didn\u2019t press her about it. And I should have. If I had, I might have got her to go to the doctor\u2019s about the lump in her breast. Instead she was so frozen with fear, by the time she finally found the courage to do something about it, it was too late.\u2019</p><p>\u2018God, Olivia, I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019</p> <p>She shrugged. \u2018I live with that guilt every day, so whatever your gut is telling you, don\u2019t ignore it.\u2019</p><p>I was so busy scrutinizing the dark shadows lurking in her eyes that I sidestepped Olivia\u2019s advice completely. \u2018Does Uncle Mick know how you feel about your mum\u2019s death?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019 She nodded. \u2018He worries. But I\u2019m okay.\u2019</p><p>\u2018If you ever want to talk ...\u2019</p><p>Olivia smiled sadly at me. \u2018Thanks, Jo. I mean that. You\u2019ve been really cool about me being here, and I know that can\u2019t be easy. I can tell by the way you look at Dad that he\u2019s important to you, and after seeing what your mom is like, I kind of hate myself for taking him away from you when you so obviously needed him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t ever feel that way. You\u2019re his daughter. And he needed you. I understand that. \u201cTeen Me\u201d didn\u2019t, but \u201cAdult Me\u201d gets it. And \u201cAdult Me\u201d is finally all right with it.\u2019 I watched Mick laugh at something Cole said. \u2018But it\u2019s nice to have him back for a while.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cameron must really care about you to have gone to all the trouble of finding us?\u2019</p><p>There was a question within her question, and I knew Olivia realized that whatever was troubling me was about Cam. I felt the need to confide in her forcing its way to the fore. I\u2019d spent so long bottling everything up and keeping it to myself, I guess I was kind of tired of shouldering every little problem in silence. \u2018Cam and I bumped into his ex-girlfriend yesterday.\u2019</p><p>Olivia sighed heavily. \u2018Ah.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He told me a while back he\u2019d been in love with this girl Blair. They broke up because she left to work at a university in France, not because they fell out of love. Now she\u2019s back and they\u2019re already exchanging text messages. You must have seen how subdued and weird Cam was yesterday after it, and then you saw how bloody drunk he got \u2013 and he never gets drunk. So now I\u2019m thinking the worst. Blair\u2019s back and Cam\u2019s head is all messed up because he still loves her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Whoa, okay, that\u2019s a lot.\u2019 Olivia threw her shoulders back and began counting down her points on her fingers. \u2018One: you don\u2019t know he still loves her. Two: bumping into an ex you have real history with will mess with anyone\u2019s head. Three: he doesn\u2019t get to just start up a friendship with this woman without discussing it with you, which brings me to four: you have to talk to him about it. Otherwise the uncertainty is just going to eat away at your relationship like a virus.\u2019</p><p>I nodded. \u2018You\u2019re right. You are good at this.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know. So are you going to take my advice?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I have a little insecurity problem, so it might take me a while to gather the nerve to approach him about it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018In other words you\u2019re afraid he\u2019s going to turn around and say that he\u2019s in love with this Blair person.\u2019</p><p>I frowned. \u2018You might want to add mind reader to your r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah, I think we\u2019ve established that I am awesome.\u2019 She grinned cheekily.</p><p>I smiled back. \u2018Agreed.\u2019</p><p>Just as quickly as her grin had appeared, Olivia grew serious again. \u2018Find the courage to talk to him, Jo, or it\u2019ll blow out of proportion.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Courage?\u2019 I furrowed my brow. \u2018Do you think I can download that from the Internet?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It wouldn\u2019t surprise me. But it\u2019ll probably come with strings attached and a whole host of nasty ramifications.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So I\u2019m going to have to steal it from someone else, then?\u2019</p><p>\u2018What do you mean steal courage? Johanna Walker, you\u2019re one of the bravest, strongest people I\u2019ve ever met, and that\u2019s saying something \u2013 I come from Arizona, where about six million people willingly live in torturous heat between May and September.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Cam says he thinks I\u2019m strong, too,\u2019 I murmured disbelievingly.</p><p>\u2018Girl, talk to him. I cannot believe that a man who looks at you in a way that actually makes me think that being in a relationship might be pretty sweet could possibly be in love with someone else.\u2019</p><p>I sucked in a deep breath. \u2018Okay. I\u2019ll talk to him.\u2019</p><p>Olivia smacked me on the back, making me wince. \u2018That a girl!\u2019</p><p>A few hours later I said goodbye to Uncle Mick and Olivia on Princes Street with plans to meet them for dinner during the week, and then I dropped Cole off at the Omni Centre, where he was meeting up with his friends. Before I left, he grabbed my arm.</p><p>\u2018Jo, you okay?\u2019 he asked, his eyebrows drawn together in concern.</p><p>I marvelled that I was now looking my brother in the eye. I wished he wasn\u2019t so tall for his age; it would at least allow me to pretend he wasn\u2019t growing up if he still looked like a wee boy. However, height or no height, nothing could diminish his intuitiveness. It was a part of who he was, it was a part of our relationship \u2013 he knew me too well. I shrugged. \u2018I\u2019m okay.\u2019</p><p>Cole stuck his hands in his jeans, hunching over, his head bowed towards me, his eyes searching mine. \u2018Is there something I should know?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m just feeling a little off. It\u2019s a girl thing,\u2019 I reassured him with a soft smile. \u2018Now go. Hang out with your friends and be immature. Responsible,\u2019 I added hurriedly, \u2018but immature.\u2019</p><p>He made a face. \u2018Do those two go hand in hand?\u2019</p><p>\u2018If your immaturity can lead to consequences, then it\u2019s irresponsible.\u2019</p><p>Cole grunted. \u2018You should write that shi\u2013 stuff down.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I heard the \u201cshit\u201d in there, baby boy, and I\u2019m stealing the last Pop-Tart as punishment.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Harsh, Jo.\u2019 He shook his head, backing off with a smile. \u2018Harsh.\u2019</p><p>I rolled my eyes and gave him a little wave before I left him there, hoping to use the walk back home to bolster my courage.</p><p>By the time I was standing outside Cam\u2019s door I was pretty sure I was ready to call him on his bullshit. Having already texted him to let him know I was on my way, I didn\u2019t bother to knock. \u2018It\u2019s me,\u2019 I called as I stepped inside and shut the door.</p><p>\u2018In here.\u2019</p><p>I followed his voice to the sitting room and was surprised to find that Nate was with him. Even more surprising, the telly wasn\u2019t on. Glancing down at the coffee mugs and the half-eaten sandwiches from the local deli, it was clear that Nate had stopped by for a chat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My heart thumped.</p><p>Uh-oh. That couldn\u2019t be good, right?</p><p>\u2018Hey, Nate.\u2019 I smiled tremulously.</p><p>\u2018Jo. Looking gorgeous as always, babe.\u2019 He grinned at me, dusting the crumbs off his fingers.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how to greet Cam. After our encounter with Blair, he hadn\u2019t touched me. Cam, who didn\u2019t seem to be able to breathe without touching me, hadn\u2019t placed a single fingertip upon me. No handholding, no waist squeezing, no affectionate neck nuzzles. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d been in his company once since we started dating without him giving me a neck nuzzle.</p><p>Not really feeling in the mood to be rejected by his sudden disinclination to touch me, I didn\u2019t go over to him to kiss him like I normally would. I just stood there awkwardly, gazing at him. He didn\u2019t look the least hungover, the lucky bastard. \u2018How are you feeling?\u2019</p><p>Cameron didn\u2019t answer me right away. In fact, for what felt like the longest moment, he sat there cradling his coffee mug in his hand as his eyes roamed my face, drinking in every single feature. Slowly, a smile stretched his lips, the tenderness in his gaze causing an ache to blossom in my chest. \u2018A lot better, baby. A lot better.\u2019</p><p>There seemed to be more behind his words than an update on his physical health. I just couldn\u2019t work out what it was.</p><p>\u2018Well, my work here is done.\u2019 Nate clapped his hands on his knees and stood up.</p><p>I followed his movements, completely confused. \u2018What work?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh.\u2019 He shook his head, smirking like he had a secret. \u2018Feeding brewery boy over there.\u2019 Still smiling, Nate approached me and pressed a soft kiss to my cheek, his dark eyes glittering happily as he pulled back. \u2018Always good to see you, Jo. Catch you later.\u2019</p><p>\u2018 \u2019Bye,\u2019 I answered quietly, stunned by his affection, confused by his and Cam\u2019s mysterious behaviour, and wondering what the hell I\u2019d walked into.</p><p>\u2018See you, mate,\u2019 Cam called to him, and Nate waved to him, then left us in the quiet emptiness of the flat.</p><p>My nose wrinkled in bemusement, I turned back to Cam. \u2018What was that all about?\u2019</p><p>Cam shook his head, setting his mug down on the coffee table. \u2018He just came around for a chat.\u2019 His lips tilted up at the corners. \u2018Why are you still over there when I\u2019m over here?\u2019 He curled a finger, beckoning me towards him with a sexy confidence that immediately set off little green flags in all my erogenous zones. The revving of my sexual engines purred in my ears, the flags waving, ready to drop ...</p><p>I physically shook myself, attempting to remind myself that I came here to talk to him, not to throw myself at him at the first opportunity. Just because Cam was suddenly feeling all nice and affectionate didn\u2019t mean I had to give in to him. I wanted answers about his behaviour yesterday.</p><p>Didn\u2019t I?</p><p>\u2018Jo?\u2019 Cam raised an eyebrow. \u2018Get over here, babe.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019 I jutted my chin out, my eyes narrowed on him. What kind of game was he playing with me? \u2018If you want me, come and get me.\u2019</p><p>A low growl was the last thing I heard before he moved, at surprising speed for a hungover person. One minute he\u2019d been in the armchair, the next he was on the other side of the room, his body pressing me back on to his work desk. Manhandling me a little roughly, he gripped my thighs, wrapping my legs around his hips so he could grind his erection into me. I clung to him, my hands on his waist, my head thrown back in instant pleasure as he nuzzled my neck.</p><p>\u2018Cam,\u2019 I groaned, trying to remember what the point in my visit had been as he thrust his hips, the denim around his hard-on rubbing against the seam between the legs of my own jeans. I panted, wet and needful. What was going ... what were we ... what?</p><p>I felt his tongue on my throat and ground harder against his movements.</p> <p>His lips peppered kisses up my neck to my ear. \u2018I missed you this morning,\u2019 he whispered hoarsely.</p><p>\u2018You did? I thought you\u2019d be too hungover to notice.\u2019 My hands slid up his back to wrap around his neck, my fingers curling in his hair as I angled his head so I could look in his eyes and see if I could discern the truth in them. I took a deep breath, terrified that what I was about to say might conclude with experiencing the abject loss of Cam in my arms. \u2018You were off yesterday. After ... Blair ...\u2019</p><p>Cam nodded carefully, running his hands up and down my outer thighs in what appeared to be a reassuring gesture. \u2018I was taken aback to see her. I got lost in my thoughts for a while.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You got drunk.\u2019 I smiled weakly. \u2018Are you sure everything is okay? That ... we\u2019re okay?\u2019</p><p>His eyes gentling, Cam grasped my chin in his hand. \u2018Baby, we\u2019re more than okay.\u2019 He kissed me, pulling me closer, deeper, and I relaxed into him with a groan. God, I wanted to believe him more than I\u2019d ever wanted to believe anyone in my life.</p><p>His tongue teased my lower lip as I felt his fingers on the button of my jeans. I pulled back, anticipation and arousal knocking the rest of the questions I had out of my head. He\u2019d reassured me we were okay. That was enough. I licked my lip where his tongue had just been and held his scorching gaze as he unbuttoned me. After the last button was popped, Cam cradled my hips and slid me forward gently so that my ass was hanging precariously off the edge of his desk. His warm fingers slid inside my waistband and I held on to the desk, lifting my hips up to give him better access as he eased my jeans down my legs. They came off, along with the red flats I was wearing.</p><p>Teasing me, Cam slowly pulled my underwear down my legs and when they were off, he stuffed the knickers in the back pocket of his jeans.</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re such a perv.\u2019</p><p>He laughed quietly, watching me as I watched him unzip his jeans. He shoved them and his boxers down to his ankles, his eyes never leaving my flushed face as he slowly stroked his cock.</p><p>I squirmed, my legs unconsciously widening.</p><p>Cam stepped forward, his jeans rustling around his ankles, and just when I thought he was about to slide inside me, he lowered himself to his knees and pushed my thighs apart, insinuating his face between my legs.</p><p>\u2018Oh, God,\u2019 I groaned, throwing my head back at the electric touch of his tongue on my clit. I grasped his hair, holding on, rocking gently against his mouth as he licked me and spurred me towards climax.</p><p>And then he sucked on my clit. Hard.</p><p>I cried out, coming against his mouth in an explosion of light and heat. My muscles were just relaxing when he stood up, gripped my hips, tilted them upward, and slammed his dick inside me so deep it was almost painful. I gasped, clinging to him as my inner muscles pulsed around him in little aftershocks.</p><p>His grip on my skin was bruising, his movements rough, hard and frenetic, but I didn\u2019t care. Already the tension had started to coil inside me again, and my sputtered breaths and cries for more mingled with his animalistic growls and grunts.</p><p>I was hot.</p><p>Too hot.</p><p>I wanted to rip off my T-shirt and his, but that would mean stopping, and nothing could stop me now.</p><p>One hand left my hip to grasp the back of my head, and then he crushed his mouth over mine, a panting, gasping slide of lips and tongue ... no finesse, just a wild need to mimic with our mouths what his dick was doing to my insides. He tilted my hips up more, dislodging my mouth from his as I held on. His eyes were dark with possessiveness as he pounded into me.</p><p>I felt like my entire body must be glowing with fiery fractures, as each thrust pushed me towards breaking point.</p><p>And finally ...</p><p>I shattered.</p><p>The orgasm came in wave after wave, and I was so caught up in the extraordinary moment I barely even heard Cam\u2019s growled \u2018Fuck!\u2019 as he climaxed, jerking against me as he came hard.</p><p>My hand slipped on the desk as my muscles liquefied, and Cam\u2019s arms came around my waist, holding me up as he continued to pant into my shoulder.</p><p>It was the roughest sex I\u2019d ever had, a kind of pleasure-pain experience. I didn\u2019t know if my body\u2019s epic response had been to the rough sex or to the possessive, seemingly unearthly need Cam had appeared to be driven by, a need to have me, to claim me. He was always a little like that during sex, but this had been ... different.</p><p>Almost desperate.</p><p>\u2018Did I hurt you?\u2019 he asked quietly, sounding remorseful.</p><p>I shook my head against his shoulder, the material of his T-shirt, damp with sweat, rubbing against my cheek. The smells of his aftershave, the sea breeze detergent he used, and his fresh sweat were comforting. \u2018No.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re sure?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Positive.\u2019 I laughed a little. \u2018Although I could sleep for a month now.\u2019</p><p>He snorted. \u2018Me too.\u2019 He pulled back, smiling softly, tenderly, as he brushed his knuckles down my cheek. \u2018Nothing feels as good as being inside you.\u2019</p><p>And there he went, pushing back all my insecurities. \u2018Nothing feels as good as having you inside me.\u2019</p><p>His kiss was warm and sweet, so soft in comparison to the sex we\u2019d just had ... like whatever had happened between us had reassured him and taken the edge off.</p><p>I remembered Andy telling me he\u2019d never seen Cam so happy as he was with me, and I suddenly felt stupid for having doubted us. For having doubted him. Like a contented kitten, I leaned back on my elbows and watched as Cam pulled his jeans back on. He told me to stay there. He disappeared out of the room and returned a few minutes later with a washcloth. Up until then I\u2019d still felt a little embarrassed whenever Cam helped me clean up after sex, but something had just changed between us and I felt secure again. If possible, even more than I had \u2013 I no longer felt embarrassed. I felt ... powerful.</p><p>I widened my legs with a come-hither smile and his blue eyes flashed at my wickedness.</p><p>\u2018Sexy as fuck,\u2019 he muttered, pressing the cloth between my legs.</p><p>My eyelashes fluttered shut at the coolness of it, and I lifted myself a little to help him. Warm lips closed down over mine, his tongue pushing into my mouth. The cloth disappeared, and I cried out into his mouth as two thick fingers slid inside my swollen passage.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t take any more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shook my head, moaning as I pulled away from him. \u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>Cam disagreed. He pumped his fingers in and out of me, watching my face intently. I had thought that after that huge climax it would take some time to work me up to another, but my body was still tautly strung, and his penetration along with the torturously gentle flick of his thumb against my clit sent me crashing headlong into another orgasm.</p><p>It was gentler, but my skin was almost burning with overuse.</p> <p>\u2018You\u2019re trying to kill me.\u2019</p><p>Cam kissed me again, and I felt the cloth back between my legs.</p><p>I was still trembling when he helped me off the desk and eased my jeans back up my legs. I didn\u2019t even bother asking for my underwear. I knew what the answer would be.</p><p>After a little while, we were settled on his couch. I lay between his legs, my back against his chest as we watched a movie. I felt relaxed for what felt like the first time in days. I couldn\u2019t actually believe that it was only yesterday we\u2019d bumped into Blair. It felt like it had been preying on me for weeks.</p><p>Cam laughed loudly at the telly and I turned my head to smile up into his face. \u2018You\u2019re definitely in a better mood today.\u2019</p> <p>His arm tightened around me. \u2018Things are good today. Incredible sex, great company and good friends. Which reminds me, did I tell you I\u2019m having a party next week?\u2019</p><p>I smiled and shook my head.</p><p>\u2018Aye, I was telling Nate and Blair about it. I\u2019m inviting everyone around to the flat next weekend. Invite Olivia.\u2019</p><p>All I heard was \u2018... and Blair about it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Blair?\u2019</p><p>Cam nodded, looking back at the television, his concentration on me waning. \u2018I spoke to her this morning just before Nate got here. Thought it would be nice for her to catch up with Nate and Peetie.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018I thought you said it was a shock seeing her yesterday?\u2019 I was trying to ignore the banging of my heart against my chest and I really hoped Cam couldn\u2019t feel it.</p><p>\u2018It was. But it was a good shock. Bumping into Blair was just what I needed \u2013\u2019 Cam snorted at the screen. \u2018What the hell is he going to do with that?\u2019 His focus on the movie cut him off in midsentence. What did he mean, \u2018Bumping into Blair was just what I needed\u2019?</p><p>And just like that I was back at square one.</p><p>Now was the time to ask him outright how he felt \u2013 in plain English \u2013 about having Blair back in his life. What did it mean for us? How did he feel about Blair? Was he still in love with her?</p><p>Oh, God. Was that what the happy, rough sex was all about?</p><p>I felt my chest tighten and I couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Was his good mood due to his conversation with Blair? Was he transferring possessive, lovey-dovey thoughts for her to me because I was here and willing?</p><p>Or were my big, fat, illogical, psychotic insecurities rearing their ugly heads again and twisting everything around?</p> <p>\u2018You okay?\u2019 Cam asked softly, running his hand up and down my arm.</p><p>Tell him! Ask him!</p><p>But I was terrified. If I asked and he did still love Blair, Cam would feel compelled to tell me the truth and I would have to get up out of his arms and never return to them again.</p><p>How pathetic that I could willingly sit with him in a lie just to feel his breath on my ear?</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m fine,\u2019 I whispered softly, snuggling against his chest. I closed my eyes. \u2018Just tired.\u2019</p><p>His fingers brushed through my hair and I punched back at my insecurities. The sex earlier, the cuddling now \u2013 that couldn\u2019t be about anybody but me.</p><p>Cam cares.</p><p>He really cares.</p><p>\u2018Jo? I know when something\u2019s wrong with you. Your whole body goes tense.\u2019</p><p>Dammit!</p><p>I sighed and pulled back, leaning my hands on his chest as I looked up into his familiar and wonderful face. My stomach was suddenly a riot of butterflies. \u2018I\u2019m just wondering if I should be worried that the love of your life is suddenly back in it?\u2019</p><p>Cam\u2019s eyebrows slammed together. He looked completely baffled by my question. \u2018I never said she was the love of my life. I said we used to be in love. Used to be. We\u2019re both different people now. Well, I am at least.\u2019 He traced my lip with his thumb, his eyes following the movement before finding their way into mine. \u2018You\u2019ve got nothing to be worried about. I told you that. You believe me, right?\u2019 His hand slid to the nape of my neck, his strong grip bringing my face even closer to his. \u2018You trust me?\u2019</p><p>When Cam gazed at me like that, with such intensity and sincerity, it was hard to reply with anything but a quiet affirmation: \u2018I trust you.\u2019</p><p>26</p><p>As though Cam sensed that I needed a little reassurance, he texted me more than usual over the next few days despite how busy he was. We were both busy. To the delight of both me and Cole, Uncle Mick and Olivia had decided to stay in Edinburgh indefinitely. I spent time helping them search for flats online and sending them links to decent ones during my quieter periods at work, since Uncle Mick was preoccupied with looking into setting up a painting and decorating business in Edinburgh. I\u2019d put him in touch with Braden as a start for building a profile and contacts, but Mick also had a lot of stuff to figure out financially, and Olivia and I were happy to let him get on with that while we searched for flats. I was a little surprised when Olivia informed me that we were looking for two flats, but she insisted that she\u2019d been relying on Uncle Mick too much lately and it was time she took back control of her life \u2013 starting with renting her own place.</p><p>On top of that, I found myself playing referee with regard to Joss\u2019s wedding plans. Ellie still hadn\u2019t given up her hopes of turning Joss into a romantic, and Joss, in my effort to talk her out of homicidal thoughts, needed a reminder every now and then that she loved Ellie and would be greatly upset with herself if she \u2018accidentally\u2019 offed her maid of honour.</p><p>So, a little overwhelmed that week and unable to see Cam as much as I would have liked, I thought it was nice of him to keep in contact with me so much during the day, and even lovelier of him to stop by on Wednesday to take me for a long lunch.</p><p>I was seated behind the reception desk waiting for him when he strode into the estate agents office wearing his worn jeans, boots and ragged Def Leppard T-shirt, looking sexy and cool and utterly at home in his own skin. I watched my colleague Anna, who worked in admin with me, stop in the middle of her conversation with Ollie, one of our agents, to slaver over Cam as he strolled past her.</p><p>My face split into a big grin and I hurried around the desk to greet him. I should have been embarrassed by the long kiss he smacked on me, but I wasn\u2019t. I was just so pleased to see him.</p><p>\u2018Hey, you,\u2019 I murmured, pulling back to affectionately stroke his scruffy cheeks.</p><p>His eyes drifted down my body and were filled with more than a little appreciation when they returned to my face. \u2018You look good, baby.\u2019 I was wearing a black high-waist, calf-length pencil skirt with a sleeveless white silk blouse tucked into it. On my feet were four-inch black-and-white stilettos that took me a couple of inches above his head. He clearly didn\u2019t care. \u2018Very sexy secretary.\u2019</p><p>\u2018My God, is this the boyfriend?\u2019 Ryan, one of the younger estate agents, asked teasingly from behind Cam.</p><p>Cam turned with a raised eyebrow, taking in the good-looking guy in his well-cut suit. Ryan was exactly the kind of guy I would have dated pre-Cameron, and I think Cam knew it. I felt the instant tension in his body.</p><p>I pressed closer to Cam, understanding after my own recent bout of insecurity and jealousy (neither of which had completely gone away) how much it helped to be reassured by your partner. To make it clear that I was with Cam and Cam alone, I curled an arm around his waist. \u2018Yes, this is Cameron.\u2019</p><p>Cam nodded at Ryan, still appraising him.</p><p>Ryan grinned in response. \u2018We all thought you were a phantom, mate.\u2019 His eyes shot over Cam\u2019s shoulder to me and a decidedly flirtatious spark flared to life in them. \u2018We just thought Jo was pretending to have a boyfriend to keep us all off her back.\u2019</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>\u2018Pardon?\u2019 Cam murmured, and I felt his hand slide down from my waist to cup my hip, pulling me even tighter against him.</p><p>Ryan laughed, holding up his hands. \u2018Ah, don\u2019t worry. We know she\u2019s taken. You\u2019re a lucky bloke.\u2019</p><p>I heard Anna giggle nervously when Cam\u2019s face remained intimidatingly impassive. I decided it was definitely time for lunch. \u2018Well, we\u2019re going now,\u2019 I announced cheerily, reaching across my desk for my purse. \u2018See you in a bit.\u2019</p><p>With his arm still around my waist, Cam led me out of the office and we walked in silence up the hill past Queen Street Gardens. By the time we got to the restaurant, this delicious little place on Thistle Street, I\u2019d received three grunts in response to the three questions I\u2019d asked him about work.</p><p>When we had settled at our table, he sat and looked at me for a moment and then said quietly, \u2018I must have counted at least five guys in there, all our age.\u2019</p><p>Trying not to get pissed off at him, since I\u2019d acted like a jealous shrew (at least inwardly) at the weekend, I nodded.</p><p>\u2018And I take it they all flirt with you like that wee git was.\u2019</p><p>I shrugged. \u2018You\u2019ve seen guys flirt with me, Cam. They flirt at the bar all the time.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s different. Friendly banter gets you tips there.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t say I flirt back with these guys. That\u2019s why Ryan cracked a joke about you being real. They\u2019ve never seen you, but I talk about you all the time.\u2019 I leaned forward. \u2018You asked me to trust you. I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d trust me back.\u2019</p><p>After a moment, Cam relaxed and leaned an elbow on the table, running his hand through his hair in frustration. \u2018I\u2019m just tired. Sorry. Not in a great mood.\u2019</p><p>I reached over and took his other hand. \u2018It\u2019s okay. You\u2019re allowed to be in a shitty mood.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not today. We haven\u2019t seen each other since Monday. I\u2019m not going to spend our lunch together snapping your head off because you\u2019re too fucking gorgeous for your own good.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pleased, I laughed, and the mood between us relaxed. By the time the food arrived we\u2019d caught each other up on everything that had happened that week.</p><p>\u2018I think Cole has been missing judo,\u2019 I said. Cam had been too busy to attend class, so Cole had missed out too. Consequently he\u2019d seemed restless and bored all week. When Cam didn\u2019t answer, I looked up from my salmon to find him texting. \u2018Something wrong?\u2019</p><p>He shook his head. \u2018Nah, it\u2019s just Blair.\u2019</p> <p>And just like that, a dark cloud rolled over our table and burst, drenching me in cold, wet miserableness. I waited a couple of seconds, but he continued to text. My patience snapped. \u2018Can you text her later? We\u2019re supposed to be spending time together.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sorry.\u2019 He flashed me a look of concern before hitting SEND and tucking his phone back in his pocket. \u2018She left her Kindle at my flat last night.\u2019</p><p>I felt like he had just kicked me in the stomach. His casual announcement knocked the breath out of me and it took me a moment to pull myself together. \u2018She was at your flat last night?\u2019</p><p>Catching the accusation in my tone, Cam\u2019s eyebrows knitted together. \u2018Is that a problem?\u2019</p><p>My blood heated and I had a sudden vision of throwing my salmon and potatoes in his face and screaming, \u2018Yes, it\u2019s a fucking problem!\u2019</p> <p>Instead, I pushed my plate back and gave him a look that suggested he was a complete and utter dunce. \u2018Let\u2019s see ... you were alone in your flat last night with your ex-lover. Why on earth would that bother me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ve been over this. We\u2019re just friends.\u2019</p><p>\u2018And if I have a problem with that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You said you trusted me.\u2019</p><p>I leaned over the table, keeping my voice low, trying not to cause a scene. \u2018Ten minutes ago you acted like a possessive asshole in my place of business over a couple of guys flirting with me. How can you not see that inviting your ex-girlfriend over to your flat and not telling your current girlfriend is a huge bloody problem?\u2019 My voice rose on the last three words and people turned to look. Cheeks burning, I stood up from the table. \u2018I\u2019m going back to work.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Johanna.\u2019 Cam stood to stop me, but I\u2019d already grabbed my bag and moved towards the doorway, leaving him in my dust, knowing he couldn\u2019t follow me before paying for our meal.</p> <p>I was so upset I couldn\u2019t return to work immediately. I let myself into the Gardens and sat on a bench tucked behind a tree, and I sniffled away to myself.</p><p>Being with Cameron had turned me into an emotional wreck.</p><p>My phone rang. It was Cam. I ignored him.</p><p>And then I got a text.</p><p>Baby, I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re right. I would have been pissed off, too. Come by the flat after work so we can talk. I hate fighting with you. x</p><p>I swiped the tears out of the corner of my eyes before I picked up the phone to text him back.</p><p>Okay. x</p><p>That was all he was getting. After all, I was still hurt and severely pissed off at his inconsiderate assholery.</p> <p>Although I\u2019m not one of those people who infect everyone else with their bad moods, I was so lost in my own thoughts for the rest of the day that my colleagues gave me a wide berth, sensing my misery. I didn\u2019t know what I would say to Cam when I saw him. Was I going to get over the whole Blair thing? I didn\u2019t think so. Was I going to make him choose between me and her? I wanted to, but that just made me the shittiest person ever. I couldn\u2019t dictate to Cam who he was and was not friends with.</p><p>By the time I knocked on his door I felt ill with uncertainty.</p><p>He opened the door, looking relieved to see me. I gave him nothing, brushing by him briskly. I strode into his living room and the first thing I saw on the coffee table was her effing Kindle. I dumped my bag and threw my phone on the table beside it. \u2018She\u2019s not picked it up, then?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jo ...\u2019</p><p>At his plaintive tone, I spun on my heel and raised an eyebrow at him. \u2018You know I was willing to believe it was just me. Just me and my stupid insecurities. But having her over here without telling me, that was really crap of you, Cam.\u2019</p><p>It had been a long time since I\u2019d seen Cam look guilty. The last time, in fact, had been when he realized he\u2019d been wrong about me, when we\u2019d sat in this room and I\u2019d trusted him with my life story. He had the same look on his face now. \u2018I am sorry I didn\u2019t tell you. But it was completely innocent.\u2019</p><p>I bit my lip, feeling my stomach roil with emotion. \u2018I have a problem with her,\u2019 I confessed.</p><p>\u2018She hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. Jo, Blair and I were friends before we were a couple, and I\u2019m just catching up with an old friend. That\u2019s it. You need to grow up about this.\u2019</p><p>I hated him. Right then, I actually physically hated him.</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t speak to me like that, you condescending dick.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jo \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why didn\u2019t you tell me she was here last night?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t hide it from you. I told you at lunch. If something was going on I wouldn\u2019t fucking tell you, would I?\u2019 His voice began to mimic mine, rising in frustration.</p><p>\u2018You said you loved her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Loved. Past tense.\u2019</p><p>Ignoring his growing impatience, I crossed my arms over my chest and attempted to drive my point home. \u2018You didn\u2019t break up because you fell out of love, Cameron. You broke up because you were scared she was going to leave you. You were scared she wasn\u2019t going to choose you and so you walked away first.\u2019</p><p>Anger sparked in his eyes and he took a few steps towards me, bearing down on me. \u2018You don\u2019t know shit.\u2019</p><p>For once I wasn\u2019t daunted. I was too pissed off. \u2018I know I\u2019m right.\u2019</p><p>Cameron cursed under his breath and looked down at the table where her Kindle was. \u2018This conversation is insane.\u2019</p><p>Before I could respond to that non-answer to my non-question, my phone rang. I was about to turn around to pick it up and shut it off when I froze at the look on Cam\u2019s face. His eyes had narrowed on my phone, studying it, it seemed. Gently brushing me aside, he reached to pick it up. As he stared at the screen, his jaw clenched, the muscle in his cheek popping as he lifted furious eyes to my face.</p><p>My heart suddenly began to pound in my chest.</p><p>Cam turned the phone towards me. The screen read MALCOLM CALLING. \u2018What\u2019s he doing calling you? What? Did you go running off to him at the first sign of trouble?\u2019</p><p>I flinched at the accusation. \u2018No. We talk sometimes.\u2019</p><p>Wrong thing to say. \u2018You\u2019ve kept in contact with him and you didn\u2019t tell me?\u2019</p><p>Uh-oh. I shrugged.</p><p>Cam gave a huff of disbelief. \u2018I\u2019m standing here getting grilled about Blair and you\u2019ve been keeping Malcolm from me? Why? Why not tell me?\u2019</p><p>I threw up my hands, wondering how on earth the argument had turned on me. \u2018Because it doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s just a friend.\u2019</p><p>His expression turned glacial, jealousy and anger and disgust in his eyes.</p><p>And his next words broke my heart.</p><p>\u2018No. Blair\u2019s just a friend. Malcolm\u2019s a rich fuck who still has a hard-on for you, and he lets you dangle him on a string. Got a problem with me hanging out with Blair? Think I\u2019m keeping her around in case you and I don\u2019t work out? Well, what\u2019s to say you\u2019re not ready to spread your legs for Malcolm if what we have goes south?\u2019</p><p>I guess that\u2019s the problem when you really get to know someone. You learn all their triggers and emotional buttons, and unfortunately, in times of war, you press them. The button Cam pressed had direct access to my tear ducts, and salt water spilled down my cheeks in anguished silence. I took a step away from him, feeling sick. I ignored his remorseful expression, concentrating on those ugly words and what they meant.</p><p>They meant he had never stopped thinking of me as a shallow gold-digger. He\u2019d never believed that I could be more than that. Not really. Did that mean he\u2019d never meant anything he\u2019d said to me?</p><p>The pain wouldn\u2019t allow the silence to hold and I lost control of a sob.</p><p>\u2018Fuck, Jo.\u2019 He swore hoarsely, trying to reach for me. \u2018I didn\u2019t \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Don\u2019t touch me.\u2019 I ripped my phone out of his hands and seized my purse.</p><p>\u2018Jo, I didn\u2019t mean it.\u2019 He grabbed my arm. \u2018I was just \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Let go!\u2019 I screamed in his face, wrenching myself away from him, frightened that if I let him touch me I\u2019d give in to him as I always did. I sagged with grief as I backed away.</p><p>\u2018I didn\u2019t mean it.\u2019 His eyes were bright with a panic I couldn\u2019t quite process.</p><p>\u2018What are we doing?\u2019 I shook my head. \u2018Is this worth it? Is it worth the way I\u2019ve been feeling the last few weeks? I feel raw all the time, like my heart has been laid out on a butcher\u2019s block and you\u2019re hammering away at it. I thought it was me. I didn\u2019t feel smart or interesting enough for you. I kept thinking, \u201cAny minute now he\u2019s going to wake up and wonder what the fuck he\u2019s doing with me.\u201d \u2019</p><p>Cam sucked in a breath. \u2018No \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018I thought it was me,\u2019 I repeated. \u2018That my insecurities were the problem. Not you and Blair. But then last night, you hanging out with her ... not telling me, not talking to me about it, expecting that I would be okay with it? And maybe not telling you about Malcolm wasn\u2019t right either. But none of that really matters in the face of this.\u2019 I wiped a hand down my cheek, trying to clear the stream of tears. But as I began to speak again, more poured out. \u2018You said you wanted me to see that there was so much more to me than even I realized. No one had ever told me I was smart or talented or brave, or that I deserved more than what I\u2019d asked for. Until you. And it turns out you never really believed that. You always believed that deep down I\u2019m just this shallow girl that would fuck her way to a gold mine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No,\u2019 he argued, taking hold of my arms to shake me. \u2018I was just pissed off. It came out wrong. I didn\u2019t mean it.\u2019 He tried to pull me into a hug, but I struggled against him. \u2018Baby, stop, just stop. I can\u2019t \u2013\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pushed at him and shoved at him until he let me go, and I glared into his face with every shred of my tattered self-respect. \u2018You said it. It means it\u2019s in there somewhere.\u2019 And then I threw out, \u2018And I saw the way you reacted to Ryan.\u2019</p><p>As he dragged a hand through his hair, Cam\u2019s expression changed from remorse to agitation. \u2018Well, he is the kind of stupid prick you\u2019d go for.\u2019</p><p>I shook my head in disbelief. \u2018You really think that after everything between us, he\u2019s the kind of guy I\u2019d go for?\u2019</p> <p>\u2018You really think that, after everything, I\u2019d cheat on you with Blair?\u2019</p><p>\u2018You cheated on Becca with me.\u2019 I winced as soon as the words were out of my mouth. That was a low blow.</p><p>Cam huffed, looking at me incredulously. \u2018And you cheated on Malcolm with me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is that what you really think?\u2019 I repeated his words back at him. I felt more tears tremble on my lashes and I hated that he could reduce me to this snivelling mess. \u2018That I\u2019ve been holding on to Malcolm in case this ends?\u2019</p><p>He shrugged, his expression stony. \u2018Do you really think I\u2019ve been waiting on someone better to come along? That I\u2019m using you?\u2019</p> <p>I wiped my nose with the back of my hand and looked away, unable to stare into his eyes as I answered hoarsely, \u2018I think you never stopped seeing me as that girl. The one you didn\u2019t respect very much.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Then maybe you really aren\u2019t that smart after all.\u2019 His tone was cutting, horrible.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think anyone had sliced me as deep with their words as he had. And I hated that he had that kind of power over me.</p><p>He sighed and I finally looked at him, watching as he rubbed a hand down his face and turned away from me. In a weary voice he suggested, \u2018Maybe you better go before we say more ugly shit we don\u2019t mean.\u2019</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer him in words.</p><p>I just left.</p> <p>27</p><p>I had difficulty finding sleep that night. I finally drifted into unconsciousness in the wee hours of the morning and was awoken at ten thirty by the loud bing of a text notification on my phone.</p><p>It was from Uncle Mick, reminding me that I\u2019d agreed to go flat hunting with him. That was fine. Probably better to keep my mind off my fight with Cameron anyway.</p><p>I\u2019d swayed back and forth on the whole thing during the night. Part of me felt like our argument was ridiculous, that it was ludicrous to be feeling this much pain over misunderstandings. I wondered if they were all misunderstandings of my own making. Three times I almost picked up the phone to call Cam, to talk it through, to try to make sense of all the drama. I\u2019d watched crap like this on the telly, read about it in books, and although I\u2019d enjoyed the angst of it all, I\u2019d rolled my eyes and thought of how it never really happened in real life. People weren\u2019t that stupid.</p><p>Well, we were.</p><p>I was.</p><p>In the end I didn\u2019t call him. I decided my wounds were still too fresh to talk to him just yet. Since I was sixteen years old I hadn\u2019t been without a boyfriend, and during the months in between relationships, I\u2019d been on the hunt for a boyfriend. I\u2019d spent so much time believing Mum and Dad, believing I was nothing, that instead of putting effort into fighting the hateful crap they\u2019d fed me all my life, I\u2019d bought into it and thus clutched on to men I believed had all the attributes I lacked.</p><p>Cam had been different from the start, but I\u2019d still launched myself into a relationship with him. I\u2019d begun to rely on him. More than that, I\u2019d begun to rely on his opinion of me as a person to make me feel better about who I was. I was more than a little cut up inside at the thought of losing that good opinion \u2013 or worse, that he\u2019d never really had a good opinion in the first place.</p> <p>I shook my head at that thought. Even though my mind was all over the place because of him, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to believe that he\u2019d never seen more in me. Everything he\u2019d done for me, all the looks he\u2019d given me, the affection, the tenderness, it couldn\u2019t be fake. I knew it couldn\u2019t be fake.</p><p>Maybe taking a day away from each other to calm down was best. We could talk it out tomorrow.</p><p>Chest aching, I nodded to myself. That sounded like a plan.</p><p>I got up out of bed to see Cole off to school. He took one look at me and he knew. \u2018You and Cam have a fight?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Bloody clairvoyant,\u2019 I muttered irritably under my breath as I passed him to make some tea.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll take that as an aye.\u2019</p><p>I grunted.</p><p>\u2018Is it bad?\u2019 He suddenly sounded worried and very much like a little boy.</p><p>I looked at him over my shoulder. Cole was trying to act cool, like a fight between Cam and me was no big deal, but I knew he would be anxious about what it meant for his friendship with Cam. I shook my head at him. \u2018We\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be fixed.\u2019</p><p>Relief glinted in his eyes as he gave me a sympathetic smile. Sympathy from Cole. I must really look like crap.</p><p>I closed my eyes. God, I hoped Cam and I could fix this.</p><p>I loved him.</p><p>Heaving a heartfelt sigh, I opened my eyes and squealed.</p><p>Spider.</p><p>On my mug.</p><p>\u2018Cole!\u2019 I yelled, frozen on the spot.</p><p>\u2018Spider?\u2019 he asked casually, his footsteps coming closer.</p><p>He knew my squeal so well.</p><p>\u2018Mug.\u2019</p><p>I never moved a muscle as Cole calmly tilted the mug out of our kitchen window, depositing the spider on the sill, much as Cam had done with the humungous spider that had been in his kitchen. I felt a wave of longing at the memory of that day and tried to squash it just as quickly as it had risen.</p><p>Cole gestured the mug at me and I made a face. \u2018Bin it.\u2019</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u2018Just wash it in hot water.\u2019</p><p>\u2018If you think I can put that mug to my mouth without forever remembering that those spindly, hairy \u2013 eeeeeh\u2019 \u2013 I shuddered \u2013 \u2018legs were on it, you\u2019re mental.\u2019</p><p>With another eye roll, he threw the mug in the bin and I slumped with relief.</p><p>Damn all the spiders of the world. They were putting a serious dent in my road to independence. When Cole came over and kissed my hair before going to school, I knew I had progressed from looking like crap to just looking pathetic. Still, his affection gave me the warm fuzzies and for a moment I forgot my worries about Cam.</p><p>I hurried in the shower and got dressed in something comfortable for flat hunting with Uncle Mick. As I was passing Mum\u2019s bedroom, I sighed in exasperation. Mum hadn\u2019t popped her head out of her bedroom for days, and the only reason I knew she was alive was because I heard her snoring. It occurred to me as I stood in our quiet flat that I hadn\u2019t said a word to her in a week. Not one word. Maybe that\u2019s a good thing, I thought with a surprising amount of sadness. Maybe I would never learn to think more of myself if I continued to let Mum get close enough to poison my attempts. And maybe if I thought more of myself, I wouldn\u2019t feel so irrational over Cam\u2019s friendship with Blair.</p><p>Then again, maybe that was just wishful thinking.</p><p>Uncle Mick and I were lying on the hardwood floor of the two-bedroom flat on Heriot Row. A street that was mere minutes away from Dublin Street, it skirted the north side of Queen Street Gardens. More importantly, it was just around the corner from Jamaica Lane, where Olivia had just signed a lease on a one-bedroom flat above a coffee shop. It was all coming together for her. Proving it\u2019s who you know once again, Clark managed to get Olivia an interview at the university library. They\u2019d been impressed with her postgraduate degree in library science from the States as well as her six years of work experience. They had taken her on, on a temporary contract to be reviewed for permanency in six months\u2019 time.</p><p>She seemed happy. Nervous but happy.</p><p>Mick was worried.</p><p>Since Olivia had started her new job today, I\u2019d offered to accompany Mick to see the unfurnished flat that was so close to his daughter\u2019s new home. Unfurnished wasn\u2019t ideal, but the location was. The rental was under the Carmichael banner, so Ryan was the one viewing the flat with us. When we suddenly lay down on the floor, our eyes studying the level of craftsmanship in the decor, Ryan had stared at us wide-eyed and then said, \u2018Uh, I\u2019ll wait outside.\u2019</p><p>Uncle Mick and I used to lie like this when he took me on jobs with him. During our lunch break we\u2019d lie down on the dust sheets and talk nonsense to one another. Today, I wasn\u2019t in the mood for nonsense. I was in the mood for answers.</p><p>\u2018Are you going to tell me why you keep hovering over your adult daughter like she might disappear or shatter into a million pieces at any second?\u2019</p><p>Mick heaved a sigh, rolling his head to the side to look at me. His golden eyes were soft with affection for me, but I could still see that glimmer of sadness at the back of them.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m a father. I worry, baby girl.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Is it because she\u2019s carrying all this guilt about Yvonne?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She told you that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019</p><p>\u2018My girl is tough, just like you, and she\u2019s going to be okay. I know that. But I\u2019m her dad and she\u2019s moved to a new country, left all her friends behind, and is starting over. I want to make sure she\u2019s okay, and I\u2019ll worry if I can\u2019t be near her. So what if I have to put up with bad paintwork in order to do that?\u2019 He gestured to the main wall, where the paint had dried in uneven brushstrokes. \u2018Something happens, she needs me, she calls me, and I\u2019m literally seconds away.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So you\u2019re taking this place, then?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aye.\u2019 He sat up, pulling me with him. \u2018Fancy a trip to Ikea?\u2019</p><p>I grinned. \u2018Lucky for me today was payday.\u2019 Mick looked confused. \u2018I can go a little accessory mad when I shop at Ikea.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ah.\u2019 He chuckled and helped me to my feet.</p><p>As I dusted off my bum, I became aware of the heat of Mick\u2019s sudden and intense scrutiny.</p><p>I looked up and raised an eyebrow at his grave expression. \u2018What?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m worried about you, too.\u2019 He brushed my hair off my face, stroking my cheek with his callused thumb. \u2018You look tired.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shaking my head, I gave Mick a glum smile. \u2018I had a fight with Cam.\u2019</p><p>He frowned. \u2018About what?\u2019</p><p>And so I laid it out for him, telling him about Blair and my insecurity over their friendship and my worry that Cameron would never really respect me the way he would respect someone like Blair.</p> <p>\u2018All that\u2019s going on in your head?\u2019 Mick asked in disbelief.</p><p>Confused, I nodded slowly.</p><p>\u2018Jesus Christ, woman. I doubt very much Cam was thinking any of the shit you threw at him last night. It probably felt like it came out of nowhere. You know, men don\u2019t think like women.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well ...\u2019 I pulled a face. \u2018That\u2019s because you have the emotional capacity of a shot cup.\u2019</p><p>Mick huffed in amusement as we met Ryan outside. \u2018I\u2019ll take it, son.\u2019 He nodded at him.</p> <p>\u2018Great.\u2019 Ryan beamed. \u2018Let\u2019s get you back to the office so we can sign all the forms.\u2019</p><p>We followed Ryan down the street as he talked at someone on his phone. Everything about him was so polished, so rehearsed. I actually couldn\u2019t believe that only four months ago I would have been attracted to the douche bag.</p><p>Douche bag?</p><p>Oh, Christ, I was spending too much time with Cole these days.</p><p>\u2018Back to my earlier point,\u2019 Uncle Mick suddenly said, drawing my gaze away from Ryan\u2019s well-tailored jacket. \u2018I think you\u2019re overthinking the whole thing. I think you\u2019ll find that boy cares a great deal about you and would be willing to compromise. And I can tell you for a fact he didn\u2019t mean what he said last night. You know we all say shit we don\u2019t mean when we\u2019re angry.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You think he cares a great deal about me?\u2019</p> <p>Rolling his eyes (someone else was spending too much time with Cole, too), Mick sighed. \u2018Of course he does. Jesus Christ, girl. Get your head out of your arse.\u2019</p><p>I\u2019d been planning on popping down to Cam\u2019s before my shift at the bar that night, but when I tried his door there was no answer. Since he hadn\u2019t texted me or called me, I thought perhaps it was a good thing anyway. Maybe he needed time away from me to cool down.</p><p>I received a text from Joss before heading to work, explaining she wouldn\u2019t be in tonight because she\u2019d caught a bug that Declan had picked up at school and couldn\u2019t keep anything down.</p><p>Lovely.</p><p>She said Sadie was covering for her.</p><p>Brian greeted me cheerily at the door to the bar and introduced me to our new doorman, Vic. He was this huge, hulking Polish guy I wouldn\u2019t want to mess with. I smiled hello at Vic and got a stoic nod back. I raised an eyebrow at Brian. \u2018What happened to Phil?\u2019 Not that I would miss him.</p><p>\u2018Left us for greener pastures,\u2019 Brian replied with a shrug.</p><p>Mimicking his shrug, I went inside to find Sadie and Alistair working behind the bar. Su still hadn\u2019t found a replacement for Cam, so Alistair was back to covering the shifts that he could. Sadie was a twenty-one-year-old postgrad student who usually worked Monday nights. She seemed like a cool girl. She was outgoing and funny and very smart. We\u2019d only worked together a few times, so I didn\u2019t really know her that well, and tonight would be busy so I didn\u2019t imagine that would change in any way.</p> <p>Three hours later the place was packed. The three of us were worked off our feet and I hid in Su\u2019s office during my break since the sound level was much quieter in there. I also obsessively checked my phone, but Cam still hadn\u2019t got in touch. Biting my lip, I wondered if I should be worried, but then it occurred to me that I hadn\u2019t contacted him either, and maybe he was sitting looking at his phone, worrying about why I hadn\u2019t texted him.</p><p>God, I hoped so.</p><p>When I got back to the bar, it was so busy I thankfully didn\u2019t have time to dwell on my relationship. In fact my head was so into work that when the guy first pushed his way to the front of the bar and leaned across it I didn\u2019t recognize him. I shot him a quick, irritated look, not having much patience with anyone who shoved himself to the front of the queue, but I hurried down the bar to get a beer for my customer, not registering who he was. It wasn\u2019t until I stretched back up from the fridge and realized he\u2019d shoved his way down to the end of the bar to be near me that I took the time to really look at him.</p><p>Grey-blue eyes stared at me out of a rugged, older man\u2019s face. His hair was cropped close to his head, but I could see the sprinklings of grey among the dark strands. There were attractive lines around his eyes, and his face hadn\u2019t softened with age. It was still rough-hewn. His powerful shoulders and chest suggested he was still as fit as he\u2019d ever been.</p><p>Those hard eyes glittered at me and I felt my world flip upside down.</p><p>\u2018Dad?\u2019 I mouthed, disbelieving that he was standing at the bar in front of me.</p><p>I wanted to run. I wanted to hide. No. I wanted to run home, grab Cole, and then hide.</p><p>\u2018Jo.\u2019 Murray Walker leaned across the bar. \u2018Good to see you, lass.\u2019</p><p>I found myself stumbling towards him, the pounding noise of chatter and music fizzling to a quiet murmur. I put the beer on the bar with a trembling hand.</p><p>Murray eyed my shaking fingers and smirked as he turned his gaze back on my face. \u2018Been a long time. You\u2019re all grown up. You\u2019re even prettier than your maw was.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hey, can I get served?\u2019 an irritated girl beside Murray asked. The irritation melted to fear when Murray whipped his head around to glare at her.</p><p>\u2018What are you doing here?\u2019 I asked, loud enough to be heard over the music, hating myself for the quiver in my voice.</p><p>\u2018Been trying to find you for fucking ages, ever since I got out.\u2019 He grunted, his face twisting into that familiar expression of hate. \u2018Bitch took off and didn\u2019t tell me where you were going. Then I did a google search on you the other week there and where did you crop up but in a picture with a multimillionaire from Edinburgh. The article said you worked here. It was an auld article like, but I thought I\u2019d try my luck.\u2019 He flashed me a grin that didn\u2019t reach his eyes.</p><p>My whole body was shaking now. The blood was rushing in my ears, my pulse points throbbing and my stomach churning. I clasped my hands behind my back, trying to still the tremors. \u2018Wh-what do you want?\u2019</p><p>Murray\u2019s eyes narrowed and he leaned over the bar. I instinctively moved back. \u2018I want to see my son, Jo.\u2019</p><p>It was my worst fear realized.</p><p>I feared it more than I feared Murray Walker.</p><p>\u2018No.\u2019</p><p>He curled his lip at me. \u2018What?\u2019</p><p>I shook my head, eyes blazing. \u2018Never. I\u2019ll not let you near him.\u2019</p><p>He huffed, seeming amazed at my audacity. He slammed a hand on the bar with a twisted smile. \u2018I\u2019ll let you think on that very carefully, lass. See you soon.\u2019 And just as quickly as he\u2019d appeared, he melted back into the crowd.</p><p>The noise, the music, came flooding back and I staggered against the bar in absolute shock.</p><p>\u2018Jo, you okay?\u2019</p><p>Blinking rapidly, seeing little dark spots all over my vision, I turned on unstable feet to find Alistair peering into my face in concern. \u2018I feel \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Whoa.\u2019 He reached for me as I swayed towards him. \u2018Okay, you\u2019re taking a break.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Too busy ...\u2019 I murmured.</p><p>Something cold was pressed into my hand as Alistair led me towards the staff room. I glanced down at the bottle of water. \u2018Sadie and I have this, so just take a minute or two. You\u2019re probably dehydrated. It\u2019s hot in here tonight. Go on, drink up,\u2019 he insisted, and then once he was sure I was obeying his order, he hurried back out to the bar to help Sadie with the customers.</p><p>My heart was still pounding. I gazed at the wall. Trying to process what had just happened.</p><p>Murray Walker was back.</p><p>He was still a mean bastard.</p><p>And ... Cole. He wanted to see Cole. I shook my head, bending over on a gasp as tears pricked my eyes.</p><p>No. Never.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>What was I going to do?</p><p>I took a taxi home that night, terrified that Murray would be waiting outside the bar for me. He wasn\u2019t. Still ...</p><p>I lay in bed staring at the ceiling.</p><p>This could break me. I could curl up and cry and become that little girl he\u2019d abused. I could run to Cam.</p><p>But Cole was mine to protect. He\u2019d always been mine to protect. And anyway, Murray was just playing with me. He\u2019d had no interest in wanting to see Cole when he was in Cole\u2019s bloody life, and now he\u2019d come to me. Not Mum. Me.</p><p>Then I did a google search on you the other week there and where did you crop up but in a picture with a multimillionaire from Edinburgh.</p><p>The bastard didn\u2019t want Cole. He wanted money.</p><p>He was going to blackmail me for money.</p><p>Stupid asshole. I didn\u2019t have any money!</p><p>I shook my head and turned on my side, pulling the covers tight around me. I\u2019d just tell him that Malcolm and I were over and I didn\u2019t have access to his money any more. I was pretty sure that then he\u2019d go slithering back into his little hole in Glasgow.</p><p>That was it, settled then. There was no need to tell anyone about this. Murray would be gone before I knew it.</p><p>Sleep evaded me for another night.</p><p>28</p><p>Thankfully Cole put my subdued behaviour the next morning down to the reigning silence between me and Cam.</p><p>\u2018You should talk to him,\u2019 my little brother had advised as if it was the most obvious solution in the world. I\u2019d just nodded at him and promised him I was nipping down to see Cam before work tonight.</p><p>Cam still hadn\u2019t texted me.</p><p>Then again, I still hadn\u2019t texted him.</p><p>Zombified from lack of sleep, I didn\u2019t do much that day. When I popped out for some groceries I felt as though eyes were following me the entire time, paranoid that Murray had found me again. I hurried home and stayed in the flat for the rest of the day.</p><p>When I was sure Cam would have returned home from work, I threw plenty of concealer on the dark circles under my eyes and walked down to his flat on shaking legs. I didn\u2019t know what to say to him, where to start ...</p><p>I\u2019d worked myself up into such a nervous mess that it was sort of deflating to discover that he wasn\u2019t home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That had not been an outcome I\u2019d imagined when I\u2019d been guessing as to how our conversation would go. Mostly I hoped it would conclude with a lot of apologies from both of us, Cam agreeing never to see Blair again and then taking me wildly on his couch.</p><p>If he wasn\u2019t home, none of those things would happen.</p><p>A little nonplussed, I moodily returned to the flat. Cole was having dinner at Jamie\u2019s after school and returning home later that night. He was of course under strict orders to inform me when he got back to the flat. Strict orders or not, he had been getting a little lax lately with keeping me informed. Well, with thoughts of Murray riding me, baby boy would not be getting away with radio silence tonight. I\u2019d be on his back like hair on a gorilla.</p> <p>Determined to at least see Cam\u2019s face (I missed the asshole, goddammit), I knocked on his door on my way out to work. Again there was no answer. I pressed my ear against the door, but there was no sound of movement, no sound of the television, no music.</p><p>Where was he?</p><p>I glanced at my phone as I left the building, wondering if I should text him, make the first move, and it vibrated in my hand. My heart leaped into my throat as the message envelope blinked at me. Relief rushed through as I swiped the lock screen away and saw Cam\u2019s name.</p><p>Think maybe it\u2019s time we talk, baby. Can you come down to the flat tomorrow morning? Please. x</p><p>I sucked in the fresh air, feeling at least one weight lift off my shoulders. I nodded, as though he was there in front of me, and quickly sent him a reply.</p> <p>I\u2019ll be there. x</p><p>I was just getting on the bus for work when my phone vibrated again.</p><p>I chuckled and settled into my seat. A smiley face. A smiley face was always a good thing, right?</p><p>Joss was still unwell, so I was working with Sadie and Alistair again. Alistair inquired immediately if I was feeling better, and I lied and told him I was fine. It was nice of him to ask. Alistair was a sweet guy. I was glad, however, that we\u2019d been so busy the night before that he hadn\u2019t noticed Murray\u2019s appearance. If Alistair had seen the interaction between us, he would have known something was wrong and he would have peppered me with questions. He was a sweet guy, but he was also a nosy bastard, and if I hadn\u2019t given him answers, which I wouldn\u2019t have, he would have sought out Joss for them. Joss would then be involved and well ... she had a way of unearthing all of my secrets.</p><p>It was just as busy as it had been the night before, and I was a jittery mess. I got drink orders mixed up, I dropped not one but two glasses, and in general caused Alistair to raise his eyebrows so many times he could have been mistaken for a Muppet.</p><p>When the time for my break arrived, I couldn\u2019t have been more relieved. I threw back water, staying away from anything with caffeine in it, since it would probably only make my nerves worse, and I pulled out my phone. Cole still hadn\u2019t texted me.</p> <p>I rang him.</p><p>\u2018Uh, hullo?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Uh, hullo?\u2019 I sniped. Sometimes worrying could turn me a mite crabby. \u2018You were supposed to text me when you got home. Are you home?\u2019</p><p>I heard him sigh heavily and had to stomp down on my aggravation so I didn\u2019t scream at him. \u2018Aye, I\u2019m home. And when are you going to start talking to Cam again so you can stop being a total \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Finish that sentence and die.\u2019</p><p>Silence governed on the end of the line.</p><p>I scowled. \u2018Are you still there?\u2019</p><p>He grunted in response.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u2019 I tugged on the end of my ponytail, wrapping my hair around my fist. \u2018You locked the door, right?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Of course.\u2019 He sighed again. \u2018Jo, is there something else bothering you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Nope,\u2019 I answered quickly. \u2018Just, you know, I worry, so next time I ask you to text me, text me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Fine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Okay. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u2019</p><p>With another grunt he hung up.</p><p>As I blew out the air between my lips in relief that he was home and safe, I noted the envelope in the top left-hand corner of my phone screen. I clicked on the unopened message. It was from Joss.</p><p>The Reign of the Vomit is over! Hope you\u2019re not missing me too much:)</p><p>I choked on a weak laugh and texted her back.</p><p>Are you telling me you\u2019re well enough to be working but aren\u2019t? Tut tut, Mrs Carmichael, tut tut. x</p><p>Two seconds later my phone binged.</p><p>I was well until you called me that:\\</p><p>Better get used to it x</p><p>Fuck!</p><p>I laughed for real now, shaking my head. She was worse than a bloke. Poor Braden had his work cut out for him with that one.</p><p>Feeling somewhat better, I returned to the bar, praying the evening would be over quickly. For the next few hours I couldn\u2019t help but scan the crowds for Murray\u2019s face, but as the night wore on and he didn\u2019t show, I started to feel antsy. Part of me had wanted him to appear so I could get our confrontation over with. The sooner he realized I wasn\u2019t with Malcolm anymore and didn\u2019t have the kind of money he was after, the quicker he\u2019d get the bugger out of Edinburgh.</p><p>Last night I\u2019d called a cab to pick me up at the door of the bar, but tonight I was feeling defiant. I was still angry at myself for reacting to Murray like I was ten years old again and defending myself against his fists. I didn\u2019t want him to know I was frightened of him. I didn\u2019t want him to think he had that kind of power over me. I wanted him to think he\u2019d never left a mark on me.</p><p>So I (in retrospect, stupidly) took my usual route home \u2013 walking to Leith Walk in hopes of grabbing a taxi with its light on once I got there.</p><p>I stood on Leith Walk for five minutes, waiting for a taxi to turn down the wide road. The only one that did was mobbed by a small group of guys. As the taxi drove away, I stood there for a minute, listening to two drunken girls across the street shout names at one another.</p><p>I was starting to get uneasy standing there alone. It never usually bothered me because Edinburgh was still so alive at this time in this area \u2013 people were still out and about, witnesses to halt any nefarious intentions of a creepy stranger. But I had goose bumps and the hair on the nape of my neck prickled. I whipped my head around, scanning back up the road I\u2019d just walked down. I couldn\u2019t see anyone watching me.</p><p>With a weary huff, I decided to just walk home. It was a fair wee walk at this time and I didn\u2019t particularly enjoy walking down the very long London Road, but I didn\u2019t want to hang around any more.</p><p>I was just about to turn the corner on to Blenheim Place when something made me look back. Call it a sixth sense, a chill down the spine, a warning ...</p><p>My heart shot up into my throat.</p><p>A dark silhouette was a few yards behind me. I recognized the lope. Growing up, we called it the \u2018hard man\u2019 lope. The gentle but forced swagger of the shoulders, chest puffed up, steps deliberate. It was usually adopted by men when they were going into some kind of \u2018battle\u2019. My dad had walked like that all the time, though. Then again, every second of every day he\u2019d treated life as one big battle and everyone as an enemy.</p><p>Murray Walker was following me.</p><p>I quickly looked in front of me, and without really even taking the time to think about it, I took the path up the cobbled streets of Royal Terrace instead of London Road. It ran adjacent to London Road on higher ground, but I knew there was a path by the church that would take me into Royal Terrace Gardens. I raced into the entrance, and the climb burned in my muscles, but I pushed on, taking the wide path that veered steeply up along the outskirts of Calton Hill. The precipitous pathway would eventually slope downward and bring me out on to Waterloo Place, and from there I\u2019d go west back on to Princes Street. Then it was north to Dublin Street.</p><p>All that really mattered was misdirecting Murray.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t know where we lived.</p><p>I was so panicked at the thought of him finding the flat that I didn\u2019t think clearly and I didn\u2019t see the error in my plan.</p><p>Me. Alone. On a dark, rough, muddy pathway. At night.</p><p>The adrenaline was pumping through me as I marched upward. I attempted to listen for the sound of footsteps behind me, but my heart was racing so hard it was pulsing blood in rushing waves into my ears. The palms of my hands and my underarms were damp with cold sweat, and I couldn\u2019t breathe properly, my chest rising and falling in ragged breaths. I felt sick with fear.</p><p>When I finally heard the heavy footsteps behind me I glanced back and saw my dad\u2019s face under the wash of moonlight. He was pissed off.</p><p>All the determination I\u2019d had earlier to stand and face him and show him he didn\u2019t scare me just disappeared. I couldn\u2019t let go of that little girl who was terrified of him.</p><p>And so, like her, I tried to run.</p><p>My feet slapped against the steps as I ran upward as hard and fast as I could, wishing I could conjure up people, witnesses. But no one was there.</p><p>I was alone.</p><p>Except for the pounding of heavy boots behind me.</p><p>At the hard, warm grip of his hand around my arm, I made a noise of loud distress that was quickly muffled by his other hand clamping down over my mouth. The smell of sweat and cigarette smoke flooded my nostrils as I fought him, my nails biting into his arm, my legs trying to kick out as I was dragged off the path. I lost my grip on my bag with my pepper spray as I fought him.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t strong enough, and now I was unarmed.</p><p>Murray slammed me back against the rocky, grass-covered slope of the hillside and pain shot through my skull before shooting all the way down to the tip of my toes. Tears leaked from my eyes as he held me there, his large hand around my throat.</p><p>I grunted against the other hand that was still clamped over my mouth.</p><p>He tightened his grip on my throat and I stopped squirming.</p><p>Despite the fact that his face was mostly cast in darkness, I could still make out the anger that stretched his features taut. \u2018Trying to give me the runaround?\u2019 he hissed.</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer. I was too busy wondering morbidly what he was going to do to me. My body began to shake hard, and I lost complete control of my breathing. He felt the gulping breaths behind his palm and smirked.</p><p>\u2018I won\u2019t hurt you, Jo. I just want to see my son.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Knowing it would bring me physical pain, I still shook my head \u2018no\u2019.</p><p>Murray\u2019s smirk grew into a smug smile, as though he\u2019d won something. \u2018I suppose we better come to an arrangement then. I\u2019m going to take my hand off your mouth and you\u2019re not going to scream. If you do, I won\u2019t hesitate to hurt you.\u2019</p><p>I nodded, wanting at least one of his disgusting paws off me. As I stared up into his face, I saw not for the first time how there was nothing behind his eyes. I didn\u2019t think I had ever met anyone in my entire life who was as callously selfish as this man. Was he really my father? There had been no connection between us other than that of abuser and victim. To me he\u2019d been the reason for the knot in my stomach when I heard his rattling old banger of a car pull up to the house. The affection I\u2019d felt for Mick, the eagerness to see him, the warm contentment of safety he gave me, was exactly what I should have felt for this man. But a man was all he\u2019d ever been to me. A man with mean eyes and even meaner fists. For the longest time I\u2019d despaired that he didn\u2019t love me as a father should. I\u2019d questioned whether there was something wrong with me. Looking at him now, I wondered how I could ever have questioned myself. I wasn\u2019t the problem. He was. He was the shameful one, not me.</p> <p>I sucked in a deep breath when he let go of my mouth, but he put more pressure on the hand around my throat as an extra warning to be quiet.</p><p>\u2018Now.\u2019 He leaned into me and I could smell the beer and cigarettes on him. He hadn\u2019t been in Club 39, but he\u2019d obviously been in one of the bars near it, waiting on me. \u2018I might just give up my right to see the wee man if your boyfriend made it worth my while. Say a hundred grand?\u2019</p><p>I knew it. And straight to the point. He didn\u2019t even care. He was as soulless as he\u2019d ever been. How could someone be that way? Was he born soulless, black to his rotten core? Or did life make you that way? How could you hurt your own children and not feel like a monster? Maybe a monster was too far gone to realize he\u2019d become one ...</p><p>\u2018I stopped seeing Malcolm months ago. You\u2019re out of luck.\u2019</p><p>He squeezed my throat and panic suffused me. I automatically grabbed his hand, my nails biting into his skin. He didn\u2019t seem to notice. \u2018I\u2019m sure you can persuade him somehow.\u2019 He pushed his face into mine, his breath reeking of smoke and stale beer. \u2018I had myself a bonnie bairn. She\u2019s fucking useless but bonnie. It\u2019s a commodity, Jo. Use it or I\u2019ll come for Cole.\u2019 He let me go and I sucked in a breath, my fingers brushing my neck to reassure myself that his hand was definitely no longer there. \u2018If I wanted to, I could become a right pest in your lives, lass.\u2019</p> <p>Fury that he could do this to me, to Cole, after so long, after thinking we were free, took over and the fear was burned to hell in a blaze of rage. \u2018Commodity\u2019s a pretty big word for you, Murray. Looks like someone finally taught you to read.\u2019 I rebelliously hoped my eyes conveyed my condescension clearly even in the shadows. \u2018But reading does not a smart man make. I don\u2019t have money. You\u2019ll need to whore yourself out to an old prison buddy.\u2019</p><p>I barely even saw the blur of his fist coming towards my face.</p><p>My head flew back, the muscles in my neck screaming with the impact and the burning heat of his fist hitting my mouth spread into my lower cheek and jaw. Tears of pain fell from my eyes as I brought my head slowly back around to face him, my lip feeling a million times bigger than normal. The warm trickle of blood oozed from an already stinging cut in my lower lip where my teeth had snagged the skin.</p><p>There was nothing behind his eyes as his other fist flew low and hit me hard in the gut, bowing me over. All control fled me as I panicked, trying to draw in air. I hit the ground knees first and he kicked me in the side, sending unbelievable pain flaring through my ribs as I collapsed on the muddy footpath, loose stones and dirt biting into my skin.</p><p>My body couldn\u2019t decide whether it couldn\u2019t breathe or was going to be sick.</p><p>Hard fingers bit into my chin and I cried out, the air rushing into my lungs. Every muscle, every nerve, every piece of bone felt as if it was on fire. I clutched my ribs as Murray held my head up by my chin. \u2018You get me that money, lass. I\u2019m renting the flat above the Halfway House on Fleshmarket Close for a few days. You\u2019ve got two days to bring the money to me there. Got it?\u2019</p> <p>The hurt in my ribs was unbelievable. I could barely concentrate on what he was saying.</p><p>\u2018I said got it?\u2019</p><p>I nodded feebly, sighing with relief when he abruptly let go of my chin.</p><p>And then he was gone.</p><p>The thick scent of beer and nicotine had disappeared. I was lying on the cold ground, my lip throbbing, my ribs aching and my head screaming with fury. At him. At myself.</p><p>I should have taken Cam up on those self-defence lessons.</p><p>At the thought of Cam I began to cry, cradling my sore side as I pushed myself up on to quivering legs. I swayed against the hillside, feeling light-headed. My body began to shake uncontrollably.</p><p>I think I was going into shock.</p> <p>I shook my head, trying to clear it. I didn\u2019t have time to go into shock. I had two days to get the money to Murray. A burst of pained energy propelled me forward.</p><p>Malcolm would give me the money. Malcolm would take one look at me in this state and give me the money, no problem. He was that good a guy.</p><p>I stumbled back down the path I\u2019d run up, picking up my fallen purse, desperation and adrenaline making my progress hurried despite the pain I was in. I could phone Malcolm, get him to come and get me.</p><p>His name whirled in my brain as I came out of the gardens and did a U-turn at Leopold Place at the top of London Road. I kept to the trees where I could and then in shadow as much as possible in case I met anyone on my way. I didn\u2019t want the police involved. If I got the police involved they might start looking into my whole family life and ... I just couldn\u2019t risk it.</p><p>If Malcolm paid, this would all go away.</p><p>Before I knew it I was standing outside the familiar building.</p><p>At the sight of it I began to cry harder, my breath hissing as my teeth caught my burst lip.</p><p>Malcolm wouldn\u2019t pay.</p><p>Malcolm wouldn\u2019t pay because I didn\u2019t want Malcolm to help me. I didn\u2019t want anybody but Cameron.</p><p>I let myself into our building and pulled myself up the stairs, determined to get to him and to throw my arms around him. I cried harder. I needed to feel safe and only Cam could give me that.</p><p>I lightly hammered on his door, and sucked in my breath as agony ripped through me. Lifting my arm was like ripping a stitch across my ribs. My body moved forward to lean on the frame and then the door was suddenly wrenched open. My heart was wrenched out of my body with it.</p><p>Blinking, I tried to compute the image in front of me. I shook my head to clear it, but it didn\u2019t go away.</p><p>Blair gasped at the sight of me bloodied and crying. \u2018Jo? What happened?\u2019</p><p>My eyes travelled down the length of her and back up again.</p><p>Her short hair was wet and curling around her jaw and she was wearing Cam\u2019s QOTSA T-shirt. She was so small it fell to just above her knees. Her bare knees. Her bare legs.</p><p>Blair was at Cam\u2019s with wet hair, wearing only his T-shirt at two thirty in the morning?</p><p>\u2018Oh, my God.\u2019 She reached for me and I wobbled back. \u2018Cam\u2019s in the bathroom. I\u2019ll just get hi\u2013 Jo!\u2019</p><p>I was already running, stumbling, falling, tripping my way back down the stairs. In that moment I couldn\u2019t be anywhere near that building. I couldn\u2019t go home to Cole like this, and Cam ...</p><p>I threw up beside the rubbish bins.</p><p>Wiping my hand across my mouth, I glanced up the road.</p><p>I needed a taxi.</p><p>I needed my friend.</p><p>If Cam ... I stifled a sob, hurrying around the corner and up London Road ... if Cam wasn\u2019t ... then I had to go someplace that was safe.</p><p>The only good thing to happen to me that night came in the shape of a taxi with its light on. I threw out my hand and the cabbie pulled over. Still cradling my rib, I shakily got in.</p><p>\u2018Dublin Street,\u2019 I told him, speaking awkwardly with my split lip.</p><p>He eyed me warily. \u2018You all right? Do you need a hospital?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dublin Street.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re in a bit of a state \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018My people are on Dublin Street,\u2019 I insisted, tears pricking my eyes. \u2018They\u2019ll take me.\u2019</p><p>The taxi driver\u2019s moment of hesitation was long enough for Cam to come skidding around the corner in T-shirt and jeans, his frenzied eyes searching up and down the street before swinging to meet mine in the cab. Features pale and drawn, he moved towards me just as the cab pulled away, his muffled shout reaching my ears over the sound of the engine.</p><p>My phone rang seconds later. I picked it up but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u2018Jo?\u2019 he yelled, the word coming out in a puff that told me he was out of breath, probably from running after me. \u2018Where are you going? What happened? Blair says you\u2019ve been attacked? What\u2019s going on?\u2019</p><p>Hearing the fear in his voice did nothing to soothe my heartbreak or quell the bitterness I felt for him in that moment. \u2018I guess that\u2019s no longer your concern,\u2019 I answered numbly and hung up to the sound of his frantic shouting.</p><p>29</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m going to kill him,\u2019 Braden threatened with such quiet veracity that a shiver rippled down my spine. An unyielding blaze of retribution burned in his eyes. Another shiver followed in the wake of the last just as Joss dabbed at my lip.</p><p>I hissed at the sting of TCP against my cut and threw Joss a wounded look.</p><p>She winced, pulling back the cotton wool. \u2018Sorry.\u2019</p><p>Braden took a step towards me, all bristling angry male and even in a T-shirt and jogging pants he was intimidating. \u2018Where is he?\u2019</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u2018Tell me, Jo.\u2019</p><p>When I didn\u2019t he took another step towards me and demanded coldly, \u2018Tell me.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You, back off!\u2019 Joss yelled up at him, her own eyes bright with anger and anxiety. \u2018You\u2019re starting to scare Jo.\u2019 Her voice quieted but didn\u2019t lose its authority. \u2018And I think she\u2019s been through enough for one night, don\u2019t you?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They stared each other down for a moment and then Braden muttered something under his breath and stepped back. Renewed respect for this woman took hold in me. She might be small but she was extremely fierce \u2013 the kind of friend everyone needed on their side.</p><p>When Joss had opened the door after I hammered on it for what felt like five minutes, she\u2019d stared at me in shock for a second, standing there half asleep in pyjamas with her hair a wild mess around her shoulders. When I tripped towards her, my expression pained, dried blood crusted on my face and shirt, it was the first time I had real evidence of how deeply she cared about me. She pulled me inside and I felt her body trembling with anger as she helped me to the living room, her hoarse voice shouting to Braden for help.</p><p>I collapsed on their couch, exhaustion leaching all strength out of me now that I\u2019d got to them. While Joss tried to clean the cut on my lip, I explained to them what had happened. Then Braden\u2019s scary caveman threatening began.</p> <p>\u2018Is it really bad?\u2019 I asked Joss softly, my quaking fingers tentatively touching the area around my lip. It felt tender and swollen.</p><p>Joss scowled. \u2018You\u2019re lucky he didn\u2019t knock out a tooth.\u2019 She looked down at my left side. \u2018You\u2019ll need to have your ribs looked at.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t think they\u2019re broken.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, are you a doctor now?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Joss,\u2019 I said with a sigh, \u2018if you take me to the hospital there will be questions and police and I can\u2019t have the social services looking into our situation right now. Mum is worse than ever. They might take Cole away.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Jo, your mum can\u2019t help her illness, and you\u2019re there looking after him,\u2019 Braden spoke up, his voice reassuring.</p><p>With my eyes I told Joss I thought she was amazing. She\u2019d kept my secret and she\u2019d even kept it from Braden. I appreciated it hugely, but I was more than a little tired of having the secret in the first place. As if it was something I should be ashamed of. \u2018Braden, my mum doesn\u2019t have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. She\u2019s a bedridden drunk.\u2019</p><p>Other than the slight raising of his eyebrows Braden didn\u2019t really react to the news. We sat in silence for a moment and then he stepped forward and lowered himself to the coffee table so he was sitting directly in front of me. For a moment I got lost in those concerned pale blue eyes of his. \u2018I\u2019ll have my family doctor look at you in the morning. He can be very discreet. Will you agree to see him?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yes, she will,\u2019 Joss answered for me belligerently.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t even looking at her and I could feel her eyes boring into me, daring me to defy her. I nodded at him and I felt the couch move as Joss slumped back with relief.</p><p>\u2018Before I see a doctor I need a plan.\u2019 I glanced from Braden to Joss, desperation and determination vying for a place in my eyes. \u2018I can\u2019t let him near Cole.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018And he wants money from Malcolm?\u2019 Joss curled her lip in disgust.</p><p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why didn\u2019t you go to Malcolm, then?\u2019 she asked, more than a little curiosity in her voice. \u2018He would give you it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He would,\u2019 I agreed, my voice soft but laced with an edge. \u2018But he\u2019s from a life I don\u2019t even recognize anymore, and I don\u2019t want to go back there. Facing him, ensuring his loyalty, it means becoming someone else again. I can\u2019t do that. I\u2019m just \u201cJo\u201d now. And I know I can\u2019t do everything by myself any more.\u2019 I gave her a wobbly smile. \u2018Good thing I finally realized I have friends I can trust.\u2019</p><p>Joss swallowed hard and reached for my hand, threading her fingers through mine. \u2018You do.\u2019 Her eyes turned ferocious as she looked over at Braden. \u2018We\u2019ll get him off your back. We\u2019ll pay the asshole to disappear.\u2019</p><p>As I turned my head I caught Braden\u2019s reluctant nod. Braden didn\u2019t want to pay him back in money. He wanted to pay him back in blood.</p><p>The ache in my side and my battered pride made me tend to agree with Braden. Would money really keep Murray away or would he eventually come back for more? He\u2019d always been like that when we were younger. He\u2019d take whatever extra cash Mum had lying around, disappear for days on end, and then return home when he\u2019d run out. The only time he ever disappeared completely was when Uncle Mick beat the crap out of him and started playing bodyguard arou \u2013</p><p>\u2018Uncle Mick!\u2019 I breathed the words in excited, sudden realization, my hand gripping Joss\u2019s so hard it was probably painful.</p> <p>\u2018Mick?\u2019 Braden\u2019s eyebrows knitted together in confusion.</p><p>I nodded. \u2018Mick. I\u2019m not letting you guys pay Murray. He\u2019ll see that as weakness and he\u2019ll come back for more. No.\u2019 I looked at them, unable to smile in triumph because of the cut. \u2018There\u2019s only one person Murray Walker has ever been afraid of and he thinks that person is in the States.\u2019</p><p>Braden smirked. \u2018Mick.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Mick.\u2019</p><p>Turning to Joss, Braden nodded towards the door. \u2018Come on, we\u2019re getting dressed. We\u2019re taking Jo to Mick and then Mick and I are paying Mr Walker a wee visit.\u2019</p><p>\u2018No, Braden, I don\u2019t want you \u2013\u2019</p><p>He held up a hand to quiet me. \u2018I\u2019m not going to fight him.\u2019 His eyes darkened. \u2018Mick and I will just have ... a word with him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Shouldn\u2019t we call Cam?\u2019 Joss asked as she and Braden stood up.</p><p>Mention of his name shot pain far more excruciating than my physical wounds through my entire body. I felt my cheeks burn as I admitted softly, \u2018I went to him first. He was a little preoccupied with Blair.\u2019</p><p>They were both silent for a moment as my meaning registered with them, and then Braden bit out a curse. He grazed past Joss, squeezing her shoulder as he flashed her a wolfish grin that didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes. \u2018Better wrap my hand up. Looks like my fist will be meeting more than one face tonight.\u2019 And with that pronouncement he strode out of the room, presumably to get changed.</p><p>I stared after him, wondering if he\u2019d meant what I thought he\u2019d meant.</p><p>Joss smiled weakly. \u2018He\u2019s kidding. Braden doesn\u2019t fight. Well ... normally ...\u2019 She raised an eyebrow in thought. \u2018He is a little overprotective, though. And he definitely doesn\u2019t like men who beat women and he doesn\u2019t like cheaters ... but he\u2019s kidding ...\u2019 She turned her head to look at the door. \u2018I think.\u2019</p><p>The Caledonian was a Waldorf Astoria Hotel, so it was a nice place. To assure uninterrupted passage through it, Joss and Braden dressed well, and I huddled behind Joss for the entire walk across the quiet reception area. It was now four thirty in the morning. Braden gave the night receptionist a brisk, no-nonsense nod, and that together with his appearance \u2013 he was wearing a black Armani trench coat over his dress trousers and shirt \u2013 seemed to assure the receptionist that we belonged there.</p><p>Butterflies were in full riot in my stomach as we rode the lift up to the fourth floor. I felt guilty for dragging Joss, Braden and Mick into this mess, but I wasn\u2019t doing it for me. I was doing it for Cole, and I had a proven track record of acting selfishly when it came to protecting Cole. Lucky for me, Joss, Braden and Mick actually cared, and I knew that they would be doing this even if I hadn\u2019t asked it of them.</p><p>As we stopped outside Mick\u2019s hotel door, Braden knocked on it loudly and Joss put an arm around my shoulder and pulled me to her. It put pressure against my side and I winced, immediately rewarded with a rambling apology from Joss. It would have been funny how many times she called herself a dick if I hadn\u2019t been trying to catch my breath.</p><p>The hotel door swung open and I was surprised to find Uncle Mick fully dressed and alert. His eyes narrowed in on me and I saw the muscles in his jaw working against his fury. \u2018I\u2019ve been trying to call you,\u2019 he said tersely.</p><p>Confused, I blinked rapidly. \u2018Um ... my phone\u2019s switched off.\u2019 I\u2019d turned it off when Cam had tried to call me again.</p><p>Mick nodded and then stepped back so we could enter his room. Braden led us in and stopped quite abruptly at the threshold. I knew why when I sidled up next to him with Joss.</p><p>Olivia and Cam were there.</p><p>Braden looked down at me, drawing my gaze. \u2018I can hit him now if you want?\u2019</p><p>I\u2019m not going to lie \u2013 I seriously pondered the suggestion before finally saying with a sigh, \u2018Not worth it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jo?\u2019 Cam asked hoarsely.</p><p>I looked at him and felt Joss\u2019s hold on me tighten. Cam\u2019s blue eyes searched my face and just like Mick\u2019s had, his expression clouded over, undiluted rage sparking to life in his eyes. \u2018Who the fuck did it?\u2019 he asked between gritted teeth.</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer his question. Having him here was incredibly painful. The anger he felt over my attack seemed fake in light of the fact that he\u2019d cheated on me with Blair. \u2018I want you to leave.\u2019</p><p>Cam closed his eyes as if he was in pain. \u2018Jo, please, what you saw ...\u2019</p><p>\u2018Just leave.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jo.\u2019 Olivia stepped forward. \u2018Give him a chance to explain.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Later,\u2019 Mick snapped, his gold eyes fixated on my wounded mouth. \u2018I want a name. Now.\u2019 I gulped, feeling the threat of violence rise in the room. Not just from Mick \u2013 his anger was infecting Cam and Braden.</p><p>\u2018Murray.\u2019</p><p>Mick\u2019s nostrils flared at the name.</p><p>\u2018Dad did it,\u2019 I clarified.</p><p>\u2018What?\u2019 he yelled, his question muffled by Cam\u2019s explosion of expletives.</p><p>Olivia strode between them, trying to calm them. \u2018We\u2019ll get thrown out of the hotel,\u2019 she warned them. She turned to me. \u2018Explain what happened.\u2019</p><p>For the second time that night I related my tale, and when I was done the air was thick with testosterone. Cam finally couldn\u2019t take it any more and he crossed the room, his shaking hand reaching to cup my chin. At the brush of his skin against mine, I tugged my head away, then grimaced at the sharp sting of pain in my neck from where I\u2019d suffered whiplash from Murray\u2019s attack. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Jo, I didn\u2019t do what you think I did,\u2019 he insisted.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look at him. All I could picture was his face above mine as he made love to me, his eyes telling me he cared, and then the image tearing down the centre to reveal him and Blair writhing naked together on his bed. My stomach turned at the thought and the pain in my chest was indescribable. So this was what it was like to be heartbroken? \u2018Why did you even come here?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I came here because I thought this was where you\u2019d go if you were in trouble.\u2019</p> <p>His response startled me. My eyes betrayed me and sought out his. He\u2019d thought I would come here? \u2018Not Malcolm\u2019s?\u2019</p><p>He shook his head, his expression desperate.</p><p>That disconcerted me. I didn\u2019t like it. I dropped my gaze, my confused thoughts giving me a headache. Cam had trusted me not to turn to Malcolm after all. He did see me.</p><p>He saw me.</p><p>I scoffed at the hope bubbling up inside me.</p> <p>He\u2019d also screwed Blair.</p><p>Deflated, I felt my shoulders slump.</p><p>\u2018Where is he?\u2019 Mick demanded. \u2018I\u2019m going to sort that fucker out once and for all.\u2019</p><p>I wasn\u2019t big on violence. Anyone who really knew me knew that. But as I looked up into my uncle\u2019s distressed and bloodthirsty gaze, I couldn\u2019t find the willpower to lie to him. I wanted to believe fighting violence with violence was never the answer. I wanted to believe that there was a better way. And maybe for other people there was. Unfortunately, fear was the only thing Murray Walker understood. He was a schoolyard bully, and bullies really were cowards at heart. Murray definitely was ... but only when it came to Mick.</p><p>One day I\u2019d have to ask Mick why that was.</p><p>Not tonight, though.</p> <p>\u2018The flat above the Halfway House on Fleshmarket Close.\u2019</p><p>Mick grabbed his phone from the bedside table and stuffed it into his pocket. He turned to Olivia. \u2018Take Jo home. I\u2019ll call you when we\u2019re done.\u2019 He nodded at Cam and Braden. \u2018You two are with me.\u2019</p><p>My eyes disobeyed me again, finding Cam\u2019s. The emotion roiling in those blue eyes of his was like an electrified net that caught me. Holding my gaze, he stepped towards me and cradled my face gently in his hands, then pressed his forehead against mine without a word. The familiar scent of him, the heat, the feel of his skin, all made me shudder with a rush of anguished longing.</p><p>\u2018You know I didn\u2019t sleep with her, Jo,\u2019 he whispered against my mouth, and everyone else just seemed to disappear. I wanted to believe him so badly.</p><p>Pulling back to gaze into my eyes, he refused to let go of me. We had a silent conversation.</p><p>You have to trust me.</p><p>I saw her there. In your T-shirt. What else am I supposed to think?</p><p>That I would never hurt you like that.</p> <p>A deluge of images flashed in flutters and whispers of colour and feeling. The tenderness in his eyes, the honesty I\u2019d known from him, our laughter, searching hands that couldn\u2019t seem to get through a day without feeling my body beneath them ...</p><p>Blair coming back into Cam\u2019s life was a problem for me. However, it had never been because I was worried he would do something so callous as cheat on me with her. Yes, I had worried that he\u2019d leave me for her, but I never believed he would cut me like that. I\u2019d trusted that he would never cut me like that. Did that trust still exist? I searched his face for the answer.</p><p>No. Cam would never cut me like that.</p><p>Something in his gaze shifted as he recognized my realization and he sighed.</p><p>There she is.</p><p>I pinned him with a look that told him he wasn\u2019t off the hook just yet. \u2018We still need to talk.\u2019</p><p>He nodded, his gaze flickering to my mouth. His own lips thinned, a hard glitter entering his expression at the sight of my bruised and swollen lip.</p><p>\u2018Does anyone else know what just happened here?\u2019 Mick asked impatiently.</p><p>Joss grunted. \u2018I think Jo just said she believes Cam didn\u2019t sleep with this Blair chick.\u2019</p><p>Braden grumbled, \u2018If only you were that intuitive about our relationship.\u2019</p><p>She glowered at him. \u2018If I wasn\u2019t so damn worried about you going off to face this guy, I might just dump your ass.\u2019</p><p>I raised an eyebrow, looking over my shoulder at her fianc\u00e9. Braden narrowed his eyes and I watched another silent conversation unfold. Whatever he said in it made her squirm.</p><p>\u2018Och, enough of this,\u2019 Mick groused cantankerously as he wrenched open the hotel door and stormed out, followed by Braden. Cam gave me one more meaningful, soulful look before he disappeared behind them.</p><p>My stomach flipped as I thought about what they were going to do.</p><p>Another cab ride took Joss, Olivia and me back to the flat. Although I was exhausted, I was awake enough to shoot the door to Cam\u2019s flat a glare so ferocious it was a wonder flames didn\u2019t erupt from the doorstep and devour it with the heat of my anger.</p><p>\u2018He explained everything to me and Dad,\u2019 Olivia suddenly said, obviously catching my look. \u2018You need to talk to him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She doesn\u2019t need to do anything but rest right now,\u2019 Joss insisted softly, taking my keys out of my purse as we climbed the steps to my flat.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s okay,\u2019 I muttered. \u2018I believe him. Seeing her was a shock, I didn\u2019t think clearly ... but Cam wouldn\u2019t do that to me. Still doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t thinking about doing it, though.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He\u2019s not,\u2019 Olivia assured me, but I was too weary to listen.</p><p>We tried to be quiet as I settled on the couch with Olivia while Joss made us all a cup of tea, but I heard Cole\u2019s door open nevertheless. I closed my eyes, drawing in a deep breath.</p><p>\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 I heard him ask, obviously talking to Joss.</p><p>She whispered something to him and the next thing I heard was his light footsteps across the hardwood floor.</p><p>\u2018What the hell?\u2019</p><p>My eyes flew open to find Cole standing over me in his pyjamas. His eyes were wide and frightened as they took in my face, and just like that he was a wee boy again. \u2018I\u2019m okay.\u2019 I attempted to reassure him, stifling a flinch of pain as I reached for his hand and dragged him down beside me.</p><p>The fear began to melt out of his eyes, to be replaced by something that was all too familiar tonight: the promise of male retribution.</p><p>\u2018Who did it?\u2019</p><p>Despite all the crap that had happened in the last twenty-four hours I was starting to feel rather loved, given all this anger and bristling on my behalf. \u2018Dad,\u2019 I answered honestly, having already decided I wasn\u2019t keeping this from him.</p><p>I told him everything. And not just about tonight. Bracing myself, I confessed to all three of them of my dad\u2019s abuse when I was young.</p><p>The last word had spilled from my mouth minutes before and still no one had said anything. We sat in the living room in a heavy silence. My stomach churned as I awaited my brother\u2019s response.</p><p>Joss was the first to speak up. \u2018Well, now I hope Mick kills the swine.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You don\u2019t mean that,\u2019 I muttered.</p><p>\u2018Doesn\u2019t she?\u2019 Olivia asked, surprising me with her anger. She was always so laid-back. \u2018People can be ... well, they can be wonderful. And sometimes, unfortunately, they can be monsters we hide from inside our homes. We worry that those monsters will find their way inside. We\u2019re not supposed to fear that they already are inside. Your mom and dad are supposed to protect you from that. They\u2019re not supposed to be the monster.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s right.\u2019 Cole leaned forward, his elbows braced on his knees, his head bent low as he stared at the floor. \u2018Mick needs to teach him another lesson. One that\u2019ll stick this time.\u2019</p><p>Hating to see him distressed, I put my hand on his back and began to rub soothing circles between his shoulder blades.</p><p>He looked back at me. \u2018That\u2019s why you fly off the handle when Mum says I\u2019m like him.\u2019</p><p>My mouth flattened. \u2018You\u2019re nothing \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018Like him,\u2019 Cole finished. \u2018Aye. I get that now.\u2019</p><p>We were silent again for a moment and then my wee brother looked over at me. \u2018You have to stop trying to protect me from everything, Jo. I\u2019m not a kid any more. You handle everything by yourself and it\u2019s not fair on you. So stop. We\u2019re a team.\u2019</p><p>Pride and gratitude bundled together to create a lump in the back of my throat, so I nodded, brushing my hand affectionately through his hair. His eyes closed at the caress and to the surprise of everyone, he tucked himself into the side of me that wasn\u2019t sore and hugged me close. We sat there so long that I drifted asleep ...</p><p>30</p><p>The whispering of hushed but agitated voices seeped into my consciousness, thankfully pulling me out of a murky dreamscape of wet leaves, blood and pounding footsteps. My sore eyes fluttered open, the blur of colour focusing quickly to reveal that I had a busy sitting room.</p><p>Olivia and Cole still sat beside me, Joss was on the armchair, and Braden was perched on the arm of it, his fingers massaging the nape of her neck. Cam and Mick stood by the fireplace with an older man I didn\u2019t recognize, and Mum was seated on the other armchair.</p><p>They were all staring at me.</p><p>I was staring at Mick.</p><p>The air around him crackled, and although I could tell he had calmed somewhat, he had the aura of a man back from battle. There was a lot of pent-up energy around him.</p><p>My eyes travelled down his arm to his hand.</p><p>Bruised knuckles.</p><p>I swallowed hard.</p><p>\u2018He won\u2019t be bothering you again, baby girl.\u2019</p><p>Our eyes caught and I felt my fear disintegrate. \u2018He wasn\u2019t expecting you.\u2019</p><p>The corner of Mick\u2019s mouth quirked up. \u2018No. That he was not. I had ... words with him.\u2019 He glanced quickly out of the corner of his eyes at the man I didn\u2019t recognize. \u2018He\u2019s gone back to Glasgow and he knows if he comes back I\u2019ll forcefully remove him.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What do you have over him, Mick?\u2019 I asked curiously, my voice raspy from sleep deprivation and pain.</p><p>He sighed, his eyes darkening. \u2018It\u2019s not what I have over him. It\u2019s what I know about him. I know which buttons to push.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shook my head, confused.</p><p>\u2018Let\u2019s just say his dad was quick to violence as well.\u2019</p><p>That information froze me in place for a second.</p> <p>Murray Walker had been abused? Now, didn\u2019t that make a whole lot of sense? A cycle of abuse. Of course.</p><p>I turned to Cole and brushed his hair back off his face. I may not have saved him from Mum\u2019s quick hands, but I\u2019d saved him from Dad\u2019s brutality. It was a small kind of consolation.</p><p>At the thought of Mum, I focused on her. \u2018We woke you up?\u2019 I asked blandly, not really giving a crap if we had or not. My father\u2019s attack had brought back my initial feelings of betrayal and anger when I first discovered she\u2019d hit Cole.</p><p>Fiona\u2019s anxious eyes searched my face. Let\u2019s not forget this was also a woman who had known that Dad beat me as a child and had let it happen for far longer than she should have.</p><p>I stiffened.</p> <p>Was that what I was doing with Cole? I knew Mum hadn\u2019t hit him since I confronted her in the kitchen, but did that really matter? He still had to live in an environment where I was nervous about leaving him alone in the flat with her. Was it selfish of me to keep him here because I feared losing him? If only she hadn\u2019t threatened to go to the authorities if I took him ...</p><p>Resolve forced its way into my bones and my eyes narrowed on her. I was a little tired of threats.</p><p>\u2018I wanted to make sure you were okay,\u2019 she muttered before her eyes flickered over everyone. Her hand instinctively went to her unwashed hair. It was a rare moment of self-consciousness, and she followed it by pulling her robe more tightly around her frail body. \u2018Now I know you\u2019re okay, I think I\u2019ll go back to bed.\u2019</p><p>I watched her silently shuffle away, a difficult decision weighing on me despite everything.</p><p>\u2018Jo, this is Dr Henderson,\u2019 Braden informed me quietly, dragging my thoughts from Mum to the distinguished-looking older man in the room, who now took a step towards me. I was acutely aware of Cam standing beside him, but I still hadn\u2019t acknowledged his presence. There was too much going on and I was really too tired to think clearly on that subject. \u2018He\u2019s going to examine you.\u2019</p><p>I smiled wanly at the doctor. \u2018Thank you.\u2019</p> <p>His kind eyes dropped to my lip. \u2018Where would you like to do this, Jo? Somewhere private?\u2019</p><p>\u2018My room will be fine.\u2019</p><p>Dr Henderson followed me silently down the hall to my small bedroom, and there he checked my cut, which Joss had already protected against infection, and then inspected my stomach and ribs. There was slight bruising around my ribs that made him purse his lips.</p><p>\u2018It seemed he wanted to frighten rather than maim entirely, Miss Walker,\u2019 Dr Henderson murmured with a hint of anger. I was guessing it was directed at my dad. \u2018He could have caused some internal injuries if he\u2019d kicked you any harder. As it is, I think your ribs are just bruised, although it\u2019s possible there could be a hairline fracture or two. You\u2019re going to feel some discomfort over the next few weeks. There\u2019s nothing I can do except advise you to take ibuprofen to reduce the inflammation and to ice the injured area as well. I\u2019ll also write you a line for work. It would be best if you take at least a week off. You don\u2019t smoke, do you?\u2019</p><p>I shook my head. \u2018I quit a few months ago.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good. That\u2019s good. If you feel any shortness of breath, or the pain worsens, or you feel any pain in your abdomen, contact me.\u2019 He held a business card out to me and I took it gratefully.</p><p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Now, I\u2019m going to leave you to rest. Get some sleep.\u2019</p> <p>Persuasion was not necessary, and I crawled into bed carefully, closing my eyes to the sound of my bedroom door shutting. I wriggled out of my jeans, hissing at the pain in my ribs. With a kick, my jeans fell out of my bed on to the floor and I pulled my duvet tighter around me.</p><p>For the first time in a very long time I felt absolutely safe. How could I not when I had a small army out there in my living room, willing to defend me until the last breath? I\u2019d been so frightened last night, so panicked, but they had taken most of that away \u2013 Joss, Braden, Uncle Mick, Olivia, Cam and Cole.</p><p>My family.</p><p>Tired muscles melted into my comfy mattress, and my eyelids drifted closed. Deep sleep claimed me for the first time in days.</p><p>It was the heat that woke me up.</p><p>Agitated, I threw off my covers and my eyes shot open with the pain as I let out a garbled cry.</p><p>\u2018Johanna.\u2019 Cam\u2019s voice was suddenly there.</p><p>My blinking, bleary eyes met his. He was sitting on the floor of my bedroom, his back against the wall, his knees drawn up, his hands dangling listlessly over them. Dark circles plagued his eyes, eyes that were lidded but still brimming with concern.</p><p>I rolled on to my elbow, clutching my ribs. It was light outside. \u2018What time is it?\u2019 I asked, my voice cracking on the words. I felt icky and warm and my mouth was dry.</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s eight o\u2019 clock in the morning. Sunday.\u2019</p><p>Oh, God. I\u2019d slept for an entire day. With effort I processed Cam\u2019s ragged appearance. \u2018Baby, have you not slept?\u2019</p><p>Something sparked in his eyes at my question. \u2018I\u2019ve drifted in and out. I didn\u2019t want to leave you. Look what happened Friday night.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not your fault.\u2019 My lips thinned and then I hissed at the sting. I\u2019d forgotten about my lip.</p><p>\u2018I want to hit him again.\u2019</p><p>My eyebrows shot skyward, his words waking me up. \u2018You hit Murray, too?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I would have killed him, but Mick thought that might be a bad idea.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ah, Uncle Mick. A man of rationality. He\u2019s such a buzz kill.\u2019</p><p>Cam\u2019s lips twitched. \u2018Glad to see your sense of humour is still intact.\u2019</p><p>I grimaced at the waking aches and pains. \u2018It\u2019s about the only thing that is.\u2019</p><p>He leaned forward. \u2018Can I get you anything?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Glass of water.\u2019 Nodding, Cam got to his feet. \u2018Where\u2019s Cole?\u2019</p><p>\u2018In his bed. Joss and Braden offered to come by and take him to the Nicholses\u2019 for lunch later.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Good.\u2019 I closed my eyes again.</p><p>A minute or so later, Cam was shaking me gently awake. \u2018You need to drink something.\u2019</p><p>Reluctantly, I let him help me sit up, and I had to stop myself from leaning in and pressing my face against his neck. We still had way too much to discuss before we could even think about cuddling.</p><p>I took a big gulp of the ice-cold water he\u2019d brought me and thanked him. And then before I could say anything, he gently nudged me over and got into the bed beside me, his arm coming around my shoulder to draw me against his chest. \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 I mumbled, but I didn\u2019t really protest.</p><p>Cam sighed heavily, his fingers brushing through my hair. \u2018I\u2019ve been through hell and back in the last few days, Jo. Just let me hold you.\u2019</p><p>Tears pricked my eyes. \u2018I know you didn\u2019t sleep with her.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It looked bad, though, and you weren\u2019t in any state to think anything else but the obvious.\u2019</p><p>My fist clenched, curling into a tight ball. I hadn\u2019t even realized I\u2019d done it until Cam pushed his fingers against mine, forcing me to relax my hand. His thumb rubbed soothingly over my palm where my nails had bitten into the skin. \u2018I\u2019m almost afraid to ask this, but ... why was she there?\u2019</p><p>I felt his hesitation and my heart automatically lodged a complaint with a bang, bang, bang against my chest. \u2018Cam?\u2019</p><p>He turned his head and pressed his mouth against my forehead, breathing me in. When he pulled back, he replied softly, \u2018She turned up late at the flat, distraught and a bit drunk. I let her in. She threw herself at me.\u2019</p><p>It was decided. I hated her.</p><p>\u2018I pushed her off, told her nothing could happen between us and I thought it was best she leave, but she broke down crying and I felt like a bastard. I couldn\u2019t just throw her out.\u2019</p><p>I swallowed past the lump in my throat. \u2018She\u2019s still in love with you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018She doesn\u2019t know me,\u2019 he answered, sounding irritated.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u2019</p><p>\u2018We sat talking for ages, going around in circles until she started to sober up. She asked to use my shower and crash for the night. By then we were on the same page and I felt bad for her, so I said yes.\u2019</p><p>It took me a moment but I asked, \u2018Same page?\u2019</p><p>Cam shifted away from me tentatively, and only so he could look me in the eye. His haggard face was the most beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen and the ache in my chest intensified for him. I lifted my gaze from the soft, sexy curl of his upper lip to his eyes and my breath caught at his expression.</p><p>It was vulnerable and raw and open ...</p><p>He was naked and bleeding for me.</p><p>\u2018I told her something I should have told you ages ago.\u2019 He cupped a large hand around my neck, drawing me closer. \u2018I\u2019ve never met anyone as quietly brave and strong as you. I\u2019ve never met a woman so unassuming, so kind and so selfless. You are a complex lady.\u2019 His mouth curled up at the corners. \u2018And you are smart, and passionate, and funny, and exciting, and you blow me fucking away. When I first saw you, I wanted you like I\u2019d never wanted anyone. When you first tore me a new one, I wanted to know you. And when I got to know you, when I stood across a kitchen and you told me not to kill a spider because it didn\u2019t say much for us as a species if we killed something because we feared it, I knew. I knew that I would never meet anyone as beautiful or as compassionate or as determined. I\u2019ve known for a while that I was in love with you, Jo. I\u2019ve known and I should have told you.\u2019</p><p>Tears streamed down my cheeks and Cam\u2019s thumb did its best to catch them all. My chin trembled as I asked, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>He quirked an eyebrow at me. \u2018Maybe for the same reason you didn\u2019t tell me.\u2019 He leaned in to place a very careful but sweet kiss on my mouth. When he pulled back he continued. \u2018Last week, the Saturday we met Blair and I went quiet on you?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018Yeah?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It wasn\u2019t about Blair, baby. It was about you. About us.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I don\u2019t understand.\u2019</p> <p>Cam\u2019s hand slipped down my arm, his knuckles caressing my skin in soothing strokes. \u2018When we bumped into Blair, it was a shock and it was strange. When she and I dated I thought I was in love with her. We were together three years and I didn\u2019t take it well when it ended. But standing there, looking at her, I didn\u2019t feel anything but a distant familiarity. There was no hurt or love or anything but a friendly gladness to see her.\u2019 His eyes darkened. \u2018As we were standing there I got stuck in this thought ... the thought of me walking down Princes Street ten years in the future with some faceless woman on my arm, and bumping into you when you weren\u2019t mine any more. Because everyone leaves eventually, I thought.\u2019 He huffed in what seemed like pain and his grip on me tightened. \u2018It winded me. No, it floored me. I think I\u2019ve been in love with you since that moment in the kitchen, but last Saturday was the first time I realized how crazy I was about you. What I feel for you ...\u2019 Cam sucked in a breath and I found myself reaching a hand up to his face, my heart pounding as I watched this man \u2013 this strong, irreverent man \u2013 overcome with emotion ... emotion for me. \u2018It\u2019s all-consuming,\u2019 he breathed, leaning his forehead against mine again. \u2018It\u2019s almost debilitating. It\u2019s too much. It\u2019s ... I can\u2019t even describe it, but being with you is ... there\u2019s this intensity inside me all the time, this ... constant pull, desperation ... it\u2019s like you\u2019re branded on me or something. And it bloody well burns.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 I whispered soothingly, my tears falling faster. \u2018I know. I feel it, too.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You never told me that, though,\u2019 he answered a little harshly. \u2018You always kept something of yourself hidden from me, and I didn\u2019t know. I couldn\u2019t tell if you felt the same way. That\u2019s why I got drunk on Saturday night. That\u2019s why Nate came around the next morning to talk to me. He convinced me you felt the same way.\u2019</p><p>\u2018How did he do that?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I asked for his opinion about you and he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to worry about, mate. That girl thinks you\u2019re \u2018it\u2019 and I wouldn\u2019t say it if I didn\u2019t think it.\u201d \u2019</p> <p>I suddenly remembered Cam\u2019s attitude once Nate had left. It was like someone had flipped a switch inside him. Gone was the quiet, subdued, moody man from the night before. In his place had been a seducer. The rough sex against his desk ... I remember thinking at the time that it had felt like a claiming. Now I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d been too far off the mark.</p><p>Relief, intense relief, washed through me and I rested my head against his warm chest. \u2018You told Blair this?\u2019 I murmured against his skin.</p><p>\u2018I told her I was in love with you and that I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea to renew our friendship.\u2019</p><p>Another tear fell, splashing his skin.</p><p>\u2018I hope those are happy tears.\u2019</p><p>I sobbed now, the well of emotion inside me too much to contain after everything I\u2019d been through. \u2018I love you,\u2019 I cried, holding him tighter. \u2018So much I want to kill you sometimes.\u2019 I hiccupped attractively.</p> <p>Cam laughed softly. \u2018The feeling is definitely mutual, baby.\u2019</p><p>\u2018So what now?\u2019 I sniffled.</p><p>\u2018Now? I endure the agonizing wait for those ribs to heal up so I can have my wicked way with you and show you just how much I fucking love you.\u2019</p><p>I grinned through my tears. \u2018I feel your pain.\u2019</p><p>Cam grunted in response.</p><p>We lay there in silence for a moment and then I pulled back to look up into his gorgeous face. \u2018I think I have to leave Mum, Cam. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to bring myself to do it.\u2019</p><p>Another soft kiss grazed my lips and I tugged him back to me, ignoring the pain so I could kiss him, long, hard and deep. We finally broke apart, panting.</p><p>God damn these stupid ribs.</p> <p>\u2018We\u2019ll worry about all that later,\u2019 Cam said. \u2018For now, let\u2019s just get you on the mend.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Can I tell you I love you again?\u2019</p><p>He nodded slowly, his expression earnest. \u2018I\u2019ll never get tired of hearing it.\u2019</p><p>31</p><p>\u2018So any word from the mysterious Marco?\u2019 I asked Hannah, leaning against her bedroom wall, watching as she taped a poster of the lead singer of one of the biggest indie rock bands in the world to her wall. My girl had good taste.</p><p>Hannah blew air out between her lips, stepping back from the wall to analyse the poster. \u2018I\u2019m helping him with a paper for school, so I\u2019ve seen him quite a bit.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I detect from the tone that nothing of import has happened?\u2019</p><p>She looked at me over her shoulder. \u2018I think there might be some sexual tension between us.\u2019</p><p>The matter-of-fact reply caused no small amount of snort choking on my part. \u2018Sexual tension?\u2019</p><p>Turning fully towards me now, Hannah stared at me with the nonplussed expression of an academic facing a theory she found baffling. \u2018Well, I fancy him, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s me projecting those feelings into the situation or if the tension between us is due to the fact that the feelings are mutual.\u2019</p><p>I thought of the tension between me and Cam before we started dating and then studied Hannah. The girl was stunning and way too built for a fifteen-year-old. A teenage boy\u2019s Kryptonite. I smirked. \u2018He\u2019s feeling it back.\u2019</p><p>Her eyes brightened with hope. \u2018You think?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Definitely.\u2019</p><p>Pleased, she began to hang up another poster, grinning like an idiot. \u2018So how\u2019s your ribs?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Unfortunately still sore.\u2019 It had been a week since the attack, and after spending seven days of bed rest in the flat, I\u2019d begged Cam to let me attend Sunday dinner. Seeing my desperation, he\u2019d agreed it was time I got out of the flat. Considering I had to go back to work tomorrow, I was counting it as a practise run. Leaving the flat with Cam and Cole in tow, I was surprised to find that I was still a little nervous and jittery being out and about. As we got on the bus, I found myself glancing back on to the street to make sure Murray Walker\u2019s face wasn\u2019t in the crowd.</p><p>Cam caught me and deduced what I was doing. The clouds that gathered in his eyes made me feel loved, but it upset me that part of the blackness in their depths originated from his feelings of helplessness over the whole situation. Basically, he felt guilty that he hadn\u2019t been there to stop it, which was sweet but silly and irrational. As it turned out, we both needed comforting about the whole ordeal. I\u2019d taken his hand to let him know I understood, and he had kept me close beside him to let me know he understood.</p><p>Our relationship had changed in the last week. Our confessions of love had brought us both the security we needed. I didn\u2019t think it would cure either one of us of our possessiveness, or the flare of jealousy we felt when an ex-partner was mentioned, but knowing that we trusted each other had made us stronger.</p><p>It had also made me horny as hell, and not being able to do much about it was killing me.</p><p>Assuaging my frustration was the knowledge that it was killing Cam, too.</p><p>\u2018Done.\u2019 Hannah stepped back and we gazed around her newly poster-decorated bedroom. \u2018What do you think?\u2019</p><p>\u2018I think Elodie\u2019s going to kill you.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She said I could.\u2019</p><p>\u2018She said \u201ca poster\u201d.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, I just heard the permission part.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Come on, you,\u2019 I grinned, gesturing to the door. \u2018Let\u2019s enjoy dinner before Elodie discovers your bedroom\u2019s been transformed into a groupie\u2019s paradise.\u2019</p><p>Before I could exit Hannah asked quietly, \u2018Are you really okay, Jo?\u2019</p><p>Looking back at her over my shoulder, I was warmed by the concern on her face. \u2018Baby girl, I\u2019m fine. In fact, you know what? I\u2019m more than fine. I\u2019m great.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But your dad ...\u2019</p><p>Needing to vent, Joss had told Ellie what had happened to me, and Ellie had told Elodie and Elodie had told Clark and apparently Hannah overheard the conversation between her mum and dad. I reached out for Hannah\u2019s hand, giving it a squeeze. \u2018I know it must be difficult for you to understand because you\u2019ve got such an amazing dad. I could let the fact that my dad doesn\u2019t care who he hurts, including his own children, get to me. Or I could find what he can\u2019t give me somewhere else. I have Uncle Mick. And I have family in all you guys. It doesn\u2019t change what my dad did, but you know, it goes a long way to helping me get over it.\u2019 I smiled reassuringly at her. \u2018Some people are born with family, and others have to make family.\u2019 I shrugged. \u2018I can live with that if it means I get to spend time with you sarcastic buggers.\u2019</p><p>Hannah laughed, the sadness fading from her eyes. She squeezed my hand back, and I led her to the dining room, where our family was waiting:</p><p>Cam, Cole, Uncle Mick, Olivia, Joss, Ellie, Braden, Adam, Elodie, Clark and Declan.</p><p>What a beautiful sight for sore eyes. I smiled at Cam across the room as he pulled out a chair for me.</p><p>Once we were all settled around the table and the others were chatting loudly, Cam leaned over me. \u2018How are the ribs holding up?\u2019</p><p>I looked into his concerned eyes as I held a roast potato to my mouth. \u2018Just as they were when you asked me that question twenty minutes ago.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Well, excuse me for being a concerned boyfriend.\u2019</p><p>I made a face at him, and we shared another silent conversation.</p><p>You just want to know if we can have sex yet.</p><p>Cam\u2019s lips twitched around his mouthful of food.</p><p>Damn right.</p><p>Amused and turned on in equal measure, I searched for distraction from Ellie, who was talking about the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses for Joss and Braden\u2019s wedding.</p><p>\u2018I saw these beautiful fuchsia gowns on this Spanish wedding designs website. I was thinking \u2013\u2019</p><p>\u2018That I\u2019m out of my mind if I think Joss will have the colour fuchsia in her wedding,\u2019 Joss finished for her drily. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Braden and Adam immediately began working diligently on their meal and I wondered just how many times they\u2019d been pulled into a disagreement about the wedding between the bride and the maid of honour.</p><p>\u2018Why don\u2019t we go more muted on the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses?\u2019 I suggested, throwing Ellie a pleading look.</p><p>Ellie looked so adorably disheartened I wanted to hug her. \u2018But fuchsia is such a romantic colour.\u2019</p> <p>Clark\u2019s eyebrows dipped together. \u2018What colour is fuchsia again?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Pink,\u2019 Joss bit out.</p><p>Braden snorted, and apparently unable to help himself, he gave his wee sister an incredulous look. \u2018You\u2019re really trying to get pink into our wedding? My wedding ... to Joss?\u2019</p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not just pink,\u2019 Ellie argued as if they were idiots. \u2018It\u2019s a luxurious pinkish purple magenta colour.\u2019</p><p>Joss raised an eyebrow. \u2018It\u2019s pink.\u2019</p> <p>Ellie pouted. \u2018You\u2019ve not taken on any of my suggestions for the wedding.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Ellie, I love you dearly, I do, but you are all sweetness and rainbows and I am everything that is not that.\u2019</p><p>I ventured forth with another idea. \u2018What if we go for something in a metallic for our dresses?\u2019</p><p>Ellie stewed over that for a moment and then her face brightened. \u2018We would all look good in champagne. I think even Rhian would wear champagne.\u2019</p><p>Rhian was Joss\u2019s best friend from university and the two didn\u2019t get to see each other as much as they used to because Rhian lived in London. They kept in contact all the time, though, and they were to be in each other\u2019s upcoming weddings.</p><p>\u2018Hmm.\u2019 Joss swallowed a piece of chicken and shrugged. \u2018I could work with that.\u2019</p> <p>Everyone stopped eating to look at her. She glanced up, her eyes round at all the attention. She grimaced and shot Braden a dirty look. \u2018What? I can compromise.\u2019</p><p>He laughed. \u2018It\u2019s just the first time I\u2019ve heard you actually agree about something to do with the wedding.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s because our wedding planner sucks. No offence, Els.\u2019</p><p>Ellie rolled her eyes. \u2018Well, you could plan it yourself, you know.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I only agreed to marry him under the condition that I didn\u2019t have to do that.\u2019</p><p>Cam swallowed a chuckle beside me.</p><p>Braden narrowed his eyes on his fianc\u00e9e. \u2018Why don\u2019t I plan the wedding, then?\u2019</p><p>All of our eyebrows rose at that suggestion.</p> <p>\u2018You?\u2019 Joss gaped.</p><p>\u2018Me.\u2019 He shrugged and took a sip of water before adding, \u2018We have the same taste, so you know you\u2019ll probably like what I decide. And I think I can get it done faster than you two squabbling mares.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But you\u2019re so busy as it is \u2013 I can\u2019t ask you to do that.\u2019</p><p>He shrugged again and gave her a \u2018So?\u2019 smile.</p><p>\u2018Then I\u2019ll help,\u2019 Joss announced determinedly. \u2018We\u2019ll do it together.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Really.\u2019</p><p>\u2018But \u2013\u2019 Ellie\u2019s crestfallen opposition to being ousted from the plans was cut off by Adam as he pressed a quick kiss to her lips. He pulled back and they had one of those silent conversations that seemed to be all the rage these days. Whatever passed between them, Ellie\u2019s shoulders slumped and she nodded, giving in.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m glad that\u2019s sorted.\u2019 Elodie beamed at us all. \u2018If I\u2019d had to deal with one more phone call asking me to referee, I was going to scream.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hear, hear,\u2019 I murmured, ignoring Ellie\u2019s look of betrayal.</p><p>\u2018So, Mick, Olivia\u2019 \u2013 Braden sharply changed the subject \u2013 \u2018Jo tells us you both found flats.\u2019</p><p>Olivia nodded. \u2018On Jamaica Lane. And Dad\u2019s just round the corner. We move in soon. It\u2019ll be nice to get out of that hotel. Oh, and Dad\u2019s got his first job lined up, thanks to you, Braden.\u2019</p><p>That was the first I\u2019d heard of it. \u2018Really, Uncle Mick? Where?\u2019</p><p>Mick appeared more than a little pleased as he replied, \u2018Doing a couple of show homes for a new development in Newhaven. Starts in two months. Gives me time to get a team together.\u2019 He eyed me down the length of the table. \u2018How about it, Jo? Do you feel like packing it in at the bar and the estate agency to become an apprentice?\u2019</p><p>My fork clattered to my plate in shock. Was he ... did he ... was Uncle Mick really asking me to work for him? \u2018Eh?\u2019 I answered intelligently.</p><p>\u2018I asked if you wanted to work for me. It\u2019s a risk for us both, what with it being a new business, but I have every faith I can do this. I\u2019ve done it twice before. So will you trust me? Will you come and work with me?\u2019</p><p>\u2018As a painter and decorator? With you?\u2019 Oh, my God, Uncle Mick thought I was good enough to work for him?</p><p>I know it may not sound glamorous to some \u2013 an apprenticeship to become a painter and decorator. But it took skill, and patience, and it was something I genuinely enjoyed doing. It would be an actual career, something I\u2019d never thought I would have.</p><p>Because I didn\u2019t think I was good enough at anything to have one.</p><p>My old insecurities whispered and cursed in my ears, causing a flight of nervous butterflies in my stomach. Those insecurities wanted me to say no, so sure that it would only end in failure.</p><p>And it might. Not just because of me, but because, as Mick said, it was a new business. I could give up two secure jobs for this one and then have everything fall apart. Could I really be that selfish? Cole needed me to think logically about these things \u2013</p><p>I felt Cam\u2019s hand slip into mine under the table and when I looked at him his eyes told me everything I needed to know. I shoved back the insecurities, the second-guessing.</p><p>The butterflies were a little harder to get rid of, but despite them, I nodded at Uncle Mick, a wondrous smile forming on my lips. \u2018I\u2019d love that.\u2019</p><p>A few hours later I was still stunned by Uncle Mick\u2019s offer. Sitting at Cam\u2019s desk in his living room, listening to Cole laugh at Olivia as she trash-talked Nate over a video game, I was still half in that moment back at Elodie and Clark\u2019s.</p><p>Cam, Cole, Olivia and I had come back to Cam\u2019s to meet up with Nate and Peetie, who\u2019d stopped by with beer, takeaways, and the latest fighting video game.</p><p>Olivia had quickly fallen into a surprising camaraderie with Nate and the two of them were now throwing PG-rated (I was still aware enough to give them hell if they swore in front of Cole) comments at each other as they beat the crap out of each other\u2019s virtual counterparts.</p><p>\u2018Dude, you suck!\u2019 Olivia grinned as the annoying commentator bellowed, \u2018Knockout!\u2019</p><p>Nate threw her a look of mock offence. \u2018Give me a chance, Yank. I haven\u2019t played this game before.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Neither have I.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aye, but you have smaller fingers. They\u2019re faster and more agile across the buttons.\u2019</p><p>Olivia burst out laughing. \u2018Even your excuses suck.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Dude,\u2019 Cole agreed, shaking his head in disappointment.</p><p>\u2018Och, now.\u2019 Nate gestured to him in dejection. \u2018Don\u2019t you be \u201cdude-ing\u201d me.\u2019 He narrowed his eyes on Olivia. \u2018You\u2019ve been here ten minutes and you\u2019ve already managed to undo months of hero worship.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Oh, come on,\u2019 Olivia answered cheerily. \u2018I did the kid a favour. He would have found out the truth eventually.\u2019</p><p>Lips twitching, Nate turned back to the television. \u2018Right, Liv. Prepare to die.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You\u2019re on.\u2019</p><p>I wondered when the grown-ups were finally going to allow Cole to play. Eyes on my wee brother, though, I could see he was enjoying himself just hanging out with the guys and listening to Olivia\u2019s banter with Nate. I actually suspected Cole might have a small crush on Olivia, but I would never embarrass him by asking.</p><p>As they laughed with one another, I stood up and quietly left the room, heading to Cam\u2019s bedroom for a moment of peace so I could wrap my head around the fact that in a few months\u2019 time I would be starting a new career.</p><p>A career.</p><p>Shaking my head in wonder, I closed Cam\u2019s door and then crept across the room to carefully lie on his bed. Getting comfortable, I kicked off my shoes, my mind whirring with new plans as I lay there.</p><p>My eyes snapped down from the ceiling at the sound of the door opening, and I wasn\u2019t surprised to see Cam slip inside the room, shutting the door behind him. He smiled at me as he came over and settled beside me.</p><p>\u2018You all right?\u2019</p><p>I nodded, reaching up to stroke his cheek. \u2018Just needed a moment to process.\u2019</p><p>He cozied up to me and I rolled into him, enjoying the feel of his arms around me. I breathed in the smell of his aftershave and rubbed my forehead against the bristly line of his jaw.</p><p>\u2018Today\u2019s a good day,\u2019 I murmured, content.</p><p>\u2018Well, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m about to make it better or worse.\u2019</p><p>Remembering the last time he\u2019d said that, I tensed in expectation. It had been just before I discovered Uncle Mick and Olivia in his sitting room. Hopefully, whatever he was about to say would be as nice a surprise as that one. Fingers crossed. \u2018Okay,\u2019 I answered warily.</p><p>Cam took a measured breath. \u2018You said last week you thought you needed to leave your mum and you didn\u2019t know what to do.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Aye.\u2019 My good mood fled at the thought of it.</p><p>\u2018I think I have a solution, but I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to react to it.\u2019</p><p>I waited.</p><p>Cam\u2019s hand cupped my hip and he murmured above my head. \u2018Move in with me. You and Cole.\u2019</p><p>At the life-altering suggestion, I jolted back and instantly flinched at the sharp pain in my side. Clearing my expression so he didn\u2019t think I was wincing at the thought of living with him, I gazed up into Cam\u2019s suddenly uncertain face. \u2018You\u2019re asking us to move in with you?\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019 He gestured to the room. \u2018There\u2019s plenty of space. It means you\u2019ll not have to worry about Cole being left in the flat with your mum, but it also means that you can check on your mum anytime you want to.\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018But Mum\u2019s rent ... her disability won\u2019t cover it.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Keep paying it.

I\u2019ll keep paying it. We\u2019ll just have to chip in on food and utilities together.\u2019</p><p>My heart was pounding hard at the offer, my emotions (and my body) screaming \u2018Yes!\u2019 at the thought of getting to wake up next to him every morning, but my mind was playing it way more safe. \u2018We can\u2019t intrude in your life like that, Cam. You\u2019re not just asking your girlfriend to move in with you. You\u2019re taking on a teenage boy as well.\u2019</p><p>My caution caused a smile to form on his perfect mouth. \u2018Baby, I already have taken on a teenage boy. I spend just as much time with the kid as I spend with you. He\u2019s a good lad. I love him. I love you both. So will you move in with me?\u2019</p><p>Tears started to fill my eyes as my chest compressed with too much feeling. \u2018You love him?\u2019</p><p>He shook his head at my tears. \u2018Christ almighty, I\u2019ve set you off.\u2019</p> <p>I slapped at him halfheartedly. \u2018Don\u2019t ruin the unbelievable romanticism of the moment.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Was that a yes?\u2019</p><p>Moving in with Cameron was a huge step for the three of us, but after all our ups and downs we\u2019d come out stronger than ever. I believed we could do this, that I was ready, and that for now it was the best solution to our problem with Mum.</p><p>I snuggled deeper into Cam\u2019s chest and closed my eyes as his arms automatically tightened around me. \u2018That was a big, fat yes.\u2019 As Cam relaxed beneath me, I realized how tense he\u2019d been about asking, and an overwhelming rush of love for him washed over me. That love quickly turned into lusty tingles in all my lusty places as I felt the heat of his skin through his T-shirt. \u2018God damn these ribs,\u2019 I muttered, my voice now hoarse with sexual frustration.</p><p>Understanding, Cam groaned. \u2018Baby, don\u2019t. I\u2019m struggling as it is without hearing that you\u2019re struggling too.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know,\u2019 I murmured plaintively, my wicked thoughts pouring into my hand as it slid slowly down Cam\u2019s stomach and over his jeans. He hissed, inhaling sharply as I rubbed my hand hard over his growing erection.</p> <p>\u2018Are you trying to torture me?\u2019</p><p>I shook my head. \u2018If you\u2019re up for nice and slow\u2019 \u2013 my fingers fumbled as I undid the button on his jeans and then slipped the zip down \u2013 \u2018I can ease some of the pain.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Jo, you don\u2019t have to,\u2019 he argued, but it was a halfhearted protest, and I could feel his chest rising and falling in excited breaths.</p><p>\u2018I want to.\u2019</p><p>That was all it took to convince him and he helped me release him from the confines of his jeans and underwear. Days of pent-up sexual frustration now faced me in one throbbing, thick, veiny cock, straining towards Cam\u2019s stomach. When I wrapped my cool hand around it, he tried to stifle another groan, his head falling back with the feeling.</p><p>My grip tight but slow, I began to stroke him. I couldn\u2019t move any faster for fear of pulling on my ribs, and the torturous momentum had a sexy effect on Cam. Instead of watching my hand, I studied his face. He\u2019d closed his eyes, his eyelashes resting against his cheeks, his cheeks now flushed at the crests. His lips were slightly parted in pleasure.</p><p>God, he was hot.</p><p>I squeezed my legs together, feeling my sex throb and grow wet with need.</p> <p>\u2018Baby, I\u2019m \u2013\u2019 He sucked in a loud, harsh gasp for breath and I was suddenly glad that the volume on the television in the living room was up high. \u2018Going to come \u2013\u2019 His jaw clenched and he made this guttural noise as he came all over my hand and his T-shirt.</p><p>After a few seconds of listening to him pant, I bit my lip and mused aloud, indicating his T-shirt, \u2018I hope that wasn\u2019t new.\u2019</p><p>His body started to shake with rueful laughter. He ran slightly shaking fingers through his hair, his eyes bright on me. \u2018I just came like a callow youth.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Magic hands,\u2019 I teased.</p><p>Cam shook his head. \u2018Jo hands,\u2019 he corrected, then pressed a sweet kiss to my mouth.</p><p>After he\u2019d cleaned up my hand and himself and changed into a fresh T-shirt, he got back on the bed, but this time he straddled me.</p><p>\u2018What are you doing?\u2019 I breathed, excited but also still in pain. \u2018We can\u2019t do anything.\u2019</p><p>He shook his head, his eyes full of heat. \u2018You don\u2019t have to do anything but stay as still as possible.\u2019 And without another word he went to work on my jeans, carefully pulling them off, along with my underwear.</p><p>He pushed my thighs apart and crawled up the bed until his head was between my legs. Gently, he eased two fingers inside me and grunted. \u2018Fuck, you\u2019re soaked.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I enjoyed getting you off,\u2019 I whispered, trying not to writhe at the delicious sensation of him inside me.</p><p>\u2018I can feel that.\u2019 Cam took a shuddering breath. \u2018This is torture.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Do you know what torture really is? Having your tongue so near and yet so far.\u2019</p><p>He threw me a wicked smile and then promptly put that tongue of his to better use.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>The peace it brought me to look back and no longer see that wall Cam had helped me scale so long ago was indescribable. I would never be back behind that wall again, or have my colours muted and my personality trapped in the stranglehold of my insecurities. This was me. Life from now on would consist of being real, which was somehow scary and freeing all at the same time.</p><p>It helped that the pieces of my life were falling nicely into place for once.</p><p>Cole pretended to be indifferent to the news that we were moving into Cam\u2019s flat, but I could tell by the way he\u2019d been enthusiastically packing, and slowly moving something new into the flat every day, that he was happy about the new arrangement.</p><p>As for Mum ... well ... first she\u2019d gone off about how we were abandoning her, and how she wouldn\u2019t let me do this to her, and I couldn\u2019t take Cole, and I was a selfish little whore, and blah, blah, blah ...</p><p>Allowing her to exhaust herself in a tirade seemed like the best way to cope with her. That way she tired herself out and had no energy to fight me as I calmly told her that if she didn\u2019t let me move Cole downstairs, if she even dared to call the authorities, I\u2019d leave her ass in the dust and never look back. I assured her that this way I would check in with her, and if she needed me I was only a staircase away. Her silence was a bittersweet relief and it informed me in its heavy weightlessness that I\u2019d won this particular argument.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t spoken to us for three weeks.</p><p>Wiping sweat off my forehead, I blew air out between my now completely healed lips and gazed around Cam\u2019s sitting room. Boxes surrounded me on every side. Cole and I were supposed to be officially moving into Cam\u2019s the next day \u2013 a Saturday \u2013 so that Cam and the guys could help us with all the boxes. Feeling a little overexcited about the whole thing, and restlessly wandering around the flat, I\u2019d decided to take one of the lighter boxes downstairs to his (our) flat while he was at work. It was now late afternoon, my side was hurting a little, and I\u2019d moved most of the boxes into their new home.</p><p>Cam would return from work in an hour or so and a few hours after that I had to be at the bar for one of my last shifts ever at Club 39. I was going to miss everyone at the bar. I\u2019d still see Joss, of course, but that place had been a home away from home for the longest time, and I had spent time there with two of the most important people in my life. It was the end of an era.</p><p>However, something new and exciting awaited me. Uncle Mick had already given me two work T-shirts with his company name on them: M HOLLOWAY\u2019S PAINTER &amp; DECORATOR. I loved them. They looked great with the new overalls Cam had bought me.</p><p>Humming to myself, I pulled out my iPod and stuck it in Cam\u2019s stereo dock, turning the volume up as I began unpacking. Time passed quickly as I sang along, dancing, and shaking my ass as I found places for all my stuff, attempting not to overwhelm Cam\u2019s space with my things.</p><p>Just as I was breaking up the empty boxes, a pair of strong arms slid around my waist and scared the bejesus out of me. I yelped and spun around to find a bemused Cameron smiling at me. He gestured silently to the room and all of the new objects.</p><p>\u2018I got a little carried away,\u2019 I explained, speaking loudly to be heard over the music.</p><p>He nodded, his gaze drifting over the mantel, where a photograph of me, him and Cole now sat next to his own pictures. The stylish mantel clock from upstairs now dominated the centre, the photographs dispersed evenly on either side of it. \u2018I can see that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018It saved us doing most of it tomorrow.\u2019</p><p>Blue eyes dropped to my side and his hand came up, his palm pressing gently against my ribs. At the proximity of his touch to my chest, I felt my nipples peak against my sweat-dampened tank top. We hadn\u2019t had sex since before the attack. Fooling around while we waited for my ribs to heal had been fun, but my hormones were becoming a tad impatient for the play that succeeded the fore.</p><p>\u2018You didn\u2019t hurt yourself, did you?\u2019 Cam asked, his brows knitting together in concern.</p><p>Lying to him a little, I shook my head in response.</p><p>As if he knew, he scowled at me.</p><p>\u2018Okay, I got a bit overeager. It\u2019s just because I\u2019m excited to move in with you, baby.\u2019 I tried to charm my way out of the coming admonishment.</p><p>It worked. With a roll of his eyes, he whipped his other arm out and pulled me against him. I wrapped my arms around his neck as he held me, resting my chin on his shoulder. Breathing Cam in, feeling the strength of him against me, and knowing that I could reach out and have this with him anytime I wanted made me sink deeper into him. Those lean, muscular arms of his tightened around me, not only comforting me but awakening another set of frustrated, neglected hormones.</p><p>Without really meaning to, we began to sway to the music, and Rihanna\u2019s mournful voice sang \u2018Stay\u2019 at us. Goose bumps woke up all over my arms and I held on tighter to him, turning my head so our cheeks brushed. The song filled the room with such meaning it took my breath away, and as it hit the chorus Cameron whispered the lyrics in my ear, \u2018... I can\u2019t live without you ...\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With my heart pounding with the profundity of what he\u2019d confessed so romantically, I pulled slowly away from him so I could look into his face, and his eyes seared into mine. He meant that. He meant every word.</p><p>I was too full. Too full of emotion. Too full of love. There was no room for words. Instead I kissed him, throwing every feeling I had for him into it, my mouth savouring his in wet, hard desperation. Cam started moving us backwards as we kissed, his hands reaching out behind him as he led us out of the sitting room. He turned to guide us towards the bedroom, but I broke the kiss with a shake of my head, tugging on his hand.</p><p>Stumbling back against the wall in the hallway, I yanked him towards me. My skin flushed under his gaze as I whipped my T-shirt off and then pushed my leggings down. \u2018Here,\u2019 I told him, my voice shaking with anticipation. \u2018Where it all started.\u2019</p> <p>Realization dawned with the light of absolute adoration in Cam\u2019s eyes, an adoration I would never get tired of witnessing. He moved towards me, watching me as I stripped before him. \u2018What about your side?\u2019 he murmured. \u2018I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u2019</p><p>I slid my hands up under his T-shirt, forcing it up and off him, my ravenous gaze eating up the sight of his roped, naked torso. \u2018It\u2019ll be worth the pain.\u2019 I reached back to unclip my bra and as it fluttered to the floor, Cam shot into action.</p><p>He kicked off his boots, fumbling with his jeans. He shoved his underwear and jeans down, not waiting another second before lifting me up by the ass. My legs wrapped around his hard hips and my hands gripped to his shoulders as he pushed us back against the wall.</p><p>I suddenly laughed, halting him. Cam\u2019s brow furrowed in perplexity. \u2018Rihanna?\u2019 I giggled as I explained. \u2018You know the lyrics to Rihanna?\u2019</p><p>Cam\u2019s mouth curled sexily, arrogantly. He was not at all abashed at knowing Rihanna lyrics. \u2018You know the lyrics to Rihanna. I just pay attention.\u2019</p> <p>\u2018Always got an answer for everything, you cocky bugger.\u2019</p><p>He laughed against my mouth. \u2018I think you like my answers.\u2019 Unable it seemed to wait another minute, Cam thrust up into me. I cried out at the thick invasion, my inner muscles clinging greedily to his cock as he pulled out almost completely and then roughly slammed back in.</p><p>\u2018I missed you, baby,\u2019 he groaned, using one hand to brace against the wall as the other hand clutched my butt cheek in its bruising grip.</p><p>\u2018I missed you, too.\u2019 I moaned as he thrust back into me, my nails digging into the muscles in his back. \u2018Harder,\u2019 I begged, sensing that he was holding back because of my injury.</p><p>\u2018Jo \u2013\u2019 He shook his head.</p><p>\u2018Please,\u2019 I pleaded into his ear in a purr. I nipped his lobe and felt his control snap.</p> <p>Afterwards, he carried me to our bedroom, put me down on the bed, and began to kiss his way up my body. With my assurance that Cole was enjoying the first days of his summer holidays at Jamie\u2019s house, Cam decided he had all the time in the world. He kissed, and licked, and sucked until I was almost wrung dry. After what felt like hours of foreplay, he wrapped my legs around his waist and braced himself over me as he kissed me.</p><p>His kisses were deep and slow. He brushed his mouth over mine in butterfly kisses one second, and then closed it over mine the next. His kisses never sped up, never hardened ... instead he revelled in the erotic building of anticipation as our tongues met in a breathless, wet waltz. When he eventually sucked hard on my tongue, setting off little jerks of reaction in my lower belly, I pushed for more. It seemed impossible, but I was ready for another orgasm. We made out, naked on his bed, for who knew how long, his hard-on rubbing over my sex, teasing my clit, as his body moved with his kisses. He squeezed my breast, his thumb rubbing over the sensitive nipple he\u2019d sucked earlier \u2013 sucked and licked it so diligently that he\u2019d only had to whisper his thumb over my clit to bring me to climax.</p><p>As he tormented me with the tantalizing nearness of his erection, I whined against his mouth and his answering smile was smug. He pulled back and brushed his fingers along my cheekbone, his eyes never leaving mine as he slowly pushed his cock inside me. He shifted, bracing his hands on either side of my head, and then began to move. His thrusts were gentle this time, languid, and the tension coiled to an excruciating level.</p><p>\u2018I love you,\u2019 he breathed harshly.</p><p>I pulled my knees up more, to allow him in deeper, as I cupped his face in my hands. \u2018I love you, too.\u2019</p><p>I gasped as he rotated his hips, starting to lose focus as the sensations of our lovemaking gained dominance.</p><p>\u2018I love to fuck you,\u2019 he whispered in my ear, his voice gravelly with emotion. \u2018But I love to love you, too.\u2019</p><p>I nodded, understanding completely.</p> <p>Cam kissed me deeply again, his thrusts growing more frantic as the tension increased inside us. Our skin was clammy with sweat as we slid against each other, our panting breathing mingling as our lips brushed back and forth with the movement of his body over mine.</p><p>Chasing climax, I tilted my hips up with force, meeting Cam\u2019s next plunge with a slam that snapped the coil. Sparks flew apart in the wake of its destruction and I cried out his name as I came, my sex pulsing around him, my lower body shaking from the climax.</p><p>Cam suddenly arranged my hands above my head on the bed, pumping into me harder as he held me down. He came with a guttural shout of my name, his hips jerking against mine as he flooded my womb with his release.</p><p>He collapsed on me and I felt a twinge of pain in my ribs. Almost as if he felt it too, Cam rolled on to his side, still in me, and pulled me against him, hooking my leg over his hip.</p><p>I felt another spark of pleasure between my legs as his cock twitched inside me.</p><p>\u2018Well worth the wait,\u2019 he sighed happily.</p><p>I nodded against his chest, thinking about all the wrong guys I\u2019d dated before him. \u2018Definitely.\u2019</p><p>Two weeks later</p><p>Cam and Jo\u2019s flat</p><p>Sweaty, tired, and covered in tiny flecks of paint from the gentle spray of the roller, I let myself into our flat and leaned back against the door with a contented sigh.</p><p>Uncle Mick had just dropped me off at home after our first day on the job together. We were decorating one of the show homes in the new development Mick had been contracted for. Today we\u2019d painted all of the ceilings. Tomorrow and the next day would be more painting and then we\u2019d get on with the wallpaper the designer had chosen.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019m home,\u2019 I called, kicking off my work boots and unsnapping the straps on my overalls so they hung on me like baggy jeans.</p><p>\u2018In here,\u2019 Cam answered from the bedroom.</p><p>I strolled along the hallway, pulling the bandanna off my head and thinking how nice it was to feel this exhausted. It was an accomplished kind of exhausted and I loved it. I stopped in the doorway of the bedroom to find Cam sitting on the end of the bed with his hands behind his back.</p><p>Our room was now a weird mishmash of my stuff and his, but I didn\u2019t care. I just loved that when I woke up in the morning it was to a warm arm wrapped around my waist and usually a welcome morning erection nudging me in the ass.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t swap it for anything.</p><p>The move had gone well for the most part. We were both pretty laid-back about the small things, so sharing space wasn\u2019t really an issue for me and Cam, and Cole had recreated his bedroom from upstairs in Cam\u2019s guest bedroom in record-breaking time. He seemed to be perfectly happy with his new home, and glad that our room was on the other side of the flat from his.</p><p>I was glad for that too.</p><p>Mum, on the other hand, was still pulling the silent treatment, refusing to talk to me whenever I popped upstairs to bring her groceries and clean the place.</p><p>Guilt would not find me. Not because of her.</p><p>Admittedly, though, some days were easier than others.</p><p>However, everything else had gone smoothly. Everyone was happy for us. Well, except Blair, I imagine, but since Cam had been as good as his word about breaking contact with her, I didn\u2019t know that for sure. The only argument we\u2019d had so far was about a week ago when we\u2019d been watching a movie and Malcolm had called me. I took the call. Malcolm had just wanted to chat, a chat in which I told him I\u2019d moved in with Cam. Silence had fallen on the other side of the line and when Malcolm finally spoke, offering me congratulations, it was with such false cheer that I knew I\u2019d hurt him. Again. Before I could respond \u2013 not that I knew what to say \u2013 he had made his excuses and hung up.</p><p>When I returned from the kitchen, I was promptly manhandled by Cameron into the bedroom, where he tried to calmly (and was unsuccessful in that endeavour) ask me what Malcolm wanted. It ended in an argument. Cam argued that since he stopped talking to Blair I should stop talking to Malcolm. I argued it wasn\u2019t the same thing since Blair was in love with him. Cam argued that Malcolm was in love with me. And since I thought he might be right, I let him win the argument, assuring him I wouldn\u2019t speak to Malcolm any more. I didn\u2019t think that would be a problem. I had a feeling that was the last call I would ever receive from Malcolm.</p><p>As fiery as the disagreement had been, once it was done, it was done. We settled into our routines quickly, and so far, I would say the moving in thing was an absolute success. The following Saturday we were having a little flat-warming party so all our friends could visit and make sarcastic comments about how sickeningly in love we were.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t wait!</p><p>Eyeing Cam suspiciously, thinking his behaviour very odd as he sat there on the end of the bed, I asked, \u2018What are you doing? Where\u2019s Cole?\u2019</p><p>\u2018At McDonald\u2019s with his friends. I said he could.\u2019</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s fine. Maybe we should order in food instead of cooking, then.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Sounds good.\u2019</p><p>He seemed off. \u2018You okay?\u2019</p><p>\u2018How was the first day?\u2019 he countered, suddenly grinning at the state of me.</p><p>\u2018Brilliant. I mean my neck and back hurt and I have paint on my eyelashes, but it was brilliant.\u2019 I sidled into the room and slumped down beside him, pressing a soft kiss to his mouth.</p><p>When I pulled back, Cam gave me a half smile. I studied him, definitely getting the impression something wasn\u2019t quite right. Did he look nervous? \u2018Seriously, what\u2019s going on?\u2019 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2018I have a present for you.\u2019 He pulled his hand out from behind his back and held the gift-wrapped rectangular package out to me.</p><p>I grinned at him. \u2018What\u2019s this for?\u2019 I took the proffered gift and ran my fingers over it, wondering what it could be.</p><p>Cam\u2019s lips curled up at the corners at my excitement. \u2018It\u2019s just something to commemorate your first day as one of M. Holloway\u2019s painters and decorators.\u2019</p> <p>I laughed, giving him another quick kiss, before turning to my present. I slowly unwrapped it, tucking the paper behind me as I turned the gift over. It was a paintbrush \u2013 and not just any paintbrush. It was one of the best, most expensive, professional paintbrushes.</p><p>\u2018Oh, Cam.\u2019 I sighed at his thoughtfulness as I pried open the plastic to get to it. \u2018You shouldn\u2019t \u2013\u2019 The words abruptly stuck in my throat as the light caught a sparkle on the end of the brush. I shot him a disbelieving look before zeroing in on the handle. Gently I pulled the brush out of its plastic and my jaw dropped at the sight of the object that had been placed through the tip of the handle.</p><p>It was a diamond ring.</p><p>A white gold ring with a simple princess-cut diamond set in raised prongs in the middle of the band.</p><p>My heart racing like mad at the implication, I slowly turned my head to gaze at Cam in stupefied wonder. He casually took the brush from my hand and pulled the ring off the handle. He rose from the bed and went down on one knee in front of me.</p> <p>\u2018Oh, my God,\u2019 I breathed, my right hand fluttering against my throat as my pulse throbbed at super speed.</p><p>Cam took my trembling left hand in his, his gaze sincere as he looked into my eyes. \u2018Johanna Walker, love of my life, I never want to spend another day not waking up beside you.\u2019 He held the ring up to my hand. \u2018Will you spend the rest of your life with me? Will you marry me?\u2019</p><p>I realized now, after years of waiting for the men before Cameron to ask me that question, that saying yes to any of them would have been absolutely the worst decision I would have ever made. There was one certainty I\u2019d learned in the last few months: when a man asked you that question, there was only one thing you had to ask yourself. Could I live without him?</p><p>If the answer was no, then the answer was yes.</p><p>I nodded, my mouth quivering as the tears started to fall. \u2018Yes. I\u2019ll marry you.\u2019</p><p>With a groan of exultation, Cam pulled me towards him for a kiss so deep I was literally breathless when he let me go. I panted against his mouth, smiling crookedly. \u2018You know what this means?\u2019</p> <p>Cam\u2019s eyes glittered, and I was overwhelmed by the happiness in them. \u2018What does it mean?\u2019</p><p>\u2018We\u2019ll never be able to live with Joss after this. She\u2019ll think she\u2019s Mrs Matchmaker.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ll have a word with Braden. He\u2019ll keep her in line.\u2019 He grinned boyishly. \u2018We\u2019re good at that.\u2019</p><p>\u2018You two think you\u2019re in charge, don\u2019t you?\u2019</p><p>He shrugged but his eyes said, Yes \u2013 yes, we do.</p><p>Cupping his face between my hands, I gave him a condescending yet sympathetic smile. \u2018Oh, baby, your na\u00efvet\u00e9 is so endearing.\u2019</p><p>Laughing, Cam wrapped his arms around my waist and as he stood up he lifted me and threw me on to the bed. \u2018Tonight at least, I\u2019m in charge.\u2019 He began to undress slowly as I sat up, braced on my elbows, to watch him, my body already coming alive in anticipation. \u2018Now tell me again that you love me, Mrs Soon-to-Be-MacCabe.\u2019</p><p>I sighed happily at the simultaneous sound of my soon-to-be surname and the zip on his jeans tugging down. As I prepared to give him what he wanted, it amazed me how easily those words came after having taken me so long to find the courage to say them to him in the first place. Just like I did with Cole, I promised myself there and then that Cam wouldn\u2019t live a day of his life without knowing how I felt about him.</p> <p>\u2018I love you, Cameron MacCabe.\u2019</p><p>With a cocky grin, Cam dropped his jeans to the floor. \u2018I love you, too, Miss Walker-Soon-to-Be-MacCabe.\u2019 And I knew then as I was lying on our bed staring up into his familiar and handsome face that I had something I\u2019d never had before. I had someone who wasn\u2019t going to let me spend a single day of my life without knowing how much I was loved.</p><p>I think one of my favourite parts of it all was the fact that finding what we had together hadn\u2019t cost either of us a single penny.</p><p>Well ... with the exception of an engagement ring and a new paint palette for our flat. </p> </body></html>"]
