Logan Edgington smacked the submissive\u2019s reddening ass in time with the dark beat of the old-school Depeche Mode tunes pounding through his dungeon at Club Dominion. Clenching his jaw, he curled his palm into a fist, then shook out the sting.</p><p>The sub gasped and stuck her butt out for him. Oh yeah, Callie liked pain and punishment, which was why she frequented this BDSM club. But the past two hours had proven that her attitude didn\u2019t submit half as well as her body. Given enough time, he\u2019d change that.</p><p>Perspiration sheened across her back, and some damp tendrils from her black pixie-cut hair clung to her neck. She bowed her head between her outstretched arms. Logan stood back, watched, while she writhed as much as her bonds allowed. Her pink pussy looked drenched and swollen.</p><p>\u201cMore!\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He leaned down, growled in her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re not learning. Who\u2019s in charge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I need it,\u201d she whined.</p><p>\u201cYou need discipline, which is why you\u2019re here with me now. You say you want to learn to please the Master you hope to have someday, but I\u2019m not seeing the dedication. I think you just like a little pain to make your orgasm better and the rest is bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. Don\u2019t be an asshole!\u201d</p><p>Smack! \u201cYou\u2019re disrespectful, sub. What do you call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d she gasped. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sir. I\u2019m so close. You\u2019ve kept me on edge forever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor thirty minutes,\u201d he cut in. \u201cIt\u2019s your role to stay on edge for as long as I wish and to accept my commands with grace and dignity\u2014and silence.\u201d</p><p>Callie bowed her head, and Logan pressed his shoulders down, stretching his neck. He waited, swallowing cold water from his bottle. She was going to have to decide whether her long-term goal or her immediate need for orgasm was more important.</p><p>Her breath hitched. She sobbed, then caught herself. \u201cYes, Sir. You\u2019re right, Sir. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Damn, that was the most progress they\u2019d made all afternoon.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d she cut in with a mewl, \u201cit would be so much easier to submit if you\u2019d just give me what I want.\u201d</p><p>And we\u2019re back to square one.</p><p>Behind her, Logan shook his head in displeasure and walked around the sub in a slow circle. He crouched until she could see the thunder on his face. Callie demanded her orgasm the way a toddler stomped her foot for a doll. She was going to take a lot of taming to reach her submissive potential. Idly, he wondered if he could possibly train her in the less than two weeks left of his leave. He certainly had the time to devote, since the only thing on his calendar until he returned to active duty was his older brother\u2019s upcoming vow renewal.</p><p>He filtered his fingers into her damp tresses and pulled until she lifted her head. Her blue eyes looked glassy. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works. I explained that before we started. I know others have told you, as well. You\u2019d be more likely to get what you want if you showed respect and complied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir. It\u2019s just . . . I\u2019m so close, I can\u2019t think. It\u2019s like I\u2019m already talking before my brain has decided what I should say.\u201d</p><p>So Callie admitted that she had no filter. Since coming to Dominion, she\u2019d been bounced from Dom to Dom. Few wanted to take on a \u201cproject.\u201d Logan didn\u2019t mind; he relished the challenge.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to learn to control yourself.\u201d</p> <p>She bit her lip. \u201cI\u2019m trying, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hard enough. You know I have to punish you.\u201d</p><p>Her entire body perked up. \u201cYes, Sir!\u201d</p><p>Logan raced around her and smacked her ass again. \u201cNo coming unless I give you permission.\u201d</p><p>Her head dropped between her shoulders as her hope deflated, but she took his edict in blessed silence.</p><p>Turning away, he rummaged through the nearby cabinet until he found what he needed: a pair of unforgiving clamps and a brand-new vibrating egg. Unwrapping both, he cleaned the egg, then inserted the batteries into the remote. After a quick pinch on each nipple, he applied the harsh clamps. This sub didn\u2019t need much prepping; her nipples were already stiff red points.</p><p>She moaned and tried to claw at the padded mat beneath her. The girl certainly liked pain, and Logan had no problem dishing it out.</p><p>Finally, he crouched behind her and slid the egg into her soaking cunt. She tightened around it, bracing. Without a doubt, what he planned was going to be a trial for her.</p><p>Logan flipped the egg on.</p><p>Callie gasped. Clenching her fists, she wiggled her ass, trying to get enough friction for orgasm, but he\u2019d tied her to a spreader bar, ensuring she couldn\u2019t manage to rub anything together between her legs. And when she realized that, she wailed.</p><p>\u201cQuiet. Take your punishment. You haven\u2019t earned an orgasm. You\u2019re not getting one for a long while.\u201d</p><p>She endured. Not in total silence\u2014that wasn\u2019t her style. She cursed below her breath and alternately bit her lip. Logan watched her skin flush even more, her breathing hitch repeatedly, as need filled her. He smoothed his hand over her back, feeling her tremble, feeling her give in.</p><p>And finally, he felt.</p><p>Logan closed his eyes and inhaled, soaking in her uncertainty, her tumult, her quivering need. He savored her ragged breaths, tense mewls, and the pungent scent of her arousal. When he had a woman under his control and he stripped her down to her soul, exposing her most elemental self, then he could finally feel more than duty, anger, and nagging emptiness.</p><p>His own arousal multiplied. Blood rushed to his cock, hardening him until the sensation was nearly painful. It was perfect.</p><p>Well, as perfect as it got anymore.</p><p>\u201cSir!\u201d The sub\u2019s keening cry penetrated his haze, jacking him up even more.</p><p>He opened his eyes, slid in front of her until he fused their gazes together. Fuck, her wild, fully dilated eyes, red cheeks, and heaving breaths told him that she was close not just to orgasm, but to her breaking point.</p><p>\u201cCallie . . .\u201d he warned, dialing back the egg\u2019s remote control to let her cool down. \u201cNo coming.\u201d</p><p>This time, she winced, but didn\u2019t complain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sir.\u201d Her breathing hitched, and her head bowed completely. \u201cHow can I please you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. Finally . . . some measure of surrender.</p><p>\u201cMay I offer you my mouth?\u201d Her voice shook. \u201cMy pussy? My ass?\u201d</p><p>Technically, it was the right thing to say, but her offer left him cold. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to please you.\u201d</p><p>One look at the sub\u2019s flushed face told Logan that, for once, she actually meant it. He softened. \u201cWatching you, looking so feminine and submissive, so very close to orgasm, is pleasing me. I\u2019m going to ask you to please me like that for a bit longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her breath caught. \u201cS-Sir.\u201d</p><p>Dropping to his knee beside her, Logan wrapped his arm around her waist, pressed his cheek to her back, then put his free hand over her pussy. \u201cI like you on edge, trembling with the bite of pain I\u2019ve given you, and the swell of need that only grows. Give me more. That is how you please me.\u201d</p><p>Every inch of her skin was flushed rosy. In his head, Logan knew he\u2019d kept her near orgasm for perhaps longer than she could comfortably bear. A part of him whispered that he should throw caution to the wind and enjoy her delicious turmoil for just a few minutes more. God knew she\u2019d earned a little sensual torture for her defiance.</p><p>But a sub\u2019s responsibility was to please whoever topped her. Still basking in the overspill of her emotion, Logan couldn\u2019t deny that he was, in fact, pleased. And she\u2019d even curbed her sass\u2014at least for the moment.</p><p>A Dom\u2019s role was to give the sub what she needed. Callie needed to come.</p><p>Rising to his feet, he made for the door, then pressed the security code. Instantly, the portal clicked open and his pal Xander, whom he\u2019d dubbed his one man cleanup crew, prowled inside. \u201cShe ready?\u201d</p><p>Logan glanced at the sub. \u201cJust about. Give me thirty seconds.\u201d</p><p>He turned back and dropped to his knees beside Callie, whispering in her ear, \u201cAre you ready to be fucked? Think carefully about your answer.\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019d asked this question a few hours ago, she\u2019d replied flippantly, as if she\u2019d been entitled to pleasure. He\u2019d untied her, left her alone in his dungeon while he\u2019d found lunch\u2014let her body cool completely before he\u2019d started arousing her again.</p><p>Now, Callie averted her eyes respectfully. \u201cIf it pleases you, Sir, I offer myself for your pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Xander snorted. Logan shot him a quelling glare. Maybe he should take the sub up on that. Maybe it would be all right. Though it would probably be like always. Afterward, he\u2019d only feel crushingly empty and aware of all the fucking mistakes that had led to this shitty, hollow sex life.</p><p>\u201cThank you, little one.\u201d He stroked her shoulder as the music throbbed around them. Then he curled a hand under her body, sliding his finger over her clit. \u201cI would be pleased if you came for me. Now.\u201d</p><p>With a little cry of surprise, she gasped, \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Another light circle over her hard little clit, and Callie\u2019s whole body shook, convulsed. Her nerve-laden nubbin turned to stone, pulsed under his fingers, as her cries rang in his ears. He opened his pores to her delightful storm of emotion, letting more sink in to him. God, how desperately he needed to feel something.</p><p>When her orgasm subsided, he removed the plastic egg as he kissed her shoulder. \u201cVery pretty. It would please me now to watch you be fucked.\u201d</p><p>She stilled. \u201cWatch, Sir? I\u2014I hoped . . . Yes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Logan heard the disappointment in her voice. So, she\u2019d gotten the 411 on him, and like most of the other subs here, Callie wanted to be the one he finally fucked. That his celibacy had become a mountain for these women to climb really pissed him off. His reasons for abstaining were his own. He didn\u2019t owe anyone an explanation or a stiff dick.</p><p>\u201cYou knew what would happen when you walked in this dungeon. I stated it clearly, and you agreed. If you\u2019ve changed your mind, use your safe word and everything ends.\u201d</p><p>The sub\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cNo, Sir! If watching pleases you, then I will happily accept another. Please, I ache . . .\u201d</p><p>No, it didn\u2019t please him exactly, but in the long run, fucking her himself would displease him more. And afterward, he\u2019d inevitably dismiss her harshly and hurt her without meaning to, which would only make him feel worse. It happened every time.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he murmured. \u201cXander?\u201d</p><p>When Logan turned, his friend had already shucked his clothes and donned a condom over that big cock that made him a good living, even though he was already filthy rich. On silent footsteps, Xander circled Callie until he crouched in front of her. \u201cI\u2019m going to take care of you from here. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>The sub nodded, keeping her eyes downcast, but her body vibrated with excitement. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll please Master Logan by submitting to me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Xander caressed her back, her ass, then helped her to her feet. He guided her to a spanking bench and clipped her in with the rings attached on her wrist and ankle cuffs, tossing the spreader bar aside once he had. With one hand, he plunged two fingers into her pussy. With the other, he smacked her sweetly rosy backside. She gasped.</p><p>That quickly, Callie was aroused again. And Xander didn\u2019t hesitate. He gripped her hips, aligned his cock, and pushed his way in. She clawed the bench and cried out against the invasion. As Xander slammed her, she came again.</p><p>Logan\u2019s work here was done. The sub was in the best hands possible. Xander would give her what she needed both during and after sex.</p><p>After smoothing a tender hand down Callie\u2019s hair, Logan turned and left. Breath sawing in and out of his chest, he pivoted and headed to the end of the hall, pushing his way into the club showers. As he reached for the faucet and waited for the scalding water, his hand shook.</p><p>Damn, Callie\u2019s lack of filter didn\u2019t just apply to her mouth. Her emotions had mounted, one on top of the other, until they\u2019d spilled all over him. Her fear, her thrill, her desire, her trembling greed for more had bled into him\u2014and he\u2019d sucked in every drop. Subs like her were the reason dominance worked for him.</p><p>Logan stripped, then stepped into the swirl of spray and hot steam. He wasn\u2019t stupid; psychologists would have a field day with him, if he\u2019d ever talk to one. Fuck that. He wasn\u2019t opening his head for some shrink. He was simply wired this way, and his emotional disconnect worked professionally. Navy SEALs had to be collected, logic firing on all cylinders. When emotions got involved, people died.</p><p>Personally, however, it sucked. Sponging off women like Callie only took him so far. He remembered those high school days when all it had taken was one look, one kiss, and he\u2019d been brimming with so many fantasies and wants that he couldn\u2019t process them all. But that had been before . . . Nope, not thinking about her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Still, once she flashed across his brain, he was unable to stop himself from wrapping his hand around the inside of his left thigh and fingering the little tattoo there. Like always, desire roared through him. Just like that, he was desperate to come.</p><p>Desperate to have what he knew he never would again.</p><p>Blocking out those thoughts, Logan jerked his hand from the tattoo and soaped his palms. He\u2019d better get down to business before his thoughts turned into a total buzz kill.</p><p>Drawing in a cleansing breath, he closed his eyes and shut everything out except the vision of how Callie had looked minutes ago under his command. With his back to the spray, he took his cock in hand.</p><p>At the first touch, tingles shot through his groin, up his spine. He called forth the memories of the sub\u2019s pants and moans. The scent of her arousal still lingered in his nostrils. Her trembling pleas had been hot. Desire simmered in his belly, and another stroke up his dick fanned the fire higher.</p><p>The wild need in Callie\u2019s eyes pumped Logan with a heavy euphoria. Letting that brew in his brain, he picked up the pace, rubbed his thumb along a sensitive spot on his glans. Fire licked his balls, and the ache tightened, tingled at the base of his spine.</p><p>Part of him wished he\u2019d taken her up on her offer and fucked her. It had been more than five years since he\u2019d felt the silken clasp of a woman\u2019s pussy. But nothing had changed. He had no reason to hope that being with Callie would provide any different outcome. Crushing emptiness and disappointment would level him the moment the orgasm ended\u2014if he had one at all. The woman always either felt inadequate or irate. Sex had been that way every time he\u2019d tried with anyone after\u2014</p><p>No. Damn it, he wasn\u2019t having thoughts of her. He had to focus on Callie and those swollen lips of hers, begging for the orgasm she\u2019d needed with every nerve in her body, of those pleas filling him with anxious tension, arousal, fueling his own need to come.</p><p>Logan stroked faster. She\u2019d been gorgeous. Once he\u2019d curbed her sass a bit, she\u2019d been willing to stay in the raging tumult to please him. And when he\u2019d granted her orgasm, the pure joy in the experience had been completely heady. He\u2019d greedily sucked in that tingling ache. Now, he anticipated that same cataclysm washing over him.</p><p>But fucking hell . . . it wasn\u2019t happening.</p><p>He pumped faster, his arm starting to ache. The orgasm was right there, but all the usual tricks weren\u2019t working. And Logan couldn\u2019t pretend that he didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>God damn it, why couldn\u2019t he get past her after twelve fucking years? Memories of her still plagued him. Her sweet, bee stung lips as she looked up at him, wearing nothing but a shy smile. The vulnerability obvious in her trembling chin, shining from her big brown eyes, when she\u2019d confessed it was her first time. Knowing he\u2019d been the first man to kiss the soft curve of her neck, feel the pink berry nipple against his tongue, lap up the flavor of her sweet cream, and hear the startled cry of her first orgasm . . .</p><p>Tension torqued in Logan\u2019s gut as the water pounded his back. His palm glided up and down his hungry cock as those well-traveled memories crashed over him again. The trust in her eyes as she\u2019d parted her virgin thighs, the way she\u2019d whispered that she loved him, too, with unblinking honesty as she took him inside her body for the first time.</p><p>The only time.</p><p>My Cherry.</p><p>Now stroking his cock like a wild man, Logan reached down to rub at the tattoo again. He couldn\u2019t see it or feel it, but he\u2019d put it there years ago to remind him of her. He pictured her as she\u2019d been that spring afternoon, lying beneath him, eyes wide with startled desire, delicate nails digging into his shoulders. His balls filled with scalding need now, drew up tight. Orgasm sizzled through his blood, then exploded until he released a thick stream of semen onto the shower\u2019s black tiles.</p><p>In seconds, the sensation fizzled. He panted, propping himself up with a palm against the wall and released his softening cock. His heartbeat slowed.</p><p>And once again, he was left to feel exactly how pathetic he was because he could only come by thinking about a girl who\u2019d surely gotten over him long ago. A girl, now a woman, whom he\u2019d never have the chance to touch again.</p><p>The self-loathing had barely started to suck the pleasure from his orgasm when a knock sounded. Fuck, that would be Xander. Logan would rather ignore his friend, but he\u2019d put Callie in the other man\u2019s hands; ensuring that she was okay now was his responsibility.</p><p>Turning off the spray, he yanked a towel off the rack and wrapped it around his waist. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou done fingering your cherry yet?\u201d</p><p>God damn it, he hated that Xander knew him so well. \u201cBite my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not, nor will I ever be, interested in your ass,\u201d Xander called through the door. \u201cYou decent? \u2019Cause I don\u2019t want to see your junk.\u201d</p> <p>As if he never had during the course of a scene, which was how Xander knew about his hidden tattoo in the first place.</p><p>Logan rolled his eyes. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t look.\u201d</p><p>Xander pushed the door open, his olive cheeks flushed, his dark hair mussed. He looked relieved to see the towel around Logan\u2019s waist. \u201cCallie is fine. All sated, praised, and cuddled.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Logan turned away, hoping his pal would get the hint.</p><p>No such luck. Xander merely crossed his arms over his chest, cocky grin stretched across his face, and looked at him expectantly.</p><p>Damn. Logan sighed. \u201cThanks for taking care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter working at a BDSM resort where my primary job was to take care of women like her, it\u2019s no sweat. And unlike those women, she didn\u2019t act like I was beneath her afterward, which was a nice bonus.\u201d Xander shrugged. \u201cIt was a good fuck. I should thank you for priming her so thoroughly. I had to pause twice to slow down her slew of orgasms. The girl still doesn\u2019t have much self-control.\u201d</p><p>Another problem for another day. Maybe if he dropped his towel, Xander would leave.</p><p>Logan let go of the damp terrycloth. It slithered to the floor as he reached for his leathers.</p><p>\u201cOh, dude.\u201d In the mirror, Logan could see Xander turn away with a wince. \u201cWarn a guy next time, huh?\u201d</p><p>Shoving on his leathers, he zipped them up and shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who insists on barging in on my bathroom time. You get what you deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shooting the messenger. I\u2019m just here to tell you that Thorpe wants to see you.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell Thorpe. Logan held in a curse, hoping like hell that Dominion\u2019s owner wasn\u2019t going to chew his ass out for pushing Callie so hard. Thorpe had a soft spot for her. Logan thought it was more like a blind spot. Any other sub who\u2019d been so damn near untrainable would have been out on her ass long ago.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure. He\u2019s getting all the Doms together. I\u2019m guessing it has something to do with the FBI being here.\u201d Xander slapped him on the back. \u201cWelcome back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYOU dragged my ass out of the shower for\u2014\u201d Logan paused as Mitchell Thorpe glared at him with cold gray eyes, then yanked back the black drape covering the one-way mirror. Logan\u2019s jaw dropped at the sight. \u201cOh, holy shit.\u201d</p><p>Around him, half a dozen other Doms all whistled and looked their fill.</p><p>\u201cI thought she\u2019d get your attention,\u201d Thorpe drawled.</p><p>Completely. Logan\u2019s gaze glued itself hungrily to the graceful line of her spine, cut in half by a gray sports bra. Tight black running shorts barely covered the lush globes of her ass. Though the beauty was way overdressed for her role, she sat back on her knees, legs spread, pose submissive. Mercy!</p><p>Logan rubbed his jaw. But the ache coursing through him wasn\u2019t under his two days\u2019 growth of beard; it had quickly settled south, behind his straining zipper, despite his orgasm fifteen minutes ago. Desire sizzled through him, along with shock. For the first time in years, he not only wanted inside a woman, he was desperate for it. Trying to cool down and process this development, he grabbed a bottle of water from the nearby cooler and drained half in two swallows.</p><p>Thorpe cleared his throat, clearly expecting a reply. As Logan forced himself to look at the club\u2019s owner, a thousand responses ran through his head. Finally, he settled for something factual. \u201cWith that curvy ass and fiery hair? Yeah, she\u2019s got my attention.\u201d</p><p>He really had a thing for redheads. Always had.</p><p>In fact, everything about this woman set off Logan\u2019s buttons. Such fair skin. He\u2019d bet it would be damn soft and look so prettily pink after a good spanking. She radiated femininity, from the slender neck just under her pile of vibrant hair atop her head, to the sensual flare of her hips. Already, he wanted her the way he hadn\u2019t wanted anyone in years\u2014down, dirty, insatiably. Completely. He wanted to penetrate her, violate her, subjugate her. Every moment he watched her, the desire grew. Logan swallowed.</p><p>An unfamiliar thirtysomething man in jeans beside her issued orders. Logan couldn\u2019t hear through the glass. Granted, he wasn\u2019t the best at reading lips, but he thought the guy told her to bow her head. The stranger\u2019s physique looked powerful enough to enforce his will . . . but he lacked any sort of commanding presence.</p><p>\u201cIs this poser her Dom?\u201d Logan drained the rest of his water bottle, wondering who the guy on the other side of the glass thought he was kidding.</p><p>Thorpe sighed. \u201cNot yet. He needs to be. These two are actually FBI agents, training for an upcoming undercover assignment to break up a sex ring and rescue another agent. They\u2019ve been in Axel\u2019s dungeon for nearly a week. We\u2019re not getting anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to be honest; it\u2019s looking hopeless.\u201d Axel, the club\u2019s resident Dom, sighed.</p><p>In that instant, Logan knew that Thorpe had called together all the club\u2019s Doms in the hopes that one of them could step in and train the delicious redhead in the next room. Yeah, she was still kneeling at the other man\u2019s feet, but she had her hands on her hips. The sway of her body and the bobs of her head told Logan, she was giving her \u201cDom\u201d an earful. He smiled.</p><p>Suddenly, he was damn glad he\u2019d left Tyler, Texas, for Dallas during his leave to blow off some pent-up steam. Logan loved the navy, but constant missions to third world shit holes didn\u2019t give him many opportunities to indulge in his kink of choice. But after yesterday, he needed to release tension even more. Over breakfast with his dad, Logan had seen an engagement announcement in the Tyler Morning Telegraph that had knocked him flat. She was fucking marrying Brad Thompson. Every muscle in Logan\u2019s body tensed at the thought of that raving ass-hat touching her, planting his children in her womb.</p><p>\u201cYou trying to crush that plastic?\u201d Xander whispered, brow raised.</p><p>Thorpe, Axel, and the other Doms all stared.</p><p>Logan looked down and realized that he\u2019d pulverized his water bottle. Muttering a curse, he threw it in the trash can, then focused on the scene through the glass. \u201cShe\u2019s not submitting to him and she never will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is where one of you comes in. Axel has agreed to coach the male agent one-on-one. But that leaves the female, and she needs a strong hand. I don\u2019t have time for a project.\u201d</p><p>Before anyone else could say a word, Logan volunteered. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe paused, sizing him up. Logan refused to flinch or blink.</p><p>\u201cSince you like the defiant ones, I thought this might be up your alley,\u201d Thorpe stated. \u201cBut will you be too much for our little FBI agent? It\u2019s her first field assignment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give her whatever she needs,\u201d Logan vowed. She was beautiful and seemingly brave. Field assignments with the FBI didn\u2019t tend to be cakewalks.</p><p>\u201cExcept sex,\u201d Jason, the bad-boy financial wizard, drawled.</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Logan muttered.</p><p>\u201cSex isn\u2019t required,\u201d Thorpe advised, tossing a glare Jason\u2019s way. \u201cShe just needs to learn protocol and obedience.\u201d</p><p>The normally silent Erik shrugged. \u201cYou know I like the puttyin-my-hands type. I can tell by the finger wag, that ain\u2019t her.\u201d</p><p>Logan looked at her again. Watching that finger wag made him hard. Hell, everything about her made him hard. Any time he could spend touching the gorgeous woman in the next room would be time well spent. Maybe even cathartic. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d been this stiff so quickly after an orgasm, but looking at the redhead\u2019s lush ass, his dick was fully saluting her.</p><p>Zeb, the last of the Doms in the room, just grunted. \u201cI\u2019m heading down to Cabo in a few days for vacation. Man, I\u2019d love to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut since you won\u2019t be here, and I will . . .\u201d Logan cut him off with a smile.</p><p>\u201cLucky bastard,\u201d Zeb groused.</p><p>Thorpe stepped between them. \u201cThe agents don\u2019t have long before their mission begins. They\u2019re already working against the clock. The female agent is submissive, in my opinion. But she\u2019s not letting go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Logan already knew the problem. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t trust that guy.\u201d</p><p>In fact, the man beside her dropped his shoulders and sighed, clearly trying to reason with her\u2014and showing his frustration. Both were exactly the wrong thing to do to earn obedience.</p><p>Axel shook his head. \u201cDominance isn\u2019t Agent York\u2019s bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly,\u201d Logan drawled, staring at the two through the glass. \u201cWhy not find someone else to take his place?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSix days ago, one of their fellow agents working undercover was abducted by the leaders of a sex ring they\u2019re trying to bust. They sent her in alone as a submissive. The only training she\u2019d received was an hour\u2019s briefing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d Erik choked. \u201cWhat the fuck were they thinking?\u201d</p><p>Logan shook his head. Sending an agent in that unprepared was more than stupid; it was downright irresponsible. Submission wasn\u2019t something a person learned by reading a piece of paper. Any Dom worth his leathers was able to spot a tourist a mile away. She had been a lamb sent to slaughter. And now the redhead was going in after her, trying to dupe heartless predators for her first undercover assignment? Definitely brave.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worse than you think. Agent York let me read some cursory information on this sex ring so I\u2019d know how to prep the agents,\u201d Axel said. \u201cThe mastermind of this ring is a ruthless motherfucker. Though he\u2019s from somewhere in the U.S., he\u2019s apparently got brothels all over the world, from what the FBI can tell. He\u2019s made a fortune off the backs of ten-year-old girls in Thailand, along with distributing videos of orgies and gang rapes. Apparently, this sick bastard expanded his business to include high-end slave auctions about six months ago. He\u2019s abducting gorgeous, young submissives out of clubs and resorts, then smuggling them out of the country. The minimum bid for the sadistic fucks who want to buy is three million dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, that\u2019s twisted.\u201d Zeb frowned. \u201cWho has that kind of cash to drop on pussy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSheiks, Internet tycoons, obscure European royalty.\u201d Thorpe shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019re out there.\u201d</p><p>Zeb shook his head as he looked at the woman. \u201cThat almost makes me want to change my plans. She\u2019s probably scared to have this thrown at her as a first assignment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe volunteered,\u201d Thorpe clarified, obvious admiration in his voice. \u201cShe\u2019s never been out from behind a desk, but she\u2019s willing to risk her life for this. She deserves the best training we can give her, so these two agents are working to go undercover and hopefully recover the missing agent, who I suspect Agent York cares for as more than merely a peer.\u201d</p><p>Gorgeous, courageous, submissive. Everything Logan had heard about this woman intrigued him, and Thorpe\u2019s last statement perked him up even more. \u201cSo he and the redhead aren\u2019t an item?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not. They\u2019ve made their mutual discomfort of this training well known.\u201d</p><p>Sweet. \u201cAnd you haven\u2019t had any luck handling her?\u201d Logan asked Axel.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent all my time on York, thinking that if I can train him to lead, she\u2019d follow. Not happening.\u201d Axel\u2019s long blond hair brushed his shoulders as he shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to divide and conquer. So if you\u2019re willing to take on a novice, I\u2019m more than willing to dump her in your lap. Not that it looks like you\u2019ll mind.\u201d</p><p>As he reached for the doorknob, Logan smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>Axel pushed past him. \u201cSlow down. She\u2019s a tough cookie. I think she\u2019s a natural sub, but this is all new to her, so you can\u2019t just barge in there and go all Dom on her ass. Let me do the introductions and hand off. Then you can take the girl down to your dungeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come along, too,\u201d Xander cut in with a flashy grin. \u201cThorpe said sex wasn\u2019t required, but you never know what she\u2019ll need . . .\u201d</p><p>Wherever there was wet pussy, Xander was never far away. But the thought of his friend grinding his dick inside the redhead made Logan seethe. He shot his buddy a scathing glare.</p><p>\u201cWhat? She has a world-class ass,\u201d Xander defended. \u201cSue me.\u201d</p><p>It was impossible to argue with that. And while he didn\u2019t want to think about Xander fucking her, Logan knew that, chances were, his sudden ache for this woman would likely disappear before she\u2019d ever need sex.</p><p>Logan gestured to the door, then followed Axel and Xander down the hall to the next opening on the left. York looked up, tensed, clearly not digging the assignment. The female agent just set her shoulders and ignored him. That would change\u2014damn quick. For now, Logan let Axel ease the way.</p> <p>Quickly, Axel explained the situation. The male agent glanced at his female counterpart as she rose to her feet. Poor bastard actually looked relieved. Logan smiled, fighting back the urge to rub his hands together.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to introduce you two?\u201d Axel gestured between Logan and the redhead.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI got it from here. Face me.\u201d</p><p>The woman gasped, stiffened\u2014then darted to the other side of the room.</p><p>So she wanted to play games already? That was no problem for him.</p><p>Logan took off after her and grabbed her from behind, grasping a handful of that siren red hair. Damn, it was soft. Her breathing hitched, and he turned harder in an instant.</p><p>\u201cOn your knees. Stay there until I say otherwise. You\u2019re in training with me now, and I won\u2019t be as lax as Axel. I\u2019d rather complete introductions before I spank you, but that\u2019s your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet. Go. Of. Me.\u201d The woman fought his hold. \u201cLogan.\u201d</p><p>She knew his name? Her voice resonated in his head, crisp yet feminine. So fucking familiar. Impossible. It couldn\u2019t be . . .</p><p>He released her hair and grabbed her shoulders, still subduing her struggles. Heart pounding, he spun her to face him. That familiar face, angry dark eyes, and the mulish set of her pert little chin had him mentally flailing with shock. Holy fuck.</p><p>Logan gasped, stared. \u201cCherry?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cYOUR Cherry?\u201d Xander slanted a questioning glance in his direction.</p><p>Logan couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her or unscramble his brain enough to answer. He hadn\u2019t been this close to her in twelve years, one month, fifteen days, six hours, and a handful of minutes. Now she was in a dungeon to train as a submissive. With him.</p><p>She jerked from his hold and swatted his hand away, glaring at him with the full force of those furious brown eyes. Logan\u2019s belly pulsed with dark thrill and sexual heat. His first urge was to back her against a wall and bury himself deep inside her.</p><p>\u201cMy name isn\u2019t Cherry,\u201d she hissed. \u201cIt\u2019s Tara, not that I expect you remember.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he remembered. Hell, he couldn\u2019t forget. How was it possible that taking her virginity at sixteen had virtually ruined him for every other woman? He wished he could deny it, but if he tried, he\u2019d be lying.</p><p>Looking at her now, she was twice the woman she\u2019d been as a young girl. He\u2019d seen more beautiful females, but none who flipped his switch more.</p><p>\u201cTara Jacobs,\u201d he murmured, still staring as if she were a mirage that might disappear at any moment. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have passed sophomore lit if you hadn\u2019t tutored me.\u201d He stared, not really conscious of the words pouring out of his mouth, just the shock fueling them. \u201cStill a tiny thing. Still independent, I gather. Still have that little birthmark on the inside of your left thigh?\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped, sweet mouth gaping open. God, he\u2019d love to put his cock there. He hadn\u2019t had the chance to do that . . . yet.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your damn business.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest.</p><p>As if that defensive gesture would keep him away. Pfft.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Xander exclaimed. \u201cShe is your Cherry. It\u2019s all over your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up, Xander,\u201d Logan growled. \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>Axel cleared his throat. \u201cIt appears that you and Agent Jacobs are acquainted. That\u2019s my cue to back off and let you sort this little reunion out. Agent York?\u201d The tattooed Dom turned to the male agent. \u201cLet\u2019s go to Thorpe\u2019s office and talk.\u201d</p><p>York speared Tara with a concerned glance that rubbed Logan the wrong way. Just as he was about to offer to rearrange the agent\u2019s face, Tara sent the man a decisive nod.</p><p>\u201cXander, you, too,\u201d Axel said. \u201cSomething tells me Logan won\u2019t need your help with this one.\u201d</p><p>His one-man cleanup crew shrugged and followed Axel to the door. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Beating back his annoyance, Logan watched the trio file out. The door closed behind them with a soft click.</p><p>Now could he push Cherry up against the wall and bury himself inside her? One look at her face told him that she was less than amenable to that idea. But now that he was training her, he\u2019d have time alone with her. Get to simply touch her. God, he couldn\u2019t have planned this better if he\u2019d tried.</p><p>Tara stormed across the room, her fiery hair loosening from its clip after his manhandling. She removed it. The fiery tresses fell halfway down her back as she grabbed a robe out of the armoire against the far wall and thrust it on. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t given her permission to put that little silken robe on, but they\u2019d get to that. He had questions, and was sure that she did, as well.</p><p>Logan shrugged. \u201cI spend a lot of time here, actually. At least when I\u2019m on leave.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI\u2019d heard you joined the service. Army?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNavy,\u201d he corrected. \u201cSEAL.\u201d</p><p>That had her raising her delicate ginger brows. \u201cFrom jock to frogman. That\u2019s a stretch. Still a team player, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Oddly, her razor-sharp sarcasm, even in high school, was one of the things he\u2019d missed most about her after their split. The other thing had been her compassion.</p><p>A dozen years ago, he\u2019d hurt her badly\u2014and it had nearly killed him to rip her heart out. That she could still spare him even a shred of anger after all these years he took as a good sign. If he was irrelevant to her now, she\u2019d have no emotion beyond mild surprise. She certainly wouldn\u2019t bother to bristle and clutch that robe like a shield.</p><p>\u201cFrom budding author to FBI Agent. That is a stretch.\u201d</p><p>Then it dawned on him; he would be training his Cherry to go into the field, to submit to some unscrupulous asshole who sold females for a living, a man who would touch her, maybe hurt her. One agent had already disappeared, might even be dead. She\u2019d volunteered for immense danger. And he wouldn\u2019t be there to guide her. But York would.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest. Maybe that way she wouldn\u2019t see how hard his heart was pounding at the idea of her volunteering to walk into a snake pit. \u201cSince you\u2019re FBI, I presume you\u2019re proficient with a gun and hand-to-hand, but if you don\u2019t have the time or guts to fully prepare for a potentially dangerous BDSM environment, then I won\u2019t train you for this mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have the time and the guts, but you\u2019re right; you won\u2019t train me. I\u2019ll find someone else. But I am going to do my job. Darcy Miles, the missing agent, is my friend. And what I do is none of your business.\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019d thrown away the right to say anything when they\u2019d been sixteen, near the end of their sophomore year. She didn\u2019t spit out that she was no longer his, but the unspoken words hung brittle in the air, taking him back to that terrible day . . .</p><p>Tyler High School\u2014Twelve years ago</p><p>Logan pulled out his cell phone and tried Tara\u2019s number again. Once more, he heard her cheerful little voice telling him to leave a message\u2014just like the last hundred times he\u2019d called. He snapped his phone shut and raked a hand through his hair. God, this couldn\u2019t be happening. Where was she? Why hadn\u2019t she been in British Lit this morning? Clenching his fingers around his open locker, he tried not to hyperventilate or think about the menacing letter.</p><p>\u201cBro.\u201d Hunter, his older brother, stopped beside his locker, wearing a scowl. His blue eyes softened with concern.</p><p>\u201cSo they just let seniors roam the halls now?\u201d he tried to joke.</p><p>Hunter\u2019s mouth curled up, but it wasn\u2019t a smile. \u201cI got a hall pass to check on you after I heard that you\u2019d ditched out of Brit Lit earlier. How are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Mom was murdered yesterday, and I found her body. How am I supposed to feel?\u201d</p><p>Logan couldn\u2019t seem to stop the flashes of his mother\u2019s lifeless body, his horror at the spray of red running down the wall as she lay in a sludgy pool of her own blood.</p><p>At Hunter\u2019s sigh, Logan raked a hand through his hair. \u201cSorry. I know it hasn\u2019t been easy on you, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s harder on you. You\u2019d maintained a tight relationship with Mom after the divorce. I hadn\u2019t spoken to her since she left Dad last year. And I\u2019ll have to live with that.\u201d Hunter\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cBut just now, you seemed more concerned than grief-stricken. The worst has already happened. So what\u2019s up? It have anything to do with Tara being absent?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Logan opened his mouth, but nothing came out. He wanted to confide . . . but did he dare? Grappling with possibilities, he froze. Though he trusted Hunter with his life, the note had been very clear on the terrible consequences for failing to keep this to himself.</p><p>Hunter grabbed his shoulder. \u201cLook, I heard that you freaked out when she didn\u2019t show up for class. You wanna tell me something?\u201d</p><p>Maybe. Logan truly hoped his brother had decided to pull a sick prank last night. If Hunter was behind this, Logan would totally rearrange his face\u2014then breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cDid you jack with me yesterday by leaving a note on my pillow?\u201d</p> <p>Hunter scowled at him as if he thought Logan had a few screws loose. \u201cNo. When would I have done it? While we were at the police station? While I rocked Kimber to sleep?\u201d</p><p>Right. At eight, their little sister had been terrified last night. After hours at the police station, she\u2019d come away wise enough to understand that she\u2019d never see her mom again, but too young to cope alone. Hunter had stepped in and stayed all night. And he wasn\u2019t known for his levity, so hoping he\u2019d pulled the prank had been a stretch.</p><p>Which meant the threat was real. Logan swore under his breath. What the hell should he do?</p><p>Scanning the hall to make sure he and Hunter were alone, Logan gulped down nerves about to make his stomach revolt. \u201cLast night, not long after we got home from the police station, I found a note on my pillow. I\u2014it was from Mom\u2019s killer, threatening to kill Tara if I don\u2019t stay away from her.\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes widened with shock. \u201cWhat? Did you tell Dad or call the police?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he choked out. \u201cThe note said that if I told anyone, she\u2019d \u2018suffer.\u2019 Last night, I hoped it was just a sick prank. And I . . . needed to talk to Tara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called her?\u201d Hunter\u2019s grim tone said he disapproved of that impulse.</p><p>After all the police interviews, after they\u2019d removed his mom\u2019s body, Logan had needed to talk to the one person who understood what it was like to lose a mother. He\u2019d also wanted to check on her, make sure no one had harmed her. And after he\u2019d taken her virginity yesterday, she\u2019d surely ached for some reassurance. Yet his Cherry had brushed aside her own needs to help him. She\u2019d been so sympathetic on the phone, so understanding of his disbelief, anger, and confusion. Her voice alone had soothed him.</p><p>But after giving in to his need to hear her voice, he couldn\u2019t find her.</p><p>Dread pounded his stomach as he nodded. \u201cShe agreed to meet me at the park at nine. I waited an hour, but she never showed. On my way to her house, Dad found me and dragged me home and . . .\u201d He let out a sick sigh of worry. \u201cI tried to call Tara all night. She didn\u2019t answer or show up for class this morning.\u201d Logan crushed the heels of his hands into his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so fucking afraid that I got her killed.\u201d</p><p>The bell ending third period sounded. He looked frantically for Tara in the crowding halls, but saw no sign of her. Panic nearly choked him.</p> <p>Damn it, why hadn\u2019t he heeded the threat?</p><p>Hunter frowned. \u201cGiven Mom\u2019s brutal murder, if some asshole is threatening Tara, I\u2019d take it seriously and walk away.\u201d</p><p>Do without Cherry? Tears stung Logan\u2019s eyes. Until yesterday, he hadn\u2019t cried about anything or anyone since he was nine. But he\u2019d shed tears for Mom\u2014and now for Tara.</p><p>Maybe dealing with all the shock and death of the last twenty-four hours had changed him, but Logan feared that he couldn\u2019t live without Tara Jacobs. And he couldn\u2019t take another loss now, especially not hers.</p><p>\u201cBut I love her.\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s face turned grim. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then you\u2019d rather see her alive, right?\u201d</p><p>God, what kind of question was that? Of course. But . . . Jesus. He hated this feeling of helplessness, of his entire life being ripped apart all at once and him being unable to stop it.</p><p>With a clap on the back, Hunter said, \u201cI get that this is hurting you, man. But better you hurt than her.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s right. Swallowing the feeling of sick dread roiling through him, Logan turned away, opened his locker. Relief poured over him to find a neatly folded piece of paper. Maybe Tara had been running late this morning to school and left a note. She\u2019d done that once after a dentist appointment. God, let her be all right. With shaking hands, he tore into the white paper.</p><p>You didn\u2019t listen. Tara paid.</p><p>Air left his body with a whoosh as if he\u2019d been punched by a battering ram. Oh shit! He couldn \u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t blink. People moved in the halls around Logan, but for him, time stood still, while inside, he screamed a silent no!!!!</p><p>Over his shoulder, Hunter read the note and cursed. \u201cWhoever\u2019s behind this is isn\u2019t fucking around. They know who you are, where you live, and how you feel.\u201d</p><p>Every word of truth Hunter spoke stabbed him. What the fuck was he going to do? \u201cWhy her? What if she\u2019s been killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But if, by some chance, Tara is still alive, you need to stay away from that girl.\u201d</p><p>Crumpling the note in his fist, Logan tried not to cry again as he shoved it in his pocket and reached for his phone and dialed once more. He just needed to know that she was all right. Tara\u2019s voicemail picked up. He closed the phone and shoved it in his pocket.</p><p>Please be okay. Please . . . She had to be safe. If she wasn\u2019t, it would be his fault for calling her, for doing exactly what he\u2019d been warned against. And he\u2019d lose another loved one to terrible, sudden violence.</p><p>\u201cI have to take a Government test,\u201d Hunter murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at lunch. We\u2019ll talk more.\u201d</p><p>Absently, Logan nodded, his head still spinning as his brother walked away.</p><p>Fourth period was about to begin. And still, Tara hadn\u2019t come to her locker, only three down from his own. If she didn\u2019t, it would all be his fault. Logan raked a hand through his hair. Tara was so smart and responsible. She would never have missed school unless something was wrong.</p><p>On autopilot, he grabbed his books and closed his locker, fear eating at his composure. To say that the day before had been both the best and the worst of his life would be a gross understatement. His thrill that he\u2019d finally made Cherry his had totally amplified the horror of discovering his mom\u2019s body. The worry that he\u2019d spelled Tara\u2019s doom only made it all worse.</p><p>\u201cLogan?\u201d a shy voice whispered.</p><p>Cherry!</p><p>He whirled to find her standing beside her locker, pretty brown eyes bouncing up to his face, her expression concerned. Relief poured thorough him, and he ached to grab her, kiss her, get inside her again. They\u2019d get busted in the hallways if he did more than hold her hand. He didn\u2019t care about getting caught himself, but her overprotective stepfather already disapproved of him, an experienced jock sniffing around his pristine daughter. If Logan lured Adam Sterling\u2019s valedictorian-in-training into trouble, the man would only try harder to pull them apart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to call you.\u201d It came out like an accusation, but Logan was too strung out on worry to take it back.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I dropped my phone last night. It broke.\u201d</p><p>Logan released the last of his breath he\u2019d been holding. That was it? Thank God it hadn\u2019t been anything more serious. Thank God no one had harmed her.</p><p>At least not yet.</p><p>He stared, not sure how to how to explain his behavior. Not sure how much longer he could stop himself from touching her.</p><p>Then he realized that he shouldn\u2019t do either. He shouldn\u2019t even be talking to her now.</p><p>Under his intent gaze, a flush crawled up her skin, from the pale flesh above her little white cardigan, all the way to her lightly freckled nose. She nervously fingered a heart-shaped pendant around her neck, eyes cast down demurely. Was she remembering yesterday after school, when they\u2019d gone all the way? Logan ached to return to that blissful moment, when he\u2019d been able to truly experience first love\u2014without knowing any of the horrors that awaited.</p><p>A vision of Tara brutalized like his mother flashed through his head. If he didn\u2019t want that to become reality, he had to end this now.</p><p>Damn it, she stood two feet from him, and he could barely keep himself from reaching out to touch her. How agonizing would it be to see her every day but know that she might as well be a million miles away?</p><p>Logan swallowed all that down. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his arm. With that one touch, she soothed him. He closed his eyes and savored her for one selfish second, wishing it could last forever.</p><p>Then he jerked away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t make it last night,\u201d she apologized, her sweet face all but pleading with him to understand. \u201cYou needed me, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d He was sure there was a good reason she hadn\u2019t made it. His Cherry was nothing if not caring and conscientious. Maybe her stepdad had found out they\u2019d made love. Maybe she\u2019d gotten grounded. Logan frowned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fine. Logan, you found your mother murdered yesterday. Why are you even here today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad insisted on normalcy. You know the Colonel. Why deal with anything as paltry as emotion?\u201d And Logan knew that he shouldn\u2019t be seen talking to her now. Anyone\u2014a killer\u2014could be watching them. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan, you look . . . devastated. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t be there when you needed me.\u201d Her eyes filled with tears. For him. \u201cI\u2019m here now. I know how the death of a mom feels. I\u2019ll help you through it. We\u2019ll talk, or whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed. That was his Cherry\u2014giving, willing to do anything to soothe and please him. But he wanted her to live more.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anything from you.\u201d He turned away.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d She grabbed his shoulder, pulled him back. \u201cLet me explain last night. I snuck out and got on my bike to come to the park and see you. I didn\u2019t get two blocks before a car nearly ran me over.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s heart seized up. \u201cOh my\u2014Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>She angled her arm around from under her sweater. It was covered in a big white cast. The entire arm was in a sling. \u201cThe car came out of an alley. I guess whoever was driving didn\u2019t see my reflectors. I jerked away so they didn\u2019t mow me down, and they drove off. I hit the fence and fell. Dropped my phone. The jerk drove off. My shoulder was dislocated and my arm broken. My stepdad and I were in the ER until after midnight.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t listen. Tara paid. The warning burned through Logan\u2019s head.</p><p>He swallowed down fear. \u201cThe driver didn\u2019t stop to help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She looked down and shook her head. \u201cHe screeched off, like he was in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>Or like he didn\u2019t want any witnesses. Tara\u2019s \u201caccident\u201d had been Logan\u2019s last warning; he felt it all the way to his bones. Even now, standing in the hall with her, he could be signing her death warrant. Whoever had written this note had also killed his mother\u2014brutally. Bled her out and enjoyed her slow, torturous death. Logan knew that if he stayed near Tara . . .</p><p>Fuck, he couldn\u2019t even finish the sentence. The images pummeling his brain filled him with fresh panic. He forced himself to shake off her touch and back away.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Logan choked out and turned away to shut his locker.</p><p>For a moment, he squeezed his eyes closed. He didn\u2019t want to do this. Being without Cherry was going to hurt so fucking bad. He needed her, loved her. But this wasn\u2019t about him.</p><p>He drew in a deep breath. Once he turned and spoke to her, she\u2019d never look at him the same way again. In fact, she was so caring and certain to be worried about his grief that he\u2019d have to make sure she never wanted to speak to him again.</p><p>God, she was going to hate him for this. Hurting her was going to kill him.</p><p>Logan hesitated, pressed his lips together. No matter how excruciating, he needed to grow a set\u2014now. Better his heartache than her death.</p><p>Shoving down the anguish ripping him to pieces, Logan turned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you got hurt, but you not showing doesn\u2019t matter. Tara, we can\u2019t be together anymore.\u201d</p><p>Her expression became guarded. \u201cDid you finally decide that jocks like you can\u2019t be with brains like me?\u201d</p><p>Tara looked ready to tear into him for that, filling him with a bittersweet pride. He\u2019d love to take her to the prom, shock all his friends. Yeah, he was dating a smart girl. And he loved her. If they didn\u2019t like it, they could kiss his ass.</p><p>But the opportunity to show her off as his would never come now.</p><p>She shook her finger at him. \u201cI won\u2019t believe it. You\u2019ve spent three months convincing me that was my hang up, not yours. You haven\u2019t suddenly had a change of heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just not working for me. I\u2019m used to dating a certain kind of girl.\u201d Vapid, sleazy, and utterly dull. God, he\u2019d miss Cherry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tears filled her big brown eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re going to fail the Romeo and Juliet test without me.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he was, but he\u2019d scrape by for the semester. His grade was now the least of his worries.</p><p>The fourth-period bell rang. Tara looked up, realized the halls were empty. \u201cI\u2019m late to class. Can we talk about this after school?\u201d</p><p>He forced himself to spear her with a cold glare. \u201cWhy bother?\u201d</p> <p>She trembled as she tried to draw in a breath. \u201cBut after yesterday . . .\u201d</p><p>Yesterday. When he\u2019d shoved their books to the floor, laid her across his bed, and kissed Cherry out of her sweater and T-shirt, her shoes and pants, then finally her bra and panties. He\u2019d touched her all over. When he\u2019d finished, other than her red hair, he had no reason to call her Cherry anymore.</p><p>\u201cHi, Logan.\u201d Brittany Fuller, his ex-girlfriend, sauntered by with a wink.</p><p>\u201cBrit.\u201d He nodded, hoping like hell that she\u2019d keep walking.</p><p>She was pretty, had big tits, and loved every variety of sex, the wilder the better. But Tara had taught Logan that he required a brain and a heart in a woman. Brittany lacked both.</p> <p>Thankfully, she kept walking to her next class.</p><p>Cherry\u2019s face screwed up with jealousy. She couldn\u2019t stand the cheerleader on principle. Brit was lazy and slid by on her looks. Tara was a hard worker, blisteringly smart. She\u2019d made her contempt for Brittany\u2019s type well known. Once he\u2019d thought about it, Logan had realized that Tara was right. Which made what he was about to do all the more heinous.</p><p>He clenched his fists. \u201cIt\u2019s over. The tutoring, the sex. Don\u2019t call me anymore.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath, her creamy pale skin going ghostly white. Tears gathered in her pained dark eyes. \u201cYou\u2014you\u2019re upset. Your mom just died. Last night, you needed me a-and I didn\u2019t show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said for weeks that we had nothing in common.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just admitting now that you\u2019re right. I\u2019m getting back together with Brittany.\u201d</p><p>She was the last girl Logan wanted, but a couple of weeks with her would surely convince Tara to keep her distance.</p> <p>\u201cB-But yesterday. We . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucked. Yeah?\u201d</p><p>She gaped, shock blanching her face. \u201cYou said that you loved me.\u201d</p><p>He had, and he\u2019d meant it. But Logan loved her enough to cut his own heart out to keep her alive. \u201cLet that be a lesson not to believe everything you hear.\u201d</p><p>Tara lurched back as if he\u2019d stabbed her. \u201cYou bastard! My stepdad swore you\u2019d only hurt me. He gave me this necklace last night and told me to guard my heart. Too bad he was a few hours too late!\u201d She bit her lip, furiously fighting more tears. \u201cI hope someone breaks your heart someday, you son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Gripping her books in one hand, Tara turned away, then ran down the hall before she shoved into the girls\u2019 bathroom.</p><p>Logan watched, breaking apart into a million pieces inside. \u201cSomeone just did. I\u2019m so damn sorry, Cherry.\u201d</p><p>Dominion\u2014Present day</p> <p>Pressing her lips together, Tara grabbed her purse and clothes from the armoire, shoving the latter into a ball. It was either that or stare at Logan Edgington. If she did, she\u2019d have to acknowledge that he was more gorgeous than ever and still made her weak-kneed\u2014and that would only piss her off more. No way would she give the prick that satisfaction.</p><p>Twelve years ago, he\u2019d been a pretty, if somewhat gawky boy. Tall and thin with a hint of the broad chest to come and a mischievous smile. Today, he\u2019d grown into that body. Wide, bronzed shoulders bulged out beneath a white tank. Muscled pectorals that no T-shirt could conceal. The angles of his face, stark cheekbones, razor-sharp jaw, and dimpled chin, had once made him interesting. Now, they gave him the look of a predator, topped off by that dangerous blue stare.</p><p>God, why was he here? Didn\u2019t matter. She was leaving, right this minute.</p><p>Tara tucked the clothes under her arm. She would have loved to don them. Wearing little more than a bra and panties around the jerk who\u2019d conned her out of her virginity wasn\u2019t exactly comfortable, but no way would she give him the slightest hint that burning stare of his unnerved her. And no way in hell was she staying in this BDSM palace with him for even two more seconds.</p><p>God, it figures he\u2019d wind up spending \u201ca lot of time\u201d in a place where men played mind games and used women for pleasure. Logan had excelled at that, even in high school. And she refused to let him use her again.</p><p>Not sparing him a glance, she stormed toward the door.</p><p>\u201cTara.\u201d</p><p>Her first instinct was to turn and look at him. Because his voice snapped with command and made her pussy ache for some mysterious reason? Because she\u2019d deluded herself into thinking that she heard pain?</p><p>Tara kept walking.</p><p>She was so angry she could spit nails. It was irrational, she knew. Logan hadn\u2019t done anything to her today but surprise her. Too much frustration piled onto too little sleep, mixed with too much fear that her friend and fellow agent, Darcy Miles, could die any minute she spent in this tie-\u2019em-down-whip-\u2019em-up dungeon learning her role.</p><p>But her new boss, Jon Bocelli, had been perfectly clear when finally granting her this assignment. She\u2019d been given this opportunity because she solved mysteries well, kept her cool, was hell with a gun, and fit the victims\u2019 general background. Of course, he could find all that among existing agents. She\u2019d also been told she was the perfect bait because she had the physical attributes these men seemed to want. She was voluptuous and had a soft look about her. It didn\u2019t hurt that word had it they were looking for redheads. Beyond all that, though, what she possessed that others lacked, according to her psychological profile, was a submissive streak. Tara shuddered. Even the suggestion made her bristle. She hated being told what to do, but if the misconception worked in her favor, Bocelli could believe whatever he wanted. If she patently denied her \u201cnature,\u201d Bocelli would shuttle her behind a desk again, filtering intel.</p><p>She\u2019d volunteered for a field assignment to see if she was cut out to be an agent . . . and to see if following in Adam\u2019s footsteps would make her stepfather proud. She\u2019d only been given this assignment now because Bocelli didn\u2019t have a better option. No one would work harder to rescue Darcy.</p><p>And Tara knew that, unless she did something, Logan would be squarely in her way.</p><p>If she wanted him gone, she\u2019d have to talk to the club\u2019s owner. Mr. Thorpe seemed like a calm, rational man. Then, hopefully, she\u2019d never see her high school flame again.</p><p>But Logan was faster than her and took hold of her elbow.</p><p>He didn\u2019t exert pressure; he didn\u2019t need to. His touch alone sizzled through her like the shock of a live wire. To her horror, Tara felt her entire body heat up.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>His snapped command detonated through her system, his voice so hypnotic, so deep, it compelled her to obey. The need was almost more than she could resist. Her nipples peaked. An ache took up residence between her legs.</p><p>She hesitated, though her entire body stayed tensed for flight.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Damn it, she didn\u2019t want to. But that tone alone nearly seduced her compliance. Refusing would only make her look ridiculously stubborn. Or scared. The last thing Tara wanted to do was give Logan a reason to think he mattered, to presume for an instant that she\u2019d measured all lovers against him and found each lacking.</p><p>Drawing in a bracing breath, she met his gaze.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he murmured. \u201cLet\u2019s sit and talk. You can tell me more about this mission, and we\u2019ll talk about our best next steps.\u201d</p><p>No way was she going to risk Darcy\u2019s safety any more by wasting time with Logan. Yes, Tara was a professional, but she\u2019d have to be dead not to be distracted by the perceptive, gorgeous man staring at her now. Toss in their crappy history, and this had train wreck written all over it.</p><p>\u201cOr you could fuck off.\u201d Tara jerked from his grasp and marched out the door, giving it a satisfying slam behind her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t delude herself; if Logan wanted to make something of their unlikely meeting, he would. God knew, he\u2019d once pursued her with a single-minded intensity that had made her sixteen-year-old heart flutter. But unlike her teenage self, she knew better than to give him a second more of her time or mental energy.</p><p>And no, she wouldn\u2019t think about him at all when she lay in her bed late at night and put her hand on her clit, seeking satisfaction. Damn it.</p><p>After sneaking into a restroom in the hall, Tara wriggled into her gray suit and tucked her hair back into her professional chignon. She stepped into her heels and repaired her makeup. Feeling a thousand percent more confident, she wrenched open the door, half expecting to find Logan blocking her way. The hall was empty.</p><p>Hoping he\u2019d taken the hint, she made her way to Mr. Thorpe\u2019s office, the echo of her heels against the concrete floors too loud. At the office door, she knocked and waited.</p><p>\u201cYou may come in, Agent Jacobs.\u201d</p><p>Tara smothered her surprise as she opened the door. He\u2019d either known her identity because he had cameras installed in the hall or Logan had told him to expect her. Either way, she didn\u2019t care. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>The tight smile playing at his full mouth pricked her with unease. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>It was an order; not an invitation. If she wanted his cooperation, she shouldn\u2019t risk pissing him off.</p><p>Quickly, she settled into the stylish leather chair in front of the gigantic walnut desk and crossed her legs. Brushed nickel accented the rest of the office, along with glass shelves peppered with books, silk plants, and heinously expensive pottery. A Picasso hung on his wall. She was pretty sure it was real.</p><p>\u201cMr. Thorpe, I know you\u2019re busy, so I\u2019ll get to the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want someone else to train you.\u201d He peered at her with a penetrating stare, steepling his long fingers in front of his strong jaw. \u201cTell me why.\u201d</p><p>So Logan had filled him in. \u201cMr. Edgington and I knew each other in high school. To be blunt, I don\u2019t trust him. I never will.\u201d</p><p>From her research, she knew that trust was big in the Dom/sub relationship. She\u2019d start there. Tara sat back in the chair and waited.</p><p>As soon as she got settled, Thorpe stood, using his height advantage. He looked urbane enough, but under that expensive white dress shirt and impeccable chocolate slacks, she saw lots of muscle. He pinned her with a piercing stare, as if trying to read her mind. To hell with that.</p><p>\u201cBecause?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a liar.\u201d A ruthless one who didn\u2019t blink as he tore out a young girl\u2019s heart.</p><p>Thorpe stroked his close-cropped beard. \u201cHave you changed at all since high school, Agent Jacobs?\u201d</p><p>She knew where he was going, and she\u2019d have to cut short that line of thinking. \u201cOne hopes we\u2019ve all matured since high school, but fundamentally, some things about a person remain the same, no matter how \u2018grown up\u2019 they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He paced the room. \u201cDistant past aside, do you have any current objections to Logan?\u201d</p><p>What about the trust issue? \u201cAre you listening? There\u2019s no way I can put myself completely in his hands while I learn to say \u2018Sir\u2019 and \u2018please\u2019 every half second. I know Agent York needs quite a bit of training before he can assume the role, and I\u2019m fully aware that time is of the essence. I\u2019ll be happy to have anyone train me. Except Mr. Edgington.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched, and he looked like he was suppressing a smile. She didn\u2019t need this asshole to be amused at her expense.</p><p>\u201cAnswer my question.\u201d His quiet demand snapped in the air like a whip. \u201cDo you have any current objections against Logan? He\u2019s a highly decorated Navy SEAL with eight solid years in this club. I trained him myself, so I know very well who he is and what he\u2019s like. Do you?\u201d</p><p>God, Logan had gotten into this stuff a couple years after high school? Why? What need of his did it feed? Tara shook her head. It didn\u2019t matter. He wasn\u2019t her problem.</p><p>\u201cHis military service, while admirable, is of no comfort to me. His training, while I\u2019m sure thorough, can\u2019t make up for the fact that I distrust him. And I can\u2019t change how I feel. Mr. Thorpe, you\u2019re the best in the region, and the Bureau hired you to prepare me for this field mission\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did,\u201d he cut in. \u201cAnd I am trying to live up to my end of the contract. It\u2019s been frustrating to Axel that you\u2019ve been resistant and bratty all week. Uncooperative.\u201d</p><p>Determined to remain professional, Tara refused to betray her anger. \u201cI disagree. I\u2019ve been here, half dressed and on my knees, for ten hours a day, every day. I\u2019ve spent my nights and weekends researching the lifestyle\u2014reading, interviewing, whatever necessary to increase my knowledge.\u201d</p><p>He acknowledged her with a nod. \u201cPhysically, you\u2019ve done as asked. Intellectually, you\u2019ve got the fundamentals. Mentally and emotionally, you\u2019ve erected walls against participating in the power exchange. A shame, really, denying your submissive nature.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was that ridiculous assertion again. Just like Bocelli, Thorpe didn\u2019t know her at all.</p><p>\u201cMr. Thorpe, my nature isn\u2019t up for discussion. I\u2019m here to learn whatever I need to fake it and rescue Agent Miles.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Faking it\u2019 probably got Agent Miles captured. A Dom worth his salt can dig out a sub\u2019s true desires quickly. If she\u2019s not genuine about embracing her need to please her Master, he\u2019ll know. If you truly want to help your fellow agent, focus on finding the true sub within you.\u201d</p><p>His words wrapped around her neck like a vise grip and choked. Her stepfather had always called her a pleaser, which was why she\u2019d allowed Logan to take advantage of her. Of course she liked the idea of a man who knew her, body and soul, and fulfilled every dark fantasy. Nor could she deny having a bondage fantasy or two. But that hardly made her submissive. The thought of giving up her free will entirely to another . . . Tara shuddered inwardly. Hell no.</p> <p>Still, being here at Dominion was about the friend she\u2019d gone to college with, first gotten drunk with, shared holidays, beauty tips, illness, and breakups with. It had nothing to do with Logan.</p><p>\u201cI will do my best to embrace the role. I will work harder to internalize whatever I must before going undercover. But please, I\u2019m asking you to find anyone else but Mr. Edgington.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe sat on the edge of the desk, hovering. No doubt, he knew that the way he towered over her discomfited her. \u201cA pretty plea . . . but no. First, I won\u2019t let you top from the bottom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not manipulating a Dom to get my way.\u201d</p><p>At that, he sent her a sly, white grin. \u201cYou are\u2014and if you were mine, I\u2019d paddle you for that lie. In fact, your stubbornness is one reason Agent York isn\u2019t progressing. He\u2019s placating you instead of getting his act together. Second, Logan is the best at training subs who need, shall we say, an attitude adjustment. He\u2019s patient, logical, and unyielding. You, Agent Jacobs, need a firm hand. He\u2019ll give it to you, make no mistake.\u201d</p> <p>Bastard! \u201cYou\u2019re dragging out this training unnecessarily. Instead of simply getting comfortable with the lifestyle, you\u2019re forcing me to deal with a Dom I will never trust. How is that helpful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour employer paid me handsomely to prepare you for an urgent mission. Everything I have done is to prepare you, including taking away your choices. You have to get used to that since a submissive may only say yes or quit. That\u2019s what you haven\u2019t gotten through your head yet. The contract states that I\u2019m able, within legal bounds, to use my discretion and do whatever necessary to ensure your readiness. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. Or do you wish to quit before truly trying?\u201d</p><p>Low blow. Tara refused to give up on Darcy, and Thorpe knew it. She fought to hold down an angry flush. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He raised a dark brow. He wanted a \u201cSir\u201d out of her, damn him. But giving it would prove to him that she understood protocol\u2014and could embrace it.</p><p>And if she wanted another Dom, she needed to play his game.</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir,\u201d she murmured. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was slow and insincere. Your manners need work, Agent Jacobs. Logan may make you uncomfortable, but I believe he will be effective. I\u2019ve watched you with Axel this week. I saw from the observation room when you first realized that Logan had come for you. Your reaction was ...very enlightening.\u201d He prowled around to the edge of his desk again. \u201cFor the first time since you stepped in this door, you snapped to attention and listened. I\u2019ll bet he made you wet. There\u2019s a reason a sweet sub like you denies her nature, and Logan will get to the bottom of that. Besides, if you truly are unable to trust him ever again, this will be good training for your mission. You\u2019ll never trust an international slave dealer who wants you to kneel at his feet so he can sell you to the highest bidder. Pretending obedience will do you good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t it take less time to prepare me if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not without recourse,\u201d Thorpe broke in. \u201cYou will be monitored, for safety\u2019s sake. If Logan genuinely pushes you past what\u2019s bearable or forces any act on you, you always have your safe word. Should you truly need to use it, we\u2019ll discuss your options then.\u201d He rose from the desk and opened his door. \u201cGood-bye.\u201d</p><p>Tara rose to her feet stiffly. The bastard thought he had this all figured out. Fine. If he wasn\u2019t going to believe her, there was no sense wasting more time arguing. Giving one hundred percent to her mission and rescuing Darcy was the priority. Thorpe had all but told her the way out of this nonsense. Now all she needed was an opportunity.</p><p>Whirling to face the club\u2019s owner, she opened her mouth\u2014and closed it when she saw they were no longer alone. Logan leaned against the doorjamb, staring at her with a dissecting blue gaze that promised punishment. Against her will, her womb clenched.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Cherry. Apparently, I need to start with that spanking, after all. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>TARA swallowed. Her heart fell to her knees as Logan stepped aside just enough for her to exit Thorpe\u2019s office. She didn\u2019t look his way as she turned down the hall. Even without seeing the harsh angles of Logan\u2019s face, she felt his heat and leashed anger simmering behind her. He was furious that she\u2019d tried to have him replaced. Why the hell did he care? He\u2019d cast her aside twelve years ago. Yes, he\u2019d been reeling after his mother\u2019s murder, and she would have excused anger or aloofness. But not his cruelty. What the hell did he want now? The sick thrill of hurting her again? She\u2019d be damned if she let him, because she\u2014and more important, Darcy\u2014didn\u2019t need Logan\u2019s head games.</p> <p>But she couldn\u2019t deny that rankling his Edgington pride had given her a thrill.</p><p>Logan steered her with a light touch at the small of her back, his fingertips like a brand as he guided her down the long hallway that led to more shadowy rooms with equipment that shocked her\u2014and jolted her with a shameful hot spark. Tara hated that, almost as much as she wanted to hate his touch.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be spending a lot of time in my dungeon, Cherry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re training, you have no control over what I call you, what you do, or what you wear. Your only choices are to obey or quit.\u201d</p><p>Immediately, Tara got his game. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to push in every way possible to induce me to throw in the towel, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He raised an intimidating brow, but said nothing.</p><p>Bastard. Clearly he didn\u2019t know how much spine she\u2019d grown since high school. Yet.</p><p>\u201cYou think I can\u2019t handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer you out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job to do everything possible to save Agent Miles. I don\u2019t give a shit what you want.\u201d</p><p>Logan clenched his jaw. \u201cGoing undercover when you have no experience in either covert operations or submissive behavior is incredibly brave. But it\u2019s also very dangerous. You should have more field experience first. Since you don\u2019t, it\u2019s my job to thoroughly prepare you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not let someone else do the job?\u201d She thrust her hand on her hip. \u201cYou made it crystal clear years ago that you don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of this as my atonement for our past. Now let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>With a nudge, he urged her forward. Anger shimmered off of him. His presence filled the air around her, forbidding. Atonement, my ass.</p><p>Repressing a quiver of apprehension, Tara moved forward, heels clicking on the hard floors as he stalked behind her. He might be in charge . . . for now. But she had one power that Logan absolutely must respect. The minute he tried to exert his will? She\u2019d blurt her safe word faster than he could spit. Thorpe, watching their exchange, would be forced to replace Logan with another Dom. Then she could get down to serious training. But whatever her first lover\u2019s game, she wasn\u2019t playing.</p><p>Logan guided her to a room she\u2019d never seen and flicked on the overhead lights. The space was utilitarian, with gray concrete floors and black walls. A padded table, a spanking bench that looked like a sawhorse, a large wooden X, and a bed outfitted with nothing but a fitted, black silk sheet. Was this his dungeon?</p><p>\u201cInside.\u201d</p><p>She stepped in and whirled on him as he slammed the door. And locked it.</p><p>Tara shot him a cold glare. \u201cDon\u2019t try to scare me by playing the heavy.\u201d</p><p>He pierced her with a stare as he crossed the floor to stand beside the giant wooden X. Manacles dangled from heavy-duty bolts both at top and bottom. \u201cI\u2019m not playing. Come here and present yourself.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the apparatus, shoving down a shiver of apprehension. \u201cIf we\u2019re a team, I need to know what\u2019s going on. We should discuss how to proceed with this training.\u201d</p><p>His stare grew icy. \u201cWe may be a team, but I\u2019m in charge. I didn\u2019t give you permission to speak. First warning. Come here and do as you\u2019re told or we\u2019ll start our time together with a hell of a spanking.\u201d</p><p>Spanking, as in his hand on my ass? The thought rippled through her with an involuntary blast of heat. Tara didn\u2019t waste her breath to challenge Logan and say that he wouldn\u2019t dare. He would.</p><p>Damn it. Why did that make her panties damp?</p><p>She approached him, stopping a few safe feet away.</p><p>He raised a brow. \u201cYou can\u2019t follow my simple instructions, but you\u2019re going to breeze through some slave-peddling asshole trying to mold you into the perfect submissive while you search for your missing agent?\u201d</p><p>Tara paused. As much as she wanted to hate him now . . . he was right. Until Thorpe assigned her a new Dom, she was stuck with Logan. And whatever the situation, she had to control her anger\u2014and her anxiety that Logan would touch her.</p><p>Drawing in a deep breath, Tara dropped down into the pose Axel had taught her, sitting back on her heels, legs spread as much as her skirt allowed, palms up on her thighs, shoulders back, head down.</p><p>Logan walked a slow circle around her, his stare touching her everywhere. Though she kept in good shape, Tara had a generous booty no matter how much she exercised. But she didn\u2019t care if Logan loathed her figure. Brad, her fianc\u00e9, liked it just fine.</p><p>Logan crouched in front of her. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Tara met his stare with cool challenge.</p><p>That blue gaze penetrated her defenses, and despite wearing a skirt, blouse, and heels, she felt stark naked. Her skin grew hot and tight as he scrutinized her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the form of the pose itself, as I\u2019m sure you know. You always studied every subject thoroughly. That won\u2019t be enough to slide by with submission. What matters is not merely that you obey, but that there\u2019s obedience in your heart.</p><p>\u201cYou dropped into position quickly when I reminded you about your fellow agent\u2019s well-being,\u201d he went on. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t come to me with any desire to please me. You spoke after I told you to remain silent. I see anger all over your face.\u201d</p><p>She blanked her expression and stared through him. \u201cI\u2019ll try harder next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may not have a next time. Agent Miles doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He was right. Shit, this arrangement was never going to work. Yes, she needed to keep her head in the game, but there was too much past between them that she couldn\u2019t seem to forget. If she was going to stop wasting time and get rid of Logan, she needed to do it now.</p><p>Tara slanted him an innocent stare. \u201cDid you wish to spank me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, like the bratty sub you\u2019re being, until you think twice about letting your temper get the best of you. That will be fatal in the field. Unless, of course, you\u2019d like to quit the mission and send a more experienced agent in your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no. Unlike you, I don\u2019t turn my back on others.\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked in Logan\u2019s cheek. \u201cI still didn\u2019t give you permission to speak. That\u2019s something that won\u2019t be tolerated when you\u2019re undercover. For that, I\u2019ll punish you with two swats, in addition to the five I\u2019d already decided to give you for running to Thorpe instead of working your differences out with me. For cursing, I\u2019m adding another two. For failing to address me as \u2018Logan,\u2019 I\u2019ll add three more.\u201d</p><p>Neither Axel nor Robert had touched her all week. Nor had she wanted them to. But against her will, Tara flashed hot at the dizzying number of blows Logan promised to inflict on her ass. Her womb cramped. Damn it, she shouldn\u2019t react like this with him. \u201cDon\u2019t most of you control freaks want to be called Sir or Master?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. It wasn\u2019t a nice sound. \u201cUsually. For you, I\u2019m making an exception. I want to hear my name on your lips so I know you\u2019re aware of exactly who\u2019s making you come.\u201d</p><p>Tara bit her tongue. She\u2019d love to toss his self-assurance back in his face and vow there was no way in hell he\u2019d arouse her enough to climax. But if he\u2019d managed to make a virgin gasp and claw and melt in his arms at sixteen, what could a grown man do to a woman hungry for another orgasm like that? It was a nonissue. They wouldn\u2019t be together that long. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to make me come. That\u2019s my fianc\u00e9\u2019s role.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d read that you were engaged to Brad Thompson. I figured you\u2019d fall in love with someone who had at least a shred of honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince he didn\u2019t lie to me to steal my innocence, then dump me flat the next day, I\u2019d say he\u2019s a huge step up from you.\u201d</p><p>Logan tensed, fists clenching, muscles bunching, veins bulging. \u201cWhen you\u2019re with me, the man is irrelevant. His name does not cross your lips. That ring comes off your finger. Are we clear?\u201d</p> <p>It bothered him to see her wearing a symbol of Brad\u2019s possession. She smiled and slowly peeled it off before placing it in her skirt pocket. \u201cAs long as you understand that you\u2019re not to touch me sexually. I choose to give him my orgasms.\u201d</p><p>And she would . . . if Brad could arouse her enough to have one.</p><p>His smug smile made her heart stutter. \u201cYou agreed to be trained. That means I\u2019ll push you far beyond your comfort level so that you\u2019ll become accustomed to acts that, right now, may be uncomfortable. We\u2019ll see what your body says when I\u2019ve got your legs spread and my tongue all over your clit. Again.\u201d</p><p>Tara bit her lip to keep from sucking in an inflamed breath. His words flared heat between her legs as memories bombarded her. More moisture coated her panties. Damn it, why did her body react to him with anything other than disgust?</p><p>\u201cNo commentary?\u201d he asked with an arched brow. \u201cGood. Now where was I? Oh, for your disrespect in calling me a control freak, I\u2019ll add another three smacks. How many is that so far?\u201d</p> <p>God, she wanted to spit in his face. \u201cFifteen.\u201d</p><p>Logan smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have the most gorgeous rosy ass when I\u2019m through with you, Cherry.\u201d</p><p>Tara wished she had the luxury of telling him there was no way she was letting him touch her ass, but she needed to rid herself of Logan and get another Dom. Until then, she\u2019d stick it out, no matter how difficult or distasteful.</p><p>\u201cYour temper is brewing again. We\u2019ll work on that. But first, I told you to present yourself, not merely pose.\u201d</p><p>She froze as his meaning sank in. \u201cYou want me naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And watch your tone, or I\u2019ll add more punishment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAxel allowed me to train in my bra and panties so I\u2019d be relaxed and comfortable for our lessons.\u201d</p><p>Logan snorted. \u201cIn BUDs training for SEALs, the instructors deprive the trainees of all relaxation and comfort for hours on end to more closely simulate the stress and difficulty of real combat and covert situations. I subscribe to their theory that immersion training is most effective. What\u2019s this called?\u201d He pointed to the wooden X with dangling manacles. A something-or-other cross. Her terrible curiosity about what it would feel like to be bare as he secured her to one scared the hell out of her.</p><p>She willed herself to find the term, but with apprehension and unwanted lust clouding her brain, it didn\u2019t happen in the long, silent minute.</p><p>\u201cA St. Andrew\u2019s Cross,\u201d he said into her silence. \u201cWhat kind of ring is this?\u201d He pointed to the thick metal implement from which the manacles at the top and bottom of the cross dangled.</p><p>Tara went blank. \u201cA metal ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an O ring,\u201d he supplied. \u201cAnd you \u2018learned\u2019 this while in your bra and panties?\u201d</p><p>Crap.</p><p>\u201cWe agreed to train in bathing suits or lingerie. Besides my being engaged, Robert\u2014Agent York\u2014is a coworker. We\u2019ll have to work together after this is over, and we both wanted to avoid as much of the awkwardness as possible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou and York are now undergoing separate training, so problem solved. And I\u2019ve already seen it all, Cherry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThorpe is watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s likely not the only man who will see you naked before this mission is over. You\u2019re going to last longer if you focus only on pleasing the Dom in front of you. When you\u2019re ready to work, remove everything, fold it neatly at my feet, then resume your position. Hesitating will cost you another ten swats.\u201d</p><p>Fury broiled her composure. God, what had she ever seen in him besides those shiver-worthy blue eyes?</p><p>Once upon a time, he\u2019d seemed really, really genuine with her. In high school, they\u2019d studied British literature classics, and she\u2019d learned a lot about his heart. He\u2019d debated Shakespeare\u2019s star-crossed teen lovers, worried about Tiny Tim. He\u2019d even wrung his hands waiting for Elizabeth Bennett to have her happily ever after with Mr. Darcy. And she\u2019d delighted at his capacity to feel.</p><p>That boy was long gone, if he\u2019d ever really existed.</p><p>Now, the bastard was doing everything possible to make her job hell. Tara pressed her lips together and wiped the mulish expression off her face. Think proving yourself on this mission, think Darcy.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he barked. \u201cThat position you\u2019re in is not only for you to show your obedience, but your willingness to accept your Dom in whatever way he wishes to have you. It\u2019s also to tempt him by showing off your body. I can\u2019t see what you\u2019ve covered, Cherry. Strip.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. Being naked again for Logan . . . The cold ball of dread settling in her gut warred with the hot ache brewing between her legs. Baring herself to him would make her frighteningly vulnerable, but submitting to his demand so they could get on with this farce was necessary. She swallowed down her nerves.</p><p>After a few swats of his hand on her ass, Tara vowed that Logan would be out of her life again\u2014this time for good.</p><p>She stood and stepped out of her heels, sliding them aside, then removed her bracelet, earrings, and chunky silver necklace. She shrugged out of her suit coat and unbuttoned her rumpled eggshell blouse, closing her eyes to block out his presence.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>His voice compelled her. Almost against her will, Tara complied. Logan stood mere inches away, watching intently as she stripped the blouse from her pale shoulders, revealing her nude lace bra. His eyes heated. His nostrils flared. Her heart pounded. The sheer fabric did nothing to hide her peaked nipples as she folded the silky shirt. A shuddering inhalation later, she unhooked her bra and let it drop to the floor. His fists tightened at his side.</p><p>He wanted her. A quick glance down the front of his leather pants proved that she was turning him on. Tara didn\u2019t want to care that she got to him, but dangerous feminine thrill zipped through her.</p><p>Still, this was the first weakness he\u2019d displayed. Maybe she could use it to her advantage.</p><p>Tara retrieved her bra, folded it, then set it on top of her blouse and coat. When she stood again, she infused her stare with a bit of challenge and come-hither. His whole body went taut.</p><p>\u201cThe rest,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Heart racing, she shimmied out of her knee-length gray skirt, putting a bit of extra sway in her hips. She used it as camouflage, folding it very slowly to avoid losing her engagement ring\u2014and to tease him by delaying the moment he\u2019d see her tiny lace thong. Tara held her breath as she made the final fold, then set it on top of her bra.</p><p>She looked up at Logan. His heated gaze devoured her flushing face, swelling breasts, dampening sex. His severely short hair emphasized his high cheekbones, his hard jaw. He looked ready to eat her alive. A fresh jolt of desire pounded through her, as subtle as a sledgehammer.</p><p>When had Brad ever looked at her like that?</p><p>Shoving the thought aside, she hooked her thumbs on the sides of her ruffled panties. All she had to do was inflame Logan and let him spank her a little\u2014after she revealed her body and let him touch her one last time.</p><p>She pulled the thong down.</p><p>HOLY shit.</p><p>As Cherry peeled those little panties down her feminine thighs, Logan nearly swallowed his tongue. She\u2019d definitely grown from a girl to a woman. She\u2019d put on twenty pounds since sixteen, all in her hips, ass, and breasts. Tara\u2019s tiny waist and dainty shoulders offset all that lush, rounded perfection. And the best part? Fiery red hair dusted her puffy pink mound. She was so damn pretty everywhere. And he wanted his mouth on her so badly, he\u2019d fucking beg.</p><p>Setting his jaw into a grim line, Logan tried to wrangle in this feeling. She hated him\u2014and had every right to. Besides, she was all but married. The thought that an ass like Brad Thompson had her heart damn near brought him to his knees. Logan had known for a long time that he hadn\u2019t gotten over Tara sexually, but had hoped the fixation stopped at his dick.</p><p>Now he knew he hadn\u2019t been that lucky.</p><p>All the emotion he\u2019d been trying to manufacture with Callie and countless other subs just so he could jack off? A pale comparison. Tara had barely gotten naked, and already he felt like sinking his cock into her and staying until, oh . . . next month. But he also wanted the right to cover her plump bow of a mouth with his own, put his arms around her, and tuck her beside him and . . . just be.</p><p>Impossible. Tara was on a dangerous mission. If he didn\u2019t train her well, she was going to give herself away and die\u2014unless he could talk her out of this suicide operation. Maybe, if she got a firsthand taste of how men capable of spending millions of dollars on \u201cdisposable pussy\u201d would treat her, she\u2019d bail. The Cherry he\u2019d known had been fanciful, hadn\u2019t possessed a violent thought, and had no capacity for subterfuge. Though she\u2019d clearly improved her poker face since high school, he didn\u2019t want her on this mission. She wasn\u2019t stupid or incapable at all, but she couldn\u2019t possibly have the frame of reference to understand the kind of scum she was up against.</p><p>The last thing Logan wanted to do was hurt her again, but he had to give her a clue.</p><p>As he stepped toward her, she looked braced for battle. Challenge sparkled in her pretty dark eyes. He stared. She was up to something. Whatever it was, he couldn\u2019t let her win. He\u2019d been a prick to her once to save her life. History was destined to fucking repeat itself.</p><p>His gaze brushed over her rosy, hard nipples as she folded her tiny little thong and set it on top of her clothes. Obediently, she dropped into position, on her knees, head down, palms up.</p><p>God damn, what he wouldn\u2019t give for her submission to be real.</p><p>\u201cBetter, Cherry.\u201d</p><p>He glanced across the room at the mat Callie had occupied earlier. The thought of putting Tara in that same spot curdled his gut. Ditto for the spanking bench. Logan didn\u2019t want to do the usual with her. His eyes lit on the bed he\u2019d never used. Xander had insisted on something cozier, and Logan hadn\u2019t cared enough to refuse.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>\u201cOn your feet.\u201d</p><p>Tara hesitated, a moment\u2019s surprise flashing across her delicate face, before she stood gracefully, eyes still downcast. She\u2019d been doing her homework, and he applauded that. It also meant that it might take more than he\u2019d planned to rattle her.</p><p>\u201cWalk to the bed. Stand beside it and wait for me.\u201d</p><p>Shoulders set with determination, she made her way across the room. Logan watched the sway of her hips, the roll of her prime ass. When she reached the foot of the bed, she turned to face him, her skin was flushed, her expression sultry. She was enjoying the knowledge that he wanted her. The thought of keeping her naked and aroused, her sweet cunt ready for him . . .</p><p>No, he had to prepare her for a mission or goad her into quitting.</p><p>Logan prowled toward her, then sat on the silk sheet. \u201cCome closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I get a safe word first?\u201d</p><p>Cherry was more interested in a safe word than beginning her training? She was definitely up to something. \u201cHow about . . . Romeo. If that word clears your lips, we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a startled glance, then cleared her features. \u201cRomeo. Okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Lay yourself across my lap and present your ass for punishment. No coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d Tara stopped herself and bit back her irritation.</p><p>\u201cAnd no talking. If I was capable of selling you to a Colombian drug lord willing to pay five million dollars for the privilege of raping you, do you think I\u2019d be letting you speak? Follow directions or suffer more punishment.\u201d</p><p>Her body tensed as she lowered herself awkwardly over his thighs. Immediately, he knew Cherry had never done this. She wasn\u2019t sure how to balance her weight, where to perch. That fact pleased him more than it should.</p><p>With a guiding hand on soft skin that only made him want to fuck her more, he helped her settle. \u201cCount for me, Cherry. Lose track, and we start over.\u201d</p><p>He needed to get on with scaring her half to death, but the sight of that pale, curvy ass spread across his thighs had Logan swallowing down a fireball of lust. Nothing was going to help his cock. It poked Tara, desperately seeking her heat. She kept trying to shift away, and instead rubbed herself all over it.</p><p>Logan stopped her with a hand at the small of her back. She\u2019d stilled, but he could hear her heavy breathing as he caressed down until he palmed her sweet ass. He nearly groaned. God, he could sink his fingers, his teeth, his cock into that flesh and be one happy bastard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Focus.</p><p>Raising his hand, Logan hesitated. He didn\u2019t want to hurt her, but damn, he couldn\u2019t afford to back off. If he had any hope of getting her to quit, he had to unleash some bad shit.</p><p>Steeling himself, he bypassed the warm up and struck her harder than he\u2019d ever hit a sub. His swat landed on her right check with a deafening smack. She yelped, jerked. Logan winced. His palm stung like a bitch, so he could only imagine how poor Cherry felt.</p><p>\u201cCount,\u201d he choked out.</p><p>\u201cOne.\u201d Her voice wobbled.</p><p>Ruthlessly, he squelched his guilt. \u201cReady for more?\u201d</p><p>Under him, she tensed, clearly bracing for more pain. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t, but she\u2019d never admit it. As much as he admired tenacity, not curbing her stubbornness could get her killed on this mission.</p><p>As he lifted his hand again, he saw the clear red print of his hand on her ass. His cock jerked. He\u2019d love to put his stamp all over her. No doubt, she would think that made him a sick fuck, but Logan knew that ship had sailed long ago.</p><p>He gave her another harsh slap on her left cheek. Tara cried out, her body jolting, as she took the blow. Her nails dug into his calf as she tried to process the pain.</p><p>\u201cGet your nails out of my skin and count,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Tara\u2019s back stiffened, and she shuddered, panted. \u201cTwo.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d silently punctuated the statement with you asshole. He could hear it hanging in the air. When he saw her struggling to accept his blows, he felt like an asshole.</p><p>Logan drew his arm up to deliver another swift blow to her upper thigh. She tensed, every line in her body screeching with anger. He hesitated. This wasn\u2019t scaring her, just reinforcing her low opinion. She expected pain from him. In fact, she was holding her breath expectantly, like she was waiting . . .</p><p>What the hell was she up to? What would a novice sub trying to control a scene do?</p><p>Immediately, Logan knew he was playing right into Tara\u2019s hand. Shit. He lowered his arm.</p><p>\u201cOn your feet,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>Tara froze. \u201cWh-what about the rest of the spankings?\u201d</p><p>Fully capable of math\u2014she\u2019d kicked his ass in algebra, too\u2014she knew they hadn\u2019t completed fifteen swats. Nor had she been looking forward to the rest of such a brutal spanking. She\u2019d merely been looking for an excuse to scream her safe word.</p><p>Logan gave her credit; she\u2019d always been clever.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of your punishment will wait. When we\u2019re together, I want you to look at me. Always at me.\u201d</p><p>That chocolate gaze zipped up to his\u2014hard, resolved. No fucking way was she backing down. And cutting her off before she could credibly use her safe word had pissed her off. If she\u2019d succeeded, how quickly would Thorpe hustle her out the door? PDQ, no doubt. Likely, Logan would never see her again.</p><p>He needed another tactic. How would Tara respond to his genuine desire for her? She might hate what he\u2019d done to her in high school. But as he admired her body, Logan saw that didn\u2019t stop her from wanting him. Hard pink nipples stood up and beckoned. The plump lips of her pussy glistened. Something about this\u2014about him\u2014was getting to her. Mentally, she\u2019d write off his spanking as abuse and cast him in the villain role. But what if he gave her what he ached to? What he\u2019d bet that her body, deep down, wanted as well? How long would those walls she\u2019d erected between them last? Maybe then they could get to something honest so they could sort this mission out\u2014and he could heal himself.</p> <p>Logan gripped his thighs through his leathers. \u201cTake my shirt off, Cherry.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze went saucer wide, locking with his. That look sizzled him, settling down in his throbbing cock. He vowed to drink in the arousal burning through him. For as long as he had her, he was going to gorge on her every reaction\u2014and anything else she gave him.</p><p>Tara pressed her lips together, clearly reluctant. He watched her steel herself, then lift her hands to the hem of his T-shirt. She trembled as she did her best to lift up the cotton knit with an impersonal thumb and forefinger, and he thanked God for the tight garment. It forced her to lay her palms against his abdomen and shove the shirt up his torso, dragging across his skin, over muscle, so near his nipples. She brushed fire everywhere she touched. He repressed a shiver. When the shirt bunched under his arms, she stopped.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem, Cherry? Keep going.\u201d</p><p>He knew full well it would force her up on her tiptoes, putting her face breathlessly close to his.</p><p>Raising up, Tara grabbed a handful of shirt and yanked.</p><p>Logan grabbed her wrist. \u201cSlowly.\u201d</p><p>Bastard! Her expression screamed it. Her fists clenched.</p><p>He did nothing to help her as she raised the white cotton, dragging it up one arm, then the other, her mouth a bare inch under his own. He could smell mint on her breath. And that cherry-vanilla scent he\u2019d always known as hers wafted between them. His mouth watered.</p><p>Her gaze fell on the bold black tattoo she\u2019d revealed, etched permanently on his ribs from armpit to hip.</p><p>Logan tensed. \u201cYou read Japanese?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever quit,\u201d he lied. The truth would freak her out.</p><p>Finally, she jerked the shirt over his face, then stepped back the instant the cotton cleared his head. That wouldn\u2019t do.</p><p>With one hand, he grabbed the garment and tossed it to a far corner of the room. With the other, he latched his hand around her neck. \u201cYou never back away from me without permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going to spank me again?\u201d she challenged.</p><p>No way would he give Tara the perfect means to ditch him. \u201cLie down on the bed, back flat against the mattress, legs spread.\u201d</p><p>Though she didn\u2019t gasp or betray herself, her shock rippled across the tense silence. He could almost read her thoughts whirling as she wondered, worried, what the hell he was going to do.</p><p>\u201cCherry, is there a problem?\u201d He repressed a smile and crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>Slowly, Tara dropped one knee to the bed, then caught her weight on her outstretched hands. After a pause, she turned over, until her back hit the cool sheet. She hissed at the unexpected chill, arched, then settled.</p><p>Fuck, all that red hair spread out across black silk, along with the sweet purity of her pale skin. Incredibly, he got harder. His dick would have a permanent zipper imprint if he didn\u2019t get his leathers off soon.</p><p>Tara was, no doubt, the fantasy he\u2019d harbored all these years\u2014only better. As a teen, she\u2019d been a little shy. He\u2019d never understood why she lacked self-confidence; from his perspective she\u2019d had it all. Tara now knew who she was, wasn\u2019t afraid to exert her independence. She was still clever and a bit of a mystery . . . but Logan still knew her, felt her.</p><p>Right now, her trembling apprehension and anticipation damn near stole his breath and strangled his cock. Shit, he\u2019d better get himself under control and seduce her into quitting or obeying, or he\u2019d forget his purpose and do whatever it took to steal her for himself.</p><p>As before, saving her life was more important than saving his heart.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember you ever having trouble following directions, Cherry. There\u2019s one more part of the instruction.\u201d</p><p>She had to be mad enough to spit nails. But she hid any anger or apprehension fairly well as she complied, slowly drawing her slender thighs apart, revealing the inside of her knees, the creamy expanse of skin up the inside of her leg. More . . . more, until the little birthmark appeared on the inside of her left thigh, exactly as he remembered.</p><p>Satisfaction roared through him. Rightness. No matter what happened, a part of him would always belong to Cherry\u2014and she to him.</p><p>Finally, she eased her legs far enough apart to show every bit of the pink, swollen heaven he was dying to sink into. Sheer fucking orgasmic heaven awaited. He belonged there. Connected to her\u2014skin, breaths, hearts.</p><p>Logan edged closer and lowered himself to the bed. With his heart racing, he rolled beside her and propped his head on his hand. Cherry\u2019s guarded brown gaze met his. Oh yeah, she was dying to know what he had planned.</p><p>He could ease her into his touch, and if he was playing for keeps, that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019d do, give her a slow, sweet ramp up to an undeniable arousal that would have her gasping and clinging and begging to follow his every demand to the ultimate pleasure again and again.</p><p>But he had to make her not just want to escape him, but the whole assignment. Regret stabbed him, and he had the most insane urge to do nothing more than wrap his arms around her, bring her body flush against his and simply hold her until she lost all that starch.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t afford it.</p><p>Wrapping his hand under her neck, he tilted her head up until he was fully in control, then covered her mouth in a greedy kiss. He didn\u2019t ease inside or wait for her acceptance; he prowled in.</p><p>Instantly, hunger roared through his belly, mowing down his good intentions, screaming at him to get deeper and consume her. She stiffened against him at first, struggled for a moment, only to realize that he\u2019d positioned her so that she couldn\u2019t move. When she gasped, he plunged in again, so ravenous for her his entire body was taut, aching. Tara anchored her hands on his shoulders. Logan braced for her to push him away. Instead, after a moment\u2019s pause, she curled her hands around his neck, urged him closer, and twined her tongue around his hungrily.</p><p>Shock vibrated down his spine. Searing arousal followed.</p><p>His Cherry tasted like . . . everything. All he\u2019d wanted for years. The essence that had haunted him. This is what he\u2019d been missing. What he needed. Her.</p><p>Deeper he pressed into her mouth, laving, tasting, possessing. She met him, frenzied stroke for stroke as he wrapped an arm around her waist and crushed her bare torso against his own in a sizzle of skin. He slid a leg between hers. She cried out as he rubbed his thigh against her folds. The wetness of her pussy coated his leather-clad thigh so he slid against her more easily than melted butter. He fucking ached with the knowledge that she wanted him, too.</p><p>For the first time in a decade, Logan felt complete.</p><p>How the fuck was he going to goad her into ending this mission, knowing he\u2019d likely never see her again? He knew he should, but now that he\u2019d touched her, he needed at least a few precious moments more to savor her before she was gone forever.</p><p>\u201cCherry, baby . . .\u201d he murmured against her soft lips, so sweet with a flavor so uniquely her. \u201cOpen to me.\u201d</p><p>Without hesitation, she did, plunging her tongue in his mouth again and clinging like he mattered, like she\u2019d starve without him.</p><p>The feeling was mutual. There\u2019d be time later to make her flee this mission and hate him for it.</p><p>Easing over Tara, their lips and breaths still entwined, he savored every touch. His palms caressed her nape, glided over the dainty slope of her collarbone, before his fingers splayed across the slight incline of her breast. Then he swept down, cupped the firm little mound. Her nipple burned his fingertips.</p><p>Damn, he wanted that against his tongue. Cherry mewled, shifting restlessly beneath him.</p><p>With a last deep kiss and a nibble at her sweet lips, he kissed his way down her feverish skin, lapping at the soft expanse of pale silk that he ached to explore for hours, days.</p><p>Her fingers wound their way into his hair, dragging him closer to that delectable pink nipple.</p><p>No way was he going to refuse her silent plea. Yes, he was supposed to be in command, and Logan knew this was reckless as hell. He\u2019d reassert himself, after another taste or two . . .</p><p>Cradling her breast in his hand, he plumped it up for his descending lips. He soaked the reddening bud in his mouth, dragging his tongue over the hard tip.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she panted. \u201cLogan, yes.\u201d</p><p>Hearing her moan his name, desire whipped through him, torquing the ache in his cock. She arched closer, like she\u2019d die if he released her now.</p><p>Sucking her breast deep into his mouth until his tongue flattened her nipple against the roof, he delved down her body with his hand, sliding between the sweet folds of her pussy.</p><p>Fuck, she was more than wet. Soaked. And so damn responsive. He prayed she wanted him at least a tenth as much as he was dying for her.</p><p>He plunged two fingers inside her, sinking in as far as he could. She jerked her hips up to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so wet, baby. You\u2019re making my mouth water. And you\u2019re tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while,\u201d she panted.</p><p>A while? Wasn\u2019t she engaged?</p><p>\u201cGet all wet for me, Cherry. That\u2019s it.\u201d He lifted his wet fingertips from her slick folds and brushed them over her nipple, then sucked it into his mouth, starved for her taste. Her sweetness hit his tongue, sending him spiraling further out of control.</p><p>God, he needed more of her. All of her. Endless days and nights beside her, inside her. If she were his, Logan would keep her constantly wet, aroused, just for the pleasure of satisfying her.</p><p>Need driving him, Logan settled his fingers over her clit, thrilled to feel the bud so hard and swollen. For him. He settled in to touch her, do whatever necessary, until she surrendered her will to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>DROWNING in sensation, tingles razing her, Tara could hardly breathe.</p><p>She tried to suck in a breath, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Dizziness swam through her head, along with his masculine scent, like spice and earth. Logan oozed testosterone, drugging her senses. High on him, she soared, breath sawing, blood churning, flesh on fire.</p><p>God, this needed to stop, and yet . . . his very touch made her feel not only powerfully female, but desired in a way she hadn\u2019t experienced since the last time he\u2019d held her.</p><p>As his fingers glided through her slick folds again, Tara held her breath, waiting. Euphoria and need balled between her thighs. When he brushed over her clit, she rushed closer to the edge.</p> <p>Normally, she was professional and able to hide her emotions. Logan completely stripped that from her. Why him? Why did he always get to her in a way no man ever had?</p><p>Too far gone to puzzle it out, she lifted to him. \u201cLogan, please.\u201d</p><p>He growled against her throbbing nipple. \u201cI\u2019m going to ramp you up without mercy, Cherry, then take you over the edge, again and again. When you\u2019re boneless and wrung out, I\u2019ll just keep petting this pussy with my fingers, my tongue, taking you up, up, up until you shatter. When you think you can\u2019t take it anymore, I\u2019ll fill you with every inch of my cock, until I\u2019m all you can see and feel. We\u2019ll take a hard, wild ride\u2014the first time.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled against the damp skin of her neck as if he could breathe her in, all the while rubbing her clit in slow, tender circles that only made her entire body clench with arousal. She flattened her feet on the bed, legs spread, and shifted, lifted, silently urging him on.</p><p>\u201cAfter that, I\u2019ll slide inside you again and pull every gasping, keening little breath out of you while this sweet cunt clamps down on me. Over and over. Even then, I won\u2019t stop.\u201d</p> <p>Every word made Tara gasp harder for her next breath. How badly she wanted to forget their painful past, her fianc\u00e9, the dangerous mission to come, and sink into the pleasure she knew Logan could deliver, this connection that she\u2019d only ever felt with him. Desire roared like a runaway train, making a blur of her resistance and good intentions. Being with him like this was wrong in so many ways, but it felt so damn right.</p><p>When Logan\u2019s mouth crashed over hers, he opened her wide for his kiss. He didn\u2019t just enter; he conquered and ravaged. He possessed.</p><p>Tara met him, hungry, greedy, opening herself deep to him, then demanding more. His clever fingers grazed her clit, toying, brushing, sensitizing. Arousal wound fist-tight in her belly.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good.\u201d He scraped the dark shadow of his whiskers covering his jaw over her sensitive nipple.</p><p>A million new tingles cascaded over her. She gasped his name, clutching him tighter, lost in the feel of him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re almost ready to come for me, Cherry. Wait for my command. I\u2019m going to make it the best you\u2019ve ever felt, baby.\u201d</p> <p>It would be. Oh God, she wanted it so bad. Every nerve in her body trembled in anticipation, quivered, as she held her breath, willing to give him anything\u2014everything\u2014if he\u2019d satisfy this ache.</p><p>But if she let him, how betrayed would Brad feel? How much more would Logan tighten his twelve-year grip on her body? How much more of her soul would he steal? Tara had teased Logan in high school that if someone gave him a yard, he\u2019d take the whole football field. Nothing had changed\u2014except that he\u2019d grown more ruthless.</p><p>After a mere hour in Logan\u2019s presence, she was too entangled. As much as her body wanted Logan, what she needed was a new trainer so she could keep her head on straight, tackle her first undercover mission, and save her friend.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she drew in a shaky breath, then uttered the one word she hoped she wouldn\u2019t regret. \u201cRomeo.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>LOGAN froze. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in Tara\u2019s body protested the loss of his touch. If she didn\u2019t get distance between them now, she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d find the strength to push him away again.</p><p>She glanced toward the two-way mirror from which Thorpe must be watching and shouted, \u201cRomeo!\u201d</p> <p>Logan\u2019s stricken face said that if she\u2019d pulled his heart from his chest with her bare hands, he couldn\u2019t have been more shocked. He jerked back, staggered to his feet.</p><p>An instant later, Thorpe barged in with a blanket and enveloped her in it protectively. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>Logan launched himself toward them. \u201cDon\u2019t take her! She\u2019s topping us both from the bottom, trying to force you to replace me.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe held up a hand to stop him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. You know how this works. You\u2019re done. I\u2019ll get Agent Jacobs someone else. Stay the fuck away from her.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s condo\u2014Thursday evening</p><p>Logan paced his living room two hours later, gripping the back of his neck in one hand. He jammed the phone to his ear with the other.</p><p>His older brother, Hunter, hadn\u2019t even greeted him before Logan started in. \u201cQuestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>Sighing in agitation, Logan paced across the floor again, from the St. Andrew\u2019s Cross against the wall, past the spanking bench, to the padded table in the corner. God damn it, Tara should be here, strapped down, taking him in every way he needed. That she needed. She was a fever, boiling him up from the inside, and he\u2019d be damned before he gave her up. No Dom was better equipped to train her for this mission\u2014for her life. No man could love her the way he did.</p><p>And after this afternoon, Logan had no doubt whatsoever that he still loved her every bit as much as he had at sixteen. Maybe more. She felt something for him, too. In order to exploit that, keep her safe and make her his, he had to overcome a few obstacles.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for the long explanation now, so I\u2019ll give you the CliffsNotes. I saw Tara today.\u201d Logan struggled to get his breathing back under control as memories bombarded him.</p><p>\u201cYou said her name. That\u2019s progress. Congratulations!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it. She wants nothing to do with me. For her, the past isn\u2019t dead and buried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way you broke up with her was ugly. You knew it was permanent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hated every fucking second that I hurt her. Because of me, she transferred to that prissy private girls\u2019 academy the very next day. I rarely saw her after that.\u201d Other than the Christmas he\u2019d gone to see her, and she\u2019d slammed the door in his face. \u201cBut I dealt because it kept her safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Mom\u2019s murder unsolved and the sick bastard having Tara on his radar, you didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand the killer\u2019s motives. Why come between me and Tara?\u201d Logan shook his head. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the issue right now. It\u2019s her safety. Since the case has never been solved, we have to assume Mom\u2019s killer is still on the loose. He hasn\u2019t threatened me since I broke up with Tara. It\u2019s been a dozen years. You think it\u2019s safe for me to pursue her now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne chance meeting, and you\u2019re ready to chase this girl again?\u201d</p><p>Since their breakup, Logan had hoped that Cherry was happy. She\u2019d gone to college, gotten a great job, and as much as it bugged the shit out of him, she\u2019d gotten engaged. As long as he\u2019d believed all was right for her, he\u2019d been able to cope with the gaping hole in his heart. After all, she wouldn\u2019t be able to handle his needs\u2014or so he\u2019d believed. When he\u2019d kissed her today, touched and restrained her, he\u2019d figured out real quick that Tara\u2019s nature ran sweetly submissive.</p><p>And the way she\u2019d responded to him . . . That kiss hadn\u2019t come from a woman happily in love with her fianc\u00e9, but a hungry female craving the satisfaction she needed and wasn\u2019t getting. Logan would move heaven and earth to give it to her.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Logan didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI want to make her mine. Forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. You never got over her. Maybe she\u2019s what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on a plan, but I can\u2019t execute it if I\u2019d be putting her in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Logan sighed. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m not doing a good job of thinking past my dick.\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s deep laugh resounded in his ear. \u201cIf you\u2019re ready to fuck her and end this crazy five year abstinence, I\u2019m definitely in favor.\u201d</p><p>He only said that because he could barely stand to leave the bed he shared with his wife.</p><p>\u201cBut what about Tara?\u201d Logan prodded. \u201cI won\u2019t put her in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a dozen years. I don\u2019t think you can answer that question without going for it and seeing what happens. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be one miserable bastard, always wondering \u2018what if.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Shit, Hunter was right. Agitation stabbed Logan. He didn\u2019t like unnecessary risk of any kind, but like his missions as a SEAL, he couldn\u2019t predict the exact outcome before putting forth the effort. Planning, keeping calm, paying attention to detail\u2014those things gave him an edge. When he did them right, he succeeded.</p><p>He paced back to the St. Andrew\u2019s Cross, imagining Tara there. She would look amazing, bound and bare, wet and begging for him.</p><p>That fantasy wasn\u2019t helping him think clearly.</p><p>He let out a pent-up breath. At sixteen, Logan hadn\u2019t had the first clue how to protect Tara. Today, he was an adult, a highly trained operator. He could\u2014and had\u2014killed enemy combatants in seconds with his bare hands. He\u2019d do anything to keep her from harm\u2019s way.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. If anyone threatens her, I\u2019ll tear out their motherfucking throat and spit in the empty hole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the Logan I know and love. I\u2019ll help you, by the way. Go after her.\u201d</p><p>Just one small problem . . . \u201cShe said her safe word. Thorpe won\u2019t let me near her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, this is good. She submitted? Willingly? Knowing you were topping her?\u201d</p><p>Logan wished Hunter wasn\u2019t enjoying the speculation quite so much. \u201cWe were getting there, but I lost my head. Came at her too hard and fast. I need to downshift and regroup before I approach her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019ll have to hurdle Thorpe. Once you do, then you absolutely have to tell Tara why you left her years ago, if you\u2019re going to earn her trust.\u201d</p><p>Again, Hunter was right, but even that wasn\u2019t simple. First, Logan could count on Thorpe to be a real hard-ass about enforcing the club\u2019s rules.</p><p>Even if Logan found a way around that, then came the hard part: explaining the reason for their painful breakup to Tara. He refused to do it at Dominion. No way was he sharing something so personal with Thorpe. Training? Fine. Actual feelings? No.</p><p>And Logan had no doubt that revealing the truth about their past to Tara was going to get sticky. She was no longer a pliant young girl who would listen to his explanation because he asked her to. She\u2019d definitely grown more spine. Now, he might be able to top her into giving him a blow job, but not forgiveness. As much as he\u2019d love the first, it was the latter he\u2019d do anything to have. If he pushed her, she might hate him more.</p><p>Logan grimaced. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about that. I doubt she cares now why I left her. Even if I could make her listen, would she believe me? If I hadn\u2019t been through it, a killer threatening her would sound far-fetched. Tara might want me, but she doesn\u2019t trust me for an instant. I\u2019m not sure how to work past that. Unlike you, I\u2019m not devious enough to marry a drunk girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it was Kata\u2019s idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t encourage that at all, huh?\u201d</p><p>Hunter laughed. \u201cMaybe a little, but it worked out. Speaking of which, my wife is on her way home, so if there\u2019s anything else, make it quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are you going to be waiting naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSick fuck. You\u2019ll scare the poor girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Kata is made of stern stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has to be if she\u2019s going to stay married to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d Hunter sighed. \u201cSeriously, I know you can\u2019t force it down her throat, but you\u2019ve got to find some way to tell Tara why you broke it off with her in high school.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. It would go over better once he\u2019d reconnected his bond with her, established some trust. Even then, would she believe him? Damn it. If he was in her shoes, he probably wouldn\u2019t. A mysterious stranger threatening a high school girl? It made way more sense that he\u2019d just wanted to screw other girls. But maybe if he could earn Tara\u2019s trust, he could find some way to make her believe him. Right now, she was too angry to hear any postmortem of their high school drama. And damn it, Logan wanted Tara to want to hear the truth.</p><p>\u201cWhen the time is right, I will,\u201d Logan murmured.</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He hung up and prowled into the bedroom, tossing his phone on the bed. He rifled through his paperwork. Dominion\u2019s rules would be among them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Forty-six minutes later Logan found exactly the loophole he needed. Tucking the papers in his back pocket, he sprinted out his door, locking it behind him. Rush hour traffic would be thick now, and he had to reach Dominion before Thorpe left for the day because he intended to fucking settle this now.</p><p>Club Dominion\u2014Thursday evening</p><p>In less than eight minutes, Logan climbed off his motorcycle in Dominion\u2019s parking lot and slammed through the front door, past Thorpe\u2019s usual bouncers and the crew setting up for the night. Axel was preparing for a demonstration with a single tail whip. Jason was checking the club\u2019s public playroom. Logan was supposed to be helping, but first, he and Thorpe were going to have it out.</p><p>Logan stalked down the hall, his boots striking the concrete floors, the pendant lights above providing one soft pool of light after another on the otherwise unrelenting gray. When he reached Thorpe\u2019s door, he entered without knocking.</p> <p>The club\u2019s owner looked up, then glared. \u201cWhatever you have to say, I don\u2019t want to hear it. Agent Jacobs warned me that she couldn\u2019t work with you. You got her naked and lost all control. There was no training happening there. I don\u2019t know what the fuck your problem is, but it\u2019s not mine or hers. Get out.\u201d</p><p>Logan slapped his copy of the club\u2019s rules on Thorpe\u2019s desk. \u201cRule twenty-one dot three dot five. I\u2019m invoking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrior claim?\u201d Thorpe wouldn\u2019t have been more surprised if he\u2019d said he was the freaking Easter Bunny. \u201cBecause you fucked this girl in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe slanted him a long, considering look. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t heard her say so during your session, I\u2019d think you were full of shit, given how many women you\u2019ve refused to share your sheets with.\u201d</p> <p>Logan forced down his impatience and leaned over the desk. \u201cIf you heard everything she said, then you heard that I have the ultimate prior claim: her virginity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d He braced his elbows on the desk. \u201cThis clause doesn\u2019t exist for you to protect your old stomping grounds. It\u2019s to keep two Doms from fighting over a sub. No one else is threatening violence, so . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. If anyone touches my Tara, I will bust them wide open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis territorial crap is unlike you.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe sent him a Dom-like stare and waited for him to break. Logan glared back.</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t met all the clause\u2019s stipulations,\u201d the club owner pointed out. \u201cPrior Claim can only be invoked if the Dom doing so intends to either collar or marry the sub in question.\u201d</p> <p>If he could earn her trust again and make her happier than Brad Thompson? And see her through this mission? She\u2019d given up a much desired orgasm when she said her safe word. There was a reason Tara had used such grit to maintain her self-control. Hell, Logan knew he hadn\u2019t. He doubted she\u2019d kept a clear head and manipulated the situation because she was afraid or wanted to quit the mission. She\u2019d never quit anything before. He knew Cherry. She was going to dig in and do the job no matter what he said. She\u2019d simply wanted to shed him as her trainer so she could continue on without him.</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou intend to tie yourself to Agent Jacobs permanently, even though she loathes you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t, and yes. I plan on making her mine in every way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually going to have sex with her yourself, and not send in Xander?\u201d</p><p>Logan smiled wide. \u201cIn every conceivable way. As soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe considered him for a very long moment. \u201cYou\u2019ve cited a viable club rule and you sound very serious. The clause gives you a week to win her without obstruction or interference. But the FBI is paying me to ensure their agent is trained. Your love life isn\u2019t important to them. Another woman\u2019s life hangs in the balance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve considered that. No Dom will be more invested in Tara than me. No one will have a greater stake in making sure she comes out of this mission alive. I understand that I only have a week. If I\u2019m forced to choose between winning her or preparing her for the mission . . . keeping her safe is my first priority.\u201d</p> <p>Thorpe kept staring. \u201cThe thought of putting the enforcement of her safe word entirely in your hands for the next seven days doesn\u2019t set well with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she knows saying it means she\u2019ll get her way, she\u2019ll be a broken record. I will take care of her, but it has to be on my terms or she\u2019ll never truly submit. You can\u2019t throw away your own rulebook for a paycheck. She\u2019s going into our world, or a twisted version of it anyway. She\u2019s going to have to conform to rules or everyone is going to see straight through her.\u201d</p><p>Logan stood firm and waited. Doms were sometimes victims of their own rules, like now. Tara couldn\u2019t learn\u2014or succeed\u2014if she didn\u2019t get a dose of true club life. Nor would Thorpe\u2019s selective enforcement of the rules be well received by other club members\u2014and he would know that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a shrewd son of a bitch.\u201d Thorpe rose, agitated. \u201cAll right. You have seven days, but I\u2019m not letting you off the leash entirely. If I think you\u2019ve crossed the line with Agent Jacobs, or that you\u2019re not adequately preparing her, I\u2019ll revoke both your claim and your membership. Of course, the same holds true if you fail to win her in a week. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>The bastard drove a hard bargain, but Logan smiled. \u201cPerfectly.\u201d</p><p>Club Dominion\u2014Friday morning</p><p>The following morning, Tara slammed into Logan\u2019s dungeon, fire charring her veins.</p><p>She\u2019d arrived expecting to train with another Dom, one she hadn\u2019t stupidly rubbed up against like a cat. But no. Thorpe had explained that she was completely in Logan\u2019s hands for the next week. She\u2019d have to look at the man and remember how utterly she\u2019d responded.</p><p>Worse, last night she and Brad had argued; he\u2019d seen the whisker burns on her chin, neck . . . and breasts. If he\u2019d known who\u2019d given them to her, he would have completely lost his mind, especially after he\u2019d asked her to drop the case, and she\u2019d refused.</p><p>Damn it, her life would be much easier if Logan would just get the hell out of it.</p><p>As Tara set her purse down and tugged at her black pencil skirt, she struggled to get control of her temper; anger wouldn\u2019t help her focus. But the sight of Logan, brow raised, like he knew she was pissed and didn\u2019t care, nearly derailed her good intentions. Not to mention the hungry blue stare that said he couldn\u2019t wait to unleash his raw sexuality on her again. Tara resented like hell that he got under her skin.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cYou\u2019re three minutes late. Strip and we\u2019ll get started.\u201d</p><p>As if nothing important had happened yesterday? Tara hadn\u2019t slept a wink, rehashing where she had gone wrong, unable to forget Logan\u2019s mouth and hands on her, making her feel alive again. Damn it, she had a job to perform, and he was doing his level best to screw that up.</p><p>She tugged the lapels of her suit jacket together. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve just talked to Thorpe. What kind of game are you playing?\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head. \u201cI\u2019m not. We\u2019ll talk, but now isn\u2019t the time, and here isn\u2019t the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince this is the only place I see you, I disagree. What happened yesterday\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the issue. The elephant in the room, our breakup in high school, is.\u201d</p><p>His words couldn\u2019t have shocked Tara more, especially when something somber and pensive crossed his face. Why would he want to discuss that?</p><p>\u201cI was a na\u00efve girl, and you were a hormonal teenage prick. After your mom\u2019s death, you were hurting and lashed out at me. End of story.\u201d</p><p>Logan shook his head. \u201cThere was far more involved. I\u2019d like to explain.\u201d</p><p>Was he out of his mind? Give a player like him more opportunities to spin his lies and woo her back into bed so he could hurt her again? \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He looked disappointed, but resigned. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a part of your training. This is personal between us. If you change your mind, ask me outside this place, when we don\u2019t have an audience. I genuinely believe it will change the way you feel.\u201d</p><p>Tara opened her mouth, then snapped it closed. That crushed, angry girl still inside of her wanted to hear his explanation, but only if it ended with some confession of Logan\u2019s undying love. She gave a cynical snort. Stupid. Far more likely that he\u2019d been confused and grieving, and received a great deal of comfort in Brittany Fuller\u2019s legendary blow jobs. Besides, what good would rehashing the past do? She needed to keep him at arm\u2019s length and focus on her job.</p><p>\u201cI doubt that, so I\u2019ll skip it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat offer is always on the table. But we\u2019ll get back to training for now. I gave you an order to strip. And while it wasn\u2019t first on my agenda, we can finish yesterday\u2019s punishment now. If you\u2019re disobedient, I\u2019ll add to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said my safe word. You should respect that, as should Thorpe. Why the hell is he violating his own club\u2019s rules by giving me back to you?\u201d</p><p>Logan stalked closer, and she didn\u2019t want to notice the way his black T-shirt hugged each rippling muscle of his torso or that his leather pants clung to every inch of his erection. Nothing to the imagination there. No denying, he looked good. Okay, great. Mouthwatering. But he was definitely up to no good.</p><p>\u201cThorpe and I had a . . . heart-to-heart yesterday. We understand each other, and for the next seven days, you are completely in my hands. End of story. Any questions, Cherry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your angle? Are you hoping to nail me so you can cut me cold and see if I bleed again. You get off on my humiliation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to hurt you. I didn\u2019t then, and I don\u2019t now. Besides, do you really think humiliating you crossed my mind yesterday when I had my tongue in your mouth and my fingers in your pussy?\u201d</p><p>Tara wanted to cringe\u2014but refused. \u201cThank God my taste in men has improved since I was sixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrad sold exam keys and crystal meth to anyone with cash back in high school, so I\u2019m gonna disagree.\u201d Logan smiled tightly. \u201cUnderstand that invoking the safe word only ends the current scene, it doesn\u2019t sever the contact between us. So you can stop me if you\u2019re very uncomfortable with whatever is happening. But screaming \u2018Romeo\u2019 won\u2019t make me disappear. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>That unless she wanted to let Darcy die and give up on following in her stepfather\u2019s footsteps to make him proud, she was stuck with Logan with virtually no recourse for a week? Fine, she\u2019d suck it up. She was the perfect bait and she wasn\u2019t going to let her colleagues down. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Besides, no way in hell would she let him get the best of her ever again.</p><p>\u201cYes, Logan,\u201d he corrected. \u201cI want to hear my name on your lips.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a long-suffering sigh. \u201cYes, Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat attitude is going to get your ass spanked a lot. I\u2019d think carefully, if I were you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not me, Logan.\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth. \u201cTrue, and we\u2019ll get back to your attitude. Right now, I\u2019d like to apologize for losing control of the situation yesterday and pushing you so hard and so quickly.\u201d</p><p>That set her back. Was he trying to get under her guard to seduce her again? Did that explain why he suddenly wanted to discuss their past? Logan looked sincere . . . but he\u2019d only apologized for pushing her, not for kissing her in the first place.</p><p>\u201cAssuming you actually mean that and given that we\u2019re going to be working together, I have a condition: Don\u2019t kiss me again. You\u2019re supposed to be mentally preparing me to submit for a mission, not seducing me.\u201d</p><p>A faint smile curled up the edges of his mouth, but he wasn\u2019t amused. \u201cMental preparation is at the top of my agenda, but that\u2019s going to involve touching you in about every way possible. You don\u2019t get to give me any parameters. So if you\u2019d like to stop arguing and get down to work so you can save Agent Miles, I suggest you strip.\u201d</p><p>God, she hated that command. It made her vulnerable to him, which was precisely why he was so fond of it. But it turned him on, too. She\u2019d use that to her advantage if he pressed her again.</p><p>\u201cIf I have to repeat the command again, it won\u2019t be pretty.\u201d Logan crossed his arms over his chest, waiting.</p><p>Tara tried not to grit her teeth. Once undercover, she might be given to a Dom who would insist on her nudity twenty-four/seven. She had to ditch her inhibitions and the discomfort of having her less-than-perfect body scrutinized. And she had to stop interacting with Logan on a personal level. He was her trainer. He wanted her naked. She needed to comply.</p><p>\u201cShould I fold my garments and lay them at your feet?\u201d Even saying the words burned through her anger and began a dangerous pulse of hunger in her belly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His blue eyes darkened. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, she stepped out of her clothes, one garment at a time, then neatly folded each into a little pile, which she set before him. Once done, she stood, waiting, cool air brushing over her nipples, making them tight. They throbbed. Logan sent her a hot stare that nearly made her toes curl.</p><p>Damn it, why did he still get to her? She had to overcome this arousal. Her body and feelings weren\u2019t important, just the mission.</p><p>Easy to think, but hard to remember when Logan stepped so close she felt heat pouring off his hard, substantial body. He lifted a finger to her, its tip settling between her breasts, and brushed a soft, tantalizing line directly down her abdomen slowly, pausing just above the mound of her sex. He waited there, unmoving. Incredibly, his light touch made her pussy clench with emptiness. Blood rushed between her thighs, moisture pooled, coating her folds, though he\u2019d barely touched her.</p> <p>Finally, his finger descended again. He smiled as it drifted through her damp red curls to nestle against her hard clit, which swelled under his touch.</p><p>His smile only widened. \u201cGood, Cherry. Today, we\u2019re going to start with a demonstration. It will provide you instruction, as well as help me understand how best to proceed. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He tugged her toward the door, and she pulled from his grasp. \u201cI can\u2019t go out there naked.\u201d</p><p>The second her words were out, Tara knew she\u2019d made a mistake.</p><p>\u201cYour nudity isn\u2019t your concern.\u201d Logan\u2019s face was a thunderclap of displeasure. \u201cWhile you train with me, you and your body belong to me. As always, you can say your safe word. In that case, we will discuss and resolve the issue, then resume training. Or you may quit the mission altogether, in which case I\u2019m sure that Thorpe and the FBI will happily sever all contact between us.\u201d</p> <p>His cold speech set her teeth on edge. She was a grown, capable woman. Putting herself in someone else\u2019s hands so utterly felt foreign. She worked every day in an environment where she was expected to suppress her own emotions and use her logic, so suddenly having to do the opposite wasn\u2019t easy. Training with Logan scared her to death. But if she was going to solve this case and possibly be a successful agent, she had to suck up her courage and swallow her pride.</p><p>\u201cUnderstood, Logan.\u201d</p><p>She expected amusement to flash across his features. Instead, searing desire glowed in his dark blue eyes, flushed the slashes of his cheekbones. A glance down told her that his erection still bulged in his leather pants.</p><p>Her breathing grew unstable when he turned her away, took her arm in one hand and slung the other low on her opposite hip, and led her out of the dungeon. A frightening sense of exposure washed over her as they walked down the hall. Though the club wasn\u2019t quite open for public play yet, Thorpe and some of the other resident Doms were already roaming. She\u2019d run into a few as she rushed to confront Logan. But then, she\u2019d been clothed. Now, he was parading her though the halls without a stitch, his touch all but branding her.</p><p>It terrified her, and yet . . . Tara felt Logan\u2019s desire spilling hotly in the air between them, along with his pride and pleasure that she overcame her own fears to follow his command. As much as she hated to admit it, it turned her on.</p><p>She turned to him with a puzzled glance over her shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <p>He glanced at her hot cheeks. \u201cYou want to know why you\u2019re responding to this. Because deep inside, you feel sensual in your own skin. And you know that you\u2019re pleasing your Dom by trusting me, which for a submissive, is a pleasure all its own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t give a god damn whether you\u2019re happy. You don\u2019t care whether I am.\u201d</p><p>Logan leveled her with a direct blue stare. \u201cYou\u2019re dead wrong. There are things you don\u2019t know, and I want to tell you . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready. Just know that your happiness matters more than anything. If you let me, I\u2019ll fulfill your fantasies. Your submission, if you truly give it, will allow me the privilege of doing so.\u201d</p><p>His words sent a fission of heat through her, which she ruthlessly pressed down. Focus on the academic. \u201cNone of this makes a damn bit of sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>As they rounded a corner, they came face-to-face with another Dom. She didn\u2019t know his name, but he had that sharp, shrewd way about him. He\u2019d be dangerous across a negotiating table. Under that pristine dress shirt and tailored slacks beat the heart of a predator. He and Logan had that in common.</p><p>\u201cJason,\u201d Logan greeted.</p><p>\u201cEdgington.\u201d His gray eyes flickered over to her.</p> <p>Tara squirmed as she felt the man\u2019s gaze touch her face, her breasts, the flat of her belly, then settle for a brief moment on the red curls guarding her sex. Tara crossed one leg in front of the other, settled her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cHands at your sides and feet apart,\u201d Logan demanded.</p><p>He wanted Jason to look at her? Knowing she had to get past this hurdle for her mission, Tara forced herself to comply. Logan rewarded her with a smile of approval that lit her up inside.</p><p>Damn it, why? Normally, she\u2019d be running for cover, refusing to let a stranger see her and wondering if he found her lacking. She\u2019d be fuming that Logan demanded she show herself. She damn sure wouldn\u2019t care what he thought of her behavior. But all of those mores and insecurities paled when she saw the flash of his smile. Why?</p><p>\u201cGet out of your head,\u201d Logan instructed. \u201cDon\u2019t look for logic. Just feel.\u201d</p><p>Right. Her discomfort wasn\u2019t the point. Learning to give herself over to the mission\u2014to him\u2014was.</p><p>Jason grinned, then glanced back at Logan. \u201cHow\u2019s your slave in training?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn need of a lot of instruction. I was actually coming to ask if you\u2019re seeing the policewoman today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreta should be here in ten minutes. It was the only time she had today, so I took an early lunch.\u201d He grinned. \u201cGotta love nooners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if we use your observation room? This sub needs to see what submission truly means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I think you\u2019ll find Greta has been both an apt and eager pupil.\u201d</p><p>Tara tried to leash her curiosity as they entered the observation room. The tiny space was dark, dominated by one huge window that overlooked an unfamiliar play room. A futon, the only thing in the room, stood in the shadowed corner, allowing occupants some comfort while they watched. It could also be pulled into a bed at a moment\u2019s notice.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about, Logan?\u201d</p><p>He shut the door behind them, enclosing them in the small space. The wall trapped her on one side, Logan on the other as he turned to her in the shadowed room. \u201cYou want to know why I allowed Jason to see you naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEncouraged it, even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about him, and normally, I wouldn\u2019t share you. But you\u2019re going to have to be comfortable with your own nudity on this mission, regardless of who\u2019s around. I\u2019ll be testing you until you overcome your discomfort. It\u2019s a telltale sign of an untrained sub.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s probably what had gotten Darcy made and abducted. Tara\u2019s past, both distant and recent, with Logan didn\u2019t matter. Training to succeed at this mission did.</p><p>\u201cWill you genuinely prepare me to go undercover? No mind games?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re prepared for any situation you encounter.\u201d He sent her a serious stare. \u201cBut mind games come with the territory. Domination and submission is one giant mind fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as I\u2019m prepared to hold my own, I can live with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good with firearms and hand-to-hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m sparring every night to keep myself sharp. That\u2019s one thing Robert is damn good at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYork is never going to be a convincing Dom.\u201d</p><p>Exactly as she\u2019d feared. \u201cMaybe Axel can keep working with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Logan underscored. \u201cAnd that\u2019s something I\u2019m going to talk to Thorpe about. Starting tomorrow, Axel and I will both be checking in with your boss, Bocelli, daily. If York can\u2019t pull this off, we\u2019re going to be brutally honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have Robert yanked off this case. It will take too long to bring someone else in. We\u2019ve already invested dozens of hours in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us worry about that. You have enough on your plate, learning to be a convincing sub in seven days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the next week, who is your Dom?\u201d Even in the dark, she discerned his raised brow, his more aggressive stance.</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d When he threw her a pointed glare, she sighed. \u201cLogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does any Dom desire above all else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObedience.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cTrust. With that, obedience naturally follows. And underneath all that tough-girl FBI training, that\u2019s who you are. I realize trust is going to be more difficult with our history, but I need you to understand that I would never do anything to put you in jeopardy. Ever. I\u2019d make myself bleed first.\u201d</p><p>Wow. The gravity of his emphatic tone confused Tara, like he had some hidden message beyond his actual words. She frowned. But she wasn\u2019t here to get personal with Logan, so she wasn\u2019t touching that statement with a ten-foot pole.</p><p>\u201cTell me about Agent Miles\u2019 disappearance,\u201d he said into her silence, switching topics.</p><p>It was a command\u2014one Tara found easy to comply with. \u201cDarcy was sent near Key West to attend a singles\u2019 weekend at a resort that caters to dominance and submission. That\u2019s where Darcy and two other women have gone missing. Darcy reported in during her first two days at the resort to say that she\u2019d attended lectures and demonstrations. They paired her up with a few Doms, but nothing out of the ordinary happened. Then she said she\u2019d been invited to a special demonstration by the resort\u2019s director, Lincoln Kantor. Three hours later, we received eight seconds of distress signal from her before the transmission ended abruptly. We haven\u2019t heard from her since. That was seven days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re against a ticking clock.\u201d</p><p>Tara nodded, worry twisting her stomach in knots. \u201cI know I\u2019m supposed to train with you for a week. I\u2019m not sure Darcy has that long.\u201d</p><p>Logan took her hand in his, lacing their fingers together. She found the gesture ridiculously comforting. \u201cBut I won\u2019t send you in unprepared. The FBI will only lose another agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>With a squeeze of her hand, he acknowledged her difficulty in dealing with this reality. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to save Darcy, we will. Let\u2019s focus on getting you ready.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and a few moments later, Jason and his policewoman entered the room. The instant the door shut, Jason\u2019s shoulders squared. He appeared bigger, adopted a mantle of authority.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word to the woman, just sent her an expectant stare. Immediately, she removed her uniform, one garment at a time, until she stood completely bare, the ends of her long, dark hair brushing her mid-back. Then she kneeled at his feet, knees spread, palms up, head down. Even from here, Tara felt her desperation to please.</p><p>Jason ruffled her hair. \u201cVery good, pet. Have you done as I asked during our last session?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>Greta didn\u2019t hesitate before she uncurled her legs from beneath her, rocked back on her ass, legs spread wide for Jason\u2019s view.</p><p>He dropped to one knee and his hand disappeared between her legs. \u201cVery nice. Shaved or waxed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaxed,\u201d she panted. \u201cBrazilian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I see you\u2019ve complied with regard to the anal plug. Is this the largest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master. I put it in this morning. It was challenging, but I\u2019m ready for you now.\u201d</p><p>In Greta\u2019s voice, Tara heard the need for Jason\u2019s acceptance and pleasure. Her own knowledge about the shadowy world of BDSM was almost exclusively academic and yet . . . Tara already understood exactly how the other woman felt. It struck a chord in her, all the times she\u2019d done her best to please Brad or another lover by cutting her hair a certain way or buying a sexy pair of shoes. Most of her efforts had gone unnoticed.</p><p>For a crazy moment, Tara wanted a man who would truly notice her, down to the last detail. A man like\u2014</p><p>She didn\u2019t dare finish that thought.</p><p>But memories filtered in as her gaze skittered Logan\u2019s way. In high school, he\u2019d usually noticed when she\u2019d even changed her sweater. The afternoon he\u2019d taken her innocence, he remarked on everything, all the way down to her birthmarks and the way she flushed before she came.</p><p>Jason smiled, stroking between her legs again. Greta\u2019s thigh blocked her view, but whatever was going on, the woman moaned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very proud of you, pet,\u201d Jason crooned. \u201cYou deserve a reward, which you\u2019ll get as soon as we deal with your punishment for Tuesday.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Despite being nearly flat on her back, Greta managed to cast her gaze down. She was the picture of contrition. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master. I won\u2019t fail you again. I was . . . apprehensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou uphold the law, and I would never want you to be arrested for public indecency. The exercise was intended to test your trust in me, and you failed. Did you think I would let you be reproached professionally?\u201d</p><p>Greta bit her plump lip. \u201cI didn\u2019t think. I panicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p> <p>The woman bowed her dark head. \u201cI wish to please you, Master. I\u2019ll take any punishment you see fit.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cFirst, I will give you another opportunity to do what you refused on Tuesday and please me. We are, even now, being watched. I won\u2019t say by whom or why. Stroke your clit.\u201d</p><p>She cast a quick glance toward the mirror. The stunning beauty\u2019s sultry eyes looked both wide and dilated. She was afraid . . . but aroused.</p><p>Jason snapped his fingers. \u201cThey are not your concern. I am.\u201d</p><p>With a shaky nod, Greta reclined on her elbows and drew her hand shyly between her spread legs.</p> <p>\u201cTurn your body to face the mirror,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Greta froze.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he pushing her when she\u2019s so obviously apprehensive?\u201d Tara whispered.</p><p>\u201cShe wants it, and Jason knows it. The sub is trying so hard to control the scene that she\u2019s not letting go and putting her well-being in his hands. Logically, she knows she has nothing to fear in this situation. Jason\u2019s job is to push her past her inhibitions until she\u2019s able to submit and experience her fantasy.\u201d</p><p>Tara understood, but she related to Greta\u2019s discomfort. The thought of masturbating in front of a lover and unknown witnesses made her squirm with both apprehension and a disturbing thread of arousal.</p><p>Finally, Greta gathered her courage and turned her body to face the window. Tara saw every goose bump on the woman\u2019s flesh, every jagged breath, the peaked nipples topping her plump breasts, the slick lips of her bare sex, along with the pink base of the plug tucked into her anus.</p> <p>Greta\u2019s hand slid between her legs. She closed her eyes and began to rub slow fingers over the little bundle of nerves.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted her to do this in public?\u201d Tara couldn\u2019t fathom that, but the idea of having that sort of faith in a partner made something inside her curl with unwanted warmth.</p><p>\u201cTuesday, after her shift ended, he met her at a park. It was dark and empty. He didn\u2019t tell her, but he\u2019d actually swept it and had a couple of buddies guarding the entrances. Jason has a real hard-on for outdoor sex, and Greta gets off on the thought that she might be watched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can see her uneasiness.\u201d Tara frowned. Every muscle in the woman\u2019s body tensed, shook.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s also flushed. She keeps spreading her legs wider. Her nipples are diamond hard.\u201d</p><p>Tara\u2019s gaze skated over the other woman. He was right. Now that she saw the sub\u2019s reactions through a Dom\u2019s eyes, she also noticed something else. \u201cShe\u2019s beginning to stroke herself faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Does she truly look uncomfortable? Perturbed? Inhibited?\u201d</p><p>After another glance, Tara had to shake her head. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s helping her bring out her true nature and fulfilling her fantasies. That\u2019s his role.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you do this?\u201d The question slipped out before she could stop it.</p><p>Logan turned her way, hesitated. \u201cThat\u2019s what every Dom aspires to. Some make it, some don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Tara was sure Logan was right . . . but he hadn\u2019t really answered her question.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Jason demanded of the woman.</p><p>Greta sobbed as she lifted her fingers to hover over her clit. Her back arched, teeth grinding together. She\u2019d been just on the verge. Tara\u2019s body clenched in empathy. Sitting next to Logan in this small, dark space made Tara fidget, hyperaware of the ache that started in the pit of her stomach and grew between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cSit still,\u201d Logan demanded, as if he knew exactly the uncomfortable desire brewing inside her.</p><p>\u201cStand,\u201d Jason demanded of Greta.</p><p>Slowly, the policewoman rose to her feet. She cast a pleading glance at her Dom. He looked unmoved as he sat on a plush ottoman squatting nearby.</p><p>He patted his thigh. \u201cOver my knees, pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster . . .\u201d Greta looked ready to cry.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been doing so well. Don\u2019t spoil it now.\u201d</p><p>Greta closed her eyes, her face tense as she searched for the courage to carry on. Finally, she draped herself over Jason\u2019s impeccable charcoal slacks. \u201cCount each spanking. No coming.\u201d</p><p>The Dom began peppering a stinging volley of slaps across the woman\u2019s pert ass. Greta counted each, becoming breathier with every number. Tara squirmed.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re wondering,\u201d Logan murmured, \u201cyou weren\u2019t aroused when I spanked you earlier because I meant to punish, not pleasure you. Next time I spank you, you\u2019ll feel the difference. And if all that fidgeting you can\u2019t seem to stop is any indication, you\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><p>If anyone had asked her ten minutes ago if she\u2019d be aroused by an erotic spanking, she would have laughed, but now Tara couldn\u2019t deny that she\u2019d become more than curious. There was a rhythm to their bodies, a push-pull, almost like a well-choreographed dance. As he struck, she gasped and counted breathlessly. Then he groaned. He rubbed his worshipping palm across her reddening cheeks, and she lifted her butt into his hand\u2014again and again.</p><p>Suddenly, Greta\u2019s body tightened. Jason lifted her until she straddled his thighs, then fused his mouth to hers. In seconds, he\u2019d shoved his pants down and rolled a condom on.</p><p>Grabbing her hips, Jason bared his teeth. \u201cTake me inside you.\u201d</p><p>With a cry of relief, she impaled herself on his thick cock, shoving it deep in her sex in one brutal thrust.</p><p>Jason tossed his head back with a groan. On the next down stroke, he swept his thumb over her clit. \u201cCome, Greta.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to ask her twice. Her lithe body tensed up, fingers digging into his shoulders as she met his gaze with a helplessly erotic stare, then closed her eyes in pleasure, releasing everything to him.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Jason to fuck her through the first orgasm, then a second. When Greta ramped up for her third, her face rosy, her breath stuttering, the Dom finally let go, one hand splayed behind her back, the other tangled in her hair. Not a bit of air passed between them as he kissed her all through their shuddering joint climax.</p><p>Tara let out the breath she didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d been holding. Her entire body shook, pulsed. Desire pooled in her pussy. Jason and Greta had been visually arousing . . . but far more. Deeper. He\u2019d given; she\u2019d taken\u2014and given everything back in return. The act looked like one of such togetherness. That sort of connection of bodies, of minds and souls, that made poets and songwriters dash madly for their pens. Tara had never seen or felt anything like it.</p><p>And, in that moment, she wanted it\u2014desperately.</p><p>She risked a glance at Logan. He met her stare with silent confidence that said, yes, I can give you that.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand now?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t find the words to tell him how deeply she was moved and how completely she understood. \u201cYes, Logan.\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>LOGAN\u2019S heart beat faster and more forcefully than a sledgehammer. He tried not to crush Tara\u2019s hand in his as he forced down his impatience. No matter how badly he itched to touch her, get inside her and stay, he had to focus first on teaching her.</p><p>At the door to his dungeon, he pushed it open, let her walk through. Her clothes still lay on the floor, her engagement ring peeking out from her skirt pocket, winking in the light from overhead. With his blood already pumping, knowing that she still planned to tie herself to Brad Thompson made him damn near violent.</p><p>Calm. Breathe. Focus. He had to be smart, pay attention to detail. The reality was, right now, Cherry was flushed, aroused. She\u2019d seen the power exchange and found beauty in it. She wanted it for herself. She needed it for her mission. Their biggest impediment now was his own impatience . . . and her unwillingness to hear his reason for their breakup. But that was another issue for another time. Now, he\u2019d begin to bind her to him sexually, as a way to reach her emotions, because he wasn\u2019t going to make Hunter\u2019s mistake and try to force them. Logan had seven days; no need for panic. He had to believe that her heart would be roused before their time ran out.</p><p>\u201cKneel,\u201d he ordered softly. \u201cGet into position.\u201d</p><p>Without hesitation, she slid to her knees and parted them, then met his gaze. Her nipples stood up, begged for his mouth. Her pussy had swollen to a deep, rosy red.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he praised. \u201cTell me what equipment Axel walked you through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, what did he use on me? He didn\u2019t actually do anything to me, Logan.\u201d</p><p>Hearing his name slide off her tongue with that reverent tone any other sub would use to say \u201cMaster,\u201d revved him up. He\u2019d been hard nearly every moment he\u2019d been with Tara, but when she said his name like that . . . Damn, he had to keep his head in the game.</p><p>\u201cOn your feet. Over to the St. Andrew\u2019s Cross.\u201d</p><p>Tara stood and stared at the giant wooden X, stained a rich walnut, padded manacles affixed at top and bottom. With a hesitant gait, she made her way across the floor.</p><p>Logan stopped her by taking her hips and pulling her back against his chest. The vanilla-fruity sweet scent of her skin grabbed him by the balls. \u201cWhat are you afraid of, Cherry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing helpless.\u201d Even her voice quivered.</p><p>\u201cYou will be. Trust me with your safety and training,\u201d he murmured in her ear. \u201cWill I let anything bad happen to you?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cDefine bad.\u201d</p><p>He repressed a smile. Tara had always looked at every angle. \u201cWill I make you bleed?\u201d</p><p>\u201c No.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t hesitated with that answer, which filled Logan with relief and pride. She was scared, but her logic was shining through. \u201cWill I mark your skin in any permanent way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I give you more pain than you can bear?\u201d</p><p>A small pause. \u201cNo. But what will you make me feel?\u201d</p><p>She looked over her shoulder and met his gaze. Since they\u2019d begun working together, Tara had been desperately trying to hide her apprehension and desire, but in that moment, she dropped her mask. Her face glowed with arousal\u2014and tightened with worry. Both were so honest that triumph rushed through him. Some small part of her was beginning to trust him with her feelings.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll feel whatever needed so that you\u2019re willingly in my control. While our interaction may be different than Jason and Greta\u2019s, I will do whatever necessary to make you give yourself over to me. Step up, Cherry.\u201d He waved her against the cross. \u201cNormally, I\u2019d have you face away from me, but I want to see your every reaction. Back against the cross.\u201d</p><p>She smoothed out a shuddering breath, then turned, easing against the smooth, dark wood. Every muscle in her soft body went tight. Under that pretty, pale skin, Logan was sure she fought the urge to fidget and shiver. That instinct would serve her well.</p><p>\u201cPlace yourself in the manacles and lock them.\u201d</p><p>Her brown eyes flew up to him with a startled glance. Wisely, she held her tongue. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, she secured her left ankle, then her right. The second she straightened up and glanced at the wrist shackles, Logan knew she was questioning her own wisdom.</p><p>He gave her a moment to work it out in her head. As their training went on, her response times would have to become instant and fluid. Behaving like an untrained sub would only make her stand out. Like a soldier unable to complete an evolution of any special forces training, negative attention wasn\u2019t the kind anyone sought.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your hesitation, Cherry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been restrained.\u201d</p><p>That fact thrilled Logan. He\u2019d be the first\u2014and last\u2014man to show her the true joy of the power exchange she secretly ached for. She might experience a dark version of it during her mission, but she\u2019d only truly submit to him.</p><p>He lowered his voice, peppering it with disapproval. \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this. I won\u2019t hurt you. What is the real issue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a logical fear to put yourself at someone else\u2019s mercy.\u201d</p><p>Especially someone who has hurt you. Tara didn\u2019t say it, but Logan heard the subtext.</p><p>\u201cIt is, but I\u2019ll reward your trust. And you\u2019ll be one step closer to saving Agent Miles.\u201d</p><p>With that, she nodded, then drew in a bracing breath as she stretched one hand up to a manacle and closed it with other. Then she looked to him for approval, and that expression, her need to please, went straight to his cock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He drew off his T-shirt, gratified as her eyes widened, then he stepped close, lifting her chin with his finger. \u201cVery good, Cherry. You\u2019re being very brave.\u201d</p><p>Then he laid his lips over hers, a small, reassuring peck. Her breath caught. It was almost indiscernible\u2014but he felt it, felt her begin to give herself over. His chest tightening, Logan took her free hand, leaned in, and slowly pressed it to his torso. She took over, moving across his skin. God, those soft little fingers were like brands sizzling across his abdomen, brushing over his nipple. Her delicate palm settling over his heartbeat all but seared him.</p><p>With every moment that passed between them, Logan was more certain that he\u2019d made the right decision to risk everything to win Cherry back. Smiling, he lifted her hand to his mouth, pressed a kiss to her palm, then eased it into the last manacle.</p><p>As it snapped shut, the little red light in the corner flashed, indicating that someone had tripped the motion detector in his observation room. Someone had entered without his knowledge or permission. It wasn\u2019t Thorpe; he\u2019d scheduled a tour of the facility to a new member. Had he sent someone to watch in his stead? Possibly, but Jason had to get back to work. Xander rarely showed up before noon. Most of the other Doms weren\u2019t here, and Thorpe would never allow any of the casual club members this deep into the club. He didn\u2019t think Axel would waste his needed time with Agent York to watch Tara\u2019s progress. So who the hell was spying on them?</p> <p>\u201cWait here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCherry,\u201d he cut her off. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll be back. Nothing will happen to you. I\u2019m watching from the next room.\u201d</p><p>It pained Logan to leave her naked and hanging on the cross, looking so beautiful and uncertain that she hurt his eyes. But whoever observed them without obtaining permission was breaching protocol. And it pissed Logan off.</p><p>He shoved out of the dungeon, stalked a few steps to the observation room, and pushed the door open, ready to see just about anyone\u2014except Tara\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Brad Thompson.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d Logan demanded.</p><p>Brad stood under the harsh glare of the industrial light with his face red and his fists clenched. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here, Edgington? I pounded on that damn door, and you ignored me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s soundproof for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou underhanded bastard. I don\u2019t know how you talked Tara into participating in this degrading tie-\u2019em-up crap with you, of all people, but I demand that you to unchain her and return her clothes now.\u201d The man looked him up and down with disdain. \u201cMy God, what kind of animal are you?\u201d</p><p>The kind of animal who made Cherry flushed and wet. The kind who looked forward to getting her off until she screamed her throat raw. But Logan didn\u2019t mention that.</p><p>Instead, he crossed his arms over his chest and looked at Brad like he was an insect. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTara is not your damn toy anymore. She\u2019s my fianc\u00e9e, and I won\u2019t let you hurt her. Let her go this second.\u201d</p><p>Like hell. \u201cHow did you get down to the dungeon level? This area is security restricted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlashing the credentials of an Assistant District Attorney at stupid receptionists usually works. She nearly fell all over herself to help me find you down in this labyrinth.\u201d</p><p>Misty, or Sweet Pea, as everyone called her, was an efficient receptionist and a sweet little sub, but skittish around anyone with a badge. She\u2019d nearly fainted when meeting York.</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck out before I call security.\u201d Logan turned his back to leave.</p><p>Thompson grabbed his shoulder and spun him around, throwing a left hook. Logan had known it was coming from the way the man\u2019s body tensed. He ducked, then recovered, shoving his right fist into Brad\u2019s stomach. Thompson grunted and turned an even darker shade of red.</p><p>\u201cListen up, because I\u2019ll only say this once. On a professional level, stalking your fianc\u00e9e while she\u2019s working won\u2019t go over well with her superiors or help her learn the skills necessary to survive her mission.\u201d</p><p>Brad jerked away. \u201cI saw your whisker burn on her body last night. You\u2019re not teaching her a damn thing, just setting her up to hurt her again.\u201d</p> <p>Logan shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. And on a personal level, do you think spying on Tara is going to win you any brownie points?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care about her well-being. It\u2019s my responsibility to keep her safe.\u201d Brad glared.</p><p>\u201cWhile we\u2019re working, she\u2019s my responsibility. I\u2019ll take excellent care of her\u2014always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that some kind of innuendo? A veiled threat that you\u2019re going to try to seduce her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo innuendo at all. I\u2019ll lay it flat out for you right now.\u201d Logan got in Brad\u2019s face. \u201cTara is made for what I can give her, and whatever vanilla sex you\u2019re having with her isn\u2019t getting the job done. Her heart was mine first. If she wants me, I won\u2019t rest until it\u2019s mine again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTara will be my wife, the mother of my children. You\u2019re not getting in my way.\u201d</p><p>Thompson swung at him again, and Logan plowed his fist into the man\u2019s jaw. Brad staggered back, nearly tripping over some folding chairs. Logan helped out by backing him into the concrete wall, then shoving a forearm to his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you duped her into marrying you, but I know the kind of scab you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a real gentleman, chaining women up,\u201d he croaked. \u201cDo you honestly think she\u2019ll fall for that?\u201d With narrowed eyes and ruthless pleasure, Thompson smiled. \u201cBut go ahead and hit me some more. She\u2019ll hate you even more, not that it matters. Regardless of what you do, she\u2019ll never love you again.\u201d</p><p>That possibility worried Logan. He could train her to be submissive. She had both the urge and the aptitude. He could even make her want him; already she responded. But was it possible to make her fall for him again in a week? Logan was tempted to blurt the truth about their breakup to Cherry, whether or not she wanted to hear it. But he\u2019d taken so many other choices from her when pressing Thorpe to honor his prior claim. Trying to wrestle absolution from her was counterproductive. He had to tamp down his impatience and let things play out.</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck out and don\u2019t ever darken my dungeon door again.\u201d</p><p>Logan slammed his way out of the observation room. In the hallway, he let out a calming breath, rolled his shoulders to clear the tension. It wasn\u2019t working. Motherfucker. He\u2019d always hated Brad Thompson in high school, the slimy, two-faced bastard.</p><p>But now he had to focus on Cherry.</p><p>Letting himself in his dungeon, Logan locked the door behind him once more. If Thompson was smart he\u2019d leave. And yeah, he could call security and have the asshole tossed out. But Logan was betting that Tara\u2019s fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t smart. He\u2019d stay and watch out of some misguided sense of duty. Or maybe because he wasn\u2019t as sure of Tara\u2019s love as he pretended. Logan didn\u2019t really give a shit. But if Thompson was fool enough to hang around . . . well, Logan would be happy to put on a show and do whatever necessary to prove that he pleased Tara sexually in a way Brad couldn\u2019t because her feelings for him lingered. It ought to be a big wake-up call for the ass wipe.</p><p>Logan sighed. Tara\u2019s reaction worried him. Guilt niggled. In the short term, she\u2019d be pissed. But he wouldn\u2019t do this if he didn\u2019t genuinely believe that they belonged together.</p><p>Pushing his concerns aside, he approached Cherry, sweeping her hair away from her face with a soft palm. \u201cYou okay, baby?\u201d</p><p>A shiver ran through her. \u201cA little cold.\u201d</p><p>And a little scared. Not that she\u2019d say it. Tara was stubborn, but he admired her moxie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I had to deal with someone unpleasant. You have my undivided attention now. I\u2019ll make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get to work.\u201d She sent him a brave smile.</p><p>Logan slanted her a grin. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to not make it too tedious.\u201d</p><p>Her expression turned wary, and she opened her mouth. Before she could say a word, he laid a finger over his lips and shook his head. \u201cWho are you going to obey?\u201d</p><p>Tara licked her lips, her eyes dilating a bit. \u201cYou, Logan.\u201d</p><p>Hearing those words made not just his cock jerk, but his heart sing. \u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>He pressed kisses across the soft slope of her shoulder, up her neck, then whispered for her ears alone, \u201cYou look beautiful restrained for me.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cAt least you can\u2019t see my ass.\u201d</p><p>Normally, he\u2019d discipline her for thinking anything negative about her body. In fact, he should already be disciplining her for yesterday\u2019s offenses. But after seeing Jason and Greta, she now knew the beauty of this kind of relationship. Before giving her more of the unpleasant so that she could cope with this mission, he wanted to give her a bit more of the wonderful\u2014for them. And if that pissed their peeping Thompson off, so much the better.</p><p>\u201cI already have, and I love it. Hmm . . .\u201d He nipped on her earlobe. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to fondle and kiss it.\u201d And fuck it.</p><p>\u201cLogan . . .\u201d she warned. \u201cThis is business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd pleasure.\u201d He cradled her face in his hands and compelled her wary stare up to him. \u201cBreathe with me.\u201d</p><p>Tara did. As he inhaled, she did the same. Ditto with the exhalations. Soon they were in sync, but he didn\u2019t look away. Her gaze clung to him, fell down into him, and Logan edged closer. Their toes touched. Her icy feet sent a shiver through him.</p><p>\u201cYou said you were cold, not frozen. Why didn\u2019t you tell me you were uncomfortable?\u201d he demanded, kneeling to envelop her cold feet in his hot grip.</p><p>Relief relaxed her face, and she moaned. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would matter to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour discomfort always matters. Some pain is intentional and is meant to arouse you physically and emotionally. Neglect never falls in that category.\u201d</p><p>Logan crossed the room and rummaged through the little closet. He found a clean pair of his tube socks, left over from his stop here last winter. He unfolded them, approached Tara, then slipped one on each foot, bunching them under the restraints. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t relent until he\u2019d taken care of her. Granted, giving her socks was a small gesture, one not likely to win her heart. But her expression softened.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Logan.\u201d</p><p>Every word was breathy. His touch and simple care were getting to her, it seemed. Deep down, was she looking for signs that she mattered to him?</p><p>The thought made him smile. If she wanted some measure of his caring, he\u2019d be more than happy to give her all she could handle.</p><p>TARA looked at Logan. Uh-oh, there was a dangerous gleam in his eye, the one that said he was up to something.</p><p>\u201cNo more cold feet. Now we can get back to work,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have cold feet at all?\u201d</p><p>Did he mean physically or metaphorically? If the latter, oh hell yeah, her feet were freezing. But no way was she going to show her weakness or give up on this mission. No way was she going to give up on experiencing the sort of power exchange Jason and Greta shared. She needed it for herself, just once.</p><p>\u201cBring it.\u201d</p><p>The second she issued the challenge, Tara knew it was the wrong thing to say. If she\u2019d simply agreed with him and used that deferential tone when speaking his name . . . he liked that. It soothed him. When she tossed out something like this? She was just asking for the beast.</p><p>His hands caressed their way up her calves, behind her sensitive knees, inching up her thighs until he gripped her hips, his fingers sinking into her ass. He looked straight forward\u2014right at her pussy. He licked his lips, staring like he couldn\u2019t wait to devour her. Her heart started tripping over itself, beating triple time. In this position, she was desperately aware that her legs were spread, her body bare. She could do nothing to stop him.</p><p>Her entire body jolted with the thought of his mouth on her most secret flesh again.</p><p>\u201cWait, Log\u2014Oh my God.\u201d She swallowed as his tongue pressed torturously slow over her clit, the tip toying with the protective hood. Then he slipped two fingers inside her, lazily fondling her slick walls. She struggled for her next breath.</p><p>No man made her feel like Logan. Through college and her midtwenties, she\u2019d taken a few guys for a \u201ctest drive.\u201d Some had performed better than others. A few had even made her motor rev a little. But no one had given her the same high-octane thrill as Logan. He was the Ferrari of lovers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wet, Cherry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just put your saliva on me.\u201d She dished out the excuse with a voice that trembled more than she liked.</p><p>Logan raised a brow in displeasure. \u201cWere you wet before?\u201d</p><p>He knew the answer, but was making her say it. Damn him. Why? To professionally push her past her comfort level? Or to personally bring about her submission? Could she ever experience the kind of connection she\u2019d witnessed today if she wasn\u2019t honest? No. The woman had faced her desire for Jason\u2019s demands head-on, determined to please him and find the pleasure she fantasized about. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, Logan.\u201d She closed her eyes. \u201cI was wet before you touched me with your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes. Always look at me.\u201d</p><p>She did, her lashes fluttering wide until she had nowhere to look but his intent blue stare.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He breathed against her mound, and every nerve below her waist tensed, pooled hot with need. \u201cYour kiss yesterday told me how hungry you are for satisfaction. I know you want it even now. Will you be brave enough to accept it?\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. He\u2019d read her like an open book. Tara drew in a deep breath. She had to do this. For Darcy and her own success as a field agent, she\u2019d need to be able to perform any act asked of her. For herself, she needed to see if this time with Logan would patch up the empty, gaping hole of unfulfilled desire inside her.</p><p>\u201cYes, Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate for an instant before settling his mouth over her pussy again and swiping his tongue underneath her clit, then over it, laving the little bud with almost more friction than she could take. But somehow, he knew exactly how far he could push her before the pleasure became too much. Logan backed away, blowing cool air over her slick, overheated folds, and rubbed his thumb over the needy bundle of nerves. Her entire body jerked and heat brewed between her trembling legs.</p><p>\u201cHmm, Cherry. You\u2019re as sweet as I remember.\u201d He brushed his tongue over her birthmark, the one inside her thigh that he\u2019d been seemingly fascinated with at sixteen. \u201cI\u2019d love to spend a day with my mouth on your pussy, lapping at you while you shiver and swell. And give me all that sweet cream. I want you to come. I want to stay at you until you shake and cry and beg, not sure if you want me to stop or taste that pretty cunt all over again.\u201d</p><p>A big boom of desire dropped right between her legs, adding to the already torturous ache. How did he do that to her, so quickly and easily? Mere seconds, and she was panting. Arousal overtook her senses. No way she could pretend that she didn\u2019t want every tingling bit of sin his deep voice promised.</p><p>\u201cLogan . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, baby.\u201d</p><p>Not a moment passed before he pried her open with his thumbs and stroked his tongue all the way from her seeping hole up, up, over the hard knot of her clit. Dizziness swept over Tara in waves, euphoric, surreal. God, at sixteen, he\u2019d made her feel so good. Given her first orgasm ever with that patient, talented tongue. Then, it had taken time, and his endless little licks had built, finally escalating into something spectacular.</p><p>This orgasm was going to burst over her in a flash like a fireball of sensation. It would make every self-induced climax for the last dozen years feel like a lame joke. She clenched her fists. Climbing desire tightened her body until every muscle clenched. As wrong as Logan was for her, she needed this orgasm, and only he seemed able to give it to her.</p><p>Instead of pushing her over the edge, Logan sat back on his heels and looked up expectantly. What did he want from her? Tara clenched her fists above the unyielding manacles, dying a small death inside as she panted and writhed. \u201cLogan . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you need it.\u201d</p><p>Below the ridge of his dark brow, he stared at her with eyes like blue fire. His nostrils flared. His taut mouth twitched, as if lifting into a snarl, before he forced it back in line.</p><p>That expression said that he wanted her\u2014badly. Worse, he looked willing to do anything to make her want him that badly in return.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t have to try at all.</p><p>Tara\u2019s shaky breath couldn\u2019t quite fill her lungs. He was breaking her down, and somehow, being on this cross, at his mercy, stripped her bravado and revealed the woman beneath. Even if her mind shied away, her body craved it. Worse, no matter how badly he\u2019d burned her before, some part of her trusted his strength, his tenacity, that searing desire all over his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I need it,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>From her knee, he smoothed his hand upward. Tara couldn\u2019t take her eyes off the contrast of those strong, dark fingers against the pale flesh of her thigh. Her breathing hitched as his touch inched closer and closer to the burning ache in her pussy.</p><p>He planted a soft kiss on her hip and teasing her clit with his thumb again. \u201cThank you for your honesty. Your body is so sweetly ripe. Flushed, wet, trembling. I can barely wait to get my mouth on you again.\u201d</p> <p>Tara cried out at his words. She couldn\u2019t move much, but wriggled her hips, urging her pussy closer to his waiting lips just a few inches away.</p><p>Logan inched back, then lifted his thumb off her aching clit.</p><p>\u201cPlease . . .\u201d She was begging and she knew it. He knew it. Yet she\u2019d never needed pleasure this desperately. Her body felt as if she\u2019d been waiting for twelve cold years for him.</p><p>Slowly, he swiped his thumb, all but dripping with her cream, over his tongue. Then he closed his lips around the digit and sucked with closed eyes and a moan. \u201cFuck, yeah.\u201d</p><p>The ecstasy prowling across his face aroused her even more.</p><p>Before she could take a breath, that thumb was back on her exposed, engorged nubbin, rubbing in slow circles. \u201cYou really need it, Cherry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she gasped, willing to say anything. She\u2019d worry about repairing the damage to her pride and her engagement later.</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do is say that you need me to give it to you.\u201d</p><p>Shock ricocheted through her. It was true, but admitting that to him gave him so much power over her. \u201cI already said that I need to come.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s only half of the admission. Give me the rest.\u201d</p><p>Logan was going to make her surrender both body and mind\u2014to him. She wanted to despise him for it, but she needed him too damn badly. His Cheshire cat smile said that he knew it.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2014I need you to give it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good enough. Be specific. Address me properly.\u201d</p><p>Having him this near was an aphrodisiac, not to mention the hypnotic rhythm of his thumb over her responsive flesh. With every pass, every bit of friction he bestowed on the little bud, it swelled more, poked out from its hood, exposing the delicate, sensitive organ beneath. Tara gasped as he unraveled her. She ached to reach out and touch him. Since she couldn\u2019t, she dug her nails into her palms. Her thighs clenched.</p><p>He started to back away again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d she protested. \u201cI need to come. I need you to make me come, Logan. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still owe me another thirteen spankings on that pretty bare ass for yesterday\u2019s transgressions, but for your sweet request just now, I\u2019ll grant your wish\u2014with one condition: No holding back your screams.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a feverish nod, willing to say or do almost anything for Logan.</p><p>If she wanted to know if he could ease the constant ache of her body, then she had to be woman enough to accept everything he gave her. Overcoming her apprehension and learning to give over control would be imperative to succeed on this the case, too.</p><p>His blue eyes darkened to something like midnight. Then he smiled\u2014and leaned in.</p><p>The moment his mouth opened over her pussy and his tongue slid through her juices, her breath caught. God, it was like he hadn\u2019t paused at all. Her desire was still pooled right on the edge, just waiting for that last shove over.</p><p>Logan moaned, and the vibrations made her clit tighten, tremble. If she\u2019d had her hands free, Tara would have loved to plunge her fingers into that short hair and push his face deeper into her. But as he nibbled gently, then sucked her clit into his mouth, she moaned in return. Somehow, being manacled so that she couldn\u2019t direct what Logan did was the most freeing thing of all. She had no responsibility. And she had no choice but to stay and take the pleasure he gave her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sweet, Cherry,\u201d he whispered against her pussy, then shoved his fingers into the hot well of her sex.</p><p>It took him less than two seconds to find a spot that made her gasp with a sharp pleasure, so unlike anything she\u2019d ever felt before.</p><p>\u201cY-Yes,\u201d Tara sputtered. \u201cOh my God . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever had your G-spot stimulated?\u201d</p><p>Never. \u201cNot like that,\u201d she hedged.</p><p>\u201cHmm. I love being your first at so many things.\u201d</p><p>Before she could process his words, he brushed his fingertips over that nerve-laden spot again and circled his tongue over her clit. Friction sparked fire all through her body.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ready now. Come for me, Cherry.\u201d</p><p>With those magic words, Tara came apart in an instant, every nerve in her body escalating to a shattering crescendo unlike anything she\u2019d ever felt. As promised, she screamed. And screamed. He didn\u2019t relent until he\u2019d wrung every spasm, shiver, and moan out of her.</p><p>The violent sensations raged through her body in a seemingly endless blast until the tension finally left her. As she sagged against the manacles, anger seeped out. Bravado buckled under the strain. He\u2019d stripped away her ability to put on a front, leaving behind a terrible sense of naked vulnerability.</p><p>Logan pulled away from her pussy, licking his lips. He placed a reverent kiss on her lower abdomen, still twitching with aftershocks. With soft fingers, he petted her mound, kissing his way up her body. \u201cGorgeous. You did well, Cherry.\u201d</p><p>When he stood, she didn\u2019t know where to look. The floor? The bed across the room? Not at him. She feared begging for more. So she closed her eyes, but a terrible sense of exposure hit her. Tears leaked out. Her chest bucked with a sob. God, the release he\u2019d given her had scrubbed her psyche cleaner than steel wool. She felt new and raw.</p><p>Tara sucked in a ragged breath, tried to bottle up her haywire emotions.</p><p>Logan wasn\u2019t having any of that. Quickly, he released her manacles. Her rubbery legs wouldn\u2019t support her weight, and she crashed into his arms. He caught her and carried her to the bed. Once he laid them down, he rolled to his back, draping her on top, soothing her with his body and a rhythmic caress up and down her spine.</p><p>\u201cLet it out,\u201d he encouraged.</p><p>She shook her head with a sniff, trying again to hold in all the emotions. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I need to stop. This isn\u2019t professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s necessary.\u201d He cupped her face in the steely heat of his hands. \u201cDoms will expect an honest response. Don\u2019t lie and don\u2019t front\u2014or there will be punishment. Whatever you need to feel, feel it.\u201d</p><p>His gentle voice encouraged, but Tara still wanted to crawl into a hole. She had to stop bawling and clinging to him. Instead, she buried her face in Logan\u2019s neck and availed herself of the earthy musk and leather scents. She cuddled closer. How could he comfort her when he was the source of her distress?</p><p>\u201cB-But I\u2019m a damn FBI agent. I need t-to act like one.\u201d</p><p>Quite simply, Logan brought out every emotion in her. She was usually good at keeping all that in; she had to be. But with him, she couldn\u2019t seem to turn it off.</p><p>Logan wiped her fresh tears away with the pad of his thumb. \u201cYou have. This is part of training. You\u2019re learning to give into your submissive nature. That\u2019s what this mission requires.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps, but she hadn\u2019t been thinking about her mission with Logan\u2019s mouth on her pussy. She\u2019d been focused on pleasure, on her need for more. That reality filled her with shame.</p><p>\u201cThis feels so personal.\u201d She scrambled off of his body to sit beside him, curling her knees into her chest.</p><p>\u201cYou feel off balance, and you\u2019re not used to that.\u201d He tucked a strand of fiery hair behind her ear. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. Since you\u2019re independent, you\u2019re going to feel that way in a D/s relationship until you learn to flow with it and trust me. I\u2019ll help you through it. Lie back.\u201d With a gentle, but insistent hand, he pushed her to her back. \u201cRight now, just breathe with me. In . . .\u201d</p><p>He demonstrated, lying beside her, inhaling through his nose until his chest rose. Tara followed suit.</p><p>\u201cNow let it out.\u201d Logan exhaled until the air was gone, his shoulders slightly slumped.</p><p>Again, she did the same. Amazingly, her tears began to dry up. A sense of calm settled over her. It wouldn\u2019t last. She had mountains to climb with this case\u2014and Logan. But right now, she felt more settled than she had in months, maybe years.</p><p>But she also felt more connected to him than she ever had to any lover.</p><p>Before the alarm bells could go off in her head, Logan rolled over, his body half covering hers, and he possessed her mouth with his in a slow kiss of reverence. Endless, deep. It wasn\u2019t meant to arouse. Instead, Tara had to fight the urge to burrow deeper into his embrace and cling. To connect with him again in every way.</p><p>Feelings like that could lead nowhere good. Logan would train her and disappear from her life. She had to be ready to feign an appropriate response to York or any other Dom presented to her.</p><p>She broke the kiss and eased to her feet, praying her legs would support her.</p><p>\u201cI need a minute. Please. Then we\u2019ll get back to work.\u201d Tara reached for her clothes on the concrete floor.</p><p>Logan scooped them up before she could grab the first garment. He tucked the stack against his chest. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in my dungeon\u2014in most Dom\u2019s dungeons\u2014you won\u2019t be dressed beyond what they allow. If you need to go down the hall to the ladies\u2019 room, I\u2019ll give you your robe.\u201d He placed her clothes in the wardrobe, then handed her the silky cream-colored garment. It wasn\u2019t sheer, but it clung to every bump on her body, especially her stiff, aching nipples. She crossed her arms over her chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tsking, Logan pushed them down to her sides. \u201cNo hiding.\u201d</p><p>He cradled her breast in his hand, thumbing her engorged nipple through the silk. Fresh pleasure arced through her body. Her head told her that she should be pulling away. She was engaged. None of the soft touches Logan lavished on her forwarded her training. But her body didn\u2019t care. It wanted him.</p><p>\u201cYes, Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent, Cherry.\u201d In reward, he eased the silky lapels of the robe apart, anchoring them on the sides of her exposed breasts. He leaned in and kissed one nipple, suckled and nipped it gently. More blood rushed to the tip in a flash of sensitivity. Logan did the same to the other hard tip. More desire gathered hotly between her thighs.</p> <p>As she arched toward him in silent offering, he covered her breasts up and spun her toward the door.</p><p>\u201cStill want a few minutes alone?\u201d he murmured in her ear.</p><p>Distance between them would be good, but she no longer wanted it. But was it really wise to experience all that passion again when she was marrying someone else? Someone like Brad, whom her stepfather approved of. Brad shared her desire for marriage and children. He did absolutely nothing for her in bed and could never use sex to control her. Logan could do that twenty-four/seven. Tara sighed. Maybe she should ease her own ache in the bathroom and come back with renewed focus, a clearer head.</p><p>\u201cYes, Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen minutes. No masturbating. Or that will cost you twenty-five swats and a whole lot of orgasm depravation. That would be a damn shame . . .\u201d He smiled as if he knew that he\u2019d thwarted her plans.</p> <p>Damn him. He wanted her totally at his mercy. For the case\u2014or for himself? Was he really trying so hard to train her simply for the mission? Did he want to talk about their past merely to clear the air so their rapport would be easier and facilitate the training? Or was this personal for him? His every touch seemed to say so. Tara had to ask herself why. And what was she going to do about the fact that both the scared girl and aching woman inside her wanted to cling to Logan and ask the answers to all her questions?</p><p>Tara drew in a bracing breath and opened the dungeon\u2019s door. To her utter horror, Brad stood directly in her path.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cB-BRAD?\u201d Tara\u2019s heart dropped to her knees. She had trouble drawing in a breath. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest, anger radiating from his nearly black eyes, glittering with betrayal. \u201cAfter the marks I saw on your body last night and our argument, I came to find out what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Tara swallowed. How much of this morning\u2019s session with Logan had he seen? \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNeither should you.\u201d Brad stepped into the room on heavy footsteps. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that your first lover was working you over\u2014excuse me, working with you on this case? Did that fact slip your mind, dear?\u201d</p><p>Crap. She\u2019d stepped deep in it now, and had no one to blame but herself. \u201cNo. I was reassigned to Logan yesterday. I didn\u2019t tell you because I didn\u2019t want you to overreact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you didn\u2019t want me wondering if you were having feelings for him again.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that, too. Brad\u2019s sarcasm made his fury painfully obvious. Maybe she should have handled things differently, but it was too late now. Clearly, Logan was always going to elicit some response in her. It was like her body was hardwired to his, and she\u2019d been na\u00efve to hope otherwise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right, you should be sorry! You took off every stitch of clothing and let him put his fucking tongue all over you. And you came for him like a bitch in heat. You begged for him. I have always treated you like a lady, been gentle and deferential. And this is how you screw me over?\u201d</p><p>Tara felt two inches tall\u2014and wished she could disappear altogether. \u201cIt\u2014I didn\u2019t arrange to have Logan as my trainer. That decision rests with my superior and the club owner. You know Darcy is in imminent danger. What kind of friend, what kind of FBI agent, would I be if I held up this case for my personal\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur wedding is in eight weeks. Our invitations arrived yesterday afternoon. Now, I\u2019m standing here wondering if I know you at all. I\u2019ve always thought you were honest and forthright. That you\u2019d never cheat because this bastard\u201d\u2014he pointed to Logan angrily\u2014\u201ctaught you how much it hurts.\u201d</p> <p>Brad was right. The fact that he was a lawyer, capable of tossing together great arguments on the fly, didn\u2019t help, either. Worse, she couldn\u2019t say that she hadn\u2019t cheated. She may not have had sex with Logan, but if he\u2019d dropped his leather pants and crawled between her thighs ten minutes ago, would she have found the strength to stop him?</p><p>Tara feared she knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d She shook her head, not knowing what else to say. \u201cAbout everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall Bocelli and tell him you need to be reassigned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Yesterday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Cherry,\u201d Logan cursed softly.</p><p>Tara glanced his way. Hurt flashed across his face. And somehow, his pain hurt her.</p><p>Why? She didn\u2019t owe him anything, except hard work on this case. But engaging in a bit of the power exchange today had reforged the connection she\u2019d once felt with Logan. It was back\u2014but stronger.</p><p>Damn. The last thing she wanted to do was hurt Brad. If she\u2019d seen him having oral sex with another woman, even for the sake of his job, she\u2019d feel betrayed, too.</p><p>Pressing her lips together, she turned back to her fianc\u00e9. \u201cBocelli refused me. The club\u2019s owner insists that Logan will get the job done, and my boss is sticking by that. Logan has a lot of valuable experience in this environment. I know what you\u2019re thinking, but this is my job. I have to see this through. And quite frankly, I understand where they\u2019re coming from. Look, Brad, I know this seems weird to you, but I\u2019m about to go into a different world. These people are criminals and don\u2019t play by the rules. If I\u2019m going to do this job right, I have to fit into their world and that includes accepting certain things I might not like.\u201d</p><p>Brad paced. \u201cSo I\u2019m supposed to watch you walk out the door every morning, knowing that you\u2019re strutting around naked for him, letting him touch you so he can dig his way back into your heart? He\u2019s been a ghost between us since day one, Tara.\u201d</p><p>She wished she could refute Brad.</p><p>He lifted her chin and forced her stare to lock with his. \u201cWhat else don\u2019t I know? Have you fucked him again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Brad, don\u2019t do this . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, seek the truth? I shouldn\u2019t point out that, in the three years we\u2019ve been together, I\u2019ve never heard you scream during sex. Hell, I\u2019d wondered if you even liked it, but that was okay because I love you and wanted to be with you, regardless. I guess I should be wondering now about your feelings for me.\u201d</p><p>Tara was questioning them herself. But aside from her stepfather, Adam, Brad had been the most stable force in her life. \u201cI would never have agreed to marry you if I didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to try to tell me that nothing has changed for you?\u201d he challenged.</p><p>Tara hesitated. No. Everything had changed. She closed her eyes. How had that happened? When? Did she even want to know why?</p><p>It sucked caring about two men who were so damn different. They were like comparing a sunny morning to a midnight storm. Brad usually brought his kindness, his well-developed sense of justice to everything he did. Logan charged in with a bang\u2014all testosterone and demand with a little mischief thrown in\u2014then wrought difficulty and destruction before disappearing like a wraith.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t stop wanting him. Maybe she\u2019d never stopped.</p><p>God, her life was falling apart. She hoped that when this case was over, her fever for Logan would be, too. But she feared that was wishful thinking.</p><p>\u201cBrad, this isn\u2019t the place to discuss us. Let me get dressed. We\u2019ll talk in the car for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur relationship is a mess, and you want to give me ten minutes in the Audi?\u201d</p><p>His sarcasm made her wince. \u201cIt\u2019s all I can spare now. Tonight, we\u2019ll talk\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Right here, right now, I want to know what\u2019s most important to you. Either you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d Tara had a terrible felling that she knew what his next words would be and she wasn\u2019t ready to face this so soon after Logan had opened up everything vulnerable inside her.</p><p>\u201cQuit this case\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Brad . . .\u201d Distress stabbed her chest.</p><p>\u201cOr give me back my ring. Because I\u2019ll be god damned if I\u2019m going to do nothing while you come here every day to play kinky personal trainer with your ex-boyfriend for your \u2018job.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Dread made her stomach plummet to her knees. Since yesterday, Tara had feared that if Brad learned Logan was prepping her for this mission that he\u2019d blow a gasket, but this wasn\u2019t the reaction she\u2019d imagined. Anger, yes. Betrayal, absolutely. But this?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re reading this wrong, Brad. Logan is a highly skilled non-Bureau contractor assigned to teach me everything I need to succeed and save Darcy. You know how important this is to me, to make Adam proud, see if the field is where I belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talked about interviews, maybe a demonstration or a walkthrough of all this BDSM shit. Not hands-on experience with your ex.\u201d</p><p>Logan got in his face. \u201cAre you really such a prick that you\u2019d want her to go into a potentially dangerous situation without the proper training?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone else can teach her what she needs to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Tara insisted. \u201cThe brass put my training in Dominion\u2019s hands because no one at the Bureau is equipped to teach me properly. The head of this club thinks Logan can prepare me to survive in this world. At this point, I think the smartest thing is for me to listen to the people who know what the hell they\u2019re doing. What\u2019s the brass going to say if I walk in as a junior agent on her first assignment and tell them how it\u2019s going to go down? They would laugh at me. Nor can I walk off this case without losing credibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so, but they can\u2019t force you stay with this job.\u201d</p><p>Tara\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me to quit the FBI for you?\u201d</p><p>That took his jealousy too far. It was a betrayal of everything she wanted and believed in. Brad worked to all hours of the night. He\u2019d asked her to sacrifice for his career, claiming that it was for the good of both of them. But her job didn\u2019t mean anything?</p><p>\u201cFor us,\u201d he stressed. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to think about our future. Take a job that doesn\u2019t put you in the hands of ruthless bastards and criminals for a paycheck. A job you won\u2019t have to prostitute your integrity for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me to choose between my aspirations and my fianc\u00e9? I need to know if I\u2019m meant to spend my life in the field. And I can\u2019t leave my maid of honor in some sick bastard\u2019s dungeon. What about Darcy and the other victims? Am I supposed to just let them die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Tara. As much as I hate to say it, they\u2019re probably either already dead or sold. Let\u2019s say what this really is about. Do you want a man who wants to love you for the rest of your life, or the douche bag who\u2019s going to treat you like a piece of ass\u2014again.\u201d</p><p>Brad wanted her to choose between Logan and himself, between the past and the future. He was forcing her to lay her cards on the table now.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know a damn thing about me or how I feel about Tara,\u201d Logan growled, suddenly standing protectively by her side. \u201cYou\u2019ve said a lot of really ugly things about the woman you supposedly love. Have to guilt her into staying with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really want to go there?\u201d Brad glared at Logan, despite being four inches shorter and having thirty fewer pounds of pure muscle. \u201cFrom here, it looks like you have to tie them down to keep them from running away, screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, both of you!\u201d Tara glared from one to the other. \u201cBrad, this isn\u2019t about Logan.\u201d</p><p>Fists clenched, Brad looked like a kettle ready to blow, all red and worked up. Logan appeared calm on the surface, but she wasn\u2019t fooled. Under that fa\u00e7ade was a deadly force he could unleash at will.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself, Tara.\u201d Brad shook his head. \u201cEither get your clothes on and come with me or give me back my ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the douche bag now?\u201d Logan said, staring at Brad with disdain.</p><p>\u201cYeah, if the shoe was on the other foot?\u201d</p><p>Logan laughed. The sound wasn\u2019t nice. \u201cI\u2019d spend every night satisfying her to make sure she knew how much I loved her, so that the last thing on her mind during the day was another man. But I\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t try that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working late. I have a big case,\u201d Brad defended.</p><p>\u201cShe does, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to prance around naked for mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis attitude only shows that you know squat about working undercover. Solving crime and stopping bad shit is more important than modesty or your tight-ass idea of morality.\u201d</p> <p>Tara jumped into the fray before Logan and Brad started dismantling one another. \u201cPlease, Brad . . . You\u2019re asking me to give up the opportunity to nail a guy who kidnaps ten-year-old girls, then sells them to perverts in brothels. So what if someone sees my boobs? I\u2019m an adult; I can handle it. What about these poor girls? Who is going to fight for them? Should I apologize to them because my fianc\u00e9 is squeamish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being obtuse. I\u2019m not objecting to the case; I\u2019m objecting to him.\u201d Brad pointed.</p><p>Logan smiled. \u201cFrom the FBI\u2019s perspective, we\u2019re a package deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could be anyone else, and you still wouldn\u2019t want another man touching me this way,\u201d Tara pointed out.</p><p>One look at Brad\u2019s face told her that rationale wasn\u2019t going to cut it for him. Anxiety clawed through her, along with a fear of letting go of her status quo. What would she do without his anchoring influence? And what about her stepfather? He\u2019d be so disappointed, then disapproving if he found out Logan was back in her life. No, she wasn\u2019t a teenager anymore, could choose who she wanted to be with, but Adam was all the family she had left. She hated letting him down after he\u2019d all but raised her.</p> <p>Even so, the big question loomed: What did she want? In the end, she was going to have to battle her natural inclination to please everyone and decide what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d Brad conceded. \u201cBut he makes it worse. It took years to exorcise his ghost from between us. Last year, when I finally thought you\u2019d overcome him, I proposed. Now he\u2019s back, and this time it\u2019ll be worse. Just to inflate his ego, he\u2019ll make sure you won\u2019t forget him, even as he\u2019s ripping your heart to shreds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChoose, Tara. Come with me or give me the ring.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t dare look at Logan. She didn\u2019t want to look at Brad. A million thoughts swirled in her head. The need to help Darcy. The crusading spirit in her chest to stop the abduction of these poor young girls sold into sex. The fire in her belly to be a good agent. The ache Logan stirred in her warred with the fear of losing Brad\u2019s stability. If Logan knew she was no longer engaged, he\u2019d ruthlessly go after her body. And her heart would follow.</p><p>If she was that worried about Logan stealing her heart, how in love with Brad could she be? The too-honest question made her flinch. But there was no taking it back. The risk in losing Brad wasn\u2019t in losing the love of her life, but the man who made her feel like she\u2019d finally have the family she wanted. After losing her mother young and being bounced around between her grandparents and an aunt until Adam stepped in and adopted her, she craved having one roof and one man to come home to. She wanted to know that her children would never wonder where they\u2019d live tomorrow. Brad could give that to her.</p> <p>But was it fair to hang on to someone who\u2019d been nothing but patient and kind to her when that family was off in the future and she wasn\u2019t sure that she loved him now?</p><p>Without looking at either man, she made her way to Logan\u2019s little cabinet on the far side of the room. She doffed the socks and the robe, feeling both men\u2019s eyes searing her bare backside. Then she donned her suit, buttoned her blouse, adjusted the lapels of her coat, stepped into her heels.</p><p>She grabbed the ring in her hand, then crossed the room again, focusing on Brad. \u201cShall we go?\u201d</p><p>Astonishment flashed across Brad\u2019s face, then an exultant smile that had Tara wincing.</p><p>\u201cTara.\u201d Logan grabbed her hand, his dark brows bunched over his stunned gaze.</p><p>God, every time he touched her, her body flared hot. She didn\u2019t want to leave him.</p><p>\u201cGet your hand off her,\u201d Brad growled, placing his arm around her waist.</p><p>It was one of the few times he\u2019d ever been possessive.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this, Logan. Not now.\u201d Tara squelched her guilt, then eased away from them both before addressing Brad. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladly,\u201d Brad said as he shot Logan a triumphant glare.</p><p>Then he slammed the dungeon door behind them, and the last thing Tara saw was shock and agony ripping across Logan\u2019s face. Her heart squeezed painfully in her chest.</p><p>With a kiss at her temple, Brad threw his arm around her again and drew her close as they walked down the hall. \u201cThank you. I was so afraid I was going to lose you.\u201d</p><p>In a few minutes, he\u2019d hate her so much that he wouldn\u2019t care. But for everything he\u2019d done for her, been for her, for the past three years, he deserved the respect of privacy for this conversation. \u201cWhere can we talk?\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, they were back at the house they shared. It had been investment property for Brad, but when the previous tenants had moved out and she\u2019d accepted Brad\u2019s proposal, he\u2019d given up his studio apartment and asked her to move in here with him. As he opened the front door, into the living room, Tara was struck by the fact that this place had never felt like home.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to eat first, then talk?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d Tara shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d She drew in a long breath and held the engagement ring out to Brad. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t marry you.\u201d</p><p>Shock blanched his face as he stared, frozen. When she pressed the ring into his hand, his fingers curled slowly around it. \u201cYou\u2019re picking him over me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about Logan. It\u2019s about making the right choices for me.\u201d</p><p>Brad\u2019s anger took over. \u201cTell yourself that all you want. I know the truth. He will, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about my case and my friend and the duty I swore to upheld when I joined the FBI. It\u2019s about what I want to accomplish. I won\u2019t quit.\u201d And I won\u2019t continue pretending that I love you as much as you want me to.</p><p>Brad shook his head as he pocketed the ring. \u201cI wonder if he knew when he staged that demonstration for me earlier that he\u2019d break us apart.\u201d</p><p>Demonstration? \u201cWhat d-do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must have known that my watching you with him would tear me apart inside.\u201d</p><p>Shock turned the blood in her veins to ice. Logan had known that Brad was watching him go down on her? Horror washed over Tara. And certainty. Of course Logan had known. Brad had been the \u201csomeone unpleasant\u201d he\u2019d had to deal with.</p><p>That son of a bitch. Betrayal scalded her. And fury. She\u2019d trusted him enough to submit, so she could feel for herself the connection that Jason and Greta shared. He\u2019d used the scene as a way to rub her desire in Brad\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a fucking bastard, Tara,\u201d Brad spat. \u201cEnjoy the hell out of your life, especially after he makes you miserable again. Screaming orgasms aside, you know that day is coming. And I won\u2019t be around to pick up the pieces. Leave your key on the kitchen counter.\u201d</p><p>Brad stormed through the front door\u2014and out of her life.</p><p>Just like that, her perfect picket-fence future was gone. How the hell had that happened so quickly?</p><p>Tara braced herself on the back of the sofa with shaking hands. She needed a few minutes to process the fact that she was no longer engaged to an up-and-coming ADA who\u2019d sworn he\u2019d love her forever\u2014and that her first lover had done his level best to break them up. And why? Just to see if she\u2019d be gullible enough to fall for him twice? All the bullshit earlier about him caring for her and wanting to protect her . . . She suspected all he\u2019d really wanted was to strip Brad from her life so he could have her back at his mercy. No way was she going to give him the satisfaction.</p><p>Club Dominion\u2014Friday afternoon</p><p>Two hours later, Tara walked back into the dungeon. Logan felt his entire body go rubbery with relief. He\u2019d feared that when she\u2019d left with Brad, she\u2019d never return, that she\u2019d marry the schmuck and leave Logan alone and fucking miserable for the rest of his crappy life.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back?\u201d God, even his voice wobbled nervously.</p><p>When she stepped closer, he looked under that furious glare to see that she\u2019d been crying. Something in his chest seized up. Her expression told him that she hadn\u2019t shed all her tears yet. Was she that miserable being here with him?</p><p>Logan raked a hand through his hair. If she stayed, he\u2019d train her. But damn it, he wanted to do everything possible to make her happy. He couldn\u2019t stand that anguished face. He hoped like hell that he could make her fall in love with him again, not only because he\u2019d told Thorpe he was going to collar and marry her, but because he didn\u2019t think his god damn sanity would last without her.</p><p>But if, after her training, he only made her miserable, he\u2019d let her go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d She raised her chin proudly. \u201cDon\u2019t gloat. If it weren\u2019t for my job, I swear to God, I\u2019d never come within ten feet of you again.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, she took off her clothes, folded them at his feet, then assumed the slave position. Despite being posed in a way meant to communicate her desire to serve, her body shook with fury, complete with a \u201cfuck off\u201d vibe.</p><p>Shit. She looked so lovely, and it was all he could do to keep his hands off. But he had to figure out what was in her heart first. So the bad news he\u2019d received while she\u2019d been gone would have to wait.</p><p>\u201cCherry, tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>Tara glared at him with the fire of a thousand suns. \u201cI ended my engagement to Brad.\u201d</p><p>Hope and triumph spiked inside him. She\u2019d left the asshole? Thank God. Not only was Brad a distraction Tara didn\u2019t need right now, he was completely wrong for her. He\u2019d been standing squarely in Logan\u2019s way. It was a relief to have that obstacle removed.</p><p>\u201cBut then, I suppose you manipulated the situation\u2014and me\u2014 as always.\u201d She tossed him a bitter glare. \u201cWhy else would you go down on me and force me to beg for orgasm, unless you knew he was watching.\u201d</p><p>Shit. She\u2019d totally mistaken his utter need to fight for her as a betrayal. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to do that every day. Brad watching was merely a bonus. I told him to leave, but I suspected he\u2019d be stupid enough to stay and watch. Did I want to piss him off? I didn\u2019t really care how he felt. Did I hope to come between the two of you? He and I had already covered that. He knew the score. But I didn\u2019t do it for him; I did it because I couldn\u2019t stay away from you for another god damned minute. I needed to touch you.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cWhat did you cover with Brad?\u201d</p><p>Tara didn\u2019t want to listen to him. Frustration gnawed at his stomach. He\u2019d been right to put the decision to hear him out in her hands. He wasn\u2019t going to be able to force her to believe him, especially a few minutes after breaking up with her fianc\u00e9. Unlike her behavior in the dungeon, this had to be her choice. She\u2019d been through a lot already today, and it was barely after noon.</p><p>\u201cTell you what, Cherry. We\u2019ll talk about it when we\u2019re both in a better place.\u201d</p><p>Tara was silent for such a long moment, her face so angry and full of hurt. Dread wound its way through Logan\u2019s system. \u201cYou manipulated my future. I started to trust you and . . . you hurt me.\u201d</p><p>He winced. Every word was true. He was used to being ruthless; fighting terrorist thugs required it, and sometimes, he forgot to turn that off.</p><p>\u201cBaby, I didn\u2019t mean . . .\u201d To come between Tara and Brad? Yeah, he had. Or at least he\u2019d hoped to make her think about where her heart truly lay. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Logan couldn\u2019t say that he was sorry for the result\u2014but he was sorry for her pain.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t even look at him. \u201cWhat you did was despicable, but I shouldn\u2019t have expected any different. It doesn\u2019t matter. I won\u2019t let you matter. Physically, you\u2019ll teach me and keep me safe, and that\u2019s all I need. So let\u2019s get back to business. Strictly business. The sooner I learn what I need to know, the sooner I\u2019ll be away from you.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. He probably deserved that. He still had plenty to say on this topic, but he\u2019d play it her way for now. Forcing her to talk before she was ready wasn\u2019t going to make her feel any better or get him what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cAll right, work it is,\u201d he conceded. \u201cBut we will revisit the subject later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve just stabbed me in the back and exploded my personal life all to hell. From now on, it\u2019s off-limits to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think that your breakup with Brad had nothing to do with me?\u201d Logan knew he should shut up, but if Tara imagined that to be true for a second, then she\u2019d lied to her former fianc\u00e9\u2014and herself. \u201cThe way I see it, you responded to my hands on your body, my mouth on your clit so completely that there\u2019s no way you don\u2019t have feelings for me. You\u2019ve never been the kind of girl to get off with a guy she doesn\u2019t care for. I\u2019m guessing that was your problem with Brad.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She flushed, but still managed to scowl. \u201cYou\u2019re delusional. Go fuck yourself.\u201d</p><p>Not gonna happen. He had six days to convince Tara that he\u2019d always loved her and that she was his. He refused to waste another second.</p><p>\u201cYou want to get down to business, fine. Lose the chip on your shoulder, get your ass over to the bed, then wait for my command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a prick,\u201d she muttered as she made her way across the room.</p> <p>Logan caught up to her in a heartbeat. \u201cThat\u2019s Master Prick to you.\u201d</p><p>Tara rolled her eyes. With that attitude, she wouldn\u2019t learn anything about how to behave with a suspect trying to dominate her. She was also testing his authority. Yes, she was angry, but she\u2019d broken her engagement to roll the dice with him again. Deep down, she knew it, even if she wasn\u2019t ready to admit it.</p><p>But if she wanted to work, the first thing he was going to do was put a stop to her shitty attitude\u2014quickly.</p><p>He grabbed her wrist and turned her around, thrusting his hand into the silky length of that fiery red hair. Fuck, he wanted to slide his tongue along her skin, his cock deeper into her body than any man ever had, and stay there until she acknowledged who she belonged to.</p><p>Taking a calming breath, Logan released her and sat on the bed, then pulled her naked backside across his lap.</p> <p>Tara stiffened. \u201cYou\u2019re not abusing my ass again, you bastard! Romeo! \u201d</p><p>He smoothed a hand across her firm, pale cheeks as he held her struggling form. Tara was topping from the bottom. But in case she was actually scared, he paused.</p><p>\u201cAm I going to hurt you past what you can bear? Make you bleed? Permanently mark you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you fear for your physical safety?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo what? Rephrase your answer.\u201d</p><p>A long pause later, she grumbled, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t fear for my physical safety, Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve barely touched you, but I\u2019ve pushed you beyond what you can endure?\u201d</p><p>Tara didn\u2019t answer, just wriggled, trying to displace his hold on her.</p><p>Logan held her steady across his lap. \u201cStay still and answer the question.\u201d</p><p>With a huff, she stilled. \u201cI don\u2019t like being spanked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad a lot of experience with it, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you did yesterday was\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot meant to pleasure you. It was meant to punish. I told you that. Now I\u2019ll show you the difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I said no, you\u2019d do it anyway. If I told you to fuck off, you\u2019d only add more. At least the safe word stops you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does, but if you can\u2019t take a spanking or a little mind fuck, how will you save Darcy or succeed on this mission? If a training exercise scares you this much, then I can\u2019t let you proceed any further.\u201d</p><p>Her back went ramrod straight. \u201cI\u2019m not scared. You just . . . annoy me.\u201d</p><p>Annoy wasn\u2019t the right word; he got under her skin. This emotional block was one they had to get past. She could probably learn to submit for this assignment, but these walls she thrust between them wouldn\u2019t fly if they were going to progress as a couple. \u201cSo you\u2019re giving me a red light because you\u2019re annoyed with me. Is that what a safe word is for? How do you think that\u2019s going to work undercover?\u201d</p><p>Her fists clenched, and Logan heard her curse under her breath. Time to pull out his ace in the hole. \u201cI\u2019m scheduled to chat with Thorpe and Bocelli later this afternoon. Cherry, if you can\u2019t do this, then you\u2019re in over your head. You have a submissive nature, but mentally, you\u2019re not allowing yourself to give up control so that you can learn\u2014and get\u2014what you need. I\u2019ll ask Bocelli if he can think of another agent who could pull off the case. I\u2019m in town for another ten days, so I can train\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d she snarled.</p><p>The situation was serious, but Logan had to work to suppress his smile. He knew Cherry. Yeah, she didn\u2019t want to give up this assignment, but she really didn\u2019t like the idea of him training another woman. Whether she knew it or not, by giving up her fianc\u00e9 and refusing to let another woman take her place in his dungeon, Tara was telling him that he mattered to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll dare if I think you\u2019re not ready. So either admit that you can\u2019t handle this case or take the punishment you\u2019ve earned.\u201d</p><p>Tara didn\u2019t say anything for a long moment. Finally, she drew in an angry breath. \u201cThe thirteen swats I had left over from yesterday? Should I count them, Logan?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and refrained from a rousing fist pump. \u201cYes. And I\u2019m adding another seven for your generally bad attitude and leaving without permission. Get ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Her entire body tensed, as if bracing for a mortal blow.</p><p>Logan caressed her ass again. She\u2019d find this spanking much different than yesterday\u2019s. This one would push her to the brink until she begged for more.</p><p>A strange curl of anticipation writhed in Tara\u2019s belly as Logan braced one palm on the back of her thigh\u2014a gentle reminder of who was in charge\u2014and lifted the other hand to deliver a light smack to the middle of her right cheek. A little sting spread over her flesh with a sizzle.</p><p>That was it? No terrible blow? No awful pain? She wanted to ask, but didn\u2019t. Quickly, the sting dissipated. She found herself almost . . . disappointed.</p><p>\u201cOne.\u201d Tara spoke the number more like a question, feeling decidedly off guard.</p><p>Then she waited. So did Logan. As long seconds ticked by, she wondered what the hell he was up to. Tara fought off the urge to look over her shoulder. Instead, she bit her lip and forced herself to remain still.</p><p>Finally, he raised his hand, this time smacking her left cheek lower, with a bit more force.</p><p>\u201cTwo,\u201d she counted with more confidence as the slight tingle flitted across her ass again, then slowly faded. Tara squirmed, trying to extend the sensation, but it didn\u2019t work.</p><p>The good news was, she\u2019d easily make it through twenty of these.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><p>She wriggled again, but the sweet ache was gone. Instead, a more insistent one had taken up residence between her thighs. And she was getting wet. Damn it.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen hold still and take the rest of your punishment.\u201d</p><p>Bastard. Tara scowled and held her breath.</p><p>Lifting his hand again, Logan rained a series of swats across her ass\u2014on her right thigh, high on her left cheek, over the line that bisected her cheeks.</p><p>The sizzle heated up again, a little faster and harder. A little hotter. She closed her eyes to enjoy the burn seeping through her.</p><p>\u201cCherry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree, four, five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He stroked her ass, the heat of his palms intensifying the crackling warmth.</p><p>Her breathing was a bit heavier now, her voice shakier. No doubt, he heard it, too. She wanted to hang on to her fury, but she was finding it more difficult to concentrate on anything except her anticipation of Logan\u2019s next slap. His movements had a rhythm Tara couldn\u2019t escape. Lured by the cadence, she sank into sensation.</p><p>\u201cFeeling warm back here, Cherry?\u201d He rubbed his palm over the fading sting of her right thigh, and the friction of his skin sliding against hers did something to Tara that she didn\u2019t understand. The sensations felt almost dreamlike. The peace of it lulled her.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou finding a little place in your head to sink into?\u201d</p><p>How had he known?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called subspace,\u201d he offered. \u201cAll submissives go there when they\u2019re getting what they want and need. It\u2019s their happy place. Get cozy, baby. You\u2019ll be spending a lot of time there.\u201d</p><p>Before she could ask what he meant, he rained down another series of blows on her tender ass, each a bit more forceful than the last. A slow fire began to burn. Everything between her hips and her knees throbbed, especially her pussy. With the slaps ringing in her ears and the prickling heat quivering across her skin, she lost count of his blows.</p><p>\u201cCherry, where are we? How many?\u201d</p><p>She blinked and realized that she\u2019d zoned out looking at the concrete floor and feeling the erotic rhythm of his hand striking her, skin on skin.</p><p>\u201cSix, seven, eight, nine.\u201d</p><p>He smacked the side of her thigh. \u201cFocus. That was six through ten. Do I need to start over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Logan.\u201d But she swallowed at the thought of staying here, pinned helplessly across his lap while he heaped one slap after another across her tender buttocks. She should hate his guts, but imagining that he might continue to spank her to his satisfaction made her impossibly hot and wet.</p><p>Suddenly, he thrust a hand between her legs, his fingers sliding through her copious juices to brush across her clit. She gasped and tried to twist away. No luck. He circled the sensitive nub once, twice. Tara couldn\u2019t hold in her moan.</p><p>\u201cYou going to tell me now that you don\u2019t like to be spanked?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. How could she be aroused so completely by someone who\u2019d broken her heart in the past and done his part to ruin her future? Then again, she had no way to lie. Given her very fair skin, she was going to bruise. And yet knowing he\u2019d leave his mark on her somehow turned her on more.</p><p>\u201cCherry, I asked you a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she choked. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you that I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>Beneath her, Tara felt Logan\u2019s whole body relax. Did her feelings really matter to him?</p><p>Gently, he glided his palm down her spine, over her warmed ass, as he pressed a soft kiss between her shoulder blades. She had to remind herself that his tenderness was a lie.</p><p>\u201cThank you for your honesty,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI know that was difficult for you.\u201d</p><p>Very. And she didn\u2019t want to give him anymore ammunition, so she said nothing.</p><p>Logan stroked a hand down her hair, then cradled her head in his palm with one hand. With the other, he started raining down a series of blows again.</p><p>\u201cKeep counting, baby,\u201d he crooned.</p><p>\u201cEleven, twelve, thirteen . . .\u201d The numbers poured out automatically, but the rest of her body was anything but machinelike. The fire spreading over her skin became a blaze burning through her blood. As her body revved up, her brain shut down. And the pain dazzled. It stripped her bravado, her barriers, until it poured into her very soul\u2014then back out again. The hurts that had bruised her heart, both now and then, welled up and swirled together with the inferno of her backside to break her apart. Tears pooled, overflowed, slid down her cheeks.</p><p>She should be pissed, fighting and screaming being treated like a naughty child. Instead, she murmured \u201ctwenty\u201d and prayed like hell that he wouldn\u2019t leave her like this, alone, aching for release, and spread wide open emotionally. He\u2019d driven her to a place so frighteningly personal.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Logan lifted her to face him. He searched her watery eyes and teary face, then yanked her against his chest. \u201cCherry . . .\u201d</p><p>Tara knew that she shouldn\u2019t do it, but the concern and warmth on his face drew her in. She needed comfort\u2014from him. The why of that didn\u2019t compute. He was the one who had helped to ruin her future, then spanked her into this hot mess. But for some reason, she knew only he could put her back together.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He cuddled her close, soothing her with a soft touch to her hair, down her back. \u201cYou did really well, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cI\u2014I have to get control. This is un-p-professional.\u201d</p><p>And it was humiliating to admit that, despite everything, Logan could still make her want him more than any other man.</p><p>Somewhere in that alpha male head of his, she feared that he\u2019d labeled her not just a challenge, but the ultimate one. The one who got away. Other than the one time he\u2019d knocked on her door a few years back and she\u2019d slammed it in his face, he\u2019d never contacted her after their breakup. Now, he sought to seduce the little lovesick twit back to his bed. She\u2019d become his personal Mount Everest. Clinging to him made her feel stupid.</p><p>\u201cCherry, we\u2019ve covered this. Your response is honest, and that\u2019s what I need from you. You want to come?\u201d</p><p>Yes. Desperately. And what kind of girl got off on having her ass smacked, especially by a guy trying to fuck her over for a second time?</p><p>Tara resisted answering, wanting so badly to keep clinging to his neck, drawing in his musky earth scent . . . and avoiding that question. Instead, she pulled away, letting her arms fall to her sides.</p><p>Logan shot her a stern glance. \u201cBe honest. Did you want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d She squeezed her eyes shut, then forced herself to face the truth. \u201cYes, Logan.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her softly in reward. \u201cReally good, baby. Soon. What else did you feel?\u201d</p><p>How could she explain it? She shook her head. \u201cLike a bunch of feelings welled up inside me. With every swat, there was physical pain, but somehow that released more of it inside me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPain you\u2019ve been holding on to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d She shrugged, playing it off. \u201cI\u2019m more emotional today since I lost a fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>He clasped her head in his hands and drew her gaze squarely to his. \u201cCherry, if he\u2019d been really important to you, you\u2019d still be with him now, trying to patch up your engagement, not here falling into subspace for me. Think about that tonight for me. Please.\u201d</p><p>Tara blinked at him. God, was he right? She tried to wipe the emotion off her face, but feared that she was failing.</p><p>\u201cAnd now I have something else to tell you.\u201d He caressed her back, his face full of regret. \u201cWhen you left, you forgot your phone. Bocelli couldn\u2019t reach you, so he called Thorpe.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach clenched with fear. She grabbed Logan. \u201cPlease tell me that Darcy isn\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that we know.\u201d He soothed her shoulder with a light touch. \u201cBut the first submissive to disappear, Laken Fox? A fisherman off the coast of Key West found her body, bound, tortured, and strangled, early this morning.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>TARA felt the bottom fall out of her stomach. God, she was going to be sick.</p><p>\u201cTh-They killed her? I thought their plans were to sell submissives and . . .\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded, looking pensive. \u201cBased on the fact that they found her in the U.S., I don\u2019t think the victim had been sold yet. And given the description of her corpse, I\u2019d say someone lost patience during the training or likes to play way outside the boundaries of the safe, sane, and consensual. These people are beyond hard core, Cherry. If you\u2019re going to pursue this case\u2014and I wish to hell you wouldn\u2019t\u2014then you have to set aside everything. You can\u2019t hold back with me.\u201d</p><p>Fear tasted brackish in her mouth, but Tara had no doubt about the resolution beating inside her. No way was she leaving Darcy or any other woman to suffer. No way was she giving up on this case. This had gone way beyond pleasing Adam or serving some uncertain ambition of being a field agent, and into crusading. She needed to save these victims.</p><p>Logan was right; she had to step up to the plate. Kidnapping and sex trafficking was terrible enough, but adding torture and murder upped the stakes. No matter how she felt about Logan personally or his motives, the last twenty-four hours had taught her that she\u2019d be hard-pressed to hide her true responses from a well-trained Dom. Learning to submit was necessary for her mission. And if she was brutally honest, being submissive was filling some void inside her that she hadn\u2019t wanted to acknowledge. It scared the crap out of her, and she\u2019d been fighting Logan from the second she\u2019d hit his dungeon door. Now, she didn\u2019t have that luxury.</p><p>\u201cPoint taken,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll focus completely on learning.\u201d</p><p>Both relief and pride crossed his face as he brushed a hand over her cheek. \u201cExcellent, Cherry. You\u2019re so damn brave.\u201d</p><p>Tara swallowed. She didn\u2019t want to think about how good his approval made her feel. As Brad had pointed out, Logan had wreaked a lot of misery on her life. If she was going to truly submit to him, then she had to put that out of her head. But she had to protect herself somehow. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t make it through this training with her heart intact.</p><p>\u201cYou have to promise me something.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head. \u201cTell me, and I\u2019ll consider it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you everything I\u2019ve got. No more fighting or holding back. No pretending that submitting to you doesn\u2019t arouse me. I\u2019ll give you total honesty sexually. In exchange, once this mission is over, you\u2019ll walk away and never seek me out again. If those terms aren\u2019t acceptable, I believe my stepfather is still in contact with Admiral Pierce, who can revoke your leave immediately,\u201d she bluffed. \u201cWhat\u2019s it going to be?\u201d</p><p>LOGAN stared at his clever little Cherry. Getting angry would be easy\u2014and pointless. If he didn\u2019t agree to her deal, he\u2019d likely be back in some third world shithole by tomorrow, fighting tangos, which would pave the way for another Dom to train her.</p><p>Fuck, no.</p><p>Logan set her aside on the silken sheets and rose, scrubbing a harsh hand down his face. Talk about topping from the bottom. Either he refused her deal and gave her up now, or he took his chances and hoped that in their remaining time together, he could both teach her what she needed to know and recapture her heart. No contest.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He grabbed her chin, forcing her gaze up to his. \u201cBut I need your complete cooperation to get this done, so I have terms of my own: if you push back even once, if you lie or fail to trust me, the deal is off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d She bristled.</p><p>\u201cMake no mistake, Cherry. If that happens, once this mission is over, I will come after you hard, with everything I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>Tara jerked her chin from his grasp and glared, clearly trying to understand his motivation. If he hadn\u2019t known her well, he would have missed the curiosity and confusion she tried like hell to bury. He wished she\u2019d just ask; he\u2019d be more than happy to tell her why he\u2019d cut her loose years ago. He\u2019d gladly admit that he still loved her so much that it hurt. But she didn\u2019t trust him yet. That stunt he\u2019d pulled with Brad earlier today hadn\u2019t helped his cause. Logan knew that if he blurted his feelings now, she likely wouldn\u2019t believe him. And why should she? It wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d been at her door every day, trying to win her back. No, he\u2019d been trying, in his way, to move on, just as she had.</p><p>She glared, then nodded once. \u201cAll right. But I need to speak with Bocelli before it gets any later on the East Coast. I have a sparring appointment with Agent York at six, then dinner with my stepfather at seven thirty. Somewhere between all of that, I need to find a place to stay, since I moved my things out of Brad\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been living with the asshole? It probably shouldn\u2019t have shocked Logan, but her words were a blow to his gut.</p><p>\u201cYou can stay with me.\u201d</p><p>Tara just shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea. Misty said she knew of some decent nearby motels. I\u2019ll start there. It won\u2019t interfere with work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the way you want it. But you\u2019re not leaving this dungeon before five today. I have something planned for you this afternoon. In fact, we\u2019ve got a lot to cover before you\u2019re ready, so we\u2019ll be putting in long hours. For the rest of the week, we\u2019ll start at oh six hundred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she bit out.</p><p>Logan let out a breath, tried to stay focused. All he could think about was picking Cherry up and throwing her in his truck, taking her to his condo, to his bed\u2014where he\u2019d never taken any woman\u2014then strapping her down and getting deep inside her. So fucking deep, she\u2019d never forget the way he filled her up.</p><p>God damn it, what irony. He\u2019d refused a string of subs who\u2019d assumed that giving him sex would please him. He finally found one he was dying for, and he couldn\u2019t have her.</p><p>At least not yet.</p><p>While she spent tonight dealing with all the crap in her life, he\u2019d get his head screwed on straight. And plan. His time with Cherry was limited, so he had to pull out all the stops to show her how he felt. He\u2019d do his fucking best to ensure that by the end of the week there was no way she could fail on this mission\u2014and no way she\u2019d ever again deny that he was in her heart.</p><p>\u201cSTAND for me,\u201d Logan commanded.</p><p>Without a word or a moment\u2019s hesitation, Tara rose to her feet before him, hands behind her back, breasts outthrust, defiant stare glued to his.</p><p>\u201cCareful with your attitude,\u201d he warned, voice silky. \u201cEver heard of edge play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d She struggled to retrieve the information from her brain with Logan\u2019s unnerving gaze on every naked inch of her. \u201cIt can mean activities on the \u2018edge\u2019 of the safe, sane, consensual, like breathplay or cutting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. That\u2019s a hard limit for many, including me, so we won\u2019t go there. I\u2019m talking about a different sort of edge.\u201d</p><p>Moments later, Logan punched in his security code to the dungeon door. Tara looked up to see another man saunter inside.</p><p>He was tall, with dark hair, and eyes somewhere between green and gold. Hispanic? Italian? His bronzed complexion bespoke some exotic race. When he entered, he\u2019d looked bored. The second his eyes latched on to her, they lit up like he\u2019d found a fascinating new toy and couldn\u2019t wait to play.</p><p>Tara raised her arms, intent on crossing them over her chest.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Logan demanded, his voice low.</p><p>Body taut, she forced herself to drop her hands to her sides.</p><p>Logan nodded his praise. \u201cThis is my friend and fellow Dom, Xander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormally, I wouldn\u2019t answer that question for a sub, but since we\u2019re training for a mission, I\u2019ll explain. In the BDSM world, it\u2019s considered polite to share your subs with other Doms. Agent York may be called upon while you\u2019re undercover to let others touch you. You have to get used to the idea that it will both happen and that you\u2019ll have absolutely no control. Now, present yourself to us.\u201d</p><p>A thousand thoughts swirled through her head. Anger and shock that Logan wanted another man to look at her. To touch her? He\u2019d just done everything possible to remove Brad from her life.</p><p>But he also had to prepare her for whatever might happen undercover.</p><p>Tara refused to reveal her anxiety or renege on their deal, so she merely nodded and did as Logan demanded, sliding onto the cold concrete on her knees in front of them both. Xander looked at every inch of her bare skin, just as Logan had ordered her to let him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d Xander\u2019s deep voice slid over her skin, and she tingled with the sincerity in those words.</p><p>\u201cCherry always has been.\u201d</p><p>Warmth sang in Logan\u2019s tone. The whole situation was twisted, but for some reason, hearing his desire and pride made her hopelessly wet.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s also smart and prickly sweet,\u201d Logan added. \u201cAnd submissive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky bastard,\u201d Xander murmured. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo. I\u2019ll direct.\u201d</p><p>Before Tara could wonder what their exchange meant, Xander held out a hand. What did they expect? She cast Logan a questioning glance.</p><p>\u201cShe already looks to you,\u201d Xander said, clearly impressed. \u201cYou\u2019ve made a lot of progress in barely twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a lot more to go,\u201d Logan replied, then turned to her. \u201cPut your hand in his, Cherry. Do whatever he asks unless I say otherwise. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-Okay, Logan.\u201d She laid her fingertips across Xander\u2019s rough palm. His skin was burning hot. He smelled like cut wood and rain and something very male. Without a word, he helped her to her feet and guided her toward the bed.</p><p>Logan crossed his arms over his chest, watching. Knowing that he wasn\u2019t too far away was somehow comforting, even if his next words weren\u2019t. \u201cStrap her down, wrists and ankles.\u201d</p><p>Tara\u2019s immediate response was to protest, but she bit it back and forced herself to examine her reaction. The command caused a pulse of sensation behind her clit and it scared her. She hated to admit that. But she\u2019d promised honesty and couldn\u2019t squirm away from it. If she allowed Xander to do as Logan had ordered, it would make her utterly vulnerable to them. It would also arouse her more. Somehow, Logan knew that.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Logan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to ask that, Cherry. Unless you\u2019re pushing back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Tara took a breath, willed herself to remain calm. Then Xander\u2019s large hand all but swallowed hers as he led her to the black silk sheets, melting her composure. With her heart racing, she clenched her fist. Gently, Xander squeezed back in reassurance.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>No, but he\u2019d push her way beyond her comfort zone. And Logan would tell him exactly how to do it. And as much as it discomfited her to admit it, that thought made her flushed and faint.</p><p>All too quickly, they reached the bed. Xander helped her onto the mattress, then secured her ankles with Velcro straps at each corner. She squeezed her eyes shut for a moment, achingly aware of her naked sex.</p><p>Sitting back on his heels, Xander spread her thighs wider with searing palms and stared directly at her pussy. Lust narrowed his dark-lashed hazel eyes. He reached out, rubbed a thumb directly over her slick clit.</p><p>The shock of arousal stung her. Her body bucked.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Xander murmured. \u201cI love bare pussy, but I can see why you haven\u2019t shaved hers. With this deep red fringe and pink flesh, she\u2019s like a jewel.\u201d</p><p>Logan edged closer, brushed a hand over her aching nipple, her cheek. \u201cI could spend a whole day playing with her, touching, toying, tasting, watching her come over and over.\u201d</p><p>Tara gasped. Logan\u2019s words turned her inside out. Being held down helplessly as he teased her with his fingers and lips, teeth, and tongue, all for the purpose of giving her unending pleasure . . . Need tightened her body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unable to keep her reaction in, she moaned.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Logan praised. \u201cThat\u2019s an honest response.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. Too honest.</p><p>Xander ran a finger through her very wet pussy. \u201cShe definitely likes that idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember, Cherry, no coming unless I say so.\u201d He turned to Xander. \u201cBlindfold her.\u201d</p><p>Xander grinned as he went to the cabinet in the corner and came back toward her with something that looked like a black, lacy sleep mask.</p><p>She struggled, shaking her head. \u201cI need to see what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember your promise. You get no say in this scene, so you don\u2019t need to know anything. I\u2019m calling the shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t see, how will I understand the point of this exercise,\u201d she improvised.</p><p>The truth was, being blindfolded and touched by both of them excited her and scared her spitless at once.</p><p>A sexy smile lifted Logan\u2019s lips. \u201cTrust me, you\u2019ll get the point quickly. Xander, go.\u201d</p><p>All too quickly, the mask settled over her eyes, and Tara was plunged into darkness. Immediately, she worked to tamp down her panic and focused in on her other senses. The cold air grazing her hard nipples and the wet folds of her heated flesh. Xander\u2019s breath on her face as he hovered. The tangy taste of apprehension in her mouth. The rustling of clothing as Xander moved away, then returned. He brushed a thumb over her clit once, twice. The need in her belly twisted tighter. Again, he pulled away. A few moments later, a mechanical humming buzzed\u2014just before he settled something that vibrated directly over her clit. It gave her a jolt of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she cried out.</p><p>\u201cIs he hurting you?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>Xander moved the little device to one side of her clit, then another, awakening more nerves. Just when his stimulation of that spot made her desire spiral, he eased back over the hood and started the cycle all over again. He moved the toy around until the fire engulfed not just her greedy nerve-filled nub, but her very skin and blood. Tara\u2019s sex clenched with aching emptiness. Every time Xander eased that little rubbery device over her, he made her arch, gasp, burn just a little bit more.</p><p>\u201cIs he?\u201d Logan demanded.</p><p>What was the question? Damn, she couldn\u2019t recall, could only drown in desire.</p><p>\u201cIs he hurting you?\u201d Logan snapped. \u201cI\u2019m not going to ask again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-No.\u201d She was panting now. There was no denying that orgasm was mere seconds away\u2014all the more potent because Logan had demanded that a stranger, his friend, make her body want it.</p><p>Even so, some part of her didn\u2019t want to climax for Xander. Instead, she wanted to beg Logan to touch her and drive her to ecstasy in his arms. It made no sense to want the conniving bastard, but the thought pushed her even closer to the edge. God, just another second . . .</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Logan demanded.</p><p>Instantly, Xander lifted the device from her clit, then settled two stationary fingers over her plush, sensitive flesh. She shuddered, mewled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard and shuddering,\u201d Xander said as if that excited the hell out of him.</p> <p>Then his warm touch left her. The slide of leather told her that he\u2019d stepped back.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Logan sounded vastly pleased.</p><p>Later, she\u2019d want to die of shame and clobber him, but now she ached too much. What sort of game was he playing? Trying to prove that he controlled her orgasm, and therefore, controlled her? The whole thing was so caveman . . . but knowing that she was helpless for him, that he would only give her pleasure when he deemed it, made her dangerously excited.</p><p>\u201cNo more.\u201d She shook her head from side to side.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just getting started,\u201d Logan vowed.</p><p>Xander\u2014funny how she could already tell them apart\u2014laughed in amusement.</p><p>The pair of them stepped away from the bed, their low voices unintelligible. Her body protested, clamoring for another touch, a bit more friction. Instead, a squeak, a whoosh, from her left. They\u2019d opened the door to the cabinet in the corner again. What the hell else did Logan keep in there?</p><p>Tara feared that she was about to find out.</p><p>Moments later, Xander stepped close again. She could tell from his scent. He leaned in, brushed his lips against the skin between her shoulder and the swell of her breast. She gasped. It didn\u2019t feel either good or bad, but rather shocked her with sensation.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a rustle of cloth, a thump, then Xander let loose a long-suffering sigh. Tara had no idea what to make of that. But she felt Xander approach again and braced herself. She could almost feel Logan watching intently.</p><p>This time, something cool and rubbery traced the wet, swollen lips of her pussy, coating it with her cream. Then Xander slipped it inside her. Plastic also touched her clit. Tara held her breath, not sure what to expect.</p><p>Her friends all talked about sex toys being a single girl\u2019s best friend. Tara had never invested in any. Now she was paying the price because she had no idea what this thing was or what Xander planned to do.</p><p>She held her breath.</p><p>There was a little click, a nudge of the slippery gadget deeper into her. Then the torturous pleasure began. The little bit of plastic nestled against her clit began to vibrate, working the already stimulated bundle. Worse, this toy feathered across a sensitive spot inside the clasp of her pussy, and the second she felt that startling pleasure, she clamped down and cried out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Xander encouraged. \u201cOh, she likes having her G-spot stimulated. This is going to be fun.\u201d</p><p>His voice rang with a naughty glee that made Tara both want more and fear more.</p><p>\u201cStick to the plan.\u201d Logan sounded like he was gritting his teeth.</p><p>What plan?</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Xander sounded glum.</p><p>He began to rock the toy against all her most sensitive spots, a gentle back and forth that hyperfocused her pleasure until she gasped and arched and cried out. Helplessly, Tara clenched her fists, her body bowing as the need for orgasm stacked up into unrelieved torture. She bit her lip, trying desperately to keep herself together. Logan had forced Xander to stop last time her mewl had given her imminent orgasm away. Maybe if she stayed mute, he wouldn\u2019t notice until it was too late.</p><p>The sensations crept up, wrenching, tightening, pounding through her. Her heart raced. She couldn\u2019t keep the muscles of her shoulders, thighs, and butt from tensing. Almost there . . .</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Logan demanded.</p><p>Xander snapped off the device.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be sneaking in an orgasm, Cherry. I ought to spank you for trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d The plea was out of her mouth before she could stop it.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m doing, exactly?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>Xander pulled the toy from the clinging depths of her body. In its place, his fingers slid through the slippery flesh between her legs, hovering near her clit, rubbing all around it, but never over it, never giving her enough stimulation to do anything but make her aware that they held her body\u2014and her pleasure\u2014in their hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re keeping me on edge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. It\u2019s a facet of edge play. I could do this all day, baby. How about you?\u201d</p><p>Oh God, he was going to leave her like this, a pleading mass of nerves and need until she begged. \u201cBastard! You\u2019re punishing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor walking out on me without permission or a single god damn word, maybe.\u201d</p><p>And maybe she ought to be asking herself why she responded to this. Yes, Xander was exciting her body through the clever use of toys, but that wasn\u2019t what aroused her half as much as knowing that Logan controlled her pleasure. Tara sensed that, as her desire grew frantic, his also rose to a fever pitch. That flipped her switch. What the hell did it mean?</p><p>After setting the toy down with a soft tap on the bedside table, Xander again walked away. This time, Logan stayed rooted in place. Tara felt his stare burn all over her. Her skin flared with heat, her breasts tightened, her clit tingled. God, with him looking at her, desiring her, she wasn\u2019t coming off this arousal high.</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d she insisted. \u201cSomeone else is going to touch me. I\u2019ve proven that I\u2019m not a shrinking violet since Xander put his hand between my legs and I didn\u2019t flinch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the only purpose. A well-trained sub holds her orgasm until she\u2019s given permission to release it, when it will please her Master most. Yesterday, you screamed and pleaded and came almost the moment I put my mouth on your pussy.\u201d</p><p>She flushed. \u201cThanks for sharing that with Xander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivacy and modesty don\u2019t belong in a BDSM club. Some Doms won\u2019t tolerate you coming without permission. If you want to save Agent Miles and do this job properly, start focusing and stop worrying about what you can\u2019t control. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>Again, Logan reminded her to closet the anger she felt toward him and focused her on her purpose. She\u2019d promised to let go and she needed to live up to her end of the bargain.</p><p>\u201cYes, Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl. Xander?\u201d</p><p>Instantly, Tara tensed. Round three; here it came. With her blindfold on, she had no idea what to expect. She shivered in both fear and anticipation, focusing on getting out of her body and head, and just letting whatever was going to happen, happen.</p><p>A wet tongue rolled over her taut nipple. Xander\u2019s. The little point tightened even more. Tara breathed through the sensation, then again when he took the whole nipple in the heat of his mouth and sucked until she gasped, fists clenched.</p><p>Slowly, Xander released the hard point, only to repeat the process with the other nipple while twisting the other between a firm thumb and forefinger.</p><p>Against her will, her back arched in a silent plea for more.</p><p>A second later, he lifted away. Before she could process her disappointment and thrill that Logan was still watching intently, she felt twin shots of pain, one wrenching each of her nipples.</p><p>Tara gasped. \u201cOh God. I don\u2019t . . . I can\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreathe through the pain,\u201d Logan demanded. \u201cYou can take it.\u201d</p><p>Was he insane? \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying your safe word?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t take the easy way out. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen take the pain. For me.\u201d</p><p>God, for some twisted reason, those words melted her. She felt helpless in a way she never had. She could do nothing but accept what he chose to give her. And for some damn reason, she didn\u2019t want to let him down.</p><p>Since she couldn\u2019t change it, she let in the pain. Slowly, the bite rolled through her system, settling into a smooth throb. The hurt lashed her pussy with a direct jolt of fire. She cried out.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRephrase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Logan! Please . . .\u201d</p><p>A hand drifted over her stomach, fingers prowling lower until sure fingers slipped through her drenched folds and circled her clit. She knew by the touch and scent that it was Logan.</p><p>\u201cXander,\u201d Logan prompted him, but no other explanation was forthcoming.</p><p>He caressed her breasts, tugging gently on the clamps. Tara bucked, begged. They both petted her, keeping her just shy of climax.</p><p>Tears leaked from her eyes as her body felt like a building storm. So many sensations piled on top of emotions. She couldn\u2019t block them, couldn\u2019t process them, couldn\u2019t do anything but let them pour in.</p><p>Suddenly, Xander removed the clamps. Blood rushed back to her nipples in an uproar of tingles. And Logan\u2019s fingers toyed with her clit again. Tara thrust and wriggled, trying to manipulate more pressure where she needed it.</p><p>Logan stopped instantly, then spanked her pussy lightly with the pads of his fingers. \u201cStop moving. No coming.\u201d</p><p>Tara bit back a curse, nearly out of her mind with need. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreathe, Cherry,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cI\u2019ll start with your submission. We\u2019ll talk about the rest later. Focus on holding back your orgasm.\u201d</p><p>She clenched everything inside her to stop the pending climax. The sensation was so intense, it was like physical pain. She tried to gulp in deep breaths, calm herself. Slowly, it worked.</p><p>Tara unclenched her fists and dug her nails out of her palms. She eased her butt and thighs back to the bed, then forced her shoulders against the silk sheets. Another long exhalation later she hoped\u2014prayed\u2014that she had it under control.</p><p>The rip of Velcro and the easing of her restraints told her that she was free. Xander removed her mask. Together, they rubbed her wrists and ankles.</p><p>After a long minute, Logan edged his way in front of her and took her face in his hands. \u201cYou okay now, Cherry? Breathing and calm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? You\u2019re not going to let me come?\u201d</p><p>With a shake of his head, Logan retrieved the silk robe and tossed at her. As she scrambled into it, he glanced at his watch. She couldn\u2019t miss his tense shoulders and the sizeable erection behind his zipper.</p><p>\u201cTraining isn\u2019t always going to feel good. It\u2019s seventeen hundred. Go home. No masturbating or I\u2019ll know, and your ass will be redder than . . . well, a cherry. I\u2019ll see you bright and early tomorrow.\u201d He shifted his gaze to Xander. \u201cDon\u2019t piss me off.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His exotic friend held up a hand. \u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it. We\u2019ll talk when you\u2019re out of the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucker,\u201d Logan muttered, then hurried toward the door.</p><p>No way was she letting him leave her like this.</p><p>Fuming and aching all over, Tara charged after him and grabbed his granite arm. \u201cWhat the hell kind of power trip is this?\u201d</p> <p>He raised an ominous brow at her. \u201cI explained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard a lot of blah, blah, blah. Haven\u2019t you taken enough from me today? I lost my fianc\u00e9. God knows, you quickly stripped me of dignity. Because of you, I have no privacy. You don\u2019t allow me modesty. You shove everything on me. This is just about you having your sick pleasure, bending me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh.\u201d Xander shook his head at her. \u201cI\u2019d run if I were you.\u201d</p><p>Tara stood her ground, tightening her grip on Logan\u2019s biceps. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere until he explains what the fuck he\u2019s trying to pull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI explained.\u201d Logan enunciated each syllable with quiet bite. \u201cYou heard me. But that\u2019s not what you\u2019re pissed about. You\u2019re angry because I\u2019m withholding this.\u201d</p> <p>Before Tara could even blink, Logan scooped her up in his arms and stalked toward the bed, jaw clenched. Every muscle in his body felt tense. She had a feeling that she\u2019d awakened the sleeping beast.</p><p>Her heart seized up in her chest. \u201cPut me down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t give the orders, Cherry.\u201d With that reminder, Logan plopped down on the bed, then turned her to face him, shoving her legs on either side of her hips. \u201cI do. If you want this, scoot in.\u201d</p><p>She had no idea what he was up to, but the opportunity to be closer to him was a lure she knew she should resist, but couldn\u2019t. Bracing her hands on his shoulders, she moved her hips closer until her wet folds were nestled against the hard ridge of his cock.</p><p>\u201cWrap your arms around my neck.\u201d</p><p>Breath coming in pants, she slid her palms over his hard shoulders, then curled her arms around his nape. Their faces were inches apart, and the heat blaring from his eyes blasted her with something that made her stomach tighten, her pussy clench.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s you\u2019re safe word?\u201d he barked.</p><p>\u201cR-Romeo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Either use it or rub that pretty pussy over my cock until you come.\u201d</p><p>Oh God, his actions became crystal clear in a second. He was forcing her to either deny that she wanted him or to use him to pleasure herself. No matter what she did, she was going to lose.</p><p>God damn it, wasn\u2019t that a metaphor for her whole relationship with Logan?</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cChoose, Cherry. You\u2019ve got three seconds.\u201d</p><p>Fury and desire had whipped her into a froth. She wanted him so badly that she hated him. But he\u2019d always been like gravity for her; the pull to him was undeniable and inevitable.</p> <p>Tara slanted her mouth over his and took his lips in a fierce kiss, rocking her aching clit directly over the thick stalk of his cock. She gasped into his mouth as need streamed through her body, lacing her veins. Logan met her tongue with his, fisting one hand in her hair.</p><p>She writhed like a wild thing, panting, straining, needing everything he could give her. And it wasn\u2019t enough yet. Mewling, she clawed at his back, desperate for the orgasm beckoning with frightening intensity just out of reach.</p><p>Suddenly, he ripped away from her kiss. \u201cYou want to come?\u201d</p><p>God, she could barely focus through her haze of need. But those blue eyes were an inescapable lure; she couldn\u2019t look away from the hot demand slowly burning her alive.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she gasped. \u201cPlease, give it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Take it.\u201d His eyes burned into her. \u201cTake it now.\u201d</p><p>As if his words had been precisely what she needed, the wall of sensation flattened her. She screamed, then she couldn\u2019t breathe at all, just feel herself open wide to the pleasure pouring in.</p><p>And her soul pouring out.</p><p>As the deep pulses of her womb subsided, Tara stilled, sucked in a deep breath. Then she looked at Logan, as still as a statue, his face like a time bomb with a short fuse.</p><p>\u201cLogan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I take anything from you? Force anything on you?\u201d</p><p>His questions made her feel small\u2014and forced her to acknowledge the truth. Tears pricked her eyes, but she blinked them back. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you at oh six hundred.\u201d Logan pressed a hard, fast kiss to her lips, then set her down on the silk sheet beside him. She barely had time to notice the wet spot she\u2019d left on the front of his leather pants before he stormed across the room, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>Tara watched Logan go, feeling as if she was watching a part of her walk away. He was angry; it felt painful. The tears returned. What the hell had happened? One minute she\u2019d been furious with him. Then he\u2019d forced her to admit her need, take what she craved\u2014and torn her wide open again.</p><p>Xander laughed, a bemused expression lighting his face.</p><p>Tara belted the robe more tightly around her waist. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny, damn it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him so off balance. That orgasm was for you, you know. The normal Logan would have made a sub suffer to teach her a valuable lesson.\u201d He turned to her, cocking his head. \u201cBut he let you come because he couldn\u2019t stand to leave you hurting. God, you\u2019re . . . perfect for him. I\u2019m laughing because he\u2019s going to the shower to think about you while he masturbates, as usual. But I don\u2019t think that ritual is going to stand much longer.\u201d</p><p>So much of Xander\u2019s speech startled Tara that she almost didn\u2019t know where to start. \u201cYou think that Logan thinks about me when he masturbates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he does. Every day I\u2019ve ever spent with him for the last five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the last\u2014\u201d Impossible.</p><p>She opened her mouth to sputter . . . she wasn\u2019t exactly sure what. Then she closed it. But the myriad of questions kept coming at her. \u201cHow would you know that he thinks about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe admitted it after a few too many shots of tequila. We\u2019ve talked about it. I\u2019ve even had the misfortune to walk into the bathroom and see it.\u201d Xander sent her a quizzical expression. \u201cHave you seen his tattoos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I saw the Japanese on his ribs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t read it,\u201d Xander stated, quirking a dark brow.</p><p>\u201cHe told me it says \u2018never quit.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s a fucking liar. Have you gotten a close look at him without his leathers?\u201d</p><p>What was Xander trying to tell her? \u201cNo. He hasn\u2019t taken them off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake him. I\u2019ll tell you something straight up: Logan hasn\u2019t had sex with a woman as long as I\u2019ve known him.\u201d</p><p>Tara\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cNo way. He spends a lot of time here and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he\u2019s on leave, yeah. He spanks the subs, works them up, makes them come. He never kisses them. And he definitely never fucks them. When he wants that done, he calls me.\u201d</p><p>Shock pinged through Tara\u2019s system. \u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk anyone here at Dominion.\u201d Xander sidled closer, dropped his voice. \u201cLook, he\u2019s my friend, and I\u2019ve been worried as hell about him for a long time. His behavior isn\u2019t normal. For a Dom, he\u2019s an awful lot like a monk.\u201d</p><p>It still wasn\u2019t adding up for her. She understood Xander\u2019s implication that Logan was hung up on her, but how was that possible? Logan had broken it off with her. Why would he be hung up on a relationship he\u2019d ended so brutally? \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Why tell me this?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve pushed the door open a bit. Now you have to choose to walk through it. Or not.\u201d</p><p>After everything that had happened today, she couldn\u2019t take more mind games. \u201cLogan left me. He crushed me and walked away without a backward glance when we were sophomores in high school. I make him feel guilty, but he doesn\u2019t actually care.\u201d</p><p>Xander shook his head. \u201cFor him, the sun rises and sets on you. If you decide to seek the truth, once you see and understand all of his tattoos, maybe you\u2019ll believe me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Nearby motel\u2014Friday night</p><p>HAIR wet from her recent shower, Tara combed her tresses with one hand and rifled through her suitcase absently with the other. She grabbed a cotton floral nightie from inside, stared at the duffel bag by her feet, then frowned. In the year she\u2019d been living with Brad, this was all she had come away with? She\u2019d walked in with the clothes on her back and walked out with the same. Everything in the house had been his when they\u2019d moved in together. She\u2019d never bought a stick of furniture with him. Hell, not even a toaster.</p><p>What did that say about their relationship? Had she unconsciously known that it wouldn\u2019t last?</p><p>Tara swallowed as she flipped the lid of the suitcase closed and shoved on her pajamas. She poured more wine into one of the hotel\u2019s cheap plastic cups and grimaced. By far, she preferred tequila for a good, rousing drunk, but being in a part of town that only allowed beer and wine sales, she\u2019d had to make do. After half the bottle, however, she couldn\u2019t say that she felt any better.</p><p>Not that she felt bad exactly, just somewhat numb. And that was the problem. On a day she\u2019d come twice for a man she had refused to miss in years and the case she worked on being complicated by a dead body, not to mention the fact that she\u2019d lost her fianc\u00e9, she should feel something. But Tara wondered now if she\u2019d been truly feeling for years.</p><p>Everything came back to Logan. Somehow, over the miles and years, he\u2019d continued his hold on her without a single touch. Now suddenly, he was back in her life. In fact, he was the center of her world this week. Could she make it to the next without losing her heart again?</p><p>She wanted to talk to Logan, ached to ask him questions. But that wasn\u2019t smart. What if the truth made her want him more? If she embraced him now, how broken would she be if he walked away again? After everything he\u2019d taken from her today, and, damn him, given her, she wasn\u2019t ready for any sort of soul baring. Tears lurked under the surface of her haze; she could feel them. Just like her adolescent self, she couldn\u2019t seem to hold anything back from him. Logan was her downfall, probably always would be.</p><p>Tara downed the rest of the wine in her cup. Damn, she wished this stuff would work faster.</p><p>A boom blasted through her room, startling her. Someone was pounding on her door.</p><p>No one knew she was here, not even Adam. Her stepfather would not be pleased with today\u2019s developments. He thought Brad was perfect, and Logan was Satan\u2019s spawn, so she\u2019d bailed on dinner with her stepfather tonight, not having the energy to explain herself and defend her actions. So who the hell wanted in her room at nearly ten p.m.?</p><p>She tiptoed to the door and peeked out the hole. Logan, wearing all black and carrying a grocery sack packed full. For a moment, she debated not opening the door, but he already knew she was inside. He wasn\u2019t going to go away.</p><p>With a sigh, Tara pulled the door open, then leaned against it. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Dom; it\u2019s my job to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>That was the last damn thing she wanted to hear. \u201cOnly when we\u2019re working. Otherwise, I can take care of myself. You\u2019ve already been up in my face for most of the day. I don\u2019t need you here tonight, too, ordering me around and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to tell you what to do, Cherry.\u201d He gripped the bag tighter. \u201cI just came to bring you a few things, see what else you needed.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, he held out the bag to her. Curiosity got the better of her, and she grabbed it. A peek inside revealed some bottled water, toothbrush and toothpaste, dental floss, shampoo, and a comb.</p><p>She looked at him with a questioning gaze, and he shrugged. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d been able to get anything from Brad\u2019s house, and I didn\u2019t like the thought of you shopping at night by yourself, especially around here.\u201d</p><p>Against her better judgment she was touched. \u201cI managed to get all my things from his house, but thank you. Come in.\u201d</p><p>As she stepped back, he edged inside, looking around at the rundown dump. He scowled. \u201cThis is . . . No, Cherry, come stay with me. I promise, I won\u2019t touch you if you don\u2019t want me to, but you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill be fine.\u201d Tara marveled that he seemed genuinely concerned as she set the grocery bag on a nearby Formica table. \u201cI know it\u2019s not the Ritz, but Misty said the place was reputable enough. I\u2019ve got lots of locks on the doors and bolts on the windows. No one is getting in here to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Logan blew out a deep breath, clearly pensive. \u201cThis is another reason I wish I was your Dom. I could just tell you to come with me so I could sleep beside your warm body peacefully, knowing that you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Another reason? \u201cI am an FBI agent, you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019re also a beautiful woman in a world with a lot of predators.\u201d</p><p>She softened again. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And smart and capable. This visit was for my peace of mind. Thanks for humoring me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really different away from the club.\u201d</p> <p>Logan shrugged, his smile self-deprecating. \u201cI\u2019m not a twenty-four /seven kind of Dom. In the club, subs better not fuck with me or there\u2019s going to be punishment. Outside the club? I\u2019m just a guy, with other concerns and thoughts . . . and regrets.\u201d</p><p>He was going to get personal, and a part of her didn\u2019t want to stop him.</p><p>Her hand shook as she poured herself another glass of wine, then held up the bottle. \u201cDrink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I won\u2019t overstay my welcome.\u201d Logan turned for the door.</p><p>Tara didn\u2019t examine the feeling, but she knew that she wasn\u2019t ready to see him go. \u201cLogan?\u201d</p> <p>He turned. \u201cYou need something, baby?\u201d</p><p>Before she could talk herself out of it, she nodded. \u201cAnswers.\u201d</p><p>She settled herself on the edge of the bed, then watched as he folded his big form into an ugly green plastic chair with sleek economy of movement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wide open.\u201d</p><p>God, where the hell should she begin? It had been an eventful day by any standards, but the information Xander had dumped on her late this evening gnawed at her brain. How much of what he\u2019d said was true?</p><p>\u201cWhat does the tattoo on your ribs really say? I know what you told me but . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not important.\u201d He dipped his head, looked away. \u201cWhat happened in high school is. Don\u2019t you want to know about that?\u201d</p><p>In the past twelve years, she\u2019d sworn that she had gotten over Logan. Now she knew she\u2019d been fooling herself. Brad had accused her of giving him up for Logan. He\u2019d been right. Logan had reminded her what it was like to truly feel and want and hurt again. The avalanche of emotion had smacked her hard. Had she, maybe, not built much of a life with Brad because she\u2019d been subconsciously waiting for her withered relationship with Logan to blossom to life again?</p><p>It sounded absurd on the surface\u2014but Tara couldn\u2019t deny that his pull still lured her in like no man ever had.</p><p>Eventually, she\u2019d have to listen to his explanation, but she wanted this conversation on her terms. \u201cDo you have other tattoos?\u201d</p><p>He pinned her with a cautious look. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m in the navy, and I\u2019ve been drunk overseas more than once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou regret them?\u201d</p><p>His somber stare wiped away any levity. \u201cNo. Cherry, ask me about our breakup.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d promised that he wouldn\u2019t explain until she asked him, and he was trying to live up to his word. Tara bit her lip. What if there was some explanation for everything? What if it was something that made her want to forgive him? After the magnitude of his betrayal years ago, did she want to? She was damn sure that it would be easier\u2014and safer to her heart\u2014to go on being angry with him.</p> <p>But maybe, a voice whispered in her head, it was no longer realistic.</p><p>\u201cIs it true that you haven\u2019t had sex in the last five years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod damn Xander,\u201d Logan cursed, closing his eyes. \u201cWhat didn\u2019t he tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf what he said is true, he didn\u2019t hold much back.\u201d</p><p>He rose, paced, stared out the window into the shabby parking lot. A moment later, he seemed to come to some decision and turned back to her. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s true. Even before then, sex had become . . . infrequent.\u201d</p><p>When Xander had spilled this secret, Tara had been sure the guy was insane. To hear Logan fess up to this absolutely blew her mind. \u201cWhy? In high school, you loved sex. If those rumors were true, you had a lot of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what you heard back then, but yeah. I took advantage of the fact that I was the J.V. quarterback and the tallest guy in my class. I figured out quick that if you could make a girl feel special for a moment, then it wasn\u2019t too hard to get her horizontal.\u201d</p><p>Tara grimaced. \u201cGod, you sound like a pig.\u201d</p><p>Logan shrugged, the black T-shirt lovingly hugging his wide shoulders and muscled chest. \u201cI was sixteen. I\u2019m sure I was a pig. Then came you.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cIt was a long time ago, and I don\u2019t think for one minute that I had any lasting effect on you. You fell right back into bed with Brittany Fuller a few hours after we broke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was drunk, and I was angry.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cAfterward, I felt really empty. When she left . . . I cried.\u201d</p><p>She reared back, looking up into his taut face. She\u2019d expected to see him laugh, but Logan was dead serious. Shock pinged through her body.</p><p>\u201cThe pattern sort of repeated itself a lot for the next few years. I\u2019d meet a random girl, pick her up hoping she could bring me out of my funk. At first, I\u2019d realize how lousy I felt after the sex. Then the feeling began to hit me in the middle. I got a lot of girls off, then sent them on their way, leaving them to wonder why I hadn\u2019t finished fucking them.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cMasturbating was easier, less emotional.</p><p>\u201cThen I found BDSM and met Mitchell Thorpe. A whole new avenue opened to me. I suddenly controlled everything. The females didn\u2019t expect sex. And I realized that I could absorb a sub\u2019s sexual energy and use it to propel me to my next self-induced orgasm. It worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan . . .\u201d God, such a damaged life broke her heart. Because of her? Really? Tara didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>He stepped closer and wrapped a hand around her nape, his hot touch searing her skin. \u201cIt worked until I saw you again. I never got over you. A week ago, I couldn\u2019t find a woman on the planet who could tempt me to want to have sex with her. One look at you\u2014even before I knew it was you\u2014and my first thought was of getting deep inside you and never leaving.\u201d He trailed his thumb down her cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s what I think every time I look at you, Cherry.\u201d</p><p>A whole new wave of shock reverberated through her body. The girl who had once loved him wanted to leap up, wrap her arms around him, and offer him whatever he needed to feel whole. The woman she\u2019d become after he\u2019d burned her wasn\u2019t sure how to believe him. He\u2019d said that he loved her the day he took her virginity. Barely twenty-four hours later, he\u2019d broken her heart and taken another girl to bed.</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t together long enough for you to get that hung up on me, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we were.\u201d He closed his eyes. \u201cAnd I think I left scars on you, too. Cherry, please, ask me why I broke up with you.\u201d</p><p>Tara trembled. The million-dollar question. If she asked it, she feared that everything would change, that the answer could throw her into a tailspin all over again. Being able to open up physically and emotionally to Brad had been a real step up for her. In college, she\u2019d only managed drunk sex. Sober, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to let anyone touch her. But she\u2019d broken through with Brad.</p><p>And now he was gone.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t get the answer to this question, would she remain in limbo, hung up on Logan forever? Maybe they both needed this to cleanse themselves of the past and move on.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean that she wasn\u2019t scared as hell to hear the answer.</p><p>\u201cA-All right, Logan. Tell me.\u201d Her voice broke up as tears welled. She was fucking terrified. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He leaped on the bed, pushing her flat on her back and covering her body with his own. He pressed their foreheads together and drew in a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cLogan . . .\u201d He was so close, felt so good, that she couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cTara, I had to protect you. The sick fuck who\u2019d killed my mother sent me more than one note threatening to kill you if I didn\u2019t walk away. Then when you showed up at school late that day with a broken arm . . .\u201d Logan told the entire story, the words halting at first, as though recounting all this hurt him, but Tara could feel his will and his anguish as he explained.</p><p>When he was done, she blinked and tears filled her eyes. If he\u2019d told her this story earlier, she would have tossed it back in his face angrily and called him a liar. She would have assumed it was some sob tale he\u2019d spent years inventing, designed to dupe her into dropping her panties so he could get her into bed again. Now, looking at the torment tightening his face, she couldn\u2019t doubt that this was the truth as he knew it.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell the police? Or tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no way I was going to risk you any further. You were beyond precious to me.\u201d He cupped her cheek. \u201cI would have done anything to keep you safe, and at sixteen, I couldn\u2019t think of another way. Please understand.\u201d</p><p>Oddly, given the circumstances and their age, she did. And she was both touched and crushed by his words. All the time they\u2019d never had together, all the things they\u2019d never had the opportunity to do . . . The relationship may not have been one to last happily ever after. But how much pain would they have never experienced if it hadn\u2019t been for that note on his pillow and the relationship had come to its natural conclusion?</p><p>\u201cYour mom was such a nice lady. I\u2019m sorry. And the police never caught her killer?\u201d</p><p>Logan shook his head with deep regret. \u201cIt\u2019s in cold-case status now. A new detective tried to tackle it about four years ago. He called my dad and me, checked with some of Mom\u2019s old neighbors, asked questions of the people she once worked for. Nothing. One of her neighbors said she thought she saw a man entering her apartment that afternoon, but she was elderly and a bit senile. My mother never mentioned a boyfriend, not to me, to her neighbors, or her coworkers. There were no prints at the scene, no DNA left behind. This psycho randomly chose my mother. The police have no record of any similar case, either.\u201d He squeezed his eyes shut and pain crawled all over his face. \u201cI am never going to forget what it was like to drive to her house, so excited to tell her about us, then find her so still. Dead.\u201d</p><p>Her heart went out to Logan. It was a lot to deal with at sixteen. He\u2019d been reeling, grief-stricken. A note like the one he\u2019d received from the killer warning him away from her would have both scared and confused him. Tara couldn\u2019t blame him for the decisions he\u2019d made then.</p><p>\u201cCherry, if I\u2019d had my way, we would have stayed together, gone to prom as a couple, graduated hand-in-hand.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBuilt a life together.\u201d</p><p>A part of her really wanted to believe that, but after everything that had happened, she couldn\u2019t imagine that alternate universe. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever try to tell me all this after your mom\u2019s case cooled down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you changed your cell, I only had your stepfather\u2019s home number.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d always made Adam answer the phone and tell him off. \u201cYou could have come to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried. Remember a couple of Christmases ago? You slammed the door in my face.\u201d</p><p>She had. And now she regretted it like hell. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know the paths our lives would have taken if things had been different. I may be training to be a submissive. I may even have submissive tendencies. I don\u2019t know that I could live this life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could, baby, under the right circumstances. It doesn\u2019t have to be in a club, if you don\u2019t like that setting. I just want to be with you. I\u2019d vow to be the most loving Dom ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that kind of an oxymoron? What, you\u2019d boss me around in a tender way?\u201d She raised a disbelieving brow.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Say the word, Cherry, and I\u2019ll show you exactly what I mean.\u201d</p><p>His words, along with his body heat settling under her skin, made her tremble. \u201cI just lost a fianc\u00e9 today, and there\u2019s been too much water under the bridge. Maybe . . . your hang-up isn\u2019t about me in particular. Is there another incident\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what happened. I know what\u2019s in my heart,\u201d he growled each word fiercely, fisting the cheap bedspread beneath her. \u201cIt was you. It\u2019s always been you.\u201d</p><p>Those words sounded so romantic, and the female in her really, really wanted to believe them. But they almost didn\u2019t compute. Yes, she\u2019d pined for Logan, but him for her?</p><p>Oh, God. Her next confession was going to open her up wide, but he\u2019d been so painfully honest, how could she be anything less? \u201cI saw a therapist shortly after college. I went to him for a good two years. He suggested that my hang-up about you stemmed from the fact that our break was really sudden. He suggested that I simply needed closure. Maybe that\u2019s what you need, too. Maybe we just needed to talk it all out and know the score\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I know what I need, what I\u2019ve always needed.\u201d Logan wriggled his hips between the slight spread of her thighs, forcing them wider, until his cock settled right against her pussy. \u201cCherry, I need you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then he rocked against her, igniting her body with sensation to match all the emotions swirling inside her. Tara closed her eyes. God, it would be so easy to give in. He wanted her. Between her tears and her loathing, she\u2019d fantasized more than once about what it would be like for Logan to make love to her again. Never in her wildest fantasies had she imagined that she\u2019d actually have this opportunity again.</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cLogan, really, maybe you\u2019re mistaking some old emotion or the need for closure for actual love. Someday, you will fall in love with the right person and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019ve never been in love? Baby, I never fell out of love with you.\u201d</p><p>Tara\u2019s heart lurched in her chest. And something that felt way too much like joy raced through her veins like a heady drug. She had to take a deep breath and stop herself. Everything on his face underscored his honesty\u2014at least as he believed it. But how could he know for certain? If what he said was true, he\u2019d never really been in another relationship, so it was possible he\u2019d fixated on her because she was the last girl he\u2019d tried to love. There was too much behind them, and even if she put the BDSM thing aside, their lives were going in opposite directions. She might have a mountain of feelings for Logan, but being with him so soon after getting out of a relationship with Brad . . . Frying pan, meet fire.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t immune to his pain. If he was stuck here, then perhaps she could help him out. Maybe it would be good for both of them to get the closure they\u2019d never had.</p><p>\u201cKiss me, Logan.\u201d When his entire body tensed, she added, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I start, Cherry, I won\u2019t be able to stop.\u201d He caressed a gentle hand down her hair, over her shoulder, brushing the side of her breast to settle at her waist.</p><p>\u201cYou sure? It\u2019s been five years . . .\u201d Would he still be able to? Would he feel empty afterward, as he did with the others?</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m dying to prove that, with you, everything will work just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen kiss me,\u201d Tara repeated.</p><p>She\u2019d worry about tomorrow when tomorrow came. Tonight, she\u2019d be with him, try to heal his pain, scar over her own. He\u2019d done an incredibly selfless thing to protect her all those years ago. She might wish that he\u2019d told her what was going on. But at the end of the day, he\u2019d been young and he\u2019d done what he thought would be best for her, shattering his own heart in the process.</p><p>Clearly, he cared about her. But unending love?</p><p>They were going to be together until she went undercover. Maybe it would be best, for both of them, to spend the rest of the week together, training hard by day, working through their issues by night. Maybe by the end of the week, both of them would be ready to move on with their lives, sane, happy, and whole.</p><p>\u201cCherry, baby . . .\u201d he breathed out, then settled his mouth over hers.</p><p>The kiss was soft as a rose petal. He clearly leashed himself, sinking into her mouth slowly, as if worried that he would scare her.</p><p>When his tongue brushed her bottom lip, then curled into her mouth, Tara opened to him. There was no place she\u2019d rather be than here tonight with Logan. Maybe they weren\u2019t meant to be together forever, but every time he touched her she felt some inexorable bond with him, an invisible line that ran between them over the years, unchanged, unbroken.</p><p>Logan moaned, then nudged the little spaghetti strap of her nightie down her shoulder, then shoved the garment under her breast. The cool air hit her nipple, and it puckered. He covered the little bud with his hand, pinched it with his fingers. Then he looked down at her with burning blue eyes, already panting.</p><p>\u201cTake it off for me.\u201d</p><p>That was his Dom voice. She couldn\u2019t fail to recognize the lower, silkier tone. Her pussy clenched. She nodded.</p><p>He eased off of her, still hovering above her. He gave her just enough room to pull the garment up her body and over her head. She used it to shield herself.</p><p>Logan\u2019s stare raked her body. Around the edges of the little nightie, he could surely see that she hadn\u2019t been wearing any panties. \u201cFuck, Cherry. I can\u2019t wait to get inside you, baby. Hand the nightgown to me.\u201d</p><p>Those hushed words, his low command, made her insides flip, then melt. Of the lovers she ever had, none had ever made her feel as beautiful and desired as Logan.</p><p>Tara was shocked to feel a blush creeping up her skin as she handed the little cotton garment to him. \u201cCan we kill the lights?\u201d</p> <p>Logan shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy seeing your every expression while I\u2019m deep inside you.\u201d</p><p>As her belly dipped in reaction, he flung her nightgown to the other side of the room. Despite the anticipation charging through her system, she laughed.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he defended, \u201cif I had my way, I\u2019d burn it. As it is, I\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t need that for the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>Her belly quivered. \u201cKiss me, Logan. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he promised, before dropping his hand to her hair, tucking his fingers beneath her head, and bringing her close.</p><p>This time, his mouth settled over hers firmly. He didn\u2019t merely seduce her with his kiss; he took charge, nudging her lips apart with his own, tasting her deep inside, an endless tangle of lips and tongues that had her breathless and clinging. She wrapped her arms around his sizeable shoulders, fingers grasping into the hard flesh of his back as he moved between her thighs and began working his way down her body.</p><p>His lips caressed her everywhere. She shivered as they drifted down her neck, to the sensitive little spot where it joined with her shoulder. Those same sure lips pressed tender kisses across her collarbone as his palm cradled her breast in his hand. Languid honey rolled through her blood, and yet, every sense felt attuned to him. Even her skin seemed to strain closer to him.</p><p>\u201cI fantasized about this a lot,\u201d he whispered against her skin. \u201cFrom the day I met you, I used to think about getting you alone and naked for uninterrupted hours, exploring every part of your body over and over.\u201d</p><p>His words alone made her shiver, but when he closed his lips over the hard bud of her nipple, she cried out and arched toward him. Instantly, he wrapped an arm under her back to support her\u2014and keep her there.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019ve been drunk or just really damn lonely, I\u2019d let myself think of you. You don\u2019t know how fucking often I\u2019d roll over in bed and wish you were there.\u201d</p><p>The sincerity pouring off of Logan made her want to cry. \u201cI thought of you, too. When I realized I was doing it, I\u2019d try to force myself to stop. But sometimes, I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019d remember the way you made me feel, like a woman, like . . . someone special. No one else has ever made me feel that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCherry, you are special. I\u2019m never going to let you forget it.\u201d</p><p>Tears stung her eyes, and she slammed them shut. If he kept talking like that, they wouldn\u2019t get closure; she wouldn\u2019t want it. She\u2019d want nothing more than to cling to Logan and pretend the last twelve years had never happened. She\u2019d want to pretend they could have a fairy-tale ending.</p><p>That would most likely lead to another broken heart.</p><p>Tara forced out a saucy grin. \u201cShut up and take your clothes off.\u201d</p><p>He paused, then smiled down at her. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully demanding tonight, baby. If you\u2019re not careful, that\u2019s going to cost you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, but excitement raced through her veins, pulsed between her legs. She would never have considered herself a glutton for punishment, but the way Logan dished out pain, it felt awfully sweet going down.</p><p>But he did as she asked, and shrugged off his tight black T-shirt. Every time she saw him exposed, she wanted to swallow her tongue.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what this really means?\u201d She traced the Japanese lettering along his bronzed, muscled torso.</p><p>\u201cHow much of yourself are you going to share with me?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d dangled the answer to her question like a carrot, wiggling it in front of her face as bait, hoping she\u2019d expose all her secrets to him.</p><p>Tara couldn\u2019t lie and say that she wasn\u2019t disappointed\u2014or terrified.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cIf you can\u2019t share everything with me tonight, Cherry, I understand. It\u2019s been a long time for us, and Brad . . . I know it just ended. All I\u2019m asking is that you share as much of yourself with me tonight as you can.\u201d</p><p>He acted as if this was meaningful, almost momentous, not merely closure. Tara swallowed. Eventually he\u2019d see that, while there was something wonderful between them, it wasn\u2019t a forever kind of thing.</p><p>Was it?</p><p>She gnawed on her lip. \u201cIs there anything else you won\u2019t share with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to give you everything you\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><p>That made her swallow against a new tide of desire. According to Xander, Logan had shared next to nothing of himself with anyone in years. The fact that he felt differently about her warmed something dangerous in her chest. She shouldn\u2019t be more to him than the means to heal a wound. But she couldn\u2019t deny that part of her wanted more.</p><p>Without another word, he stood and unfastened his jeans, then slid them down his hips, taking his boxer briefs with them. Slim hips, jutting hipbones and a dark cluster of pubic hair revealed themselves before his cock sprung free. She blinked.</p><p>Tara hadn\u2019t looked at him when he\u2019d taken her virginity. At sixteen, she\u2019d been too embarrassed. The moment between them then had been tender, but now she knew why it had hurt so damn bad initially. He was long and incredibly thick and very hard. His stalk stood straight up, its head flaring bluish and wide and fascinating. He had, by far, the biggest cock she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Unconsciously, she licked her lips nervously.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cBaby, don\u2019t tease me like that. You\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, she understood\u2014and wanted the opportunity to drive him mad. Since she\u2019d walked into his dungeon, he\u2019d had more than one chance to dish out the sensual torture. This could be hers, and she wanted it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not teasing,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cShit, Cherry.\u201d He drew in a shuddering breath and stepped closer, wrapping his hands around her head. \u201cThis has been one of the most potent fantasies I\u2019ve had for years. Suck me.\u201d</p><p>When he drew her down to his turgid cock, she opened her mouth, conscious that he watched her every move with unblinking eyes. She could feel his rapt attention all through her body. Excitement settled right beneath her clit.</p><p>She licked the head once experimentally. Salty, musky, earthy. All man. She shivered as his flavor flared through her, addictive on her tongue. So she lapped at him again.</p><p>His hands tightened on her head and he hissed in a breath. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to kill me.\u201d</p><p>No, but she couldn\u2019t lift her mouth from his thick stalk to tell him so. Instead, she closed her lips over the bulbous tip and shook her head, humming a little denial. His hips jerked, his body bucked.</p><p>\u201cDeeper, Cherry.\u201d</p><p>She sank lower on his cock, her lips skimming as much of the velvety flesh as she could. There was no way she could take him in completely, so she settled for lapping her tongue around him on her way back up, tasting the head again in a series of little licks, then cradling him as she worked back down. He jerked once more, his body tightening as she braced her hands on his hard thighs. God, he was like a rock everywhere, and while that was sexy, what got to her more was how much she aroused him. The fisting of his hands in her hair and the little curses he couldn\u2019t hold in spurred her on to take him deeper again and again, until he pushed at the back of her throat.</p><p>Tara\u2019s mouth felt overfull. Suddenly, she felt as if she couldn\u2019t breathe. She panicked and tried to shove him back. Logan held firm.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, baby. You\u2019re not choking. I\u2019ll stay as still as I can. Breathe through your nose. It\u2019s okay.\u201d She heard his words, but they didn\u2019t compute until he added, \u201cI won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t; she knew that without hesitation. With that thought foremost in her mind, Tara focused on breathing through her nostrils. Relief hit her. She swallowed, and the back of her throat pushed against the swollen head of his dick.</p><p>Logan cursed again. \u201cJesus. I\u2019m trying really hard to go easy on you, but damn . . .\u201d</p><p>Her inexperience was showing. She\u2019d given a few drunken blow jobs in college and been criticized for her technique once. Brad had never seemed that enthusiastic when she\u2019d gone down on him. Maybe she sucked, and not in the good way.</p><p>Tara backed away, and his wet cock slipped from her mouth. \u201cSorry if it\u2019s not working for you. I don\u2019t do this a lot.\u201d</p><p>That made him grin from ear to ear. \u201cCherry, you were doing wonderful, but it does my heart good to know I\u2019m one of the few who\u2019ve been in your mouth.\u201d He tapped her cheek. \u201cOpen up, tongue out.\u201d</p><p>Automatically, she complied, and something inside her heated at his gentle command. Logan took himself in hand and eased his hard flesh back onto her tongue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t move yet,\u201d he advised. \u201cI want to watch this.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, he slid his cock against her tongue, from the large, salty head leaking fluid, past the ridge, down the entire silky length, until he was pressing back against her throat again.</p><p>\u201cNow close your lips around me.\u201d</p><p>Tara didn\u2019t hesitate, and the heat of his flesh in her mouth fit perfectly. She moaned.</p> <p>\u201cGood girl. I want to fuck your mouth. If it\u2019s too much, snap your fingers, okay?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d barely finished nodding before he set a blistering pace as he thrust past her lips. His fingers tangled themselves in her hair again as he groaned and slid over her tongue, to the back of her throat again and again.</p><p>The taste of him suffused her. His scent sank into her pores.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, Cherry. Dear fucking God, you\u2019re going to kill me. Yes, baby! Oh, yeah. Damn . . . I\u2019m not going to last. Now swallow me, every drop.\u201d</p><p>Tara tensed. She\u2019d never actually swallowed. The few times she\u2019d managed to finish the job, she\u2019d always discreetly spit into a nearby cup or sink. But the thought of this intimate act with Logan, pleasing him, she was nervous, but not scared.</p> <p>She sucked harder, pulling against his thrusts to create more friction, running her tongue all up and down his length, nipping at the head with her teeth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m . . . there. Damn.\u201d His fingers tightened in her hair. He pulsed on her tongue. \u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>Warm jets of salty fluid sprayed to the back of her throat, coating her tongue. Feeling the way his body shuddered, hearing his whispered \u201cCherry, baby, yes . . .\u201d filled her with something she couldn\u2019t quite explain. Happiness was too simple, as was pride. It was a deepening connection, a gladness that she\u2019d given him something he desired.</p><p>She softened her suction, lapping at him, bringing him down slowly. He cradled her head at the crown, then caressed her hair, filtering the strands through his hair for a long moment until he pulled free.</p><p>When she looked up to meet his gaze, he wore this dazed, happy expression. Every muscle in his body was relaxed. He was so blindingly handsome when he smiled that the sight of him almost hurt.</p><p>He sighed, then leaned down to kiss the tip of her nose just before he stumbled to the bed and fell flat on his back with a wobbly smile. \u201cThat was . . . awesome. No, incredible.\u201d Logan shifted his body to his side, then propped his head on his hand to look at her. \u201cI needed that.\u201d</p> <p>Warmth suffused her. As broken as he\u2019d been, she was happy to offer him some form of release that hadn\u2019t come from his own hand.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t let the subs at the club do that to you?\u201d</p><p>Logan shook his head. \u201cThe last one who tried spent twenty minutes at it. It wasn\u2019t going to happen, so I let her off the hook. My fault, not hers.\u201d</p><p>Conflicting emotions clashed inside her: pride that she\u2019d succeeded where others had failed, but jealousy that other women had taken him in their mouth. It wasn\u2019t rational or fair. If anything, he had more reason to be jealous. She\u2019d been engaged, had sex in the last five years. Feeling proprietary wasn\u2019t smart. She was supposed to be getting over him, helping him let go. But she supposed it was only natural to feel close to him when his scent and taste still lingered and he laid beside her, watching intently. The right time to say good-bye would hit them both, and they\u2019d be done, whole people ready to face their lives.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring off into space. Did I lose you already?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s just been a momentous day.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cTwo orgasms, a spanking, being fondled by a stranger, and a breakup. If you\u2019re too tired for more, I\u2019d be perfectly happy to get you off with my tongue, then let you go to sleep. Is that what you want, Cherry?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p> <p>WAS Logan suggesting they not make love? Or rather, not have sex. They weren\u2019t in love anymore. Freudian slip. As much as she loved his tongue on her\u2014she coiled tight with desire as she remembered the feel of his mouth pushing her up and over\u2014that wasn\u2019t what Tara wanted. Besides, she didn\u2019t think they\u2019d ever be able to move on again until they\u2019d truly connected.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather have you inside me.\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes darkened. \u201cCome here, baby.\u201d</p><p>Tara eased back on the bed, closer to him.</p><p>\u201cLet me see those pretty nipples.\u201d</p><p>Blushing, she did as he asked, then sucked in a breath when he drew one into his mouth, then pinched the other between this thumb and fingers. Tara gasped as the sensation shot directly to her clit. When his teeth nipped at the sensitive bud, her body jolted with sensation.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs,\u201d he whispered against her breast.</p><p>There was no way she couldn\u2019t obey that. Slowly, intentionally teasing him, she parted her thighs. Logan grunted, growled a warning, then shoved his body between her knees and pried her thighs open wide.</p><p>\u201cI ought to spank you for that.\u201d</p><p>Tara grimaced at the thought.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou sore, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. God, she hated to show anyone her less-than-perfect backside, but especially perfectly yummy Logan. But he\u2019d only push her until she complied. With a sigh, Tara rolled over.</p><p>He hissed out a curse. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I bruised you, Cherry. I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you will. I bruise really easily. It didn\u2019t hurt. Well, not too much.\u201d</p><p>Logan caressed her ass with gentle fingers, then rolled her back to face him, his expression full of concern that melted her more than it should. \u201cIf I ever truly hurt you, I expect you to use your safe word. Understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it. I\u2019m a big girl; I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ve done well, adapted faster than many would, despite the other issues going on in your life now. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>His words shouldn\u2019t mean anything to her. They were just finding a way to get past each other and moving on. But his praise warmed her. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime, I think I can make up for these bruises.\u201d He dragged one finger through her soaking folds. She\u2019d been aware that she was wet, but this was almost embarrassing. \u201cSomeone\u2019s aroused.\u201d</p><p>As she watched his cock rise up hard and tall again, Tara gave him a pointed glance down, then slanted him a saucy smile. \u201cClearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBratty girl. I\u2019ll definitely spank you again.\u201d He lowered himself over her, covering her thighs, belly, and chest, before buying his face in her neck. \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>At the feel of him on top of her, heat raced through her veins like a drug. She clutched him, held him tight. Probably not smart, but Logan\u2019s tenderness was getting to her. Like this, he made everything feel so intimate.</p><p>He inhaled her, drawing in her fragrance. \u201cHmm. Sweet and spicy, like cherry-vanilla. I used to promise myself that I\u2019d lick your skin again if I ever got the chance.\u201d</p><p>And he did, drawing his tongue over her neck, her shoulder, breathing fire all over her. Tara shuddered.</p><p>Then he eased down her body and sucked her nipples into his mouth, one at a time. The little points ached from everything they\u2019d endured today. Brad had always been an ass man, so he\u2019d paid little attention to her breasts. The one time she and Logan had had sex, he\u2019d taken a ravenous interest in her wide pink areolas and hard nipples.</p><p>Every flick of his tongue, every nip of his teeth now only enthralled her more. She writhed under his body, unconsciously spreading her legs wider.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me, Cherry?\u201d He nibbled on the underswell of her breast, then dragged his tongue to the tip before sucking it deep inside, then giving it a dizzying little bite.</p><p>Even if she hadn\u2019t already decided this would be the best way for them both to move on, Tara wouldn\u2019t have been able to resist him. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sweet little plea. You, I\u2019d never even try to resist. I\u2019d fail miserably.\u201d</p><p>She barely managed to smile at his sweet words before his hips slid between her thighs and he settled the head of his cock to her entrance. Tara tensed. It had been over a month since she\u2019d had sex, and Logan was much bigger than Brad. This was going to stretch and burn\u2014in a good way.</p><p>He cradled her cheek, caressing with his thumb. \u201cTake me, Cherry. All of me.\u201d</p><p>Then he pushed into her slowly, inexorably, one torturous inch at a time, no pausing, no waiting, just a slow, relentless entry.</p><p>She wriggled against the slight sting of discomfort, but kept taking him. She wanted to feel him deep and know that, for that moment, he was totally hers. Thrill and pride filled her because he chose to be with her after he\u2019d denied all others for years.</p><p>With that thought, Tara lifted her hips to him, impaling herself on the last of his hard length. She gasped as she stretched wide to accommodate him. God, he seared her. Everywhere inside her, so big, filling her so perfectly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a snug fit, baby.\u201d He threw back his head and groaned. \u201cSo fucking good.\u201d</p><p>Tara felt the sound resonate through her body, seep all the way down to her bones. She hadn\u2019t been this close to Logan Edgington in a dozen years, and in some ways being with him felt so extraordinary. In others, it felt so natural.</p><p>She eased her legs up higher on his hips. He sank down into her until his balls rested against her. The dizzying feelings of his hard cock filling her rivaled her amazement that he was inside her, joined with her, once again. \u201cYou\u2019re really here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Cherry. And I\u2019m going to stay here as long as you\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><p>His low, sensual words made her shiver as he eased back, almost to the point of withdrawal. The friction made her gasp. With anyone other than Logan, the pleasure gleaned during sex had been fleeting, because she\u2019d been making someone else happy more than feeling real ecstasy herself. Now, every nerve in her body pinged with life, every cell attuned to him. Her whole body was strung up, the rest of the world fading away, until only Logan existed as he filled her again, nudging all the way up at the end of her channel.</p><p>\u201cCherry, give me your hands.\u201d</p><p>Her hands? Tara frowned, then realized that she\u2019d dug her nails into his shoulders already. She lifted them away and set her hands on the bed, next to his. \u201cSorry if I hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Those burning blue eyes of his stared down at her, into her soul, and his body began working in deep, rhythmic strokes in and out of her. Tingles drifted like snow flurries through her veins. \u201cI want to touch you everywhere. I need more control.\u201d</p><p>She barely nodded before he took both her wrists and gathered them together in one firm hand, stringing them over her head. He ran his free hand down her body, then under her ass, angling her to take him even deeper. She gasped at the sensation, the burning fullness. He plunged in again, every rhythmic thrust stimulating her swollen clit.</p><p>Under him, she writhed, moaned. \u201cFaster.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t change pace. \u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>With Logan\u2019s entire torso covering her, the crisp hair on his chest rasped against her taut nipples. His so-blue eyes kept her gaze prisoner as he moved inside her again and again, sinking deeper with every thrust, not just into her body, but with his gaze, with his will. Take all of me, it said.</p><p>Tara hoped that being with him would heal him, make him a whole, happy man again\u2014and allow her to move on finally, too. But it wasn\u2019t her concern for him that had her mewling, helpless to the charge and flash of sensations bursting all through her body as she thrashed under him. It was simply Logan and the way he made her feel special. Possessed.</p><p>So she took all of him, every grunted thrust, every wild kiss, every whispered word.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so incredible, Cherry.\u201d He closed his eyes. \u201cNothing has ever felt better. I could stay inside you all night, all day, all eternity, and still want you more.\u201d</p><p>Everything within her responded to him. Together, they strained for more pleasure, two halves of a whole both aching for something desperately that they could only get from the other.</p><p>With her hands pinned immobile by his grip, Tara had no way to exorcise her need to touch him except to lift her head and press her lips to his. Immediately, he took complete possession of her mouth. She melted, opening herself, unfurling, almost as if she could feel her mind, her heart, her very soul welcoming him.</p><p>Oh, God. This was dangerous. And there was no way she could stop.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Cherry.\u201d He swallowed, panted, fused their gazes together. \u201cI.\u201d Thrust. \u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d Thrust. \u201cTake.\u201d Thrust. \u201cAnother.\u201d Thrust. \u201cMinute.\u201d Thrust. \u201cWithout.\u201d Thrust. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>Tara cried out as his words sizzled clear through her. Pleasure spiraled, a hot drizzle of sensation that burned her all the way to her core until she clenched down on him tight, hanging on the edge of the precipice. She writhed, cried out.</p><p>\u201cSay you need this,\u201d he demanded as he slammed into her again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d Tara arched beneath him, willing him deeper still.</p><p>\u201cSay you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, yes!\u201d Never, ever had she experienced this incredible rush to pleasure or felt closer to the man giving it to her. \u201cI need you, please, Logan . . .\u201d</p><p>Incredibly, he hardened even more, his thrusts became piston-fast. He stared down into her eyes as he slid his hand between their bodies and settled his thumb right in her clit. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p> <p>There was no stopping her orgasm. It was a brilliant surge of sensation charging through her system, swelling into something enormous, transcendent. She held her breath as every molecule in her body converged in the center, spreading not just from her pussy, but seizing up her chest until it radiated down every nerve. Even her fingers and toes tingled. The pleasure burst, splintering her into a million pieces as she felt Logan jolt, grip her hands tightly, then shout out his own release, hot and liquid inside her.</p><p>For a long moment, her body pulsed, unable to stop the reactive shaking. Logan released her hands and wrapped his steely arms around her, dragging her against his slowing heartbeat. She threw her arms around his neck and clung. She\u2019d never required someone for her next breath the way she did Logan in that moment. God, she\u2019d been hoping to bring them both closure, but now he felt like a part of her . . . so necessary to her existence.</p><p>No, it was a mirage, her delusion left over from the pleasure. It would fade. It had to.</p><p>\u201cCherry?\u201d he breathed heavily, his gaze fixed on her as he pushed stray tresses from her face. \u201cYou okay, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p> <p>But she wasn\u2019t. Tears lurked under the surface. He\u2019d broken her wide open again, persuaded her to give to him again some deep part of her she scarcely understood. Tara swallowed back the tears.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d Concern spread across his face. \u201cBe honest with me. Let it out.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI just feel . . . raw, Logan. I don\u2019t know what I expected, but . . .\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t to feel as if she\u2019d been turned inside out and ripped in two.</p><p>\u201cIt was everything to me, baby. Whatever you think, know that. Please believe me when I say I want to hold you all night and assure you that I\u2019m going to be here for you as long as you\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><p>Tara\u2019s sigh trembled, and Logan frowned. She tried to send him a reassuring smile. The truth was, she was utterly overwrought. It had been na\u00efve of her to think that either of them would get over a dozen years of pining in one night. Maybe their sex had been explosive because it had been so long and they\u2019d needed each other so desperately. Maybe if she just . . . gave herself over to whatever it was they had for the next week, this thing would burn itself out and they could go on with their lives.</p> <p>Maybe.</p><p>\u201cIt was important to me, too.\u201d Whatever she said to him, she wasn\u2019t going to lie. \u201cBeing with you again is better than anything I imagined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll let me hold you tonight?\u201d</p><p>How could she say no? The truth was, she craved feeling close to him as much as he seemed to need to hold her.</p><p>She nodded, tears welling up. \u201cYeah. That would be perfect.\u201d</p><p>Nearby motel\u2014Saturday morning</p><p>\u201cWould you care to explain why you left me a voicemail canceling dinner last night at the last minute and why I couldn\u2019t reach you all night long?\u201d Tara\u2019s stepfather, Adam Sterling, asked in her ear, his voice unnervingly calm, at five thirty the next morning.</p><p>Tara sighed. When Logan had popped in the shower a few minutes ago, she\u2019d taken her phone off vibrate, only to realize her stepfather had left her nine messages since seven last night, each one more concerned than the last. His question weighed on her mind, along with her broken engagement, the terrible turn in her case, and everything she\u2019d done between the sheets last night.</p> <p>Logan had awakened her twice more during the night to make love to her, once rolling her to her stomach, cupping her sensitive breasts and pinching her stiff nipples until her pussy flowed wet for him. He\u2019d pushed inside and rode her with a desperation that had her clawing the sheets and gasping his name. Then, just an hour ago, he\u2019d slid into her again and awakened her with molasses strokes and a devastating smile.</p><p>\u201cTara?\u201d Her stepfather\u2019s voice rang with concern. \u201cWhere have you been? Are you all right, princess? Tell me what\u2019s going on so I can help.\u201d</p><p>She was going to have to tell Adam something about why she\u2019d broken things off with Brad and moved out or else he\u2019d keep badgering her. She stuck to the factual. \u201cBrad and I called it quits yesterday. It\u2019s better for both of us. I\u2019m fine, just tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called me to tell me that you\u2019d ended the engagement. I want to hear your side of this.\u201d</p><p>Oh, crap. What exactly had Brad told Adam? Her stepfather had loathed Logan when she\u2019d merely been his tutor. After he\u2019d broken her heart, protective Adam had hated him with a vengeance. She didn\u2019t want to imagine his reaction if Brad had told him that Logan was back in her life. She had to hope that since Adam hadn\u2019t mentioned it, neither had Brad.</p><p>As a grown woman, she should be able to tell the man who had raised her through her teenage years that she was working with Logan. But Tara didn\u2019t want to rehash the ancient argument with Adam, especially if he thought that Logan had had a hand in ending her engagement. Besides, whatever Logan said, he\u2019d likely be out of her life in less than a week. Telling her stepfather the truth served no purpose except to worry\u2014and rile\u2014him needlessly.</p><p>\u201cTara, please. You\u2019ve been missing all night, and I\u2019ve been frantic. What\u2019s going on? Why did you suddenly break up with Brad? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>Maybe. No. Tara wasn\u2019t really sure. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to worry you. I\u2019m sorry. I wasn\u2019t ready to talk about it yet. Our breakup was sudden, but I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019m concerned about you.\u201d</p><p>Adam had always been concerned. True, he\u2019d always been busy. Lately, more so. Adam simply wasn\u2019t the sort of man to show much outward affection, but he\u2019d always been there when she needed him.</p><p>\u201cEverything will be all right.\u201d</p><p>Her stepfather sighed. \u201cWhere are you? Do you have a place to stay until you can find a new one? You\u2019re always welcome to move back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m good. I found a decent motel for a few days near my latest assignment. I\u2019ll find a new apartment afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure. Tell me what happened with Brad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this case,\u201d she finally said, choosing her words carefully. \u201cThe mission is to retrieve my friend Darcy. You remember her, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. She\u2019s spent a few Christmases with us. Sad that her parents died so horrifically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She went undercover inside a sex ring based in Florida. I\u2019d like to snuff the ring and nail the bastard who runs it. So I\u2019m getting some training to go undercover myself to this \u2018adult\u2019 resort. You\u2019ve always said missions are taxing, and that sometimes you have to give yourself over to them. Brad couldn\u2019t handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking a field position?\u201d He didn\u2019t sound pleased, but she could do this.</p><p>\u201cThis is more like an audition. I volunteered, and my boss agreed because I fit the right age and . . . characteristics. And he knows how badly I\u2019d like to make a difference in this case beyond analyzing the papers shuffling across my desk.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how it turns out. It\u2019s demanding; I\u2019m managing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you training for?\u201d</p><p>This was where the explanation was going to get hairy. \u201cTo be a sexual submissive. Before you say anything, don\u2019t worry. I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?! This is the big leagues.\u201d The worry in her stepfather\u2019s voice deepened. \u201cPrincess, I don\u2019t want to see you get hurt. Drop the case, go back to Brad, and work out your issues, please. He loves you and he\u2019s good for you. He\u2019ll give you everything you need.\u201d</p><p>No, Brad wouldn\u2019t. Last night with Logan had proven that. Sex wasn\u2019t everything, but the needs he was unlocking inside her weren\u2019t just those of her body. The intimacy that she and Logan shared resulted from some deep, organic bond\u2014a connection she\u2019d never felt with her ex-fianc\u00e9.</p><p>And she\u2019d discovered over the last two days a certain . . . pride that she was learning to submit. Tara knew she wasn\u2019t perfect, but was doing pretty well at living up to Logan\u2019s demands. Even more, she\u2019d done it on pure grit. Somehow, obeying him made her feel stronger. As powerless as she\u2019d felt as a child without a home, as a teenager with a broken heart, as an agent wondering if she was ready for field assignments, this made her feel damn capable.</p><p>\u201cNo, he won\u2019t. He wants me to quit my job.\u201d</p><p>Adam sighed. \u201cWould that be so bad? Field work will consume your life. Take it from someone who\u2019s been there.\u201d</p><p>Of course Adam knew. The fact that he\u2019d rarely come home during some of those years and often been absent mentally had caused Adam\u2019s separation from her mother. He\u2019d only changed after her mother had died suddenly in a single-car accident.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be proud of me, following in your footsteps.\u201d Tara was somewhat hurt that he wasn\u2019t and pushed back. \u201cNow that I don\u2019t have anyone to come home to, the job taking over my life is a nonissue. Really, it\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous.\u201d He sounded almost frantic to get that point across.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you for caring. I need to catch these people, for them\u2014and for me. They\u2019ve got Darcy, and I want her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you won\u2019t listen to me as a father, listen to me as a retired agent. What you\u2019re heading into is going to be ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I know you don\u2019t want to think about me in danger. But I\u2019d appreciate your support. I need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, I was never good at saying no to you.\u201d He sighed. \u201cYou want to talk about what\u2019ve you got so far?\u201d</p><p>Tara gnawed on her lip. This was against protocol, but Adam had been a damn good agent with a stellar track record in the field. That track record was one of the factors that allowed Adam to retire early and open his own security consulting firm. He traveled the world now, helping clients learn to stay as safe as possible. He made oodles of money doing it. She could benefit from his experience. And if using him brought Darcy home safely, Tara had no problem bending rules.</p><p>She filled Adam in on the case. \u201cWe have almost nothing on the ringleader, not even a name. This guy\u2019s greedy, and he doesn\u2019t care who he has to step on. He\u2019s got connections in hellholes all over the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Adam agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what else I\u2019ll bet is true: he\u2019s got a kink no one knows about, maybe it\u2019s BDSM or a serious hard-on for little girls. Whatever it is, he\u2019s figured out how to monetize it. My guess is that we\u2019re looking for an educated white male between the ages of thirty-five and fifty-five. Someone affluent, who travels easily. Maybe someone who speaks multiple languages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought as much. We\u2019re definitely dealing with someone who has no conscience and no heart. I need to catch this dirtbag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent York and I are scheduled to travel to one of his resorts on Wednesday. It\u2019s on a private island off of Key West. I\u2019ll check in with you if I can. I don\u2019t want you to worry.\u201d</p><p>Adam smiled wryly. \u201cYou know me too well. Who\u2019s training you, anyone I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon-Bureau contractor.\u201d</p><p>Not for a million dollars would she tell Adam the truth. He\u2019d only start on a pointless diatribe, ticking off all the reasons he hated Logan. And Tara wasn\u2019t sure what she\u2019d say. After his revelations and the toecurling way he\u2019d made love to her, she wasn\u2019t sure how she felt.</p><p>On the way to Club Dominion\u2014Saturday morning</p><p>Logan glanced across the cab of his truck at Tara. As close as they\u2019d been last night, as responsive and tuned to him as she\u2019d been, his Cherry was now someplace else mentally. And he didn\u2019t like it one bit. Did she think that he\u2019d be pacified with one night of sex? Was she feeling guilty that she\u2019d spent the night with him hours after breaking up with her fianc\u00e9?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s running through that pretty head?\u201d</p><p>She smiled wanly, looking tired. \u201cThe need for coffee.\u201d</p><p>He accepted her deflection for now. Maybe she was just processing and needed space. But she\u2019d kissed him so wholly when he\u2019d awakened her\u2014then seemed like a completely different person once he\u2019d emerged from the shower.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fix you up before we start working. Anything else bothering you?\u201d</p><p>Tara slanted a glance his way. The shrug she gave him was one of the fakest gestures he\u2019d ever seen. \u201cNo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought I heard you talking when I was in the shower.

Do I need to have a chat with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d She scoffed. \u201cI can just imagine how that would go.

He was already unhappy that I\u2019d ended things with Brad.\u201d She stared pensively out the windshield. \u201cThen he begged me to walk away from this case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably the only thing we\u2019ve ever agreed on.\u201d</p> <p>Tara turned to him, looking stunned. \u201cAfter all the progress I\u2019ve made, you still want me to quit? You think I can\u2019t handle it, but you\u2019re dead wrong. I\u2019ll have you know that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown, tigress.\u201d Logan stopped at a red light that seemed pointless in the sparse Saturday predawn streets. \u201cI agree that you\u2019ve been doing well. I\u2019ve always known that you\u2019re absolutely capable of doing whatever you set your mind to, and I respect the hell out of that. As the man who loves you, though, I\u2019d rather have you out of danger.\u201d</p><p>There it was again, his seemingly casual declaration of love, spoken as he pulled into a fast food drive thru. Nice weather. Pass the creamer. I love you. Tara shook her head.</p><p>After last night, they\u2019d been as close as two people could get. It was only natural, she supposed, that he\u2019d feel something for her. As he got closure and started to move on, he\u2019d likely see that it wasn\u2019t really love, not anymore. Even so, his words softened her.</p><p>As soon as they got their food and steaming caffeine, she turned to Logan. \u201cI can\u2019t back out. Darcy was my roommate in college. She lost her parents on 9/11. They were on the plane that crashed into the South Tower. She\u2019d been an admin of justice major anyway, but after that day . . . I held her hands a lot, cried with her. I even talked her into joining the FBI as a way to honor their memories and protect others from suffering the same loss. I feel partially responsible and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCherry, shh. You may have given her the idea, but she followed through because she wanted to. Would she want you going undercover to save her before you\u2019re ready?\u201d</p> <p>Darcy probably wouldn\u2019t want her to go at all. \u201cI have to. She\u2019s tough and smart, and I know if anyone could stay alive in a hostile situation, she\u2019d be the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer the question. Would Darcy want you to do this before you\u2019re ready?\u201d</p><p>God, he just didn\u2019t give up. \u201cNo. According to her, I have a lot of fortitude but the heart of a marshmallow.\u201d</p><p>Logan had never met Darcy, but he liked her already. \u201cThat sounds about right. Really, I want you to think carefully about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m committed.\u201d She crossed her arms over her petite chest, looking as determined as he\u2019d ever seen her. \u201cI owe it to her. And I owe it to me. I\u2019m not unhappy behind a desk, but I need to know if the field is where I belong. My life has been missing something, and I keep thinking that it\u2019s\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014having an actual life.\u201d</p><p>Boy, Brad had bored the shit out of her, and Tara had taken the blame upon herself. In Logan\u2019s mind, she thrived behind a desk, solving riddles that most people would never fathom. She\u2019d always loved puzzles and brainteasers, but this was one she was going to have to figure out for herself.</p><p>And it was his job to make sure she stayed alive long enough to do it.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s focus on getting you ready. We\u2019ve got four days. We\u2019re going to need every minute.\u201d</p> <p>He parked the truck, and they both climbed out. Despite spending half the night inside her, Logan was hard as nails just thinking about the preparation she needed next.</p><p>As they entered the building, he grabbed her hand. She tried to pull away discreetly. Fuck that.</p><p>He leveled her a stare heavy with disapproval. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding? After last night, you won\u2019t touch me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was separate from this. I don\u2019t think we should bring our personal stuff into our training sessions.\u201d</p><p>Logan held her hand tighter. \u201cYou\u2019re not putting distance between us when what we need most is trust and connection.\u201d</p><p>Cherry gnawed on her bottom lip as she walked down Dominion\u2019s long corridor, clearly thinking. He knew why she was backing away; she wasn\u2019t ready to admit yet that last night was the birth of something new, rather than the burial of old feelings. He\u2019d make sure she understood the difference soon.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Logan ran his key card through the mechanism beside his dungeon door. It popped open, and he pushed it wide, easing her in. He left the door cracked behind him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the dungeon now. Rephrase.\u201d</p><p>Tara didn\u2019t look pleased. \u201cYes, Logan.\u201d</p><p>But she was so damn adorable that he wanted to kiss her senseless.</p><p>\u201cGood. What else should you be doing now that we\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes and started to pull off her clothes. \u201cWhat is your fascination with me being naked?\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled her neck, running his tongue over one of the love bites he\u2019d left there. \u201cIf you have to ask that after last night, I\u2019d be happy to demonstrate again.\u201d</p><p>With a frown, she landed a mock punch on his shoulder. \u201cI meant Doms in general. Does the sub having clothes put them on too level a playing field?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. It\u2019s that subs are often feeling their most vulnerable and open when they\u2019re naked. It\u2019s a natural state, but for most of our lives, we\u2019re told that it\u2019s not. The Dom\u2019s job, in part, is to strip off the artifice to get to the real person underneath. So in that way, clothes are symbolic. And subs are less likely to put on a front with nothing to hide behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d she said, folding the last of her clothes and handing them to him.</p><p>\u201cBecause it makes you feel vulnerable. I see it in the flush that pinks up your skin, in the slouching of your shoulders, the way you try to look anywhere but at me.\u201d</p><p>Tara glared. \u201cNow I just don\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>She was teasing . . . and yet not. She really didn\u2019t like feeling vulnerable with him when she was so off balance. Time and trust would heal that. He just hoped he could convince her of his abiding love, that it was safe to give him her trust, before his time with her ran out.</p><p>\u201cUndercover, that won\u2019t be tolerated. Shoulders back, breasts out. Eyes on me, Cherry. Now.\u201d</p><p>Dragging in a deep breath, she did as she was told. Her posture improved a hundred percent. His respect for her determination went up a thousand.</p><p>\u201cDid you kids start without me?\u201d Xander called from the doorway, then sauntered across the room.</p><p>Tara stiffened. She didn\u2019t cover up, but he could tell she fought the urge. Pride at her progress surged, even as he wanted to clobber Xander for his mischief. This wasn\u2019t how he\u2019d wanted to explain today\u2019s lesson to Tara.</p><p>\u201cDamn, she looks pretty,\u201d Xander commented. \u201cEdible, even. I need a taste.\u201d</p><p>Logan glared at his friend as he circled Tara to wrap a naked hand on her hip and drop a kiss on her bare shoulder. When he saw Xander\u2019s tongue hit her soft skin, Logan nearly lost it.</p><p>\u201cGet your fucking hands off her.\u201d</p><p>Xander smiled as he pulled back.</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d Tara demanded.</p><p>Both he and Xander turned disapproving stares on her.</p><p>\u201cWatch your attitude, Cherry,\u201d he warned. \u201cI won\u2019t spank your ass again until the bruises fade, but I know plenty of other ways to make you suffer. You won\u2019t come for hours until you remember how you do and don\u2019t address me on this assignment.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, she pressed her lips together. \u201cYes, Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He rubbed a soothing hand across her shoulder. \u201cXander is here to help us with the next phase of your training. I\u2019m not going to tell you too much about it yet, because you need to learn to be ready for anything. Understood?\u201d</p><p>Tara wanted to argue, but didn\u2019t. \u201cYes, Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl. Stay here.\u201d Then he scowled at Xander as he moved to the cabinet in the corner. \u201cKeep your hands off. Take a seat.\u201d</p><p>Xander strolled to the bed and sat. \u201cThis ought to be a great show. Wish I\u2019d brought popcorn.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Logan saw Tara shoot Xander a quelling glare and pretended not to notice. The bastard deserved that and more. Logan would have to make sure that she knew better than to disrespect any other Doms . . . but he was getting ahead of himself.</p><p>\u201cCherry, lean over the spanking bench.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the apparatus, hesitated, then looked at him. He raised a brow, but waited wordlessly. Logan saw her brace herself, then comply, draping her figure over the leather top with grace.</p><p>After gathering the things he needed, he crossed the room and set everything on a table out of Tara\u2019s sight. Quickly, he clipped her in, then took a breath.</p><p>For the purposes of this mission, this preparation may save her pain. For their relationship, it was equally important. If she didn\u2019t enjoy this, Logan wouldn\u2019t love her less\u2014but he\u2019d always want to possess her more completely. After years of barriers between them, he didn\u2019t like the idea of enduring more.</p><p>In fact, last night, he\u2019d been aware that he hadn\u2019t used a condom. They hadn\u2019t discussed birth control at all. Children were something they should talk about, but he wanted them with Tara, and everything about her made him want to embrace life full throttle. For the first time in years, he felt truly alive and he wanted to share it, spread it, breed it.</p><p>He glanced at Tara, and the thought she could already be pregnant made him harder than steel. One thing at a time, buddy. Get her out of this mission alive. Then get a collar around her neck and a ring on her finger.</p><p>Logan unscrewed the tube of lube, then squeezed it on the pink plastic plug. Moment of truth . . .</p><p>He sidled up behind her. \u201cYou ever been taken anally?\u201d</p><p>His guess was that she hadn\u2019t, but he needed to hear her say it.</p><p>Tara stiffened. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll get you ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cF-For anal sex?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He bent over her, draping her gorgeous ivory skin with his body. He whispered, \u201cAnd before you ask, yes, with me. I want to be the first one to take you here.\u201d</p><p>The only one.</p><p>She shivered, and he placed a palm on her bare back. \u201cDon\u2019t tense. We\u2019ll go slow.\u201d</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t relaxing. Logan rubbed his palms across her stiff shoulders, dragged his thumbs down the outline of her spine, easing tight muscles. He traced the curve of her waist, kissed her shoulder blade. Gradually, the tension left her body.</p><p>\u201cGood girl. I\u2019m starting simple. This shouldn\u2019t hurt. You have a few days to take something more substantial. For now, the plug should simply feel foreign. If it hurts, say so. If it really hurts, say your safe word. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Logan.\u201d Her reply sounded breathy.</p><p>God, that sound went straight to his dick, too. He\u2019d imagined that fucking her repeatedly last night would give him more self-control. Today, he was fighting for it harder than ever.</p><p>He curled one palm around her hip, sliding back across the lush globe of one cheek, frowning at the fading purplish bruise there. On her other cheek, he saw another that looked fainter, a greenishyellow. And he chastised himself. He was going to have to be damn careful with her.</p><p>Squeezing some lube on his fingers, Logan rubbed it with his thumb to warm it a bit, then inserted his fingers between her delectable cheeks until he found her untried opening. As he touched her there, she clenched tight.</p><p>Slowly, patiently, he pressed in with the tip of his finger. \u201cRelax, Cherry. Breathe.\u201d</p><p>She did as he asked. Her muscles let go, and he slipped inside her, up to the first knuckle.</p><p>Shit. Hot, tight, she felt like heaven. Once he got his dick inside her here, no way he would last long. He was damn well going to have to temper himself until she got acclimated to anal penetration.</p><p>Provided she even liked it.</p><p>Tara drew in a shuddering breath. Her head lifted and she turned to glance at him over her shoulder. Her cheeks were rosy with color, her brown eyes slowly dilating. He couldn\u2019t stand not feeling her reaction for another second, so he wedged his free hand between the bench and her body, then lowered his fingers to her pussy\u2014and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou like this, Cherry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the idea of it.\u201d</p><p>That was honest\u2014and half the battle. Maybe she just needed a bit more to figure it out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut it scares me a little,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you shared that.\u201d He kissed her back again, then whispered for her ears alone. \u201cI\u2019m going to make this so good for you, baby. I want you to imagine what it would be like to take me here, my chest covering your back as I pump you full and we breathe together. Can you feel the pleasure climbing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The sound was a breathy whimper.</p><p>\u201cMe, too, baby. To get there, first you\u2019re going to have to be ready. Can you push out on me? Yeah, like that. Bear down.\u201d</p><p>In seconds, his finger slid completely inside, suddenly surrounded by hot satin fire. Logan began to sweat. God, something had changed between them last night, something fundamental. She\u2019d tried to hide behind her professional fa\u00e7ade and keep her distance, but now that he was stripping her of all those artificial barriers, he could see how she really felt. And her trust was so damn beautiful. He couldn\u2019t wait to fuck her ass, to completely own her. It would require her to have a bit more faith in him, but if he was patient and gave her what she needed, it would happen.</p><p>The minute she let him slide completely into that pretty backside, he\u2019d know that she truly trusted him. He\u2019d ask her to stay with him, wear his collar. And no matter what he\u2019d promised her earlier, as soon as this fucking assignment was over, he was going ask her to be his wife.</p><p>\u201cLogan . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Cherry? You okay?\u201d</p><p>Her whole body tensed. \u201cDo something.\u201d</p><p>He dragged his fingers up her swollen labia, over the hard, needy knot of her clit. God, how responsive Tara was. She was more than ready to come. He was more than ready to let her, too.</p><p>But he had to finish his task first.</p><p>Slowly, he withdrew his fingers from her backside, quickly washed them, then rushed back to grab the plug he\u2019d prepared. \u201cI\u2019m going to slide this in. It\u2019s a little bigger than my fingers, but you can handle it. Just stay relaxed.\u201d</p><p>Tara gave him a jerky nod. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>His heart drummed in his ears as he pulled her cheeks apart with a thumb and finger, then settled the edge of the plug against her rosette. Slowly, he sank it into her depths, watching her closely for cues.</p><p>Her back stiffened. When he paused, she forced a breath out. As he resumed, her fists clenched. But when he paused again, she shook her head frantically.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Caressing his way down her ass again, Logan pushed the plug in a bit more. As he eased the thicker end into her virgin backside, Tara gasped.</p><p>\u201cToo much, Cherry?\u201d</p><p>Her breath shuddered, and he could almost hear her trying to collect her thoughts. \u201cM-More intense than I expected.\u201d</p><p>Intense in a good way? Logan eased his fingers between her thighs again. Wetter than before. Wetter than ever. He petted her clit, then settled a pair of fingers at her entrance. They slipped inside as if eased by melted butter. Slick. Smooth. Perfect.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question; he knew.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to, baby. It\u2019s all about feeling. Just hold back a few minutes for me. I want to share this orgasm with you.\u201d</p> <p>Tara whimpered, but sent him a shaky nod.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes, Logan.\u201d</p><p>Her breathy submission went straight to his cock, as usual. God, she had another inch of the plug to take, and watching it slide into her body, seeing her incredible arousal soar, was getting to him. He\u2019d been inside her less than two hours ago, and already he was dying for her again.</p><p>\u201cGood girl. This is going to feel so good. You\u2019re going to take the rest of this plug, baby. Then you\u2019re going to take me. I\u2019m going to fill this pretty wet pussy with my cock,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to rub your hard little clit while I fuck you smooth and deep. You\u2019re going to scream for me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything, just panted.</p><p>\u201cDo you want that?\u201d Logan knew she did, but he wanted to hear her admit it. Being with her this way, her body so in tune with his, was drawing forth his every primal instinct.</p><p>Take. Possess. Own.</p><p>\u201cYes, Logan.\u201d</p><p>Jesus, somehow when she said those two simple words, his dick pulsed in response, more than ready to give her everything he could.</p><p>With a deep breath, he withdrew his fingers from her pussy. She whined in protest, but a second later, he seated the plug deep in her ass, and that whine became a mewl.</p><p>\u201cFuck, she looks pretty,\u201d Xander murmured from the bed.</p><p>As if Tara suddenly remembered they had an audience, she stiffened. \u201cIs he staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you always have to be ready to perform for an audience. Now stop asking questions, Cherry. You take what I give or say your safe word. Everything I\u2019m doing is designed to prepare you for what\u2019s ahead. If you can\u2019t handle it, say so.\u201d</p><p>That would get her back up.</p><p>Sure enough, her spine stiffened. Logan distracted her by rubbing a pair of fingers across her clit again, settling his touch into little circles.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say another word.</p><p>With a quick flick of his wrist and a lowering of his zipper, he freed his cock and settled himself against her wet portal. With his other hand, he grabbed the base of the plug. Then he eased into her hot, so-tight silken pussy, the feel of his bare cock against her flesh the most mind-blowing sensation ever. Yes, he was playing with fire without protection, and his brain knew they should discuss this, but he needed her this way so badly. The image of her round with his child almost made him come then and there.</p><p>Instead, he gritted his teeth, sucked it up, then withdrew the plug a fraction. Before she could even finish gasping, he shoved the little pink device into her ass as he eased back from her pussy, then repeated the process. Tara started to scratch at the spanking bench, her nails digging into the dark leather. Her body clamped down on him until his eyes nearly fucking crossed. Her response was hot in itself, but it was her trust driving him to the edge. The connection. He could literally feel her body overheating, overloading, going exactly where he led her. With every sigh and groan, every tensing of her muscles and shake of her head, she sent a message to him, telling him exactly how to finish unraveling her.</p><p>Fuck, he\u2019d better do it quick. He wasn\u2019t going to last.</p><p>He settled his left hand over her clit again, swiped her fingers across the little bud. Tara was hard, primed. Her orgasm was going to drag him with her, and he couldn\u2019t wait.</p><p>Logan circled her clit again, then drove deep into her pussy. \u201cCome!\u201d</p><p>The word was barely out before her body began jolting with the force of her pleasure. She clamped down on his cock and she screamed, her body bucking, pulsing with release. A moment later, the climax that had been brewing at the base of his spine shot through his balls and sped up his cock like white-hot lightning. As he plunged with feral strokes into her pussy, the fire erupted and he convulsed, emptying himself inside her with a soul-deep groan.</p><p>And as he laid his sweat-slick chest over the heated skin of her back and wrapped his arm around her, he knew that he would do whatever necessary to keep her safe and make her his forever.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Club Dominion\u2014Saturday afternoon</p><p>LOGAN entered the dungeon again, balancing a white paper bag in each hand and gripping a plastic bag with his teeth. Seeing him, Tara tossed her phone into the cabinet, then rushed to help him, relieving him of the bulk he held with his mouth first.</p><p>He sighed with relief. \u201cWho knew sodas were so heavy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bad for your teeth,\u201d she scolded.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all still here.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but if you want to continue chewing food in the future, you probably ought not to use them as tools, you know.\u201d</p><p>With a wink, he maneuvered across the room and set the bags on the table. It struck her that this was a bit like high school. Then, she\u2019d been forever trying to point out the smart thing, the logical thing. He\u2019d always pushed back with a bit of mischief that inevitably made something inside her melt. By nature, she tended to be serious. She had a sense of humor, but too often let it get buried under duty and responsibility. Logan\u2019s wit was relaxed, closer to the surface, and during their time together in high school, she\u2019d always felt more . . . balanced around him. Happy.</p><p>She felt happier and lighter today than someone who\u2019d just lost a fianc\u00e9, than a woman trying to rescue her best friend from sex slavers, than the female who\u2019d been glutting on sex with the jerk who\u2019d broken her heart once upon a time. That made her pause.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Logan said, tearing into the first bag and withdrawing a tin round with a cardboard lid.</p><p>The food smelled heavenly, but her stomach was so tight, she wondered if she could eat. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that look. You\u2019re getting serious on me.\u201d</p><p>And not for anything would she tell him that being with him now felt right. He already had these crazy ideas of love that she feared would fade once he realized that he was just getting her out of his system. She didn\u2019t want to be crushed by this incredible hunk of man again. Yes, he\u2019d left her last time for extenuating circumstances; she didn\u2019t blame him. But the fact that he\u2019d walked away with such seeming ease scared her.</p><p>\u201cThinking about the case,\u201d she lied. \u201cI leave in four days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be ready, I promise. Have you heard any news from Bocelli?\u201d</p><p>Tara shook her head. \u201cI checked in while you were gone. The call was brief, but he said there was nothing new yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more dead bodies is a good development, Cherry.\u201d</p><p>Logan was right, but that didn\u2019t make the worry any easier. She\u2019d pushed her apprehension for Darcy\u2019s safety and the mission\u2019s success to the back of her mind by telling herself that panic would only slow down her training. But the second she closed her eyes, Darcy was there, sometimes screaming for help, sometimes already dead.</p><p>\u201cBaby, now you\u2019re just worrying me.\u201d He set the food aside and crossed the room. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I really am concerned about Darcy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing your best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it isn\u2019t good enough?\u201d The thought brought a rush of tears.</p><p>He cupped her shoulders, his blue eyes delving deep into hers. \u201cIt\u2019s all you can do. Be comforted by the fact that the abductor\u2019s goal isn\u2019t to kill the women. It gives you more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wonder what she\u2019s enduring now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Darcy, but if she\u2019s a field agent for the Bureau, then she\u2019s a tough woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d Tara agreed, a bit of the anxiety in her stomach easing. \u201cBut . . . do you think they\u2019ve figured out that she\u2019s not really submissive?\u201d And if so, would she end up like Laken Fox?</p><p>Logan hesitated. \u201cHard to say. If they were convinced of that, I think they\u2019d have killed her already. They may think she\u2019s just really bratty and needs a seriously firm hand.\u201d</p><p>Tara swallowed. \u201cIn the wrong hands, that sounds terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be. But you\u2019ve got to worry about you now. You have to focus on being ready to rescue her or you\u2019ll both wind up in serious trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d And she did. It just didn\u2019t make the situation any easier. \u201cWhat about Robert? Any updates from Axel?\u201d</p><p>This time, Logan sighed. The hesitation on his face worried her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not cut out for this, Cherry. I told you that. Axel says York has the self-control, but not the drive to earn submission. He brought in one of the club subs yesterday. Apparently, she topped from the bottom the entire time. York said he was sick of head games and walked out. Are he and Darcy an item?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one is supposed to know, but yeah. I think he meant to propose soon. At least Darcy suspected so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYork is not only wrong for this assignment, he\u2019s not focusing on what he needs to learn. He\u2019s too anxious. I\u2019ve told Bocelli that. So has Axel. Baby, you need a plan B.\u201d</p><p>She chewed on her bottom lip. \u201cI know it\u2019s smart to have one. I just don\u2019t think I could go to this resort and hand over my body to someone I don\u2019t know, not the way I give myself over to you.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her cheek, and his face softened. \u201cAnd you do it because you trust me.\u201d</p><p>That expression scared the hell out of her, like he was expecting her to love him back. \u201cWith my body, yes.\u201d</p><p>Logan narrowed his eyes, clearly not liking the way she qualified that statement. \u201cWe\u2019re going to broaden that trust, Cherry. I\u2019m going to earn it all, every last drop of forgiveness and lo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>Her heart pounded. She knew what he was going to say, and she wasn\u2019t strong enough to resist it right now. Last night, he\u2019d scaled so many of her defenses. If he\u2019d been demanding or bossy, she could have easily told him to go fuck himself. But he\u2019d been patient, tender, seductive. Even today . . . Who would have thought that taking the anal plug he\u2019d inserted could seem like a bonding experience? Yet no denying that she felt even closer to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tara couldn\u2019t afford any of this, especially right now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving, and that smells good.\u201d She nodded at the tin rounds of food. Definitely Italian.</p><p>He heaved a disappointed sigh at her, then removed the lids. \u201cLasagna. Salad is in plastic containers in the other bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d And she felt like a heel for hurting him. That she had was written all over his face. \u201cI really do appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d let me, I\u2019d take care of you always.\u201d</p><p>God, it was getting hard to say no. She couldn\u2019t imagine what another three days with him would do. \u201cCan we just focus on the case right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t look happy about it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on tap for the rest of the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot telling. It\u2019s the first real test I\u2019ve prepared, which will encompass a lot of what you\u2019ve learned into one scene. You\u2019ll need to remember to stay in protocol and submit to the best of your ability.\u201d</p><p>A bit of foreboding filled her. \u201cWill Thorpe be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can bet on it.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced, but couldn\u2019t stand to tackle this fear alone. She took Logan by the hand. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of failing.\u201d</p><p>He slid a hand behind her neck. \u201cDon\u2019t be. I won\u2019t let you. Focus on me, on being with me and pleasing me. The rest will come.\u201d</p><p>Club Dominion\u2014Saturday night</p><p>With a reassuring hand at the small of her back, Logan led her out of his dungeon and down the club\u2019s hall. It would be a simple act . . . except she was wearing nothing but the short buttery, pale silk robe he kept in his armoire.</p><p>Tara didn\u2019t think for a second that she\u2019d be wearing it for long.</p><p>She knew better than to ask again where they were going and what was going to happen. He\u2019d refused to answer the question twice and vowed that if she asked again, she wouldn\u2019t come for the rest of the night.</p><p>This was a trial run for her work at Fantasy Key, the resort where she\u2019d go undercover. Eventually, Robert would lead, and she\u2019d follow. Since he wasn\u2019t proving to be a strong Dom, she\u2019d have to fill in the gaps by being especially submissive to him. Somehow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shaking,\u201d Logan whispered. \u201cNothing to be afraid of. I won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t; she knew that. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make the unknown easier to take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeep breath. I know you like to plan everything and run all the contingencies in your head, but don\u2019t. Submission works for you, in part, because it\u2019s the one place in your life where you let go. Relax into it and know that I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>It all came down to trust. She was shocked to realize how totally she trusted him to keep her safe. He\u2019d push her, but not beyond what she could endure.</p> <p>The nervous flutters didn\u2019t go away, but the fear gripping her eased. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>As they approached another door, he opened it. Immediately a wall of grinding, sexy music filled the cavernous space. The slap of leather resounded, followed by cries of passion. A man to her right groaned, and she was shocked to see a naked woman kneeling before him, taking the hard stalk of cock in her mouth as he fucked her lips rapidly. About twenty feet away, a woman in full leather had bound a man to a St. Andrew\u2019s Cross and was whacking his ass with a cane. His abundant muscles rippled with every blow.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s marking him!\u201d Tara\u2019s first instinct was to race across the room and rescue him.</p><p>Logan\u2019s hand at her elbow silently reminded her that the submissive man had signed up for this and had a safe word if he really wanted out. \u201cHe likes it. And those are your last words until I ask you to speak. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>Protocol. People were watching. Around her, she saw stares, some lustful, some curious. One sub with short pixie dark hair served another Dom a drink, stabbing Tara with a dark glare. A former sub of Logan\u2019s? In her head, she knew it didn\u2019t matter; he hadn\u2019t had sex with the girl, whoever she was. But it wasn\u2019t just about sex. Logan showed genuine caring when he topped, and the thought that this woman had experienced that for herself...</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gone tense.\u201d Logan caressed her hip.</p><p>When she looked back, he\u2019d already followed the line of her vision and his gaze fell on the sub, who quickly wiped the expression off her face. He clenched his jaw.</p><p>\u201cHey, Logan.\u201d Xander approached from their right. \u201cTara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch Cherry for a minute,\u201d Logan said to his friend. \u201cI need to have a word with Callie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood call. Since she found out you\u2019ve been holed up in your dungeon with Tara, she\u2019s been in a foul mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll nip it now.\u201d</p><p>With that, Logan stalked off. He\u2019d said no talking, but . . .</p><p>Xander raised a brow at her. \u201cAsk quickly, sweet thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted your boy something fierce. She\u2019s tried really hard to get him to fuck her.\u201d Xander shook his head. \u201cCallie\u2019s not dumb. She can already see that he\u2019s different with you.\u201d</p><p>Logan might believe that he loved her\u2014and an insidious part of her wished that were true since she still cared for him. But wishful thinking would get her nowhere. He didn\u2019t truly know the woman she\u2019d become; just the girl he\u2019d crushed on in high school. Their unresolved feelings and the case were drawing them together temporarily. Once this was over, and he no longer had to train her, he\u2019d get some clarity and likely be ready to move on. He\u2019d probably do so with a sense of relief.</p><p>Whatever conversation Logan had with this Callie woman was short. He scolded her, his expression firm, then motioned to a dungeon monitor, who escorted her away. Then Logan headed back toward her.</p><p>\u201cWhat will they do to her?\u201d she whispered to Xander.</p><p>\u201cPunish her, Cherry. Which is what I\u2019m going to do if you open your mouth one more time,\u201d Logan warned.</p><p>And he would. She pressed her lips together.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He leaned over to Xander. \u201cYou get everything in place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s exactly like you requested.\u201d</p><p>The not knowing was making Tara\u2019s imagination work overtime. Her belly twisted in knots, and she took a deep breath, willing herself to calm as Logan guided her deeper into the club\u2019s public area. Still, she couldn\u2019t decide if Xander having a hand in whatever it was made her less apprehensive or more.</p><p>Finally, they reached a fork in the main hallway and turned left. Xander took point, and suddenly the crowd parted, letting them through, closer and closer to\u2014Oh shit, no.</p><p>A stage.</p><p>Suddenly, Tara felt all the eyes in the room on her. She wasn\u2019t just going to do a scene; she was going to publicly submit to Logan for this swelling audience. Panic tore through her, along with the edges of a humiliating sting. People wanted to watch her bow and scrape and beg . . .</p><p>Tara turned to Logan, giving him a look that both resisted and pleaded.</p><p>\u201cSpeak,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be sick. It\u2019s one thing to submit to you in private, but in front of all these people\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d He took her hand. \u201cYou did brilliantly in front of Xander. We\u2019ve got a few more days to perfect this, and I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re absolutely ready before the mission. But don\u2019t forget, you have a safe word if the scene becomes too much. Other than that, focus on me. Trust me to make this not about you bending for me, but about us connecting by giving one another what we need. That\u2019s the beauty of what happens here, Cherry. Haven\u2019t you felt that?\u201d</p><p>Yes, she had, earlier today especially. He\u2019d expanded her horizons because she\u2019d trusted him, and she\u2019d given him a way to experience the sex he hadn\u2019t had in five years\u2014all because they were connected by this mysterious power exchange and emotions she didn\u2019t completely understand.</p><p>Tara nodded.</p><p>He squeezed her hand. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>Biting her lip nervously, she did, following Xander.</p><p>As they grew closer to the stage, a golden glow flickered all around the perimeter. Dozens of tea light candles burned softly. It was almost romantic, and the fact that Logan had asked Xander to do this for her touched Tara. Then she realized the candles illuminated a small padded ottoman and a pair of leather-lined shackles hanging from the ceiling.</p><p>Her belly did a flip, and her first instinct was to turn around and run. But she felt dozens of eyes on her, including Thorpe, who now stood at the edge of the crowd, near the front, watching her with a critical eye. Beside him stood a man in a pristine suit with dark hair and piercing black eyes like she\u2019d never seen. He put off an intense vibe like nobody\u2019s business\u2014and looked straight at her, assessing her almost clinically.</p><p>Instinctively, she dropped her gaze to the floor, figuring the gesture would help her submissive image. But inside, her stomach was rolling with apprehension. How the hell could she go through with this?</p><p>No idea, but if she left now, all these people would think she was a coward. Thorpe would undoubtedly report the development to Bocelli. Since she\u2019d only been working with her new boss for two weeks, he\u2019d assume she didn\u2019t have to right stuff for this mission and maybe choose someone else. If she bailed, she wouldn\u2019t be helping to rescue Darcy. And she\u2019d let Logan down. To her surprise, the thought of disappointing him hurt more than she could stand.</p><p>Tara took a deep breath and stepped toward the stage. Other people survived this. If there was a way to make this good for her, Logan would find it. She knew that as well as she knew her own name.</p><p>With a tender hand at her elbow, he helped her up the stairs to the stage. She saw a table in the shadows, its top dotted with a coiled whip, a long rectangular paddle, and a flogger with soft leather strips.</p><p>She gulped.</p><p>\u201cEyes on me, slave.\u201d Logan\u2019s voice sounded deep and downright commanding, making her shiver. She couldn\u2019t do anything but obey. \u201cWhat is your safe word? Say it loud enough for everyone to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cR-Romeo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good. Strip and hand your robe to Master Xander.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d known this command was coming, yet it startled her. Still, hesitation wasn\u2019t going to accomplish anything, so she forced herself past her nerves and unbelted the little silk garment, shrugging it off her shoulders, down her arms. When Xander held out a hand, she gave it to him, not surprised to find that she was trembling.</p><p>Logan nodded, his expression full of approval. \u201cFace the wall and kneel here.\u201d He pointed to the ottoman.</p><p>Tara fought the urge to glare at Logan and instead looked at the padded cube like it was a snake. Once she complied, everyone would see her abundant ass. But her insecurities weren\u2019t the issue. Submission was. She could do this for Darcy, for her own sense of success. And she would make Logan proud.</p><p>Facing the wall, she settled one knee down on the black vinyl, then another . . . The surface was cool, but soon warmed under her skin. But those shackles dangled just above eye level, and Xander turned a crank to raise them, they clinked against the wall, stirring up a whole new batch of fears.</p><p>Logan reached one and pried it open. \u201cGive me your wrist.\u201d</p><p>Oh God, oh God, oh God. She forced down nausea, forced herself to forget that people were watching. She couldn\u2019t see them, and they\u2019d gone silent. She knew from her research, from being restrained earlier while Xander watched, that the best coping mechanism she had was to focus on Logan.</p><p>Finally, she drew in a rattling breath, then held out her wrist to him. He snapped it into the cuff just above her head, and she was startled to find that the snug way it hugged her skin was almost comforting.</p><p>\u201cAnother hesitation will cost you, slave.\u201d</p><p>A few feet away, Xander picked up the paddle from the nearby table and smacked it lustily against his hand with a grin. A part of her feared something that solid against her rear, having everyone watch her punishment. But some other part of her must like it because moisture gushed from her slit. Shocked, she gasped.</p><p>Logan sent her a secretive little smile. \u201cYour other wrist.\u201d</p><p>This time, she didn\u2019t dither. Logan\u2019s touch calmed her even more as he settled her into the next shackle, then he squeezed her fingers before releasing her and walking over to the little table in the shadows.</p><p>Her belly clenched and turned again.</p><p>He took a long moment, then selected something. Tara couldn\u2019t see what, since his body blocked her view. But once he had an instrument in hand, he walked behind her and caressed his way down her back, over her ass, lingering on one cheek.</p><p>\u201cBend at the waist.\u201d</p><p>Tara sucked in a deep breath. Okay, he was going to spank her. She\u2019d managed this before, but tonight he was adding something new into the mix. The thought of that whip scared the hell out of her. She tensed, but complied as much she could, until her arms dangled from the shackles, pulling at her shoulders. The sensation felt foreign, but so submissive that it aroused something in her. Then she realized that, as she\u2019d bent, she\u2019d given the audience a perfect view of her pussy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>More embarrassment swirled with arousal through her body. A fresh flush crawled up her skin. Additional moisture coated her folds.</p><p>Circling her again, Logan fused his gaze to hers and cupped her breast. Though her back faced the audience, no one would have any doubt that he was fondling her in public. It should bother her . . . but any time Logan touched her, it felt so damn good. When he pinched her nipple, rubbing it between his thumb and forefinger, nothing but sensation and his touch mattered.</p><p>Unable to stop the sound, she moaned.</p><p>Logan scraped a thumbnail gently across her erect nipple. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>Then he withdrew a pair of clamps from his pocket, attached to one another by a chain. Each end had two plastic balls attached that looked like . . . cherries? She glanced back up at him.</p><p>\u201cThere are weights at each end. And yes, I bought these just for you.\u201d</p><p>It seemed silly to think that she welcomed nipple clamps because he\u2019d been thinking of her when he purchased them, but she did. Of course, when he secured the first, it pinched and burned\u2014for a moment. Just as it settled into a mellow numb haze, he repeated the process with the other nipple.</p><p>Heat rolled through her, and the ache behind her clit began to pulse in demand. No denying how wet she was now. Her labia felt slick, unbearably swollen. No doubt, everyone in the audience could see, but somehow that only aroused her more. She whimpered.</p><p>\u201cQuiet,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Not a second later, she heard a whoosh, then felt the tails of the flogger, almost like soft leather fringe, striking her ass. The sensation wasn\u2019t pain exactly; it was too diffused for that. Instead, it felt more like a dozen fingers firmly caressing her, heating her skin. No way could she bruise from this, only catch fire.</p><p>Tara found herself arching, sticking her ass back for more. Logan splayed his palm in the middle of her spine and pressed gently, raising her backside another inch. Then he struck her with the flogger again, a bit harder than before. Still, it was pleasant, and she felt her mind begin to float away.</p><p>Smacks three and four each hit one of her cheeks. With her skin already sensitive, the burn kindled into a blaze. That heat spread outward, seeping into her bones. Her pussy clenched in protest against the emptiness that ratcheted up her hunger. And as he dragged the soft leather strips across her ass, fire burned under her skin, topped by a sweet sting that soon eased into a gentle tingle.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she gave more of herself to Logan, letting the shackles assume more of her weight. Her blood hummed as she awaited another smack with the flogger.</p><p>It never came.</p><p>Instead, he circled in front of her once more. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She did, and the electric need in his eyes created an answering ping in her body. Whatever he wanted, yes. Tara knew she would give it to him, no questions asked.</p><p>\u201cGood girl. Straighten up and spread your knees as wide as the pedestal allows.\u201d</p><p>Pleasure and the sharp pang of want made her brain sluggish. It took her a second to process his command, but she complied finally. He nodded in approval, then tugged on the little weights one at a time. Fresh heat jolted down to her pussy. Her entire body tensed in need, and she whimpered.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he murmured, his low, velvety tone warming her.</p><p>Then, with a flick of his wrist, he unleashed the flogger\u2019s supple leather. The ends landed with a gentle slap right on her mound. The ache expanded, rocketing upward, outward until she swore that every nerve in her body was wired straight to her swollen clit. But it wasn\u2019t quite enough to push her over the edge.</p><p>Tara tossed her head back and cried out, forcing herself to hold back a plea. She needed him inside her. She\u2019d wanted him last night and this morning, but this ache was a living, breathing entity taking over her whole being, suppressing all but the desperate craving to feel Logan filling up every empty bit of her with every hard inch of him.</p><p>His burning blue eyes told her he knew that.</p><p>\u201cAre you wet, slave?\u201d he asked loudly. He wanted the audience to hear.</p> <p>\u201cYes, Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been very good. I\u2019ll reward you soon.\u201d</p><p>He dropped the flogger and stepped forward, wrapping one hand around her waist, anchoring the other in her hair. His mouth covered hers, his tongue demanding entrance, seducing her submission.</p><p>Feminine gasps erupted around the room. They confused Tara until she remembered Xander saying that not only did Logan never have sex with the subs, he never kissed them. And suddenly, she understood: Logan wasn\u2019t just having her publicly submit. He was explicitly staking his claim.</p><p>Something warm erupted inside her. Though she couldn\u2019t touch him with her hands because of the shackles, she met every nuance of the kiss with her own delight and need, showing him\u2014and everyone\u2014how totally she accepted him in this moment as the master of her body. He pulled her against every hard inch of his frame, her clamped nipples rasping against his bare chest. And she melted.</p><p>When Logan pulled back and searched her eyes with curiosity and wonder, he was panting. Tara wanted nothing more than to sink back down into that endless kiss and join with him forever, but he caressed her face, then stepped away. Every part of her ached for him, so focused on his actions, on pleasing him.</p><p>Then Xander stepped forward.</p><p>Tara sucked in a breath. He was going to touch her? In public?</p><p>\u201cAccept his touch because I demand it of you, slave,\u201d Logan\u2019s voice rang harsh in the air, but his blue eyes scanned her, concerned and checking her response.</p><p>\u201cYes, Logan.\u201d The words slipped out automatically.</p><p>With a wicked grin, Xander approached, trailing a finger in the valley between her breasts, caressing the underswell of one. Then he disappeared behind her and breathed kisses along her shoulders. Her skin tingled; she shuddered. Her belly knotted.</p><p>\u201cIf Logan gave me the chance, I\u2019d fuck you here,\u201d he whispered, caressing her ass. \u201cI\u2019d sink my cock so deep inside you while Logan plundered your sweet pussy. It is sweet, right?\u201d</p><p>She whimpered. Her body craved Logan\u2019s, answered to him, but this man skewed her system in some odd way. Maybe it was because Logan watched with a hot gaze. Had he overheard? Did he want to possess her pussy while Xander plunged his cock into her backside?</p><p>His sizzling words played in her head while he glided gentle fingertips over her body. A surge of passion from the audience swelled around her, nearly overcoming her. She could almost feel them holding their collective breath. But nothing affected her more than the need in Logan\u2019s eyes. She swayed closer to him.</p><p>With his signature musky heat surrounding her, he approached, all business\u2014and all man. He uncrossed his arms from his chest and settled his fingers over her clit, fondling her without hurry, for no other purpose than to jack up her need and watch her twist. Pleasure jackknifed through her body, a spike of need she found impossible to ignore.</p><p>\u201cIs Xander whispering naughty suggestions to you?\u201d He gripped her chin and forced her to meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cYes, Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery time you say that, Cherry, it goes straight to my cock. You like his suggestions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Her breath hitched.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s experiment,\u201d Xander murmured for her ears only. \u201cI\u2019d love to lick your creamy little pussy while I watch you suck his cock. Would you like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you said,\u201d Logan directed at Xander, \u201cshe just got a whole bunch wetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a dirty girl.\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded and released her with a wicked smile, and Tara caught her breath. \u201cLet\u2019s see how dirty.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, she felt Xander\u2019s fingers on her pussy, searching, sinking deep, before circling her clit in lip-biting little circles.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come for us, baby?\u201d Logan murmured, spreading kisses across her face, down her neck, then bending to trace his tongue around her clamped nipples.</p><p>Her breath caught, froze, at the exquisite sensations racing between her breasts and wet sex. \u201cYes, Logan. Please . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww,\u201d Xander crooned as he speared her pussy with two fingers. \u201cShe even said please. How sweet.\u201d Then, with a mischievous smile, he withdrew his fingers from her slit and licked them with a groan. \u201cVery, very sweet.\u201d</p><p>She flushed all over, tension coiling up under the tight knot of her clit until she thought she\u2019d explode.</p><p>\u201cXander,\u201d Logan growled in warning.</p><p>\u201cJust checking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Logan vowed. \u201cEver.\u201d</p><p>Tara understood his message loud and clear, but he shot her a warning, just in case\u2014an emphatic declaration that, while he\u2019d let Xander touch her for training purposes, there was no fucking way that Logan would ever let it go beyond this right now.</p><p>As hot as this scene was, that fact relieved her. Knowing he had no further expectations of what she\u2019d do with or for Xander allowed her to simply relax and enjoy whatever came next.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know . . .\u201d Xander groused. \u201cJust enjoying it while I can.\u201d</p><p>And he did, gliding his fingers back inside her. Instantly, he found her G-spot and rubbed, his thumb still circling her clit.</p><p>As Logan caressed her sensitive breasts, her body caught fire again. It swept through her like a conflagration that she couldn\u2019t control.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come before I give you permission,\u201d he reminded. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to spank you again tonight.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a deep breath, closed her eyes to focus inward.</p><p>\u201cNo. Look at me,\u201d Logan barked. \u201cAlways at me.\u201d</p><p>Tara opened her eyes, lashes fluttering. Logan grasped her chin and lifted her face to him for another deep, mad kiss\u2014a tangle of tongues and passion, breaths and desperation. And, God, the need that seized her every muscle as he removed the first of her weighted clamps and blood roared back into her nipple.</p><p>Suddenly, he tore his mouth away and fastened it over the throbbing little bud. A second later, he removed the other clamp, and suddenly Xander\u2019s mouth was there to breathe more fire into the aching tips of her breasts. Both men sucked gently on her nipples as Xander plucked at her aching clit with lazy fingers and teased her mercilessly.</p><p>She groaned, clenched tight, trying to fight the lure of the pleasure roaring inside her as her heartbeat boomed like a cannon in her ear. With her gaze riveted to Logan\u2019s and his thick-fringed blue eyes silently shouting of untold pleasure, Tara nearly lost her restraint.</p><p>\u201cCherry, come now!\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Instantly, ecstasy bloomed inside her, expanding outward, alighting every nerve ending in her body. Like a leaf in the wind, she swayed, arched, but the pleasure kept bowling her over as the men suckled her nipples. She jolted, and her clit pulsed again and again under Xander\u2019s deft fingers.</p><p>Slowly, Tara came down, her body releasing the gripping tension by degrees until she fell lax. Logan was there to support her weight as her legs went boneless beneath her. Suddenly, she became aware of people clapping\u2014and suddenly remembered the audience. She stiffened.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Logan murmured, caressing her cheek. \u201cThat was so sweet, Cherry. You did great.\u201d</p><p>Lacking the energy to reply, she merely nodded as Xander opened her shackles.</p><p>The instant her arms were free, Logan was there to catch her. He picked her up, cradling her against his chest, then rushed off the stage, past the crowd stumbling to get out of his way. With groundeating strides, he darted toward the secured door that led to the restricted areas of the club, fusing his mouth over hers. His demanding lips, every caress of his tongue, shouted his need for her with eloquent silence.</p><p>When he reached the door, he tore his mouth away reluctantly, those blue eyes burning for her.</p><p>\u201cCherry, I\u2019ve got to have you now.\u201d</p><p>Fresh heat flared through her at his words. The orgasm he and Xander had given her on stage should have sated her, but knowing that he intended to be deep inside her in mere seconds awakened all her nerve endings and hot fantasies again.</p><p>He fished a key card out of his pocket and handed it to her. \u201cUnlock the door.\u201d</p><p>With shaking hands, Tara grabbed the card and swiped it through the apparatus. A quiet click resounded over the din of the crowd noise in the background. Then Logan yanked the door open and charged through it like a bull.</p><p>On the other side, he grabbed the handle and slammed it shut, then shoved her against the adjacent wall. Tara felt her heart beating triple time as he covered her naked body with his overwhelming heat. His stare singed her with intent, telling her silently that he intended to get inside deep, drive her to screaming pleasure, and leave her no doubt who she belonged to.</p><p>\u201cYou want to say your safe word now?\u201d His voice was gravelly, strained.</p><p>Her stomach tightened. Her pussy clenched. \u201cNo, Logan.\u201d</p><p>Triumph mixed with his predatory stare. That hot lust on his face turned the ache brewing in her clit to a burn. He\u2019d show her no mercy, and she didn\u2019t want any.</p><p>Logan unfastened his leather pants, watching her with that unflinching gaze. With one hand, he lifted her against his body and braced her back against the wall. \u201cSpread your legs. Put them around my waist.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tara didn\u2019t hesitate, pulsing with an impatient thrill. Within an instant, he held the stalk of his cock in his free hand and lined it up to her weeping entrance.</p><p>\u201cCherry, baby . . .\u201d His hands clinched around her waist, then shoved her down on his cock, one hot, uncompromising inch at a time.</p><p>He sank into her, stretching her with the perfect tingle of pleasure and just the right bite of pain. He shuddered as he filled her. Tara focused entirely on him, flowered around his cock. She cried out, digging her nails into his back as fire seared its way through her blood.</p><p>\u201cFuck, yes, Cherry.\u201d The low groan sounded as if it had been ripped from his chest.</p> <p>Except for his panting and pounding heart, he remained totally still, as if he could absorb her into his body. But Tara needed him now. With a whimper, she wriggled on him, pleading for more.</p><p>\u201cGive me a second, baby. I\u2019m trying to find some restraint so I don\u2019t fuck you raw.\u201d</p><p>His words, the uncontrolled passion in his growl, made her sheath flutter around him in hunger, her blood sear with scalding desire. \u201cDon\u2019t hold back for me.\u201d</p><p>His entire body taut, Logan fisted his hand in her hair and forced her gaze to his. His expression was a silent warning that she shouldn\u2019t have given him such free license. But that didn\u2019t stop him from gripping her hips, lifting her up, then slamming her body down helplessly on his steely length.</p><p>The friction of his cock plowed through her sensitive sex. Her body flared with white-hot life. But he didn\u2019t go slowly, linger. Logan shoved her up again, then savagely pushed her down as he arched into her cunt, working even deeper than before.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like being inside you, Cherry.\u201d</p><p>And no one fueled her need like Logan when he filled every empty space inside her.</p><p>\u201cI fantasize about fucking you all the time, about waking you up to the feel of my cock deep in your sweet little pussy. I get hard all over thinking about laying you across my table and taking my dessert between your legs. I come wishing I could take you back to my bed and shackle you to it, then spend all night, every night, inside you, pounding away until you want me half as much as I crave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Tara groaned.</p><p>His words burned through her until she swore she was on the edge of combusting. Her every sense felt attuned to him, the hard rhythm of his hot breaths as he lifted her and thrust deep, the chugging of his heart. The smell of earth, manly sweat, and musky spice filled her head, mingling with the bite of his fingers on her hips, controlling her every move.</p><p>\u201cAh, your pussy clamped down on me, Cherry. You like that? You like the thought that I want to possess you constantly, in every way possible? Because I do. I\u2019m fucking obsessed with it.\u201d He pulled on her hair, arching her neck for him. Raking his teeth across the sensitive skin, he kissed his way up to her ear. \u201cI want to suck your nipples hard every chance I get. I fantasize about that, and about binding you so that I can open up that pretty lush ass for me\u2014and me alone.\u201d</p> <p>More heat clawed through her body. Every one of his words drove up higher. Her body tightened desperately on his cock, and he had to work twice as hard to maintain those rhythmic strokes that were unraveling her one at a time. But Logan wasn\u2019t faltering. He just kept filling her one deep thrust after another as her sheath clung and rippled.</p><p>Sweat beaded at his temples, ran down his neck. \u201cYou ready to come, baby? I need you.\u201d</p><p>Nothing could have set her off faster than hearing the raspy demand in his voice. Suddenly, the ache between her legs gathered, heated, then boiled over until it became a fire that consumed her whole body. She tossed back her head and screamed, feeling Logan\u2019s straining shoulders beneath her fingertips.</p><p>His pace quickened, a brutal shuttling of his hard stalk inside her clenching pussy. He grunted every time he plunged deep, nudging her cervix, rolling a new orgasm over her before the last one had even finished.</p><p>Fingers digging into her ass, he stilled inside her, cock pulsing as he released deep inside her, shouting, \u201cCherry!\u201d</p><p>Tara clung to Logan tighter. God, she couldn\u2019t catch her breath, and tears stung her eyes. In every word and deed this week, he\u2019d told her that he still had feelings for her\u2014strong ones. Real ones. She was supposed to be helping him get over their past while he taught her everything she needed for this mission. But nothing between them felt that way. She was losing herself in him. The connection between them kept growing, like vines curling through her chest until they nearly wrapped around her heart.</p><p>God, she couldn\u2019t afford to fall in love with Logan again, not now. Probably not ever.</p><p>Gingerly, he lifted her off his still-hard penis and set her on her feet. Semen dripped down her thighs, triggering a realization. She froze.</p> <p>\u201cDid I hurt you, baby?\u201d he sounded half panicked by the prospect as he took her face in his hands, gaze delving deep.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t use a condom.\u201d A wave of memory swept through her. \u201cWe haven\u2019t used one at all.\u201d</p><p>Logan closed his eyes, winced. \u201cI should say I\u2019m sorry, but I . . . haven\u2019t been able to bring myself to put barriers between us. I\u2019m clean and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been on the pill for a while, but with everything that\u2019s been happening I\u2019ve forgotten to take it the last two days.\u201d</p><p>His face softened and he actually looked thrilled. \u201cI\u2019m ready for whatever happens.\u201d</p><p>Tara blinked in shock. They might be playing Russian roulette with her womb, and he was okay with that? The steadiness of his deep, direct gaze told her that he was completely serious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love our baby every bit as much as I love you.\u201d</p><p>When he said things like that, she melted all over. It was hard to remember that his affection was most likely past emotions lingering before a soft death, rather than the resurgence of secret devotion roaring to life again.</p><p>Unless she was totally underestimating his feelings for her.</p><p>Before she could reply, a whoosh and a click from the other side of the door had Logan scrambling to tuck himself back in his pants and zip them up so he could stand protectively in front of her naked body.</p><p>Thorpe and the black-haired stranger made their way through the door, stopping short at the sight of them, perspiring and disheveled.</p><p>The club owner gave them the once-over, then handed Tara\u2019s little silk robe to Logan. \u201cDress your . . . trainee and come to my office. We have problems.\u201d</p><p>When Thorpe would have turned away, Logan gripped the man\u2019s arm, staying him. \u201cTara did a damn fine job tonight. A few hesitations, yes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem is way beyond whatever is going on with the two of you, Edgington.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe\u2019s gray stare wasn\u2019t angry, but ice cold. That, along with the presence of the stranger beside her, told Tara that something was very wrong.</p><p>Terror gripped her throat until she nearly couldn\u2019t speak. \u201cIs this about Darcy, Sir?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, glanced at the stranger, then nodded.</p><p>Terrible images pelted her, one after the other, as Logan draped her in the robe, then wrapped his arms around her, providing shelter, comfort. He sent Thorpe a grave gaze. \u201cGive us a minute, and we\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>LOGAN didn\u2019t have a good feeling about this. After cleaning Cherry with a warm, wet washcloth, he pushed aside her trembling fingers and helped her dress quickly. Once done, they left the room, and she settled into a grim silence.</p><p>He took her hand, wrapping her cold fingers in his. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that Darcy is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admitted, her face taut and pale. \u201cBut something is very wrong.\u201d</p><p>Unable to refute that, Logan guided her toward Thorpe\u2019s office. Xander entered the secure area, glanced their way, and frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, dude? And don\u2019t say \u2018nothing\u2019 because one look at Tara and I know that\u2019s a lie.\u201d</p><p>His friend meant well, but now wasn\u2019t the time. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. Might have something to do with Cherry\u2019s case.\u201d</p><p>Xander nodded. \u201cIf I can do anything to help, let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, man.\u201d</p><p>Guiding her down the hall, he and Tara entered Thorpe\u2019s office and shut the door behind them. Thorpe sat, resting his chin on his steepled fingers, his mouth a thin white line. A snowy envelope lay on the desk in front of him. The dark stranger in the suit paced the side of the room like a caged animal.</p><p>Both gazes rested on Tara, and Logan instinctively wrapped his arm around her.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Edgington,\u201d Thorpe snapped. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tear into her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he behaved this way since he began training her?\u201d the stranger asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you have something to say,\u201d Logan growled, \u201cyou say it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d Thorpe demanded of both of them.</p><p>Cherry did so quickly\u2014a submissive\u2019s internal urge to respond to a Dominant\u2019s command. Logan had no such urge, but the look on the club owner\u2019s face warned that arguing now would only be counterproductive to solving the problems at hand.</p><p>Glaring at the stranger in the corner, Logan sat beside Cherry, gripping her hand again.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Thorpe said, tapping his toe against the concrete floor.</p><p>He was edgy, wired-up. Since Thorpe was usually one of the fucking calmest customers Logan had ever met, that worried the shit out of him.</p><p>\u201cYou want to tell us what\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Thorpe shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m trying to decide where to start. The night has turned into one giant clusterfuck.\u201d</p><p>The stranger stepped toward Tara, his dark eyes dissecting her. \u201cI think introductions are in order first.\u201d</p><p>When he stuck out his hand toward her, Logan tensed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jon Bocelli.\u201d</p><p>Her new boss. Cherry rose to her feet and shook his hand, chin raised confidently. But Logan knew she had to be cringing at the thought that her boss had both seen her in an act of public submission and in the aftermath of passion. Yes, she\u2019d been training for a dangerous assignment, but responses like hers couldn\u2019t be feigned. Logan vowed to pull Bocelli aside if necessary and explain that the sex against the wall, which her boss would likely see as misconduct, had been his own fault.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you, Agent Jacobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdgington,\u201d Bocelli greeted, hand outstretched.</p><p>Logan shook it as Tara said, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you in from D.C. Do you have news about Darcy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019ll come back to that. I flew into Dallas to check your progress and ask you a few questions.\u201d</p><p>Tara swallowed, and Logan could sense her nerves. He longed to grab her hand again and squeeze it, just to let her know that he was here for her. But it could be construed as a lack of faith on his part or seem unprofessional in front of her boss, and the last thing he wanted to do now was undermine her when she must feel as if she already had a strike against her.</p><p>\u201cFire away, sir.\u201d</p><p>Bocelli gestured at her to sit, and she complied once more, her gaze pinging around her room. The tension was thick, and Tara was too smart to miss the fact that they were tight-lipped about something.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Agent York today?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, cocked her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t contacted you at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She turned to Thorpe. \u201cIsn\u2019t he training with Axel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t seen Agent York since last night.\u201d</p><p>Bocelli cut in. \u201cA quick search of his apartment revealed a very orderly place, but some of his clothes are gone. His suitcase and toiletries are missing. His dog is nowhere to be found. Nothing looks disturbed. The door was locked right and tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left voluntarily?\u201d Tara frowned.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it appears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobert took the death of the first victim, Laken Fox, pretty hard. I\u2019m not suggesting he cracked. Maybe he needed a day or two . . .\u201d She trailed off with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cI hear that Agents York and Miles were romantically involved. Any reason you didn\u2019t share that with me when I assigned him to this case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask. Darcy asked me to keep it on the down low, but I didn\u2019t think it would take you long to figure it out. Besides, no one, other than me, would fight harder to get Darcy back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now York has disappeared.\u201d Bocelli raised a dark brow, pinning her with a stare that stopped just short of accusing. \u201cAnything else you\u2019re holding back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I don\u2019t think for one second that he\u2019s given up on finding Darcy alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it possible he knows something we don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re not close. But he knows I\u2019d do anything to help him save Darcy, so I believe he\u2019d tell me about any new developments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope he\u2019d tell us all, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that he\u2019s missing, probably of his own accord.\u201d Bocelli\u2019s dark gaze shifted from Tara to Logan. \u201cAgent Jacobs did well in public, far better, I gather, than she would have before you took her under your wing. Is she ready?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tara shot him a glance filled with quiet plea. Logan understood her need to impress her new boss, but he wasn\u2019t going to compromise her safety. \u201cNot quite. I haven\u2019t had the chance to put her through all the exercises she\u2019ll likely need. There\u2019s still some hesitation and fear.\u201d</p><p>Back ramrod straight, Tara settled into the far side of her chair, away from him. Oh yeah, she wasn\u2019t happy with that response.</p><p>Nodding, Bocelli appeared to mull his reply. \u201cCouldn\u2019t she pass as a slightly bratty sub in need of a firm hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but even if you could find York, like I\u2019ve been saying for two days, he couldn\u2019t handle her. Tara isn\u2019t ready to face unknown Doms. Her trust is . . . fragile.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour demonstration tonight proves aptly that she trusts you.\u201d</p><p>The fact that even an outsider could sense that thrilled Logan, but he knew there were chinks in their armor. \u201cWe\u2019re getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the twenty questions?\u201d Tara demanded. \u201cClearly, you\u2019re not thinking of aborting the mission, given this verbal fishing expedition about my readiness. But if Robert is gone, we have to devise another plan. I understand our options are limited. I\u2019ll do whatever needs to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAxel, Logan, and I have had a few conference calls since Logan assumed your training,\u201d Thorpe admitted. \u201cWe\u2019ve suspected for some time that Agent York wasn\u2019t going to be successful in the role of your Dom, so we\u2019ve been devising a plan B.\u201d</p><p>Tara blinked. Something in her manner made Logan think that she couldn\u2019t decide whether she was happy that the mission to rescue her friend would move forward despite York\u2019s absence or furious that no one had kept her apprised. Probably a bit of both.</p> <p>She licked her lips. \u201cAnd that would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d Logan confessed.</p><p>\u201cAt least that was the idea,\u201d Thorpe said.</p><p>\u201cWas?\u201d Logan glared at the club owner. With York\u2019s disappearance, didn\u2019t that make their backup plan more the most viable option.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t work for the FBI,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>To Logan\u2019s relief, she didn\u2019t seem pissed about the idea, just hung up on procedure.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s taken some jumping through hoops, but I\u2019ve got the brass to approve using Edgington as a military contractor to assist with this mission,\u201d Bocelli assured. \u201cHe\u2019s got the unique skill set necessary, and I think that bond brewing between you two will allow you to submit as needed and create a more convincing cover.\u201d</p><p>Tara flushed, but looked a bit relieved; Logan relaxed.</p><p>\u201cI understand, sir,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t let your feelings interfere with this case. If you want to fuck him in your spare time, that\u2019s on you. But once you hit that resort, you keep your eye on the mission.\u201d</p><p>Logan could see Tara both flushing and restraining her temper. In truth, he wanted to rip Bocelli a new one, too, but that wouldn\u2019t do Tara a damn bit of good.</p><p>Instead, he leaned forward and met her boss\u2019s stare straight on. \u201cWe\u2019ll get the job done, but whatever happens between us will contribute to our \u2018convincing cover,\u2019 so don\u2019t knock it.\u201d</p><p>Tara thanked him with a silent stare, and Logan nodded, happy to defend her in whatever way he could.</p><p>\u201cYour role on this mission has become more complicated. I have something you need to see.\u201d Thorpe reached for the envelope on his desk. He toyed with it between his long fingers, as if considering, then held it out to Logan. \u201cA man wearing shades and a dark hoodie paid Misty to give this to you just after Tara\u2019s public submission. When she couldn\u2019t find you because you were . . . busy, she found Xander, who found me. She said this dude gave her the creeps. By the time I got it, too many people had touched it to bother dusting it for prints, so you can touch it. None of the security cameras got a good look at the guy\u2019s face. We already checked. Do you know what the hell this is about?\u201d</p> <p>With a frown, Logan took the envelope and ripped it open. Clearly, Thorpe had already been into it himself. For the moment, Logan shoved down his irritation and withdrew the piece of paper inside.</p><p>Have you forgotten my warning? Stay away from Tara. Or she dies.</p><p>Horror froze Logan\u2019s entire body. His mother\u2019s killer was still keeping tabs on him a dozen years later?</p><p>He sucked in a breath, then turned to look at his Cherry, who watched him expectantly. This was a complication they fucking didn\u2019t need. Thorpe\u2019s and Bocelli\u2019s silent gazes settled on him. They were leaving the next move to him, allowing him to bow out if he wanted.</p><p>No way was he making the same mistake he\u2019d made a dozen years ago. At sixteen, he couldn\u2019t begin to protect Tara. At twentyeight? Bring it on. This time, he\u2019d handle everything differently. Whoever this motherfucker was, Logan couldn\u2019t wait to take him apart.</p><p>He handed the note to Tara. Quickly, her eyes scanned the page, then she gasped.</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s killer is back?\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded, feeling his back teeth grind. \u201cThis reads like his work, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018back\u2019? You\u2019ve received notes like this one before?\u201d Bocelli asked.</p><p>\u201cNot since high school.\u201d Logan grabbed Tara\u2019s hand because he needed to feel her, then met her boss\u2019s gaze and told him about his mother\u2019s murder and the subsequent fallout. \u201cIt\u2019s a complication, but not a problem. I\u2019ll handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe may have to rethink this, Edgington. This is someone determined, who\u2019s followed you for years and watched your scene with Tara tonight. He may follow you to Florida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom everything you\u2019ve told me, Fantasy Key isn\u2019t easy to get into,\u201d Logan argued. No way was his involvement in this mission going to unravel now. He couldn\u2019t send Tara in without an experienced Dom to protect her\u2014and he refused to let this asshole come between him and the woman he loved a second time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Bocelli conceded. \u201cWe had to pull a lot of strings to bypass the six month waiting list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe may have another alternative.\u201d Thorpe rose and crossed the room, opening the door, only to stop short. \u201cEavesdropping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I couldn\u2019t make myself stop.\u201d</p><p>Xander. Thorpe was going to suggest that his best friend replace him? Oh, hell no.</p><p>Thorpe led him in, and Xander leaned against the wall, brow raised.</p><p>\u201cYou assisted Edgington during the scene,\u201d Bocelli said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The Fed extended a hand and introduced himself. After the pleasantries, Bocelli briefed Xander on the base facts of their mission to Fantasy Key. Xander listened without expression or comment.</p><p>\u201cI could definitely help. I worked there off and on for three years.\u201d</p><p>No shit? Logan stared at his pal. He didn\u2019t talk much about his past. He\u2019d grown up in L.A. and left home young\u2014and refused to say why. Logan knew a few things about Xander\u2019s past, like the fact that he\u2019d worked at a BDSM resort, but details had been nonexistent.</p><p>\u201cThe private resort you topped at . . . that was Fantasy Key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Xander turned to Bocelli. \u201cI still have friends there. They\u2019re good people. If there\u2019s something bad going down, I\u2019d like to help.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe turned to Bocelli. \u201cThat\u2019s a plus. And your agent needs a strong, experienced Dom she can trust to lead her through the resort\u2019s activities and hopefully attract the notice of the scumbags behind the illegal activity. Xander can do that. And he doesn\u2019t bring an extra threat to the table, like Edgington.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s first response was towering rage. After angling for nearly two days solid to accompany Tara on this mission, no way was he backing down in favor of his buddy.</p><p>But nothing Thorpe said was incorrect. In his shoes, Logan figured he\u2019d be making the same suggestion. It still pissed him off, but he had to think about Cherry. Did he want what was most advantageous for his future with her or what was best for her safety?</p><p>\u201cSince Xander has already touched her,\u201d Thorpe added, \u201cshe\u2019s familiar with him on some level. You saw she responded well to him during her public submission. In fact, he got her off. So they could make their way convincingly enough through sex, if necessary.\u201d</p><p>Xander and Cherry? Oh, fuck no! Logan wanted to rip the club owner in two. Beside him, Tara tried to school her expression, but a flush crept up her face.</p><p>Xander cleared his throat. \u201cMy first thought was simply to ask some of my friends to help you. But you might be right, Thorpe. I know most everyone there, not to mention each nook and cranny of the place. I know how to manipulate the security.\u201d He turned to Tara. \u201cBut . . . I think I could be pretty good with you, and we don\u2019t have any history to overcome.\u201d</p><p>Logan couldn\u2019t refute any of Xander\u2019s words, having topped others at Fantasy Key and knowing the people inside would lend credibility to their cover. No one would think it odd that Xander showed up with a sub. Hell, he might even get a discount.</p><p>\u201cAny military or law enforcement in your background?\u201d Bocelli barked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m a black belt and I\u2019m good with a gun. I wouldn\u2019t let anything happen to her.\u201d Xander sent a reassuring glance at Cherry, who bit her lip, clearly thinking things through.</p><p>This situation was killing Logan, but he had to put Tara first. \u201cMy role is to support Agent Jacobs. She doesn\u2019t need my military background to do her job, but if Xander will prove more useful and bring less complication\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever necessary, but I\u2019m more likely to maintain my cover at this resort if I feel really comfortable. If Xander can help us with information or inside connections, great. But I\u2019ve trained with Logan. Despite everything else, going with him makes more sense.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s heart melted. Underneath all the complexities of their past and this case, she truly trusted him to keep her safe, even in the face of a threat. That thrilled him to death and gave him a foundation to build on, but none of that mattered if she didn\u2019t come home alive.</p><p>\u201cCherry, the guy who killed my mother is a smart psychopath. I see Thorpe\u2019s point about not borrowing more trouble now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so, but he probably lacks the clout necessary to get into the resort at the last minute,\u201d Tara argued. \u201cAnd since Fantasy Key has such tight security, this killer won\u2019t be sneaking on the grounds while we\u2019re undercover. Being on this mission will probably be the safest place for me.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe shrugged, glancing at Bocelli. \u201cSEALs aren\u2019t exactly pussies, and Edgington is a tough bastard. He\u2019s capable of doing whatever necessary to keep your agent safe. But you knew that or you wouldn\u2019t have run him up the FBI\u2019s internal flagpole.\u201d</p><p>Still, Bocelli remained wordless, his face giving nothing away.</p><p>\u201cMy life for Tara\u2019s.\u201d Logan stood and braced his hands on Thorpe\u2019s desk, leveling a grave stare at the Fed. \u201cI swear it. I\u2019ll come home in a pine box before I let anything happen to her.\u201d</p><p>Behind him, Tara gasped. He couldn\u2019t turn his attention to her now, not when he had a point to make.</p><p>\u201cThis is my job, Logan. Not yours. If there\u2019s danger, I\u2019ll face it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell. If you\u2019re in it, I\u2019m in it, too, Cherry. I\u2019ll protect you with my dying breath.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze skittered away, and he couldn\u2019t tell if she was touched or horrified. Probably both.</p><p>Bocelli didn\u2019t like the situation, Logan could tell. He paced Thorpe\u2019s office in silence, clearly running scenarios in his head. Finally, he turned back. \u201cGetting my superiors to approve Xander as her partner would be a harder sell, since he\u2019s neither law enforcement nor military. And a change now would delay the mission.\u201d</p><p>Tara\u2019s face reflected the relief that Logan felt.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Edgington, you stay. But there are parameters. First, I\u2019m going to put a few agents nearby, as close as I can get them. They\u2019ll be invisible to you, but will serve as backup and be armed to the teeth.\u201d</p><p>Logan cast a glance at Tara, who nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re okay with that.\u201d</p><p>Bocelli turned. \u201cXander, can you help us decide where the agents are best placed and how to get management to insert them there without tipping anyone off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll be in touch. You\u2019re excused.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a subtle dismissal, but Xander let himself out.</p><p>Bocelli looked back at Logan. \u201cNow, we discuss your behavior.\u201d</p><p>Swallowing back what he really wanted to say, Logan merely raised a brow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious you have feelings for my agent that run deep. I don\u2019t give a shit about the details. And if you\u2019re mentally prepping a denial, don\u2019t. I\u2019m not stupid. But you\u2019re going to have to shelve those feelings during this mission. Agent Jacobs can\u2019t be a target for these people unless they believe she\u2019s going to be easy to pluck away from you. You\u2019ll pose as a new couple, and you\u2019ll seem less than committed to her. Have a roving eye, wander off to chase other subs\u2014whatever. The kidnappers have to believe that you won\u2019t move heaven and earth to find her if she disappears.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As much as Logan hated to admit it, Bocelli was right. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou damn well better succeed. Treat her as if she\u2019s disposable. Be dismissive, detached. You have to leave her vulnerable so the kidnappers think she\u2019s an easy mark.\u201d</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t like it one damn bit . . . but that was reality. \u201cI\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>The Fed turned to Tara. \u201cYou have to seem adoring with a hint of rebellion. As we\u2019ve done more research, we\u2019ve learned that the two victims so far, besides Darcy, both had Doms but neither had been in a long-term relationship. By all accounts, none had family who would miss them. Only one was employed outside her home, and she\u2019d been gone for days before anyone reported her missing. You\u2019ll need to be self-employed for your cover. Any ideas?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI spent some time as a freelance copyeditor in college. I can speak intelligently about it if the subject comes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Realistically, you would have had deadlines, but cleared them before coming to Fantasy Key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Tara\u2019s boss paced more, his whole Brooks Brothers vibe just adding to the image of a stressed-out Fed. He turned to Logan. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely sure you want to go, despite this threat?\u201d</p><p>He planned to fight for Tara, and she wanted him by her side. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>Bocelli glanced Tara\u2019s way. \u201cIf his mother\u2019s killer follows and somehow finds his way onto the resort, you understand this makes you his target, in addition to being set up to be abducted by these slavers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I\u2019m willing to assume the risk. Logan will be the best Dom for me on this case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know that if the killer can\u2019t sneak into Fantasy Key, he probably isn\u2019t going to call it a day and leave you alone once you\u2019ve returned home?\u201d her boss asked.</p><p>\u201cIt should be a nonissue once we\u2019ve finished this mission. Mr. Edgington and I . . . We\u2019ll be going our separate ways.\u201d</p><p>What the fuck? Logan turned to stare at her as if she\u2019d lost her ever-loving mind, because clearly she had. Tara would spend the rest of her life without him over his dead body. But he\u2019d correct her gross misconception later; now wasn\u2019t the time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re willing to assume the extra risk?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSir, with all due respect, it\u2019s not as if we have better options. Robert is gone, Darcy\u2019s abduction has proven that it\u2019s not good to go undercover alone, and Logan is well trained to handle all phases of this mission. Can we end this conversation now so that we can prepare for our departure Wednesday? I\u2019m sure Logan has a lot of training he\u2019d like to cram in before then.\u201d</p><p>Bocelli raised a brow. \u201cFine. You\u2019re both in. If you\u2019ve duly noted all the risks, I have nothing left to say on that score. Now to the evening\u2019s biggest problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy?\u201d That note of alarm crept back in Tara\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cYes. One of your fellow analysts found this online advertisement about noon today. We were running a new program that checks the web for certain key words and images that tap into our open cases. We found this.\u201d Bocelli turned to Thorpe.</p><p>The club\u2019s owner grabbed his laptop from the corner of the desk and pressed a few buttons before turning the screen toward him and Tara. Logan watched with horror as a bound woman wearing too much makeup around her glassy eyes\u2014and nothing else\u2014was fondled by four hooded, leather-clad men.</p><p>\u201cDarcy . . .\u201d Tara\u2019s broken whisper rang with fear and pain. \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>Logan hurt for her. How terrible it must be to see a loved one at the mercy of strangers willing to degrade her for a sick thrill\u2014and profit.</p><p>Then it got worse as the ad\u2019s words began to scroll across the screen.</p> <p>Tara gasped, slapping a hand over her mouth as she read.</p><p>Another rung of horror gripped Logan. \u201cThey\u2019re going to force her to star in a snuff film?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gang rape snuff film, yes.\u201d</p><p>Her face turned ashen. \u201cThey\u2019re going to strangle her while they . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Bocelli confirmed grimly. \u201cFriday night. It\u2019s a payper-view event, then they\u2019ll distribute through all their usual illegal channels. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll kill her on U.S. soil since it would likely be too easy to trace their location via IP addresses and whatnot, so we have to find her before they smuggle her out of the country. So you\u2019re leaving tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>Beside Logan, Tara stiffened but nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be ready,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. I\u2019ll provide you some last-minute instruction. Your flight leaves just after nine in the morning. I want to see you back here by six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Logan assured as he stood, then held out his hand for Tara.</p><p>She glanced up at him, and though she did her best to hide it, he read the trepidation in her body language, the bleak line of her lips. Now that she was committed, the reality of this mission was setting in. It would only be natural for her to be afraid, especially since she had both white slavers and a killer after her. Still, she refused to back down. His brave little Cherry just kept on impressing the hell out of him.</p><p>Finally, she placed her hand in his, but the second she had her feet underneath her, she let go.</p><p>Frowning, Logan watched her approach Bocelli. \u201cI won\u2019t let you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe smart. Stay safe.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and as Thorpe approached her, she turned to him warily. Logan was taken aback when the notoriously chilly club owner pressed a kiss to her forehead. \u201cListen to your Dom and submit with honesty.\u201d</p><p>As Tara stepped back, she frowned. Logan wondered if she could even follow Thorpe\u2019s advice. Yesterday, she\u2019d been engaged to another man. Since then, she\u2019d fallen back into her first lover\u2019s bed, submitted to him again and again, and was about to place her safety in his hands as she put herself in the path of really dangerous men. She was confused and, no doubt, afraid.</p><p>Above all, she was burying her feelings, protecting herself after the hurt he\u2019d dealt her years ago.</p><p>The case was going to take time to unravel. He might have to act distant in public, but by damned, when they were alone, Logan was going to make her face exactly what was in her heart.</p><p>THE second they cleared Thorpe\u2019s office, Logan draped his arm around her and led her to his dungeon.</p><p>Tara shivered in the shadowy chill of the room as Logan raced around, collecting various items and yanking on his T-shirt. She made her way to the armoire, withdrew her bag, and turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give you permission to go,\u201d he pointed out sharply, suddenly by her side.</p><p>She glanced at her cell phone. \u201cIt\u2019s after midnight, and I\u2019ve been here since six this morning. I\u2019m tired, hungry, I want a shower, and I have a lot of thinking to do. We have to be here early tomorrow, and I haven\u2019t yet packed. You can resume your Dom thing tomorrow. Good night.\u201d</p><p>He extracted her duffle from her hands, disapproval all over his face. \u201cHere\u2019s how it\u2019s going to go, Cherry: Your boss basically gave you to me until the end of this mission. We\u2019re not slipping in and out of roles when it\u2019s convenient for you. I\u2019m the Dom, you\u2019re the sub, period. First, you wear what I say.\u201d</p><p>Logan studied her with a critical eye. \u201cGive me your undergarments and suit coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? I can\u2019t walk out of here without a bra. Everyone will know I\u2019m not wearing one. It\u2019s not like I won\u2019t jiggle under silk.\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow. \u201cYou\u2019ll be walking past everyone else who belongs to a fetish club to exit tonight. Every Dom in the place will see if you are wearing a bra and they\u2019ll know something is wrong. For all we know, someone out there could be involved in this shit. We\u2019ve managed to keep this training secret to all but a select few, but that might change if you can\u2019t be bothered to follow simple instructions. No fucking way are we dropping the pretense because you don\u2019t want to jiggle. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>Damn it, she hated that he was right. \u201cFine, but why can\u2019t I have my panties? No one will know if I have them on but me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll know. You\u2019re riding with me when we leave. If I want to touch you, I want full access. You\u2019ll give it to me, and that\u2019s the end of the discussion. You\u2019re going to get used to it or they\u2019ll figure us out all too quickly at Fantasy Key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you always have to push me, every moment of every day? When we\u2019re undercover, do whatever the hell you want. But this, tonight, you\u2019re just pressing your agenda and probably getting some real thrill out of bending me to your will.\u201d</p><p>He stalked closer, wrapped his hand around her hip. \u201cI\u2019m always going to get a thrill out of bending you to my will. I\u2019m just wired that way, baby. But I\u2019m also going to make damn sure that you\u2019re ready for whatever command I throw your way once we reach that fucking resort. If you want to argue about it some more, then expect another spanking the second we hit my door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Logan cocked his head to the side. \u201cYou don\u2019t actually think that, after someone watched you submit to me tonight then left me a note threatening to kill you, that I\u2019m going to leave you in that motel alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work for the FBI. I\u2019m not helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI totally agree, but that changes nothing. You\u2019re not staying at that dingy little motel, even if I tag along. My condo is far more secure. No one will get to you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially me. If you think I\u2019m not going to spend these last few hours holding you and telling you how special you are to me before I have to pretend otherwise, you\u2019re lying to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already . . . I mean, we\u2019ve had sex twice today.\u201d</p><p>Logan merely smiled. \u201cThird time\u2019s the charm.\u201d</p><p>Even as her mouth pursed mutinously, she blushed. \u201cI admit that it\u2019s not terribly safe at the motel. But maybe I should stay the night at my stepfather\u2019s place and meet you in the morning. I need some space, Logan. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to be around you tonight.\u201d</p><p>Logan sent her an uncompromising stare. \u201cYou know that staying with me is the safest option. I don\u2019t like you being obstinate, especially when it potentially compromises your safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about more than my physical safety, Logan. Seriously, I need peace and some time to come to terms with everything that\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. You get me instead. Take off the garments I\u2019ve instructed. We\u2019ll stop by the motel, check you out, pick up your things, and go to my place.\u201d</p><p>Tara wanted to taunt him that he couldn\u2019t make her, but she had no doubt that he\u2019d only pick her up and carry her out, regardless of how she felt.</p><p>\u201cGod, you can be such a bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He didn\u2019t even try to refute her. \u201cBut I\u2019m the bastard determined to keep you alive and prove that I love you. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>All but snarling, she yanked off her suit coat and panties, then struggled out of her bra without taking off her shirt. She tossed everything at Logan\u2014then gasped. Even the slightest movement of her silk blouse against her nipples sent a shiver through her. Quickly, the little buds hardened, stood up.</p><p>Logan noticed immediately and ran a thumb over one. \u201cSo fucking pretty. I can\u2019t wait to strip this off and get deep inside you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say things like that,\u201d she protested, but it sounded weak, even to her own ears.</p><p>Tara wanted him again, the force of her desire like a tornado swirling uncontrollably inside her. And it wasn\u2019t just the way he touched her; it was him. He alone commanded her body.</p><p>That was a hard realization, along with her growing awareness that her feelings weren\u2019t simply those of a girl pining for the first boy she\u2019d ever loved, but a woman desperately infatuated with a man destined to get over her eventually and move on with his life.</p><p>If she called him on it, he\u2019d only deny it. Logan could be a pit bull like that. He certainly had been in high school, and she hadn\u2019t been able to keep him. Extenuating circumstances aside, she doubted she\u2019d be able to hold him now. Hell, she hadn\u2019t even been able to make Brad happy. How would she ever please a man like Logan for long? It was just the case throwing them together. He\u2019d figure that out soon.</p><p>She swallowed down the crushing sadness, focusing on anger. It, at least, was safe.</p><p>\u201cJust shut up and let\u2019s go.\u201d She stepped into her skirt and shoes, ridiculously aware of her nudity beneath her clothes, and headed for the door.</p><p>With every step, she bounced and jiggled. The silk lining of her skirt brushed the sensitive cheeks of her ass. Even her thighs took notice of the sudden stimulation. And those nipples that Logan had stroked hard again? They reveled in every sensual slide of the fabric, engorging even more. Tara gritted her teeth, wondering if she\u2019d make it out to the parking lot without shoving his pants down and demanding sex. That would serve him right. She frowned. Or was that his plan? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a sharp economy of movement, he locked up the cabinet, then followed her, locking the dungeon door behind him. In silence, they headed to the club\u2019s common areas, and Tara couldn\u2019t stop herself from looking around, wondering if the scum who\u2019d murdered Logan\u2019s mother\u2014and wanted to kill her\u2014was watching her even now. Around her, the music thumped and bodies gyrated on the floor in the distance as others played out scenes full of their favorite kink. Logan himself continually scanned the crowds, looking for trouble. Thorpe and Bocelli, along with Axel and Jason, had all fanned around the room and were scanning the guests.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s smart, he\u2019s long gone,\u201d she murmured over her shoulder.</p><p>Logan was right there with a hand at the small of her back. He bumped her side, and she felt the unmistakable outline of a gun. \u201cIf he\u2019s not, I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Her FBI-issued piece was in her purse, tucked against her side. If there were danger, she\u2019d be ready, too.</p> <p>Quickly, Logan hustled her to the door. The anxiety that balled her stomach didn\u2019t start to unravel until they were secure in his truck and were backing out of the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cWhat will happen to my car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask Thorpe to bring it by my condo while you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>So she\u2019d have to retrieve it when they returned from the mission. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he just take it to Adam\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod damn it, Cherry.\u201d He turned to her with not just anger on his harshly angled face, but hurt. \u201cWhy are you trying so hard to avoid talking or thinking about our future after this mission? You\u2019re crazy if you think we don\u2019t have feelings between us to hash out when all this is over. You told your boss that we were going our separate ways afterward. That\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou made a deal,\u201d she objected, both thrilled and terrified that Logan seemed so determined to pursue her.</p><p>\u201cWhich you violated when you argued with me about your wardrobe choice five minutes ago, among other things. Since you pushed back, I\u2019m coming after you. End of conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand you. I\u2019m all for helping you move on from the past and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s okay if I try to fuck you out of my system. I just can\u2019t try to love my way back into your heart?\u201d</p><p>His ugly question made her wince. \u201cYou\u2019re totally misunderstanding me. I just don\u2019t . . . I don\u2019t want to get hurt again, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurting and losing you the first time damn near killed me. I won\u2019t let it happen again.\u201d</p> <p>Tara sat back in her seat, watching the sparse Dallas traffic slide by. It was warm, despite being nearly one in the morning. But the vibe across the seat was chilly.</p><p>Was Logan serious? He seemed so free with his feelings. Then again, he had been in high school, too. She\u2019d spent so many years since then thinking he was a liar and a user. Knowing why he\u2019d dumped her helped, but everything was happening so fast. Still, she couldn\u2019t deny that Logan had spent five celibate years. Missing her? It seemed so. She sighed, not certain how to process it now. She was exhausted.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m doing my best to believe you, but let me catch up. You\u2019ve had twelve years to reconcile the reason for our split. I\u2019ve had twelve hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatience isn\u2019t high on my list of attributes, but I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d Logan sighed. \u201cYou hungry, Cherry?\u201d</p><p>The food would probably do her good, but she shook her head. \u201cI just want to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Logan grunted, but said nothing else as he drove to her motel room. When she found the key at the bottom of her purse, Logan grabbed it, opened the door, then flipped on the light.</p><p>\u201cSon of a fucking bitch.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p> <p>Nearby motel\u2014Saturday night/Sundaymorning</p><p>TARA peeked around the bulging cap of Logan\u2019s broad shoulder and was stunned to find the dingy little motel room completely turned upside down.</p><p>On second thought, maybe she should have seen this coming. Bocelli had warned her that the asshole who had killed Logan\u2019s mother wasn\u2019t the kind to give up. Clearly, this guy had been watching her. As much as she wanted to believe that her room being trashed had been a random vandal\u2019s act, it felt like a maniac\u2019s rage. He wanted to scare her off.</p><p>The drapes had been half pulled from their rod and sat askew over the achingly clean window. Both pillows had been cut open, the stuffing bulging from threadbare cases. The sheets were stained with red paint. Her suitcase had been sliced in half and her clothing strewn everywhere.</p><p>Logan drew a SIG SAUER from his shoulder holster, barely hidden by a dark blue windbreaker. \u201cStay out here in the hall, right under the light, Cherry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d She reached into her purse and pulled out her Glock, following him into the darkened room, and ignoring his curse.</p><p>A cursory examination of the room proved that whoever had done this was long gone\u2014but had left a wide path of destruction. Anger slapped her, and damn it, she felt violated. The last two days had been hell, and the pressure was only growing thicker.</p><p>Tara squeezed her eyes shut and smoothed out her thoughts. She couldn\u2019t let this get to her now when there was so much at stake. Darcy certainly wouldn\u2019t let some douche bag\u2019s breaking and entering interfere with her work.</p><p>Logan tore his cell phone from his pocket, then stepped a few paces away and started making phone calls. Tara did the same, figuring she\u2019d better give her boss fair warning. Within ten minutes, the Dallas police arrived to investigate the crime scene. Thorpe and Bocelli pulled up right behind them.</p><p>As the detectives and uniformed cops shooed them outside, Bocelli unfolded his powerful body from Thorpe\u2019s Lexus and approached. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to find anything.\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded, fury simmering off him. \u201cIt\u2019s a warning.\u201d</p><p>They were right, and the very thought made Tara trembling mad. The man who\u2019d killed Logan\u2019s mother had been here, prowling among her stuff, tearing the place up to scare the shit out of her. What would have happened if she\u2019d returned alone while he was here?</p><p>She must have made some noise, because Logan wrapped his arms around her, easing her head to his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared, baby. I\u2019m not going to let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>The sentiment was sweet, but Tara knew that was a guarantee he couldn\u2019t make. \u201cI\u2019m not as scared as I am pissed. This son of a bitch deserves to pay for everything he\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll fuck up, and I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t just hear you plotting vigilante justice.\u201d Bocelli shot him a tight smile.</p><p>Within a half hour, one of the detectives asked Tara to clarify the statement she\u2019d given earlier, then suggested she take an inventory.</p><p>Nothing was missing, not even the diamond earrings she\u2019d inherited from her mother or the sweet gold heart pendant she\u2019d received from Adam during her breakup with Logan.</p><p>Tara tried not to let this break-in get to her as she packed up her scattered belongings. Logan had a roll of trash bags in his glove box, and she threw everything into a couple, thinking that, in the last forty-eight hours she\u2019d packed up her entire life twice, once to leave a man, and now to tie her fate to another. Everything was changing so fast\u2014the mission, her relationships, and her heart\u2014that she struggled to keep up. Logan pitched in, right beside her, helping her sort and store her things.</p><p>With a warning to be careful, Bocelli left, Thorpe driving him away back toward Dominion. The police took a statement from the motel owner, who admitted that he had no security cameras. With a transient population at the motel, no one could say that any particular stranger seemed any more out of place than another. And in this part of town, no one saw anything, regardless of the truth. Logan could tell them about the note, but then they would take it as evidence. The cops wouldn\u2019t find anything. Logan preferred to keep the investigation in his own hands. He trusted Bocelli far more than the local P.D.</p><p>This was a dead end.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Cherry. You\u2019re about to fall on your feet. Let me take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Logan tied off her trash bags, then tossed them in the back of the truck before helping in her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ought to spank your ass red for that lie.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cBecause that\u2019s going to make me feel so much better right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because I can\u2019t take care of you if you\u2019re not honest with me. When we get to Fantasy Key, clear communication will be critical.\u201d</p><p>Tara sighed. He was right . . . again. \u201cFine, yes. I\u2019m exhausted. I couldn\u2019t eat dinner because I knew you had something up your sleeve tonight. The public submission and the sex made me hungry. I\u2019ve tried to push my apprehension to the back of my mind, but I\u2019m afraid that when I get to the resort I won\u2019t be able to pull this off.\u201d</p><p>Or you\u2019ll realize you don\u2019t really want me.</p><p>Something she\u2019d seen as inevitable even this morning now filled her with dread.</p><p>\u201cSee, was that so hard?\u201d He started the truck and drove a few blocks, stopping at a twenty-four-hour greasy spoon.</p><p>\u201cEggs at two in the morning?\u201d She shot him a questioning glance.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than my cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA killer just went through my belongings, and you want me to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt beats the hell out of you fainting.\u201d</p><p>Logan exited and helped her from the truck. Tara shoved aside her discomfiting, arousing lack of undergarments. The clientele here didn\u2019t care. Within minutes, they were tucking into eggs and pancakes. Though it was ordinary food, Tara couldn\u2019t remember the last time something tasted this good. She\u2019d been famished.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she moaned, closing her eyes as she savored each bite.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that unless you want to make my dick hard,\u201d he murmured across the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just enjoying my pancakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t differentiate. You make sounds like that, baby, and I\u2019m dying to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>Tara didn\u2019t think he was kidding and couldn\u2019t handle another of his sensual assaults now. So she finished her meal in silence.</p><p>Finally, she pushed her half-empty plate away. \u201cOh my gosh, do they feed lumberjacks here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly truckers and drunks. Both can pack a hell of an appetite. You did good. Feel better?\u201d</p><p>Whatever his true feelings, Logan took care of her. Tara tried not to read anything into it. After all, that\u2019s what Doms did. Even so, he made her feel as if no one else had ever been more important to him. She couldn\u2019t deny that turned her on.</p><p>\u201cYes. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Logan caressed her cheek. \u201cMy pleasure. I look forward to the day you let me take care of you in all ways, all the time.\u201d</p><p>Tara swallowed against a new wave of shimmering heat. And not about to bite on that dangerous bait, she sent him a wan smile, then headed for his truck.</p><p>He drove them about ten minutes north, where the glittering lights of the city were just beginning to give way to a quieter area, and pulled into an assigned parking spot. After killing the engine, he paused for a long moment, clearly choosing his words carefully.</p><p>\u201cThis means a lot to me, having you here. I hope you\u2019ll continue to trust me.\u201d</p><p>Before she could reply, Logan scrambled out into the cool, humid night. She opened the passenger door, only to find him waiting there with open arms to help her down. With his big hands, he circled her waist and lingered. Tara\u2019s breath caught. Finally, he pulled away to grab the trash bags full of her belongings from the back and headed to a nearby door.</p><p>He lived in a well-lit, upscale complex with lush gardens and a water feature trickling somewhere nearby. The courtyard tile had hand-painted designs, and the stucco exteriors were a warm beige with chocolate and gold trim. Many of the residents had pots full of flowers or decorative wreaths hung to brighten their doors.</p><p>Logan\u2019s was bare.</p><p>From his pocket, he produced a set of keys and turned one in the lock. To the right, he flipped a metal lever, then pushed the pad of his thumb onto the flat surface that emerged. Finally, she heard a click, and Logan reached out to open the door.</p><p>Only to lean back against it, hesitation all over his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in town a lot. Sometimes, when I am, I like . . . privacy.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cI\u2019ve brought girls here. A lot of girls.\u201d</p><p>His words were like a sudden slap, and Tara felt sick to her stomach, imagining him here with naked women wet and aching, bucking against his hand or mouth as they came at his command. But she steeled herself against the jealousy. She and Logan hadn\u2019t been together in years, and she had no say in how he\u2019d spent his time. Still, the knowledge ate at her insides like acid.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just here to sleep and regroup before we leave in the morning. We\u2019ve only got a few hours to rest.\u201d She shrugged, playing nonchalant.</p><p>\u201cTo me, it\u2019s more. Just\u2014\u201d He sighed. \u201cWhen we walk through my playroom, close your eyes, okay? Don\u2019t think about what\u2019s here. I want to take you where I\u2019ve never brought any other woman, ever. I want you in my bed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The words took her breath away, made her heart actually flutter. Tara examined her reaction; it made no sense. She already knew that Logan hadn\u2019t had intercourse with anyone else in five years, but she sensed that he wasn\u2019t talking about sex now. He was talking about sharing his space. Sharing himself.</p><p>She was terribly touched. \u201cWhy would you want that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t ask the complicated questions, do you?\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cCome with me, and I\u2019ll try to explain.\u201d</p><p>Tara hesitated. Somehow, the idea of walking across his threshold, into the bedroom he\u2019d never shared with a woman, felt symbolic, like taking the next step. She shoved the feeling aside, certain she was reading too much into it\u2014until he stood there looking so uncertain.</p> <p>And suddenly, she realized the truth. \u201cYou\u2019ve been lonely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor twelve fucking years without you, yes.\u201d He reached for her, anchoring his hand around her nape. \u201cI\u2019ve never wanted anyone else in my most personal space. I want you here. I want you now.\u201d</p><p>His pain compelled her to soothe it. No way she could say no. She put aside everything that had happened tonight, the danger and uncertainty of the future, and placed a soft kiss on his lips.</p><p>God, she\u2019d been assuming that he merely needed closure or to work her out of his system. She\u2019d thought maybe he was confused, nostalgic, had the chest-beating need to chase the one who got away\u2014something. Until now, she hadn\u2019t really considered that he might truly love her, that he got her on some soul-deep level that neither time nor distance had erased.</p><p>How was it possible that three short months of friendship and the loss of her virginity had made such an indelible impression on him? It sounded ludicrous, but somehow it appeared that had happened. Maybe it was time to consider that he knew his heart better than she did.</p> <p>Maybe she should truly entertain the notion that Logan might still be in love with her.</p><p>Hope surged, desire flared. Tara threw her arms around his neck, pressed her body to his against the front door, and layered a kiss over his mouth. He wrapped her tightly in his embrace, clutching the back of her blouse in his fists, and sinking into her mouth like a dying man.</p><p>When she moaned, he angled his mouth over hers to press his claim even deeper. His raw hunger sizzled through her.</p><p>Why did he affect her as no man ever had? Why did she wonder about his feelings, unless a part of her still loved him, too?</p><p>Not ready to face that possibility, Tara wrenched away. \u201cStill want to go inside?\u201d</p><p>Logan scanned her face, then the parking lot. \u201cInside would be safer. Come with me.\u201d</p> <p>After opening the door again, he led her into a dark space. The moon slanted through the blinds as he disabled the alarm, then set it once more. Tara got a fleeting impression of hardwood floors and a wide room without a single sofa or chair. But as her eyes adjusted to the shadows, she saw a spanking bench, a St. Andrew\u2019s Cross, and manacles dangling from the ceiling beam. A collection of whips lined the walls.</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d The words slipped out.</p><p>He grabbed her hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve already been on a bench and a cross, baby. You\u2019ve been manacled from the ceiling. Nothing new there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whips . . .\u201d She backed away.</p><p>\u201cThey scare you?\u201d</p><p>Tara nodded emphatically. \u201cI can\u2019t take that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis sort of discipline may come up at Fantasy Key.\u201d Logan hesitated, raked a hand through his hair. \u201cI wanted to give you the kiss of the whip next in your training, just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCherry, you might not get that choice. What I do . . . it\u2019s not like the movies, where they\u2019re intentionally tearing flesh from bone. I wouldn\u2019t hurt you, not beyond the amount of pain that feels good to you. I\u2019d only arouse you, I swear.\u201d</p><p>Her mind raced. \u201cBut whips draw blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if they\u2019re meant to. With a light flick of the wrist and the right equipment, they just wake up your skin, make it tingle, like a good spanking. Physiologically, your blood rushes to the surface, stimulating your skin and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight.\u201d Maybe never, but Tara knew she couldn\u2019t take it now.</p><p>Logan paused, then nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Tonight, I just want to be with you. No pushing boundaries. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>At the far end of the living area, he opened a door to a masculine bedroom. It contained nothing but dark, modern furniture and black walls. Everything about it was impersonal, like a hotel room but with less warmth. The lone exception was the bridal portrait of his sister. He slept here alone? The room silently cried out his solitude, discouraged anyone from caring.</p><p>Until he grabbed her hand, tugging her inside with a watchful glance, and settled on the edge of the bed. \u201cI want you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He tugged off his T-shirt, revealing his wide chest, heavily roped and veined arms, and abs that rippled when he patted the mattress. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Heat shafted her. How could she want him again? Why was it that she only had to be near Logan and she needed to feel his skin on hers, press her lips to the strong column of his throat, and spread her trembling thighs so he could work deep into her again?</p><p>He reached up, dragged his knuckles across her cheek, then over her suddenly tight nipples. \u201cI know you\u2019ve been through a lot today. Hell, the last few days. I see that you\u2019re confused and don\u2019t know where to turn, but I\u2019ll tell you where: Me. Turn to me. Lean on me, Cherry. I swear to God I won\u2019t let you down again. Just let me make love to you.\u201d</p><p>Resisting Logan was difficult enough when he delivered wicked words in a sexy rumble. This entreaty was twenty times harder to deny. He said that he wanted to help her\u2014and clearly meant it. But he looked at her like she was the answer to his prayers, the medicine he needed to heal. Whatever had happened between them in the past, no way could she refuse him now.</p><p>Time to face facts: A part of her belonged to Logan and always would.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her hands went to the buttons of her blouse. Slowly, she slid the first button through its moorings, then the second.</p><p>Logan stopped her before she reached the third. \u201cIn high school, I had these fantasies about undressing you slowly and revealing that pretty pale skin a soft inch at a time before I kissed it all.\u201d</p><p>Her breath hitched. Back then, he\u2019d frequently looked at her as if he had sin on his mind. Now, he looked even more wicked. And she knew how wonderful he could make her feel. Every time he touched her, he drove her to the shimmering brink of pleasure and built it into a towering swell of need. And with every kiss, instead of being less affected and working him out of her system, their connection reached deeper inside her, coming dangerously close to her heart.</p><p>How the hell did she fight that?</p><p>\u201cLogan . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d He slipped the third button from its hole, then caressed the top swell of her breast, moving up with a sweep of his palm until he eased the silk off her shoulder. He stood, leaned in, nipped at her neck with his teeth and a hot breath. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know how much I want you. But I\u2019m going to show you tonight.\u201d</p><p>In the back of her head, Tara knew this was reckless. They should rest for the mission and start fresh. But with Logan\u2019s blue gaze searching hers through the shadows, she didn\u2019t care. She wanted him too badly. She didn\u2019t know where their relationship was going. Right now, it didn\u2019t matter. Only sharing this solemn, intimate moment did. She could fulfill the fantasy he had of making love to her in his bed. And she could revel in touching the boy she\u2019d never forgotten, who\u2019d become the man able to rule her body with a single velvet caress.</p><p>\u201cShow me,\u201d she whispered, sliding her lips across his jaw until she reached his ear. \u201cTouch me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flared with heat as Logan wrapped his fingers into her hair, pulled her head back, and laid a soft kiss ripe with demand on her lips. Tara whimpered, wanting more. So he took her hand, leading her to the big bed with the black comforter and a mountain of pillows.</p><p>Then she noticed the padded manacles extending from the wall behind the headboard, dangling beside the posts, just waiting. For her.</p><p>Tara\u2019s heart started to race in a wild beat. Then Logan slipped free the final button of her blouse and shoved it down her arms. Even that soft touch made her shiver.</p><p>Before the silk slithered to the floor, he was there, hands cupping her breasts, thumbs rasping across her nipples, still sensitive from the cherry clamps he\u2019d used on them earlier. Tossing her head back, she moaned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, baby,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Brad had told her that before. The difference was that Logan said it with reverence, his hands worshipful. She believed him.</p><p>He slid his palms down to the waistband of her skirt. With a twist of his fingers and a flick of his wrist, it slid down her hips and landed in a puddle with her blouse. Finally, he bent and slipped off her heels, massaging her arches as he set the shoes aside.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to spoil me.\u201d</p><p>Straightening, he smiled as he slid a hand over the bare curve of her ass. \u201cThat\u2019s my job, to see to your needs, to make you feel cherished. So it\u2019s working?\u201d</p><p>Oh yeah.</p><p>Tara closed her eyes and reached for him, needing to touch him, craving more closeness between them.</p><p>Instead, Logan caressed his way down her arms, then took both of her wrists in his hands, pinning them together at the small of her back in a silken grip that held like iron. In this position, he forced her to arch, lifting her breasts to him. And he stared with hunger as her nipples hardened more, swelled.</p><p>As his free hand glided up her waist, closer to the aching mounds of her breasts, Tara became acutely aware of her helplessness, her vulnerability. Logan could touch her in whatever way he wished. She couldn\u2019t stop him.</p><p>With their gazes fused together, she lost herself to him. She panted, her nipples rising helplessly with every inhalation. Completely still, he watched, waiting\u2014for what, she wasn\u2019t sure. The tension thickened between, crashed through her system, burning into her veins.</p><p>\u201cLogan . . .\u201d God, she didn\u2019t know exactly what she asked for, except relief.</p><p>His slow smile curled up as he dragged a finger down to her drenched folds and fondled her. \u201cPatience, Cherry. I don\u2019t want to devour you in one bite. You\u2019re a treat to be savored.\u201d</p><p>Then he thrust a finger inside her, and Tara\u2019s pussy clenched around the digit, silently begging for more. Her skin tingled. She needed his hands on her, his cock deep inside her. That need skyrocketed when he withdrew his finger and slid it into his mouth with a savoring moan.</p><p>\u201cChrist, do you know what it does to me to see you all naked and aroused, baby?\u201d</p><p>Tara shifted closer, jerked her hips against his. She felt only a fleeting impression of his hard cock pressing against his leather pants before he gripped her hip and angled her away. \u201cNo rushing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop teasing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat fun would that be?\u201d Cupping a breast, he stroked the underside, brushing a thumb over her aching nipple. \u201cSpread your legs, baby.\u201d</p><p>Tara did so without hesitation, dying for his next touch, trembling with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d He swiped a finger across her pleading clit once more, making her gasp. \u201cYou\u2019re so wet and you tempt me so damn much. I have to muster all my control to stop myself from throwing you to the bed and fucking you senseless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t restrain yourself on my account,\u201d Tara whispered as she rocked against his hand.</p><p>Logan pulled his fingers back and stared down into her eyes. \u201cWhen I\u2019m ready, I won\u2019t. But now, you don\u2019t have any control over this, Cherry. I say how. I say when. Don\u2019t forget it.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, he slid two fingers deep into her pussy, rubbing at that spot inside that sent her reeling, as he thumbed her burning clit. Already aroused, now his touch felt almost too sharp to bear. Tara gasped and clenched her fists, yearning to clutch his shoulders and rub herself against him like a cat in heat. But he still held her wrists in a steely grip at the small of her back, making her take his shattering touch.</p><p>He ramped her up so quickly, she could barely catch her breath. Tingles deluged her as the ache built between her legs to something dark, demanding her every sense, urging her to beg. Orgasm shimmered just within reach.</p><p>And he backed away again.</p><p>\u201cNo, Logan. Damn it!\u201d</p><p>He shot her a harsh stare. \u201cI told you, I\u2019ll grant your climax when it pleases me, baby. I\u2019ll fuck you when I think you\u2019re good and ready. If you\u2019re damning me now, there\u2019s still too much starch in your spine.\u201d</p><p>His steely words reminded her that, while he had a heart, he was also a big, very bad Dom. Not once since they\u2019d started having sex had he truly unleashed that side of himself on her. Last night, he\u2019d been tender, but desperate to have her. During her training with Xander, he\u2019d been downright possessive. After the public submission, he\u2019d inhaled her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tonight, Logan would utterly dominate. This was his fantasy, and his searing stare told her that he planned to live it to the fullest\u2014while he drove her to the brink of sanity.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Logan. I need more.\u201d He\u2019d left her so close to orgasm that her body burned. The air conditioner kicked in, but it didn\u2019t help. Instead, the air flow dragged a cool breeze across her nipples that sent her into a sensory tailspin. \u201cI can\u2019t take this.\u201d</p><p>He dragged his fingers through her soaking pussy again, then swirled them around her nipples, coating them with her essence, making them peak harder. \u201cYou\u2019re strong, Cherry. Trust that, if you give me what I want, I\u2019ll give you what you need.\u201d</p><p>A basic tenet of any good D/s relationship. Tara tried to reassure herself with that fact, but with her body on fire, perspiration beginning to coat her skin, and a haze of need clouding her thoughts, she could only whimper. Submitting everything to Logan in the privacy of his bedroom, when it meant so much to him, when he had complete control of her every sensation, turned her on wildly.</p><p>\u201cCan you do that?\u201d</p><p>Honestly, she wasn\u2019t sure, but she feared that if she said no, he\u2019d stop everything and leave her to burn. \u201cYes, Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Slowly, he released her wrists. \u201cGet on the bed.\u201d</p><p>Heart pounding, she did. Logan wasted no time in shackling each of her limbs at the corners of the bed, spreading her wide open. Then, still dressed in his leathers, he crawled between her knees, sat back on his heels and looked his fill.</p><p>Her skin burned under his dark, unwavering gaze. Spread so totally, feeling vulnerable, her pussy seeped with need. She writhed and arched, lifting her hips to him. \u201cTouch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, you\u2019re not setting the pace or making the rules. Forget that again, Cherry, and I\u2019ll have to punish you.\u201d His silky tone belied the hard glitter of his eyes. \u201cI\u2019d rather savor you, so totally open to me. I want you good and ready for every nasty thing I\u2019m going to do to you.\u201d</p><p>At his words, her pussy clamped down. Empty inside, the aching hollowness consumed her, so acute it almost hurt.</p><p>Without warning, Logan bent and lashed his hot tongue across her pussy. She cried out and bucked up, the sudden jolt of pleasure stunning her. Tara wished desperately that Logan would cover her body with his, fill her with his cock, and take her hard.</p><p>Instead, he lifted his head, his face dark and intent in the mysterious shadows. \u201cReady to give me everything I want from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Take me. Anything. Everything.\u201d</p><p>Logan pushed a strand of hair from her face, caressed her shoulder, her breast. \u201cGood answer. I\u2019m going to lift your pussy and ass up, baby. I want them spread wide open for me.\u201d</p><p>His words thundered a dark desire through her as he slid a pillow beneath her hips, forcing her to tilt up. Her feet turned out, which spread her legs even more, exposing her completely. She fought to touch him, lure him closer, but he\u2019d restrained her so thoroughly that she could only keep her legs spread and raise up to him in a silent plea he ignored.</p><p>With a feral smile, Logan slid a possessive hand over her mound. \u201cHere, now, there\u2019s no training, just us. It\u2019s sweet to know that you like being at my mercy, Cherry. Too bad I\u2019m not going to have any tonight.\u201d</p><p>He scrambled off the bed to tear off his leathers, then he approached her, his body taut, huge cock standing tall and thick. He glided a gentle hand from her shoulder to one breast, circling, but not touching, its tight nipple. As she gasped, arched, he moved down her abdomen, settling his fingers into her folds.</p><p>\u201cI need to give you this dominant part of me, as much as I need you to submit yourself totally. I won\u2019t rest until I know that you truly belong to me.\u201d</p><p>When his gaze locked on hers again, every shred of the desire clawing at him reflected in his eyes. And determination. This was far more than sexual for him. He was playing for keeps.</p><p>Her heart turned over in his chest. An alternate thrill and panic rushed through her. What if she let her guard down and he broke her heart again?</p><p>What if he didn\u2019t and ended up loving her for the rest of their lives?</p><p>His eyes hardened. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to overanalyze this, Tara. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>How could he know that, because he knew her so well?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you fair warning,\u201d he whispered, lowering himself over her body. \u201cTune out those destructive worries and just feel.\u201d</p><p>Logan captured her mouth with his in a kiss. The simple press of lips quickly turned devastating as his tongue prowled deep, exploring her mouth with a thoroughness that staggered her, leaving her in no doubt of his dominance. He left his stamp of possession on her swollen lips, letting her know that he would take any and every part of her as he wished. As she whimpered, he proved that she didn\u2019t want him any other way.</p><p>Tara felt herself slipping deeper into a well of desire with every stroke of his tongue against hers. She tried to press her body to his, but the shackles held strong. Instead, she threw herself desperately into the kiss, giving him every bit of her hunger.</p><p>Suddenly, he wrenched away and stared down at her, his eyes nearly black as he backed onto his knees and caressed his way down her body, leaving a trail of heat in his wake.</p><p>Then Logan settled himself between her thighs, and she quivered. Her heart pounded furiously as he held her gaze while he slowly bent to her pussy.</p><p>He lapped at her swollen, slick folds and opened her wider with the spread of his thumbs. \u201cThis is mine,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s always been mine.\u201d</p><p>Yes! The thought screamed through her brain, but she couldn\u2019t gasp enough air to say it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking it back, Cherry. Right now.\u201d</p><p>Nothing tentative about his statement or the torturous flicks of his tongue against her clit.</p><p>Heat spiraling, she bucked against the shackles. \u201cPlease, Logan.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her plea and continued with his slow seduction of her flesh, circling her clit with a measured precision that drove her mad. He knew exactly where and how to touch her.</p><p>Again, she lifted up, tried to make him taste more of her, but Logan slid his arms beneath her thighs and wrapped them around her body, hands pressing down on her hips. With her thighs now over his shoulders and his face buried between them, she couldn\u2019t move an inch.</p><p>\u201cTara, behave. You\u2019ll get what you need when I get what I want.\u201d</p><p>Again, he bent and resumed his slow devastation of her senses. And she could do nothing to stop him.</p><p>That knowledge sent an undeniable flare of heat bursting though her. He didn\u2019t just arouse her body, but gave her something she craved on a deeper level, something she\u2019d never felt or imagined before. A connection, a give-and-take that she desperately needed.</p><p>Her moans turned more desperate with each heartbeat, the promise of sweet release looming closer. Her skin tingled, the sensation magnified as the air conditioner worked overtime, blowing cold air across her body.</p><p>Her hands fisted, and she clawed at her restraints. She gulped in huge breaths, tensed against the bombarding sensations as Logan\u2019s tongue lashed her clit again and again. Jolts assailed her with every clever lap. She couldn\u2019t breathe or think. A frantic scream scratched its way up to her throat and broke free as sparks erupted all through her body.</p><p>\u201cLogan, I\u2019m coming!\u201d she cried out in the dark bedroom, breathless and throaty as her fingertips tingled, her blood turned heavy, and pleasure overtook her.</p><p>Climax held her in a ruthless grip. And Tara could do nothing but take it, succumb to its dark power. He moaned against her sosensitive flesh, sending her higher and higher. She hadn\u2019t known a climax could be seemingly endless, but the merciless pleasure wracked her body as pulse after pulse rolled over her.</p><p>And still, he kept eating at her like a starving man.</p><p>\u201cOh! Logan. I can\u2019t stop.\u201d Her protest sounded breathy. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014oh . . . too much.\u201d</p><p>Logan ignored her and swirled his tongue around her throbbing nub in a long, unhurried stroke. \u201cI\u2019m not finished, baby. Come for me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He lapped at her pussy again and again, silencing her. The heat of his mouth spread more fire across her flesh. Then he pressed his fingers deep, deep inside her until the tingling promise of another orgasm shimmered through her.</p><p>Tara arched, frenzied. She hadn\u2019t believed another orgasm was possible. Now, it was imminent. \u201cLogan! Oh my . . . God. It\u2019s too big. I can\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>She thrashed against the bonds, her shaking muscles pressing against his wide shoulders. He didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cYou can. You\u2019ll come for me.\u201d</p><p>Edict given, Logan lowered his head and resumed torturing her with destructive flicks of his tongue and erotic presses of his fingers.</p><p>No matter how much she bucked or pleaded, he showed no mercy. Logan razed her with the inferno he built inside her, and she cried out over and over as he sucked her clit into his mouth continuously and moaned over her swollen bundle of nerves.</p><p>Shocked at the white-hot pleasure tearing through her, Tara tried in vain to pull on her bonds. But the electricity settled between her legs, sharpening the sensation in her nipples. Her empty pussy clenched in protest as the overload of need became too strong to endure.</p><p>Shifting helplessly beneath him, Tara screamed his name until she went hoarse. With that ruthless mouth, he continued to streak fire through her cunt, lapping at her, stealing her juices for himself, then humming in approval when her body gave him more.</p><p>Conscious thought slipped away until all she knew was Logan and the seething pleasure he forced on her. Each possessive swipe of his tongue stole more of her sanity until every muscle in her body seized up.</p><p>\u201cCome!\u201d he demanded.</p><p>No way she could hold her climax back. It swept over her, searing her. She screamed as her entire body succumbed to the brutal wave of pleasure that battered her.</p><p>His mouth turned gentle, his licks slow as she emerged from the pleasure high. Finally, he pulled away. With an exhausted sigh, she gave herself over to him completely.</p><p>The second she did, he lifted his head to watch her with feral blue eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s my sweet surrender. Now you\u2019re ready for me to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>Tara couldn\u2019t look away as he unfastened the shackles at her wrists and ankles. Exhausted, she let Logan move her like a rag doll onto her hands and knees.</p><p>\u201cGrab on to the headboard until I tell you otherwise.\u201d</p><p>With a shaking sigh and a trembling body, she complied.</p><p>Positioning himself behind her, Logan grabbed her hips, aligned their bodies, and began pushing his cock inside her. She was so swollen, he had to shove his way in slowly, and she felt every inch he scraped down her pussy.</p><p>\u201cCherry . . .\u201d He moaned as though pleasure agonized him while he pushed in deeper. \u201cSo tight.\u201d</p><p>Besieged by tingles that reawakened her flesh, she inhaled sharply and pushed back on him, taking him deeper.</p><p>\u201cBe still.\u201d His voice shook, as if he was on the edge of his control.</p><p>Tara tried, but she couldn\u2019t stop arching, moaning, clamping down as he worked inside. Logan growled, then tightened his hands on her hips, forging in the rest of the way with one quick thrust.</p><p>Eyes going wide, she gasped. Oh God. Burned by every ridge and vein of Logan\u2019s cock, she mewled. Her broken cries seemed to drive him mad, because he nuzzled her neck and silently dismantled her sanity one frenzied thrust after another.</p><p>\u201cI need to fuck you, Cherry. I\u2019ve never needed a woman the way I need to possess you.\u201d</p><p>His words reached into her chest and squeezed. Tara felt not just desired, but cherished.</p><p>Logan wrapped his arm around her and latched on to her nipple, rolling it between his thumb and finger ruthlessly. \u201cTake all of me, Cherry. Everything I give you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t just mean his cock, but all facets of him: his wry humor, his dominance, his caring nature.</p><p>His heart.</p><p>It was her last thought before he sank his teeth into her neck, pinched her clit, and set a wild pace that sent her soaring headlong into crushing pleasure again. He followed her down into the abyss of ecstasy that had her crying out as he flooded her with his hot release.</p><p>She\u2019d definitely have to remember to take her birth-control pill tonight. But unbidden, the image of Logan as her husband, caressing her swollen belly as they awaited their child flashed through her mind. A fierce, destructive longing gripped her.</p><p>Tara closed her eyes as Logan lowered her to the mattress, then rolled them to their sides, so that he spooned her against his damp, heaving chest.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Cherry. Having you here means the world to me.\u201d</p><p>She could hear that in his voice. Being here for him suddenly meant the world to her. Her head was filled with images of picket fences and cribs. Damn, was she falling for him . . . again?</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>AFTER barely sleeping all night, Tara awoke from her catnap and stretched, every muscle in her body feeling deliciously sore and used. When a girl felt this good, sleep was definitely overrated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a smile, she rose, padding her way over to the suitcase Logan had packed for her while she slept. He\u2019d been very specific before leaving for the kitchen to toss together some breakfast: No peeking inside. If she wanted to add anything\u2014no panties allowed\u2014she was to leave the items on top. Tara wasn\u2019t sure she liked this rule, as if she were too stupid to pack on her own, but he\u2019d sworn it was about expectation. Fantasy Key would expect her to have certain articles of clothing and other . . . items. And Logan wanted to surprise her with all the things he\u2019d collected for her in the last few days.</p><p>Tara wasn\u2019t sure what to make of that. She was excited\u2014but scared. Lord knows what a man with Logan\u2019s sexual leanings had packed for her.</p><p>Repressing a shiver, she brushed her teeth, showered, then changed into her street clothes, at least for now. No doubt, Logan would have her change those before they reached the resort. And no matter how unsettling all his concentrated attention felt, she had to allow it.</p><p>Gathering some of her toiletries, she set them on her suitcase. When she came across her cell phone charger, she dug the phone out of her purse to check the battery. Almost fully charged\u2014but she\u2019d missed a call from Adam.</p> <p>Five thirty in the morning. He\u2019d be up.</p><p>She dialed his number, wincing. What should she tell him about everything happening?</p><p>\u201cMorning, princess. You\u2019re up early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Adam. Yeah, I am. There\u2019s been a change of plans.\u201d She drew in a deep breath. This part he wouldn\u2019t like, for sure. \u201cI\u2019m meeting with Bocelli in thirty minutes, then I\u2019ll be on a plane to Florida. There have been some recent developments in my case, so I can\u2019t wait to go until Wednesday. I should be home no later than Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving so suddenly?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know how this job is. You did it for years.\u201d</p><p>Adam blew out a breath, clearly concerned. \u201cYes, but I thought they\u2019d give you more time to prepare for your first assignment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so, too. It didn\u2019t work out that way.\u201d</p><p>He paused, and Tara could almost hear him gearing up his arguments from the other end of the line. \u201cWho\u2019s your partner for this mission?\u201d</p><p>Her heart shuddered to a stop, then beat frantically. \u201cYou know I was assigned to York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also know he\u2019s gone AWOL.\u201d When she gasped at his spying, he rushed to add, \u201cSorry. I still have friends in the Bureau, and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re checking up on me.\u201d And damn it, if that didn\u2019t completely piss her off. \u201cI\u2019m not a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are a novice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably know exactly who Bocelli is sending me in with, don\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI got concerned when Brad told me that shithead user was training you. The fact that they\u2019re making you partner with him nearly sent me through the roof.\u201d</p><p>Tara huffed out a breath. \u201cI can\u2019t get into this with you now. I have to go in a few minutes and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re putting yourself in a position to sexually and submissively serve the man who broke your heart. He\u2019s going to get inside your head and break your heart again. Just like last time, he\u2019ll say and do all the right things. Then, when you\u2019ve fallen for him, he will rip you in two.\u201d</p><p>His words pierced her with cold fear and sharp pain. She was definitely having feelings for Logan again. If she didn\u2019t put the brakes on them, he\u2019d soon have the ability to total her heart when she crashed.</p><p>But Adam didn\u2019t know everything.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful. But Logan had reasons for leaving me back then. Reasons he couldn\u2019t share with me until now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so the piece of shit had a reason he\u2019s spent years spinning and learning to deliver perfectly.\u201d</p><p>Tara bit her lip. She thought Adam had Logan all wrong . . . but he\u2019d said much of this to her at sixteen and, for years, it had seemed that he was dead right.</p><p>The night Logan had broken up with her, she\u2019d found a beautiful heart pendant in Adam\u2019s car. When she asked him if she could have it, he\u2019d given it to her and explained that he\u2019d bought it for her, to serve as a reminder that her heart was fragile and deserved someone who would give it special care. From all of the belongings she\u2019d packed up at Brad\u2019s house, she fished out that necklace and slipped it into her purse. She had a feeling that while with Logan over the next few days, she\u2019d need the reminder.</p><p>\u201cGuard your heart,\u201d he insisted. \u201cGet in, do your job, get out, then get as far away from that son of a bitch as you can.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t promise that, not with the feelings she was having for Logan now, but she didn\u2019t want to argue with Adam, especially when he might be right. \u201cI\u2019ll tread carefully and do whatever I need to, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Plane ride to Florida\u2014Sunday morning</p><p>Bocelli\u2019s warning rang in Logan\u2019s ears: Don\u2019t appear to want Tara too much.</p><p>Logan knew he had to hide his need for her or this mission would blow up in their faces. But as she curled up against his side on the airplane, her cheek resting on his shoulder as she clasped his hand trustingly, he had everything he\u2019d ever wanted. Too bad this situation wasn\u2019t that simple. Ending this mission safely had to take priority over his heart. That meant he had to shove aside his desperate urge to tie Tara to his bed again and master her body until she admitted that she still loved him. And she did; he was almost certain of that.</p><p>He itched to get some stamp of ownership on her, not so that Thorpe allowed him to keep his membership at Dominion\u2014although once they were together and Logan met Thorpe\u2019s conditions, he had a feeling that he and Cherry would play there sometimes\u2014but because he needed to make her his. And he was desperate to be hers.</p><p>Getting these sick freaks who abducted women and made them slaves had to come first. Then he\u2019d deal with the fucker who had killed his mother and now threatened Tara.</p><p>But one way or another, Logan vowed that Tara wasn\u2019t getting away from him again.</p><p>As the flight landed, she jarred awake, blinking at him from behind fluttering ginger lashes, her expression sleepy and trusting. Just like that, she made him hard again.</p><p>\u201cAre we here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in Key West.\u201d He dropped his voice to something barely above a whisper. \u201cOnce we step off the plane, Fantasy Key\u2019s van should pick us up. From that point on, we\u2019ll have to stay in character. I\u2019m going to be a son of a bitch, and you\u2019re going to have to obey. I\u2019ll apologize in advance and tell you that, for the most part, this isn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cI just hope I\u2019m ready to handle whatever comes my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you do, keep hold of that little temper of yours. Think about how every response will look to others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about that VIP room Bocelli told us about this morning? If women are being \u2018auditioned\u2019 there, like he suggested, it\u2019s important we find our way in quickly and often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce we determine who sends out those invites, we\u2019ll work on him. For now, be on your best behavior. I\u2019ll be on my worst. If we do this right, this scumbag should come after you.\u201d</p><p>With a shaky nod, she rose and grabbed her carry-on luggage as the other passengers filed off the plane. Logan knew she was nervous. Hell, he was, too. His missions mostly consisted of timing, precision, and blowing the head off of some terrorist motherfucker. When he engaged in combat, he usually knew exactly who to target. This would be different, especially since he had to protect Cherry first and foremost.</p><p>Logan stood behind her, staying her from stepping into the aisle by wrapping an arm around her waist and pulling her back against his chest.</p><p>\u201cNothing I\u2019m going to say or do here publicly is any reflection of how I feel about you. I need you to know that.\u201d</p><p>Tara swung her gaze over her shoulder, meeting him head-on. \u201cI know. And I asked for this assignment. I\u2019m trying not to be scared.\u201d</p><p>He planted a soft kiss on her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s natural. Just remember, lean on me when you need to. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my job.\u201d Her mouth set in a stubborn line. \u201cI need to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a team,\u201d he reminded her darkly. \u201cDon\u2019t play hero all by yourself.\u201d</p><p>Cherry gritted her teeth as that independent streak asserted itself. \u201cIf we\u2019re a team, you need to remember that I have a role here besides kneeling at your feet.\u201d</p><p>Fuck, she was right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to keep my inner caveman at bay,\u201d he quipped and reluctantly released her, following her, luggage in hand.</p><p>Once they\u2019d deplaned and worked their way to the baggage claim, they found a driver in a black suit, his dark hair tucked under a cap, carrying a sign directing people to Fantasy Key.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for their checked luggage to come off the carousel. Logan grabbed it and turned toward the driver, whispering to her, \u201cShowtime . . .\u201d</p><p>She nodded nervously.</p><p>\u201cDeep breath,\u201d he demanded in a low voice.</p><p>She complied, slowly relaxing.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d he praised, then directed her to the driver, who watched them carefully with dark eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re heading to Fantasy Key?\u201d the driver asked. He wore a small nametag that read JORDAN.</p><p>Tara started to reply. Logan cast her a sharp stare. Instantly, she closed her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYes. Logan Flint,\u201d he said, using the name Bocelli and the FBI had used when making their reservations at the resort.</p><p>Jordan set the sign at his feet, then glanced at the notepad he\u2019d tucked into his shirt pocket. \u201cVery good. And your submissive is Tara Cabot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I address her?\u201d</p><p>Logan paused. Even the drivers observed protocol. Serious stuff . . . \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d The thirtysomething man, now giving off a definite Dom vibe, turned to Tara. \u201cDo you need help with your carry-on bag?\u201d</p><p>Helping Tara should be Logan\u2019s own right and responsibility, but Jordan had a job to do. Normally, Tara would prefer to make her own decisions, no doubt. In this case, she made a small production of glancing at him, as if seeking permission. She was definitely on her game.</p><p>\u201cAnswer him,\u201d Logan demanded.</p><p>Something about Jordan bothered Logan, probably the way he looked at Cherry as if he\u2019d like to eat her whole. If they\u2019d been traveling to this resort for real, he would have rescinded the driver\u2019s permission to address Tara and growled a warning. But he had to play indifferent.</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you for your help.\u201d Tara rolled the pull-along in Jordan\u2019s direction.</p><p>The driver took it. After Logan declined help with the rest of the luggage, they followed Jordan to a sleek black sedan.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only guests who\u2019ve arrived on this flight, so unless you need to make a stop in town for anything, we\u2019ll be on our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo stops necessary.\u201d Logan just wanted to get there, find Tara\u2019s missing friend, and get out, hopefully after nailing the degenerates who farmed victims from a resort intended to celebrate what should be a deep and sacred power exchange.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be with us for three days?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe four, as my schedule allows.\u201d They\u2019d left themselves a bit of wiggle room, in case they didn\u2019t complete their mission objectives right away.</p><p>Jordan glanced at Tara in the rearview mirror. \u201cDo you require anything before we arrive? There are cold bottles of water in your cup holders. I also have a few snacks, if you\u2019d like one.\u201d</p><p>Logan clenched his fist. Jordan didn\u2019t need to ask Tara those questions; a good Dom took care of his sub, and Logan had already persuaded her to both eat and drink something on the plane. But the driver was interacting with Tara, gauging her interest in him. As much as it chafed, Logan played his role and glanced out the window in seeming disinterest.</p><p>He\u2019d rather pound Jordan\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cVery well. Mr. Flint, we\u2019re aren\u2019t far from the dock. We\u2019ll take a twenty-minute boat ride to our private island. We have a dressing area there. You\u2019ll have the opportunity to change her clothes. Submissives are not permitted to wear shoes unless scening, house rules.\u201d</p><p>Already this place felt strange. The rules were definitely more lax at Dominion and put more control in the hands of the individual Doms. He had an inkling there would be more surprises once they arrived at Fantasy Key.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me a bit about what we can expect after arrival? I would like the opportunity to rest and speak with my slave in private before engaging with others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter check-in and orientation for all the new resort guests, in which we\u2019ll review the basic rules, there will be time to rest. After dinner, you\u2019ll be escorted around the various play areas, then asked to scene for your guide, to ensure you\u2019re capable of following the resort\u2019s rules.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGuide?\u201d</p><p>Jordan smiled smugly in the rearview mirror. \u201cMe. We were short a driver today, so I volunteered, but I\u2019m your dungeon master.\u201d</p><p>Just fucking perfect.</p><p>Logan looked out the passenger window again, restraining the urge to pound Jordan\u2019s face. Beside him, he felt Tara slip her hand in his. He didn\u2019t dare look at her now; his expression would reflect possessiveness and need. But he squeezed back before releasing her.</p> <p>The minutes slipped by until they reached a small marina with a speedboat tethered to the sun-washed dock. Jordan handed Tara a life jacket and helped her put it on, his hands lingering when they shouldn\u2019t, before directing Tara to a shaded overhang with a smile. \u201cTo protect your fair skin, sweet sub.\u201d</p><p>Tara did the perfect job of looking flustered and slightly flattered by his attention. On the inside, Logan seethed and almost choked, trying to restrain himself from beating the shit out of Jordan. Instead, he had to wander to the front of the boat and pretend interest in the big blue ocean. When really, water wasn\u2019t that beautiful to a SEAL; it was just a place to get the job done.</p><p>Long minutes stretched, and he resisted the urge to look back at Cherry. He heard their guide\u2019s low-voiced murmur to her. Her reply sounded breathy and small. The good news was, if Jordan had any say in which female guests were singled out for auction, Tara stood a good chance of being picked. For that reason alone, he pretended not to pay them a lick of attention again until they docked on the private island.</p><p>Logan tossed a few bags Jordan\u2019s way, keeping his own carry-on close. Besides having a satellite phone and his laptop inside, he also had Cherry\u2019s change of clothing. Idly, he wondered how she was going to feel about his selections, but nearly any reaction would be worth this view.</p><p>The fact that Jordan would see, too\u2014and likely wet himself\u2014set Logan\u2019s teeth on edge. But he couldn\u2019t let jealousy derail him. Instead, he herded Tara to the private cabana, not terribly surprised to find it more like a spa without the attendants. With Tara\u2019s help, he scanned the room for any listening or recording devices and, thankfully, found it clean.</p> <p>Leading her to a padded table in the middle of the room, he laid Tara down, then pulled up a chair, settling close to her face. Her doesoft eyes reflected a mixture of apprehension and determination. She\u2019d see this through, no matter what.</p><p>\u201cNow it gets tougher, Cherry. We have to play like this is for real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were.\u201d</p><p>Logan paused. \u201cIf you were truly any Dom\u2019s submissive, he would have already made modifications to your dress. And to your body.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cI figured you\u2019d put me in some get-up, but I can\u2019t reduce the size of my ass. I\u2019ve tried. It\u2019s just big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s luscious,\u201d he corrected. \u201cI adore it. That\u2019s not the issue. Before we leave this room, you need to be comfortable with two changes.\u201d</p> <p>Reaching into the bag at his feet, he pulled free a bundle wrapped in tissue paper, set it on the counter behind him, and removed the tags. His hands shook. Tara was going to look gorgeous, and he wished to fuck that he didn\u2019t have to share the view with anyone.</p><p>\u201cLogan?\u201d she called from behind him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be dressed submissively, Cherry.\u201d Of course, he didn\u2019t tell her that if he had his way, if he could persuade her to the altar, she\u2019d always be dressed submissively in the privacy of their bedroom. \u201cWhich is to say, barely dressed at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah . . .\u201d She sounded breathy.</p><p>\u201cGood. One last change.\u201d Logan sat in the chair by her side again, landing a hand on her thigh, then gliding his fingers up, up, up until he covered her mound. \u201cI\u2019ve got to shave you.\u201d</p><p>She gulped in a deep breath, then sent him a shaky nod. \u201cI suspected that.\u201d</p><p>Pride swelled in Logan. She\u2019d taken it well. In truth, he preferred her fiery red pussy, but it would be exciting to see her completely bare.</p><p>\u201cI can do it myself.\u201d Tara eased up on her elbows, looking around for a razor.</p> <p>Logan shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s my privilege and my right. Lie back.\u201d</p><p>She stared, clearly stunned. Logan gazed back, unblinking. He knew the second it dawned on her that he meant those words. In the next instant, she licked her lips and lowered herself to the table again.</p><p>Pride speared him as he turned to the counter behind him and found the necessary tools. In moments, he brought over a warm washcloth. \u201cSpread your legs wide.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cThat\u2019s your Dom voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll be hearing it a lot for the next few days. This is probably one of the few personal acts we\u2019ll have between us while we\u2019re here. I want this.\u201d</p><p>Within seconds, she opened to him, parting creamy pale thighs, slowly revealing that silky red hair that hid all her sweet pink secrets. Just looking at her made him want her with something bordering obsession.</p><p>Swallowing down his lust, he set the washcloth over her cunt, softening the skin and hair. In the cabinet beside him, he found a can of shaving cream and a fresh disposable razor. He lifted the washcloth from her flesh, gratified to see it soft and rosy, then he slathered the foamy white cream on top. With extreme concentration, he drew the razor across her mound, down her vaginal lips, then ordered her to flip over and get on all fours. Before she had time to question him, he\u2019d swiped more shaving cream between her cheeks. She tensed and tried to clench against him, but he held her open to shave away the wisps of hair, then wiped her clean. He finished off by rubbing her top to bottom with soothing lotion.</p><p>\u201cGod, that\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d she groaned.</p><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019m turned on and can\u2019t wait to do it again tomorrow. Get on your back.\u201d</p><p>She complied slowly. \u201cLogan, this is happening so fast. I\u2019m used to having the opportunity to talk things through with you.\u201d</p><p>And her tone indicated that she felt uncertain about this total imbalance of power. \u201cYou could have used the extra training, but with the changes in the situation, we didn\u2019t get to progress further. You\u2019re going to have to trust for me. When we can\u2019t openly communicate, that\u2019s all we\u2019ll have. Now spread your legs again.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, with trust in her eyes, she opened to him, her pussy completely bare. It nearly brought him to his fucking knees.</p><p>Unable to help himself, he swiped a thumb through her slit. She was soaking.</p><p>He settled the digit over her clit. \u201cYou like it when I go all Dom on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little annoying and frustrating sometimes.\u201d She raised her chin in challenge.</p><p>\u201cProbably, but it still makes your sweet little pussy wet.\u201d And Logan loved that fact. He cocked his head and stared as a thought occurred to him. \u201cDid you ever realize before being with me that you\u2019re submissive?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, looking away, almost like she was ashamed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Fuck shame. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Tara did, then sighed. \u201cNo. Bocelli told me my profile indicated that, and I . . . thought he had a screw loose.\u201d</p><p>Whoever had compiled her psychological profile had been deadon. The Feds weren\u2019t the only perceptive folks out there. Other men had crossed paths with Tara and certainly figured her out, too. And Tara\u2019s sweet nature had probably turned them on, damn it.</p><p>Too bad. She was his right now, and if he played his cards right, always.</p><p>He reached for the tissue-paper bundle, untying the silken red bow around it with a single pull. He fished inside for the thong and handed it to her.</p><p>Cherry stared at the little scrap of transparent flesh-colored fabric like he\u2019d lost his mind. Then she shifted her weight and heaved out a breath. \u201cWow, nothing says \u2018see my wide ass\u2019 quite like this little garment.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d had enough denigration against her luscious backside. Wrapping a hand around her neck, he yanked her closer, bringing her crashing against his chest. \u201cNot another negative word about yourself or you\u2019ll answer to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d She blinked.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight. And I could tell you all day long how fucking sexy I think you are, but you won\u2019t hear me. I\u2019m hoping this will help you figure it out and keep your cover. Put it on.\u201d</p><p>She fingered the garment, then nodded. \u201cOkay. If anyone laughs, I\u2019m punching you.\u201d</p><p>Logan couldn\u2019t help it; he grinned. She snuck under his Dom persona and warmed his heart. He couldn\u2019t resist planting a sweet, slow kiss on her lips. \u201cYou can try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBully.\u201d She stuck out her tongue playfully.</p><p>Then she donned the thong and looked down. \u201cOh, come on. Seriously?\u201d</p><p>Logan nearly swallowed his tongue. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a big bow down there, which would be fine if it covered something. But instead, I just look like some X-rated present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI wish we had time to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t, perv. As it is, Jordan is probably wondering what\u2019s taking so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck Jordan,\u201d he said automatically.</p><p>Tara wrinkled her nose. \u201cPass. Something about him seems . . . off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood instinct, Cherry. I\u2019d bet my last dime that guy is seriously bent.\u201d</p><p>Logan turned his attention back to the tissue paper bundle in his hand. And now for the next adornment. He got even harder just thinking about it.</p><p>Without preamble, he bent and cupped one of her breasts, sucking her nipple into his mouth, nipping it with his teeth. Tara gasped, arched to him. God, he could do this all day. And someday, he would.</p><p>When the nipple turned hard and began to swell, he eased back and pulled the first of two metallic ornaments from his hand. \u201cThese are nipple huggers. Watch.\u201d</p><p>He parted the delicate object at the tiny hinge, then settled it around her nipple, tightening the thin wire beneath until it encompassed the little taut bud securely. Stepping back, he surveyed his handiwork. And damn near came in his pants.</p><p>The fragile silver, shaped like petals, unfurled around her rosybrown nipple, which now looked like the flower\u2019s lush center.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he murmured as he bent to repeat the process with her other breast.</p><p>As soon as he finished, she shifted her weight from one foot to the other. \u201cThey\u2019re tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be, but you\u2019ll be able to wear them all day without issue.\u201d</p><p>She nearly choked. \u201cAll day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Walk across the room and back for me.\u201d</p><p>Since the little bathroom of this spa wasn\u2019t terribly big, three steps took her toward the slate tiled wall. When she pivoted back, her eyes had gone wide and stunned.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh . . .\u201d Tara turned her shocked stare on him. \u201cI suspected it turned me on . . . but I\u2019m so wet.\u201d</p><p>He smiled indulgently. \u201cExactly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you knew that. You really are a perv.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen. Here\u2019s the last bit of your outfit.\u201d</p><p>Cherry took the little top he extended her way with a reluctant stare. \u201cIt\u2019s totally sheer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Isn\u2019t it awesome?\u201d</p><p>She socked him in the arm with a half-hearted punch. \u201cI\u2019ll freeze to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, it\u2019s summer in the Keys. You won\u2019t get cold.\u201d He cupped her face in his hands. \u201cYou\u2019re going to do great. And remember, just because I\u2019m not looking at you doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not dying to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep reassuring me.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he did. Logan had a bad suspicion this could get painful for both of them.</p><p>Carrying her old clothes, he led her out the door and stiffened when Jordan locked his gaze on her.</p><p>Somehow repressing his violent instinct, Logan backed away and let the creep help Tara into the car. Within minutes, they were pulling up to the resort, a huge white building designed with a cottage motif that spanned the length of a private beach. The ocean lapped gently at its edges. All around, private cottages soaked in the afternoon sun. The whole thing reeked of money and exclusion.</p><p>Jordan climbed from the car and opened the door for Tara, holding out his hand. He\u2019d said the pretty boy could talk to Tara, not touch her. And damn it, Logan knew he had to pretend not to care. The next three days were going to be pure fucking torture.</p><p>Fantasy Key\u2014Sunday afternoon</p><p>Their seemingly eight-handed driver escorted them to a side door, which he unlocked. The door gave way to an air-conditioned meeting room just inside the resort. Jordan palmed Tara\u2019s hip as he helped her inside, and Tara repressed a shiver. Hopefully, her contact with him would be brief over the next few days. Logan had done a good job hiding his irritation, but she\u2019d felt his livid fury under the surface. She smiled to herself.</p><p>When Jordan excused himself for a moment, Tara scanned the room. She hadn\u2019t expected the lobby since they\u2019d entered from the side. What she saw instead was tuxedoed waiters circulating with platters of fruit and cheese, ornate quiches, crab-stuffed mushrooms, and champagne. Tara desperately wanted a glass to calm her nerves, but Logan declined on her behalf when a young waiter passed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A few other guests milled around. Tara stared at them\u2014a motley collection of Doms and Dommes, most tagging a submissive or two along who were often dressed far more scantily than she. A few submissives had come alone.</p><p>Logan surveyed their surroundings, too. \u201cYou see anything interesting?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cYeah. See the submissive talking to Jordan, the one in the latex corset with her boobs hanging out?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He shot her a wry glance. \u201cSort of hard to miss her. She\u2019s really working it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTotally, but notice how she\u2019s greeting Jordan like an old friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr flirting up a storm.\u201d</p><p>Tara shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Most every sub looks a bit apprehensive, like they\u2019re not sure what to expect next. She doesn\u2019t. And she keeps glancing at the door on the other side of the room, like she\u2019s expecting someone to enter from that direction.\u201d</p><p>After a watchful minute, Logan nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. But she might work here. We know from Xander that they employ Doms to top the single submissive guests. Maybe the reverse applies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossible. But I think she may be our best bet to start getting the lay of the land.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Regret crossed his face. \u201cI\u2019d really love to touch you now, but it doesn\u2019t serve our purpose. So, this is where I\u2019m going to pretend to strike up a flirtation with the little sub. You hang in the corner and see if Jordan comes your way. He may chat you up once I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>Tara didn\u2019t like that idea at all, but she\u2019d come to Fantasy Key to investigate. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded, his eyes already across the room on the other woman. And her large, enhanced breasts with the bloodred teardrop crystals hanging from her pierced nipples.</p><p>In the corner, Tara did her best impression of a sub who had been relegated to the back burner by her Dom. She dropped into a slave position, head down, and waited. A collection of boots\u2014both men\u2019s and women\u2019s\u2014wandered past. Tara felt eyes on her, scanning, accessing. One man even walked a circle around her. She tensed, blocking out the feeling of being alone and vulnerable in front of a stranger. Looking up or telling him off would be seen as a punishable sign of disrespect.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not collared, pretty sub. You have a lovely ass,\u201d the deep voice said from just behind her, near her ear. \u201cDo you have a name?\u201d</p><p>Answer? Don\u2019t answer? Before she could decide, a familiar pair of loafers came into view.</p> <p>\u201cThis sub is spoken for,\u201d Jordan told the other Dom. \u201cI\u2019ll advise her Master over there\u201d\u2014Tara looked up through the fringe of her lashes to see him point\u2014\u201cthat he must clearly mark his property or be prepared to lose her.\u201d</p><p>The Dom stood closer to Jordan. \u201cIf he\u2019s not claiming his territory, perhaps there\u2019s a reason. And he looks rather busy with another sub.\u201d</p><p>Tara risked a peek across the room at Logan\u2014and jealousy stabbed her heart. He looked at the virtually topless blonde as if she fascinated him. She spoke, eyes drifting down for a second. Logan leaned close and ran a knuckle under her jaw, then over the swell of her breast. Before Tara could stop it, she gasped.</p><p>Jordan stepped into her line of vision. \u201cDid your Master leave you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She willed herself to lower her gaze, and stared hard at the green-and-gold-patterned carpet. Logan was doing his job, she told herself. Yes, but did he have to look so enthusiastic about it?</p><p>\u201cAre you being punished?\u201d Jordan asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir?\u201d he corrected her.</p> <p>She brought her full focus back to Jordan. With Logan seemingly otherwise occupied, was the dungeon master trying to establish a rapport with her? As much as he raised her hackles, getting in good with him would help their cause.</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir,\u201d she repeated, doing her best to sound breathy and chastised at once.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Immediately, she raised her gaze to his. Without the driver\u2019s cap, he was almost too attractive. Sharp bone structure, a lean swimmer\u2019s sort of body, dark hair with a hint of curl around his ears and just tousled enough to make him look like he could find trouble and be happy reveling in it. Very Abercrombie. Something about him chafed at her instincts.</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cWe have a few minutes before the orientation begins. Would you like a little bonus tour?\u201d He lowered his voice conspiratorially. \u201cYou won\u2019t see this part of the resort unless you\u2019re invited.\u201d</p><p>The VIP area? If that\u2019s what Jordan meant, it would be an awesome break for her case. She glanced back over at Logan, trying to catch his attention. He didn\u2019t veer for a second from Miss Plastic Double-D Cups.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be gone long enough for him to miss you,\u201d Jordan promised, sidling closer.</p><p>In fact, every time she acted a bit shy and overwhelmed, he seemed more interested. She\u2019d noticed it on the boat and again just now. So she played the reticent card by looking down once more and angling her shoulders away from him.</p><p>\u201cHe might get angry. I don\u2019t know . . . Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he moaned very near her ear, like just hearing that word on her lips turned him on. \u201cIf he\u2019s angry, I\u2019ll talk to him, let him know I led you away.\u201d</p><p>In truth, she didn\u2019t want to go anywhere with Jordan. She could feel his lascivious gray eyes scanning every inch of her flesh, lingering especially on her nipples. But turning him down now might mean the opportunity would never come again.</p><p>\u201cA\u2014all right. Thank you, Sir. I\u2019m very curious.\u201d She tried to sound breathy and flattered.</p><p>Jordan reached for her arm, grazing the side of her breast with his long fingers. She gasped, and he chuckled in her ear as he guided her out the door. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019re a very curious pet. There are many things here I\u2019d love to show you.\u201d</p><p>Tara didn\u2019t have to pretend to shiver, though she hoped he\u2019d interpret it as excitement.</p><p>As they neared the door leading deeper into the resort, Logan cast her a sidelong glance, even as he all but buried his face in the blonde\u2019s neck. The other sub looked flushed and she swayed toward him like she was ready to lie down and spread her legs.</p><p>Shoving the feelings of betrayal down, Tara let Jordan lead her out of the room. She and Logan were assuming identities and behaving like those characters for this case. But as she nibbled at the side of her cheek, Tara felt old insecurities sneak back into her head. The sub Logan flirted with reminded her so much of Brittany Fuller from high school, the girlfriend he\u2019d taken to bed both before and after her.</p><p>Logan had told her just this morning that he loved her. But in the past, love had never equated with being faithful for Logan. He\u2019d left her to protect her before, yes. But had it really been necessary to punctuate their breakup with an exclamation note by fucking Brittany at a party that night and letting the whole school know? Granted, he\u2019d been celibate these last few years, but what if she\u2019d \u201ccured\u201d him of that so he could now move on with someone else? Even if he didn\u2019t really want this blonde, would he take her to bed in order to wheedle information from her? Did he want to?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking awfully hard, little sub. Understandable since your Dom isn\u2019t here to do it for you.\u201d</p><p>Blech. Did he really just say that?</p><p>\u201cSo let me help,\u201d Jordan continued on. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. If you aren\u2019t getting the proper attention from Logan, I\u2019ll make sure you receive it. I would love to take you under my wing for the duration of your stay.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, how often did he use that line? He probably had success with it or he wouldn\u2019t be using it now.</p><p>She forced a smile, fluttered her lashes, and looked away demurely, holding back the urge to vomit.</p><p>Jordan looped an arm around her shoulders. \u201cSo sweet. You haven\u2019t been submitting long?\u201d</p><p>He phrased it like a question, but clearly he knew the answer. Tara jumped to mental attention. Jordan was a Dom\u2014and clearly a smart one. Unless she wanted him to figure her out and get suspicious, she\u2019d better stay on top of her game.</p><p>\u201cNo. Master Logan is my first Dom. I\u2019m trying to learn, but I fear he\u2019s . . . losing interest in me.\u201d</p><p>A nice add to their cover story. Jordan instantly took the bait.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you spend your time here alone.\u201d He picked up the pace down a long hallway, then used a key card to enter an elevator to a higher floor. Inside the car, Jordan caressed her hips with his thumbs, and Tara felt his breath on the back of her neck as he nestled his hard cock against her ass. It was all she could do to stand there and let him touch her.</p><p>When they emerged into a hall, it was empty, except the superplush decor. Tara stopped in alarm. For all she knew, Jordan was taking her to a deserted part of the resort to abduct her now. It\u2019s not like she was wearing a gun with this getup\u2014something she intended to talk to Logan about if she got free.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost there, sweet sub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m afraid.\u201d She kept playing her shy almost-virgin card. \u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her chin and forced her to look at him. \u201cThe VIP room. It\u2019s a very special place where your fantasies can come true. Would you like that?\u201d</p><p>Tara\u2019s stomach jumped. This definitely was a break, and she needed to stay in Jordan\u2019s good graces.</p><p>\u201cReally? Yes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d He led her down to the end of the hallway, then used his key card to access a set of double steel doors. After they clicked open, he shoved them wide.</p><p>Before her was a BDSM heaven\u2014or hell. Three naked men stood around a flushed brunette who was bound and blindfolded. Tara tried not to let her jaw drop as they each took turns feeding their cocks into her mouth or pussy. Her tight breasts bobbed with every thrust.</p><p>\u201cDoes that excite you?\u201d</p><p>It was titillating and repelling at once, but she played along. \u201cOh my . . . yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis slave\u2019s fantasy was to experience complete submission to strangers while her Dom watches. I think they\u2019re both enjoying it.\u201d</p><p>With a glance across the room, Tara spotted an older, very urbane man lounging in a recliner, watching the scene with a faint smile as he sipped a glass of brandy. In the chair beside him, another man watched. He looked more official, and she realized he wore the same black garb that Jordan did, emblazoned with the resort\u2019s logo in turquoise on the front. He also wore a matching tie. Another dungeon Master? Someone higher up the food chain?</p><p>The man looked her way, sized her up. Tara had to resist the urge to take a step back. When Jordan glanced at her, it was like he sized up a sex object he couldn\u2019t wait to get his dick into. This man looked at her like a commodity he couldn\u2019t wait to exploit.</p><p>The brunette across the room gasped, then screamed, as if she were in pain. Tara swung her gaze across the room, stunned to see the sub, now bent at the waist, taking the cock of yet another man, this one wearing a latex hood. His penis was blue at the head and enormous. She\u2019d never seen equipment that large on any guy. And he was ruthlessly shoving it into the woman, between her legs that had been tied obscenely wide apart.</p><p>Tara stiffened.</p><p>\u201cSo innocent.\u201d Jordan laughed. \u201cShe wants this. She enjoys the struggle of taking a man this size.\u201d</p><p>Seriously? Given how painful it looked, she couldn\u2019t imagine why. And the woman was going to fail. Though the man pounded away at her, at least three inches of his cock remained outside her body.</p><p>The woman\u2019s well-dressed Dom rose and doffed his dark blue blazer, sauntering across the room. He lifted her head to him by fisting a handful of her hair and yanking.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it, slave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master. Thank you, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake more of his cock. You\u2019ve got inches to go.\u201d</p><p>The words alone nearly made the woman come, given the way she gasped and moaned. The man behind her shoved more of his dick in her pussy. She screamed again. Her Dom angled her head toward the man to her left, who rapidly stroked himself, then came in her open mouth.</p><p>\u201cSwallow,\u201d her Dom demanded.</p><p>She did, then groaned again when the other two men around her, also masturbating, came in fluid strokes across the smooth olive skin of her back. As they did, she arched and stuck her butt out. The stranger with the huge cock thrust even deeper into her pussy, until most of it disappeared. Then her Dom settled his fingers on her clit.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come, slave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Master. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my permission.\u201d He rubbed furiously between her legs as the hooded stranger shoved into her. The brunette\u2019s mouth opened in a silent O for a long moment. She closed her eyes, focusing. Then she screamed loudly, her entire body convulsing as the hugely hung stranger groaned in release.</p><p>Tara let out a breath. It was a scene she wouldn\u2019t want to participate in, but the submissive had clearly enjoyed herself. And that freedom of self-expression appealed to Tara. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVery well done,\u201d the man with the emblazoned shirt and the tie said, clapping. \u201cWas the scene to your satisfaction?\u201d he asked the brunette\u2019s Dom.</p><p>Surprise poked at Tara. That voice sounded familiar . . .</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>The two men shook hands, then the Dom unclipped his female, wrapping a gentle arm around her, before he grabbed his jacket, and helped her out the door.</p> <p>The second they\u2019d gone, the other man turned his attention to her. \u201cAnd who have we here?\u201d</p><p>Tara frowned. Yes, she\u2019d definitely heard that voice before. His face wasn\u2019t familiar at all, but his voice\u2014mellow, with a used car salesman flare\u2014she knew. But from where?</p><p>Damn, she couldn\u2019t place it.</p><p>Jordan shoved her forward. \u201cThis is a new little sub whose Dom is . . . otherwise occupied. Her name is Tara.\u201d</p><p>The man stuck out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Lincoln Kantor, the resort\u2019s manager. Welcome to our VIP room. I think you\u2019ll enjoy it here.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>\u201cWHAT did you find?\u201d Tara whispered to Logan after Jordan and Mr. Kantor escorted her back to the orientation, all smiles and attentiveness.</p><p>The two of them were a one-two punch of pure wrong.</p><p>A quick glance around the room proved that Logan\u2019s little slut bunny had gone, and he stood alone, arms crossed over his massive chest. He didn\u2019t have to pretend to be angry.</p><p>When she reached his side, he wrapped his hand around her arm and dragged her to the back of the room. \u201cWhere the hell did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe VIP room. I met Fantasy Key\u2019s manager.\u201d Tara nodded at Kantor, who stood at the front of the room, reaching for a microphone. He looked distinguished with this tall, almost scholarly build, his hair more salt than pepper. \u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHello, everyone. Welcome to Fantasy Key,\u201d Kantor said into the microphone, wearing a friendly, perfectly fake smile.</p><p>Everyone clapped. Jordan stood beside his manager, scanning the crowd. His gaze found her and lingered. She played shy and looked down.</p><p>Logan lingered close to her during the orientation, which was a general overview of the resort\u2019s rules, meal times, dungeon hours, and etiquette. Tara listened with half an ear, bursting with everything she\u2019d learned earlier, trying to process it all.</p><p>The second Kantor walked off the stage and started shaking hands, Logan grabbed her by the arm and thrust her out the door and down the hall.</p><p>Tara dug in her heels. \u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur room. We have two hours before dinner and play time.\u201d</p><p>They were here to work a case, so they needed to make use of every free second. \u201cGreat, but could you slow down? Unlike you, I\u2019m not six-four.\u201d</p><p>Cursing under his breath, Logan slowed his step. \u201cWhat did you see in the VIP room?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome hardcore stuff.\u201d She explained the scene she\u2019d witnessed. \u201cAnd in case you didn\u2019t notice, Jordan was very interested in me. As was Kantor.\u201d</p><p>Logan scowled. \u201cThey were so obvious, they might as well have been wearing signs. And either Kantor is a piss-poor manager, or he knows exactly what\u2019s happening under his roof.\u201d</p><p>She agreed with that assessment. \u201cI\u2019m betting on the latter. He\u2019s creepy with a capital C. The weirdest thing? I know I\u2019ve heard his voice before. I just can\u2019t place it.\u201d</p><p>He snapped a laser-sharp stare in her direction. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive. I just wish I could remember where . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep working on it.\u201d Logan clenched his jaw and grabbed her elbow. His strides picked up pace again as they turned a corner.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, slow down.\u201d She jerked her elbow from his grasp. \u201cWhat are you so pissed about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPissed, worried, out of my mind . . .\u201d</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t stop again until he found their room and used the key card to push her inside the door. He slammed it behind him. \u201cStrip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Tara\u2019s brows shot up and her jaw dropped. He wanted to play games? Even as a first-time field agent, she knew they had to sweep the room for bugs. It was standard protocol.</p><p>\u201cTake everything off except your nipple huggers. Now,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d she growled under her breath, pointing around the room, then to her ears.</p><p>With a curt nod, he tore around the room, looking in crevices and crannies, upending pillows, lifting lamps, uncovering bare walls behind pictures. Tara joined in, searching the room.</p><p>Suddenly, Logan stiffened, then set the remote control back on the desk. \u201cCome with me, slave.\u201d</p><p>As he dragged her to their luxurious bathroom, her mind raced. He\u2019d found surveillance equipment in their room. Was every suite in this place equipped in that way, as a part of some standard operating procedure? Or had she and Logan been discovered before they\u2019d even stepped foot on the island? Shit. If so, what should they do next?</p><p>Inside the dazzling bathroom, natural stone tiles blended with glass accents in earthy colors. Soft lighting, fluffy towels, and a sinful shower with six heads waited. Logan flipped on the faucet full blast in the huge stall. A muscle ticked in his jaw.</p><p>\u201cLast warning. Strip or else.\u201d</p><p>This was the only way they could talk freely. Their voices would be obscured by the spray.</p><p>Tara swallowed and complied, pushing the little top\u2019s spaghetti straps down her shoulders, then peeling the sheer material off her body. Logan ate her up with his gaze, his face growing intent, his eyes fierce, predatory. Her breath stuttered.</p><p>Then he backed her against the wall and shoved the thong down her legs with a growl. Flinging the little garment aside, he rose and covered her body with his own, the muscled slabs of his chest and sinewy arms eclipsing her. Notching his hard cock right between her thighs, he tore off his own clothes. Then he fused their mouths together with a dark hunger that sent her reeling.</p><p>God, they were here to do a job, and she was exhausted after the last forty-eight really eventful hours, but the second he kissed her, all that fell away. Only the mind-stealing sear of desire and the desperate need to feel Logan inside her remained.</p><p>Tearing his mouth away, a muscle in his jaw ticking like leaving her for a second pissed him off, he tossed her into the shower and closed the clear glass doors behind him.</p><p>Tara frowned. \u201cLogan, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur room is bugged,\u201d he spat out matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cI guessed as much. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m damn worried that means someone already knows who we are and why we\u2019re here. As much as I hate it, I\u2019m wondering if we should bail.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head emphatically. \u201cI can\u2019t walk away from this assignment without proof that we\u2019ve been made. I can\u2019t leave Darcy . . . I\u2019ve got to find her before Thursday, when intel says they\u2019ll take her out of the country.\u201d To film the snuff piece that would end her life.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI knew you were going to say that. Fine, but if we want to talk, we\u2019ll have to do it here or turn up the music really loudly in our room and whisper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d He dragged her against his body as hot water pelted them. Steam rose all around. \u201cThis place is teeming with sick fucks selling women to abusers and rapists around the world who might be on to us, and you have to ask why I\u2019m uptight when you disappear? I swear to God, Cherry, I should give you the spanking of a lifetime. Don\u2019t you dare leave my side again in this place without telling me where you\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>That raised her hackles. She wasn\u2019t helpless. \u201cDo you act this way with the other SEALs? No, you trust them to do their jobs. Trust me to do mine. I\u2019m a federal agent, if you\u2019ll recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, one without a gun, Bureau backup, or experience.\u201d</p><p>Eyes narrowed, she let him have a dose of the fury brewing inside her. \u201cWell, when I left before the orientation, you looked far too busy to interrupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod damn it, I only talked to Allison. Like you suspected, she\u2019s been here before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison, is it?\u201d Of course they were on a first name basis. \u201cYou work fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was pumping her for information.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands on her hips. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you were.\u201d</p><p>Logan raised a dark brow at her and said nothing. Tara realized that she sounded like a jealous shrew. He was doing a job; they both were. She couldn\u2019t bring her emotions in the middle of this.</p><p>Tara drew in a deep breath. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m on edge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that edge off.\u201d He sent her a sideways smile. \u201cIf you\u2019re good and obey me.\u201d</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat. Her pussy clenched. Tara shoved her reactions aside. \u201cWhat did Allison say?\u201d</p><p>Logan reached for the soap and rubbed it between his big palms. \u201cThat she was friends with Laken Fox, the dead girl pulled out of the ocean a few days ago. She said that it\u2019s against the rules to exchange personal information with other guests, but she and Laken did it anyway and became friends. Allison came this week because she was supposed to join Laken. Now she can\u2019t find her friend and doesn\u2019t know why. Apparently, the woman wrote Allison last week to say that she\u2019d returned to Fantasy Key and met a great Dom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan?\u201d</p><p>Logan shrugged. \u201cMaybe. Allison is worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has every right to be. If Jordan is the one who targets our vics, he definitely has access to the VIP room. No one batted an eyelash when he walked in with me. But Kantor sure sized me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll watch him. You get Bocelli digging deeper into both of them. We\u2019ll come up with a plan to figure out Jordan\u2019s role in this together. Understood?\u201d</p><p>There was his Dom voice again. He wasn\u2019t speaking to her as an operative or a partner, but as a Master. Tara knew she shouldn\u2019t, but somehow that voice made her shiver and melt.</p><p>\u201cYes. We should be working together and\u2014ah!\u201d</p><p>He cupped her breasts with his soapy hands and thumbed her incredibly sensitive nipples. Bracketed by the delicate silver jewelry, they stood up, had swelled, and every brush of his skin against them had her gasping and holding on to him.</p><p>\u201cGood. Not another word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off by lifting and spinning her until she was directly beneath the warm spray. The soap ran down her body until only water remained in rivulets. Logan began to catch them with his tongue, the shower running down his face as he sipped at her breasts and lapped at her tight, aching nipples. \u201cSo fucking gorgeous, Cherry. I love eating at these. I love eating all of you.\u201d</p><p>Tara nearly lost her mind. Tingles multiplied and sizzled, firing her blood, burning hotter with his every word until he nearly shut down her brain.</p><p>He wedged his feet between hers and nudged her legs apart\u2014and she was too far gone to object. Her stomach pulsed as he covered her mound possessively with his palm, fingers sliding into her slick folds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so sexy how wet you get for me.\u201d</p><p>She was still catching her breath when he lifted her body against his, arms straining, veins bulging, as he forced her legs around his waist and flattened her back to the wall. She hissed at the cold surface between her shoulders and the inferno of his flesh over her breasts. Heaven and hell all in one.</p><p>And she wanted it, him, throwing her arms around her neck as his cock bobbed between them, steely and thick and impossible to resist.</p><p>He bent, positioned himself at her entrance, and tried to impale her in one savage thrust.</p><p>\u201cTake me,\u201d he panted against her jaw, then covered her mouth with his.</p><p>Logan gripped her hips and pushed her down on his cock as he arched, trying to shove more of that fat blue head and those unyielding inches into her. She gasped against his lips\u2014and he used the opening as an opportunity to thrust his tongue deep.</p><p>Tara couldn\u2019t feel, hear, see, smell, or taste anything except Logan. He overtook every sense, wrapping himself all around her with his strength, his conviction, his seduction. She\u2019d had \u201cjust sex\u201d before. This was far more.</p><p>With a whimper, she wriggled, trying to take all of his hard stalk. He cursed, eased back a fraction, then plowed so deeply into her body, her head fell back against the tile with a scream.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, Cherry. Take every inch of me, sweet girl. Yeah,\u201d he rasped into her ear as he stroked into her again, easier with each spine-tingling plunge. She softened to accommodate all of him.</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d She grabbed frantically at his hair. \u201cGod, you fill me up. I\u2019ve never felt so alive.\u201d</p><p>His lips razed across her jaw. \u201cI\u2019d been dead for years until you came back. Don\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>Never, a voice inside her cried.</p><p>But was it really that simple? Could they simply resolve to be together? Her stepfather would oppose it. More important, they still had trust issues to bridge. In her head, she knew why Logan left her in high school. But for her heart, letting go of the pain and believing that he wouldn\u2019t hurt her again wasn\u2019t a matter of pure logic. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But when she was in his arms, like now, when he couldn\u2019t seem to get close enough, she felt adored. Like the only woman in his world.</p><p>Logan cupped her, lifting her closer as he nipped her lobe and whispered to her. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, baby. I dreamed of you. Wanted you. Fantasized. For me, it\u2019s always been you.\u201d</p><p>And with every word, he forged deeper inside her slick, swelling pussy, scraping against her sensitized flesh. When he was like this, it was so easy to crave him, care about him, impossible to remember any reason she shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, Cherry. Get all tight on me.\u201d He slowed his strokes, lingering over the one spot designed to send her soaring.</p> <p>\u201cPlease, Logan!\u201d she dug her nails into his shoulders, feeling her world tilt out of control.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s right here, baby. Let me give you what you need.\u201d He grabbed her tighter, ground into her, against the spot that ached most.</p><p>That was all she had to hear. With his voice mingling with her racing heartbeat, and their bodies moving as one, pleasure rushed her. Overwhelmed by the sensation overtaking her body and Logan shouting her name, she reveled when he followed her into the rush, coming inside her in a hot, liquid release.</p><p>Long moments and hard breaths later, Logan set her on her feet, then braced one hand on the wall above her shoulder for support. He nuzzled her neck as he panted, \u201cI can\u2019t stop fucking you. You\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>Her legs felt boneless, too. Still, she teased, \u201cYou\u2019re complaining?\u201d</p> <p>He lifted his head, even with water plastering his hair to his forehead, he was the most heart-stopping man she\u2019d ever seen. The thick, black fringe of his lashes framed blue, blue eyes that sparkled with sudden mischief. \u201cHell, no. If I die from having too much sex with you, that\u2019s the best possible way to go.\u201d</p><p>Tara rolled her eyes, but couldn\u2019t wipe the grin off her face. Until she began washing up. No missing his semen leaking from her sex. And she wondered again why she\u2019d held her birth-control pill in her hand last night . . . then elected not to take it. She wasn\u2019t sure she trusted him entirely, but she wanted him so badly, wanted to tie him to her always. Swept by the rightness of the image of her holding his son or daughter.</p><p>He watched her intently, almost as if he knew what she was thinking. Given their intense connection, it was possible he did.</p><p>\u201cCherry, did you take your pill last night?\u201d</p><p>It would be so easy to lie and say she forgot, but she wasn\u2019t a coward. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His smile dazzled her. \u201cYou\u2019re making me hard all over again. I want you committed to me. Tell me you haven\u2019t thought about the future and kids. I have. I\u2019ve been thinking about that a lot, about little girls with red hair.\u201d</p> <p>A big part of her wanted to throw caution to the wind and admit that she\u2019d thought about it, too. But she hadn\u2019t come to Fantasy Key to hash out her personal life. She\u2019d be here a few days at most. They could sort all this out afterward.</p><p>\u201cLogan, I can\u2019t think about the future now. My mission here is to find Darcy and arrest her tormenters. After that . . . we\u2019ll talk. It\u2019s not as simple as me getting over the past. Adam is my only family, the one who\u2019d walk me down the aisle. And he hates you. We can\u2019t pretend that being together would be easy.\u201d</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t. And not preventing herself from getting pregnant didn\u2019t sound smart, but she\u2019d looked at the little tablet and the glass of water\u2014and just couldn\u2019t bring herself to swallow them. What did that mean?</p><p>\u201cBeing with me would force hard choices on you. I understand that and I wish I could change it. I can only say that, if you choose me, I\u2019d do everything possible to not make your regret your decision.\u201d</p><p>Whereas Adam would try his damndest to come between them. He might not be worried anymore that Logan was only after one thing, but he\u2019d never forgiven Logan for breaking her heart. \u201cBut that isn\u2019t our only obstacle. You\u2019re still a SEAL, barely ever home and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can say the word tomorrow and have a position as a BUD/S instructor in Coronado, California.\u201d</p><p>An instructor? He\u2019d be in one place, no more missions? \u201cWould you be happy being sidelined?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the teams. Hell, I\u2019ve loved them. But I love you more.\u201d</p> <p>Tara blinked. Of all the things she\u2019d expected him to say, this wasn\u2019t it. She stared\u2014and couldn\u2019t deny that his words touched her. Tears stung her eyes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t make you give up something you love for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not making me. I\u2019m volunteering, totally willingly.\u201d Before she could open her mouth, he laid a finger over her lips. \u201cThink about it. I know we have a different agenda right now, but when this is over, okay?\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t she owe them both that much? Whatever they had between them had long since stopped feeling like merely bringing closure to their shared past. This now felt more like a possible future. As much as her heart embraced that, she couldn\u2019t deny that Logan still scared the hell out of her.</p><p>Silently, she nodded as he cut off the shower.</p><p>He kissed the tip of her nose, then stepped out onto the cool tile and handed her a towel. As she dried off, he wrapped his own around his waist, and checked his cell phone. \u201cDamn, only thirty minutes before dinner. When the hell are they going to bring our luggage?\u201d</p><p>Other than his carry-on with the sat phone and laptop, he had nothing. Tara had only a few toiletries.</p><p>No sooner than he spoke the words, then a knock resounded through the room.</p><p>\u201cPorter,\u201d the man from the other side called.</p><p>Logan secured the towel around his waist, then shut the bathroom door to shield her before he answered the door. Tara peeked through the crack as he wrenched the door open and found their luggage sitting by the portal.</p><p>With a frown, he carted the suitcases inside. Tara knew what he was thinking. If the resort\u2019s management only intended to x-ray luggage to ensure no one brought weapons into the resort, as they said, why was their luggage so delayed: There hadn\u2019t been a ton of guests at the orientation\u2014maybe twenty\u2014and the resort wasn\u2019t that big. She bit her lip. Something definitely wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>Something like Fantasy Key already knowing that she and Logan had come to take them down.</p><p>Maybe it would be wiser to abort this mission, but she refused to leave Darcy to certain death, not while she could still save her friend. The suspicious look on Logan\u2019s face said his thoughts were chugging down the same track.</p><p>\u201cOpen the suitcase I packed for you.\u201d Make sure everything is untouched. \u201cGet dressed in the beige silk. No bra. No panties. Quickly. We\u2019re pressed for time.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her bag onto the bed, then did the same with his duffel. Tara unzipped hers, and frowned. Most of the scanty, unfamiliar garments Logan had chosen for her were still folded and neatly stacked. Even the little bit of jewelry she\u2019d brought with her was still in place. But everything looked a bit displaced, out of order, more than the normal settling that occurred on an airplane.</p><p>Beside her, Logan unzipped his gear. Almost instantly, he stiffened. His luggage had been tampered with, too.</p><p>But he forced a smile, then turned to her, kissing her cheek. \u201cBe quick. We\u2019ll talk on the way to dinner.\u201d</p><p>In the hall, where electronic ears probably weren\u2019t monitoring them. Was there any chance that the resort listened in on all their guests as a habit? Or did he worry, like her, that someone at Fantasy Key already knew they had the FBI in their midst?</p><p>Fantasy Key\u2014Sunday night</p><p>As they walked from the dining room to the dungeon, Logan glanced again at Cherry\u2014and damn near lost his mind. Hell, he\u2019d been distracted the moment she\u2019d donned the dress.</p><p>He\u2019d known when he\u2019d picked it out for her a few days ago that she\u2019d look spectacular in it, but he hadn\u2019t expected being so hot for her that he couldn\u2019t eat, couldn\u2019t do anything but stare at the way the soft, sheer fabric clung to her breasts. Scooping low in the front, elastic cupped the sweet mounds beneath, while the garment showcased her gloriously stiff nipples, still encased in the nipple huggers. Every time she moved, they brushed the material. Her little gasps and groans told Logan those pretty little buds were all fucking kinds of sensitive\u2014and the knowledge had him so damn hard.</p><p>Even though he\u2019d fucked her barely an hour ago, the need to work his aching cock deep into that narrow, clasping pussy of hers right now obliterated nearly every other thought.</p><p>The dress hung in a straight line from just beneath her breasts, but the main hallways of Fantasy Key were well lit. The glow from nearby sconces slanted through the sheer fabric, perfectly revealing the smooth mound of her cunt and the lush globes of her ass.</p><p>The shitty part? He wasn\u2019t the only one looking. They\u2019d barely taken two steps into the dining room before Jordan had fallen into step beside her and reminded him that their safety demonstration scene must be held before they\u2019d be allowed to use the dungeons freely.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe the little asshole reserved us a time at the spanking bench without even consulting me. He\u2019s trying to usurp me to get to you,\u201d Logan growled. \u201cI want to wring his fucking neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. You\u2019re not supposed to care, remember?\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you out of my sight again. Period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as we stay in the more public areas, I should be fine. If he invites me back to the VIP area, we\u2019ll put a plan together. I got his attention, and that\u2019s a good first step.\u201d</p><p>As Tara had all through dinner, she fingered a dainty pendant that hung from her slender neck. The little gold filigreed heart was nestled right in the hollow of her throat, suspended by a thin gold chain, so short it could almost pass for a choker\u2014or a very pretty collar. It looked familiar.</p><p>He leaned in, frowned. \u201cWhere have I seen you wear that before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day we . . . split up. I don\u2019t wear it that much anymore, but I did tonight because while I was kneeling in the orientation room earlier while you chatted up Allison, another Dom approached me and mentioned that I looked available because I don\u2019t have a collar. I thought this might work in a pinch.\u201d</p><p>Good thinking on her part. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like a collar, per se, but it\u2019s close enough that others will wonder if it\u2019s intended for that purpose and steer clear. Our situation here is complicated enough without having other creeps chase after you. So, you ready for this demonstration?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThe basics didn\u2019t sound hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s their public way of weeding out the total amateurs who could cause problems. This way, they keep as many people as possible safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, while trying to decide which subs to kidnap and sell off to oil barons and Internet billionaires in obscure countries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>In the dungeon, the lighting was much lower, but the fabric of Tara\u2019s dress was so sheer he could still see the outline of her labia and the crack of her ass, not to mention the hard nubs of her nipples poking the front until he could barely look at anything else.</p><p>It was almost a relief to reach the spanking bench\u2014except that Jordan awaited them, devouring her with his gaze.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to your safety scene.\u201d He gestured to Tara to make her way onto the padded bench. \u201cWhat is your safe word?\u201d</p><p>Tara knelt on the red leather and sent Logan a sly grin\u2014and made his heart tumble in his chest. Their private joke and the deeper meaning behind her safe word roused every primal part of him until he wanted to scream, Mine!</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Romeo,\u201d she said finally.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s acceptable.\u201d Jordan turned to him. \u201cHer hard limits?\u201d</p><p>Crap, they\u2019d never had the opportunity to actually discuss these. He\u2019d been too busy fucking her to ask. Shit, he hated to miss details, but now he had to wing it. \u201cCutting, branding, piercing\u2014anything permanent. No bodily functions, blood, or breathplay. And no sex with multiple partners or strangers.\u201d</p><p>With that, it should be very clear to Jordan that he wasn\u2019t getting a piece of Cherry.</p><p>\u201cIs this a full and complete list, sub?\u201d</p><p>Tara looked at him, as if seeking direction, then she nodded. \u201cWhat he said, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Hearing her call another Dom \u201cSir\u201d bugged the shit out of Logan. It bugged him more that he couldn\u2019t do a damn thing about it.</p><p>Jordan nodded. \u201cHer soft limits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot wax and anal.\u201d Logan stroked his chin, trying to think of limitations that would inhibit the dungeon creep\u2019s ability to steal her away. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like being blindfolded or gagged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuly noted. Anything else you\u2019d like to add, sub?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cVery well. Let\u2019s see how you use the equipment.\u201d He gestured to the spanking bench.</p><p>Logan attached cuffs to her wrists, then clipped them into the restraints on each side of the apparatus. She sent him a nervous glance. He wanted so badly to reassure her that he wouldn\u2019t leave her side and would act as a buffer between her and Jordan, but he couldn\u2019t give her more than an encouraging glance. He finished with ankle cuffs and a spreader bar. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As he straightened up, Jordan handed him a four-foot single-tail whip. \u201cI presume you know how to use this and find it acceptable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how to use it, though I prefer a six-footer.\u201d</p><p>Jordan scowled. \u201cThey\u2019re unpredictable.\u201d</p><p>Logan smiled. \u201cUnpredictable is what I do best. But in this sub\u2019s case, I must add whipping to her list of soft limits. Spanking by hand or crop in small doses, yes. Whip or cane, no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re bringing along a soft little sub.\u201d The dungeon master\u2019s tone held a note of contempt that made Logan want to pound his face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly the way I like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d be a better sub with her horizons expanded. While she\u2019s here, we should work on that.\u201d</p><p>We? As if Jordan had any rights or say-so over Cherry? If Logan wasn\u2019t playing a part for this mission, he\u2019d open up a huge can of badass on this pretentious little fuck and let him know unequivocally that he had no part in her training or her life.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Logan forced himself to say.</p> <p>Jordan could barely tamp down his superior smirk. \u201cI\u2019ll think on it and map out a plan.\u201d</p><p>And I will shove your balls down your throat and make you thank me for it.</p><p>A big leather-clad Dom wielding a whip and wearing a mask ran into their scene, exuding an urgency that immediately put Logan on alert. \u201cMaster Jordan, there\u2019s been a fight in the orgy room. It\u2019s turning into a melee. Mr. Kantor sent me to find you.\u201d</p><p>Concern washed over the dungeon master\u2019s face. \u201cDamn!\u201d He took in the monogram on the new Dom\u2019s shirt. \u201cStay here with these two. They aren\u2019t to leave this scene until they\u2019ve completed their safety drill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it. Go!\u201d</p><p>Jordan dashed off like his ass was on fire, so Logan turned to the masked dungeon monitor. \u201cLook, we were nearly done, and I\u2019ve been studying and practicing this lifestyle for nearly ten years, so\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo shit, Logan.\u201d The stranger ripped off his mask.</p><p>Shock blanched Logan. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here, Xander?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>\u201cGREAT to see you, too,\u201d Xander shot back.</p><p>Logan\u2019s mind raced, trying to reconcile seeing his buddy in the middle of his mission. \u201cDid Bocelli send you after all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. He\u2019d probably kill me if he knew I\u2019d come, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized I could help. I know this place. Everyone who works here signs a contract that prohibits you from saying anything about any guest to anyone, other than staff. That fucking thing is tighter than a straitjacket. You\u2019re not going to learn jack shit from any employee if you don\u2019t have an in. Which is why I begged for my old job back, and what do you know? One of their resident Doms met up with an unfortunate hiking accident just this morning. Broken ankle; he\u2019ll recover. But they needed someone to fill in.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>With a shake of his head, Logan leaned in and murmured, \u201cWe\u2019re probably not going to get any info, anyway. The remote control in our room had a bug placed inside and our luggage had been searched. Unless you\u2019re going to tell me that\u2019s standard operating procedure here, then I think they knew who we were before we even walked in the door.\u201d</p><p>Xander recoiled. \u201cIt\u2019s been a few years since I worked here, but that isn\u2019t the SOP I remember. I mean, yeah, they search the luggage to confiscate any video or audio recording equipment. They started that after a high-profile blackmail incident a few years ago. If Bocelli had given you all the literature they send once you book your reservation, you would have read that. But bugging the rooms . . .\u201d</p> <p>Because it really didn\u2019t make sense. Why spy on all their guests? Though a small, exclusive resort, there was no way that they could listen to all those conversations at once or even record them for later playback unless they hired a whole staff twenty-four/seven. And why bother?</p><p>Logan piped up, \u201cThere\u2019s only one conclusion, man: Someone at Fantasy Key knows why we\u2019ve come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily. Even a few years ago, some of the staff liked to abuse their powers. They\u2019d electronically eavesdrop on certain guests they found . . . intriguing.\u201d</p><p>As Jordan had certainly found Cherry. That conclusion was disconcerting, but more palatable than someone nefarious knowing that he and Tara were here on behalf of the FBI to break up their sex slave ring.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible, but I can\u2019t prove if it\u2019s that or something else. Until then, it\u2019s better to work off the assumption that the listening device was more suspicious than lecherous. For that reason, you need to act like you don\u2019t know me. Pretend to run through the rest of this safety scene and we\u2019ll meet up after.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Xander made a production of covering the checklist again, then signing off and handing a copy of the form to Logan, who took it from his pal. On it, he\u2019d written:</p><p>Meet me on the east beach in ten.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Xander looked around to see if anyone was watching, but the room wasn\u2019t very busy yet, and everyone seemed to be going about their business. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can find out.\u201d Then he spoke up again. \u201cPlay safe. Be sure to find a member of the staff if you need any help or have any questions.\u201d</p><p>With that, he walked off. Logan leaned over to Cherry, who\u2019d remained surprisingly quiet during the exchange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear all that?\u201d he asked, leaning to whisper in her ear.</p><p>\u201cMost. The music is a little loud. I heard Xander say why he\u2019s here, but don\u2019t you find his presence a little suspicious?\u201d</p><p>If he were anyone else, Logan would wonder what kind of shit he was up to. But Xander had always been unpredictable. His buddy was more than a little closemouthed about himself, but Logan knew he came from money\u2014so much of it that bankers had to physically count the number of zeros in his family\u2019s balances. Though smart as hell and go-getting when he wanted to be, Xander had never held a real job. One thing Logan did know: The man never liked to miss out on the action, especially if he could make mischief right in the middle of it.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just Xander being Xander. But we\u2019ll have to watch him. If he\u2019s decided to help us, he\u2019ll throw caution to the wind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich could be destructive for us all.\u201d Tara frowned as Logan unclipped her cuffs and removed them. \u201cWhat are you doing? Aren\u2019t we supposed to scene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s optional right now. I\u2019d rather take a walk on the beach.\u201d</p><p>SOMETHING about the look on Logan\u2019s face told her this walk was more important than establishing their dynamic as the obedient sub to his indifferent Dom.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Lead the way.\u201d</p><p>No one\u2019s head turned as they slipped out the door, through the lobby, and out a side exit. Past a small parking lot full of resort vehicles and a foul Dumpster, they followed a stone-laden path between a few palm trees, away from prying eyes, toward the sound of waves breaking.</p><p>As she felt sand beneath her toes and smelled salt in the air, Logan grabbed her hand and held it in his. The moon hung heavy and surprisingly bright, and Tara wished for one moment that she and Logan were here for romance, without a care in the world.</p><p>But she needed to put frivolous wishes aside and focus on saving Darcy. Tara wondered if her friend even knew she was scheduled to die horrifically in a gang-rape snuff film in a few days. She tensed, gripping Logan\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Now wasn\u2019t the time to break down. \u201cTrying to keep it together. Why are we out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cXander wanted us to meet him. No idea why. Like everything he does, we\u2019ll have to wait and find out when he deigns to tell us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d Xander said suddenly, emerging from behind a little cabana, then winked at her. \u201cI try to help out and this is the thanks I get from my old pal, despite providing one of the few places on the island that I know isn\u2019t covered by surveillance. And for arranging Freddy in maintenance to get you a new remote for your TV that isn\u2019t bugged. Sheesh. How are you, gorgeous?\u201d</p><p>Tara couldn\u2019t help but grin. He was incorrigible. \u201cA little stunned to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way I was going to miss out on this action. Got anything yet?\u201d</p><p>She and Logan exchanged a glance, then he gestured to her. It touched her that the big, bad Dom was willing to step aside and let her lead. Yes, it was her case, but Logan could have made her bow to his greater experience, if he\u2019d wanted to push it.</p><p>\u201cNot much. It\u2019s all hunches so far.\u201d Choosing her words carefully, she told him about her episode with the dungeon master and the manager just before orientation. \u201cBut other than Jordan being stalkerish and Kantor taking stock of me like a product, I\u2019ve got nothing.\u201d</p><p>Xander nodded. \u201cI still have friends here, some of the resident Doms, wait and security staff, bartenders. Kantor took over for my old boss, Ms. Newmann, after she was abruptly fired. The rumor mill said the reclusive owner caught her skimming money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone know this reclusive owner\u2019s name?\u201d Tara asked without a lot of hope. If the FBI hadn\u2019t been able to figure it out, chances were Xander didn\u2019t know squat.</p><p>\u201cNot me. If Newmann knew, she didn\u2019t share. Anyway, about six months ago this mystery owner brought Kantor on board. No one likes him. I mean, no one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months ago,\u201d Tara said. \u201cAbout the time girls started disappearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that\u2019s a coincidence,\u201d Logan drawled.</p><p>\u201cWhich means we should assume that, whatever is going on, he\u2019s in on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty safe assumption, I think. I met the guy earlier this afternoon. I didn\u2019t like him, and vice versa. But I knew that, being short a Dom, he was in a bind. Being beholden to me clearly pissed him off. I think he\u2019s definitely worth looking into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Bocelli have any information on him?\u201d Logan asked her. \u201cDid he brief you about him at any point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, early on, we got a file on most of the management. Kantor\u2019s is sketchy and says nothing out of the ordinary. He came from an upper-middle-class family in New Jersey, went to Princeton. By all accounts, he\u2019s a smart guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all the personality of a bleeding hemorrhoid.\u201d Xander grimaced.</p><p>Tara couldn\u2019t not laugh. \u201cThe rest of his background is nondescript. He\u2019s been working at hotels his whole life. Married young. Divorced after three years. No kids. No girlfriends, no glaring debts, no ties to any sort of criminal activity. On the surface, he looks perfect.\u201d</p><p>Logan shook his head. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to prove why Kantor is neck deep in this shit, just that he is.\u201d</p><p>True, but... \u201cTo do that, we\u2019ve got to get closer to him.\u201d</p><p>That realization creeped her out.</p><p>\u201cI think you should try the easy way first,\u201d Xander suggested.</p><p>Tara raised a brow at him. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>He fished in his pocket for a ring of keys, rifled through them, then pulled one off and handed it to Tara. \u201cThe key to the desk in the manager\u2019s office. It should still work. All the other keys I\u2019ve tried today have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kept these from the last time you worked here?\u201d Logan asked, arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>Xander grinned. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that Ms. Newmann liked me, and I made sure she was a bit . . . distracted as she made her way through the employee exit process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d Tara couldn\u2019t understand it. \u201cWhy keep keys to a resort you\u2019re no longer working for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI come and go from this place a lot. I like to keep my options open.\u201d</p><p>Really? Tara frowned. At first, she\u2019d been willing to take Xander on good faith because Logan had vouched for him. Now? It seemed a little odd that he would upend his life in Dallas to follow them back to his old job simply to \u201chelp out.\u201d Who did that?</p><p>Still, she closed the key in her fist. \u201cAll right. We\u2019ll investigate Kantor\u2019s office, see what we can find. How do we get down some of the restricted hallways? I know they require a key card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll swipe one from a maid and have someone give it to you during lunch. Kantor will do another orientation tomorrow at the same time. That\u2019s a good time to prowl through his office. I\u2019ll make sure the maid is too busy to miss her access card before then and create a little diversion on the other side of the resort as the little meet-andgreet is ending, just to make sure you get enough time. Newmann wasn\u2019t big on computers, and kept everything of interest in the safe in the floor under the Persian rug by the window. In case Kantor hasn\u2019t changed the combination, here it is.\u201d He handed Tara a scrap of paper. \u201cKeep me posted.\u201d</p><p>She stared at Xander, trying to decide if he was really just a bored rich boy in search of adventure or if he was the wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. Unfortunately, she\u2019d have to play along to find out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>As if he\u2019d guessed her thoughts, Xander nodded coolly. \u201cNo sweat. But before I leave, just ask yourself if I seemed like a dishonest slime at any time Logan let me touch you.\u201d</p><p>No, he hadn\u2019t. Pushed the boundaries, yes. Done whatever he could to yank Logan\u2019s chain, absolutely. But he\u2019d never crossed the line. Still, if he were involved in this terrible human-auction scheme, he would have been nice to her from the get-go.</p><p>Tara made a mental note to ask Logan a few more questions about his buddy. Because Xander being involved in this sex ring would certainly explain why their room had been bugged and why he\u2019d unexpectedly come to Florida to cozy up to them. On the other hand, why would a billionaire\u2019s heir need money?</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Logan looked between the two of them with a frown. \u201cWhat do you know about Jordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides the fact he\u2019s a serious sadist, not much. That dude gives Doms a bad name.\u201d</p><p>That had been her impression of Jordan. Just ick.</p><p>\u201cI hear he hasn\u2019t been here long, maybe six weeks. What\u2019s odd is that he came from nowhere and didn\u2019t have to do any time as a dungeon monitor. Kantor just moved him ahead of all the resident Doms and made him the dungeon master. He told some others that he was from Phoenix, but I\u2019ve got friends who live there. I called around. No one\u2019s heard of the guy.\u201d</p> <p>Since BDSM could be a small community, if Xander was telling the truth, it was definitely fishy. \u201cI\u2019ll contact Bocelli and ask if he can look into our friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thought,\u201d Logan said, then addressed Xander. \u201cOur top initiative is to rescue Tara\u2019s friend Darcy. Hear anything about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I\u2019ll keep my ear to the ground.\u201d</p><p>Fantasy Key\u2014Monday afternoon</p><p>Tara\u2019s waiter delivered her plate of tropical fruit salad and iced tea. \u201cWill there be anything else?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour entrees should be ready shortly. Until then, Master Xander asked me to deliver something to you, which you\u2019ll find under your plate. His instructions were take it discreetly at the end of the meal, not before.\u201d</p><p>The access card. She gazed across the table at Logan, who merely nodded at the waiter. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The tuxedoed man nodded, then turned on his heel. Tara ached to look under her plate for that little plastic card, but refrained. Too many eyes here could see too much. She\u2019d wait until people left.</p><p>\u201cI told you he\u2019d come through,\u201d Logan pointed out.</p><p>Xander had indeed done exactly as he\u2019d said he would, but she still didn\u2019t quite understand his motivation. He hadn\u2019t seemed close enough to Logan that he would risk his life, but that was exactly what he was doing. Tara hoped like hell that Logan himself wasn\u2019t being duped by his pal.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to betray us, Cherry. Believe me.\u201d</p><p>Like every day since her teenage heartbreak, she found trust difficult. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot at stake here. You\u2019re asking me to rest the outcome of my mission on your instinct that he\u2019s honest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf the shoe was on the other foot and you asked me to trust someone I didn\u2019t know, I would. No questions asked.\u201d</p><p>Tara winced and forked in a bite of pineapple to stall her reply. She\u2019d like to call bullshit, but he meant that. Nor was it fair to hold their past against him since he\u2019d left her to protect her. But when he\u2019d cast her aside, it had frozen something deep in her core. She hadn\u2019t allowed anyone to breathe warmth and life into her again.</p><p>Logan was on the verge of melting those walls around her heart. And it scared the hell out of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try. It\u2019s just not easy for me.\u201d</p><p>Logan put down his fork and leveled a direct stare at her across the table. \u201cWhen are you going to trust me again?\u201d</p><p>It was a fair question\u2014and a painful one. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you don\u2019t want to talk about our future. You don\u2019t trust my sincerity.\u201d</p><p>He was right; she couldn\u2019t picture him sleeping beside her every night, much less slipping a ring on her finger. It had been a fantasy for years, that he\u2019d come back still in love with her and want her for the rest of their lives, have some perfectly plausible explanation for ripping out her heart and forever killing her adolescent ability to love with her whole being. But now that he\u2019d returned with a noble rationale for their breakup, claiming she was still the only woman in his heart? Tara ached to believe it. She just didn\u2019t know how to after twelve long years.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t quit trying. If he really did mean it, she needed to find a way to embrace him before her doubt ran him off again.</p><p>\u201cGive me a little more time, when we\u2019re not in the middle of... all this.\u201d She pushed her fruit around on her plate.</p><p>Logan hesitated. \u201cI know you\u2019ve endured a lot these past few days. I also know that I put you through hell in the past. But that was then. In my youth I allowed something to come between us that I\u2019d never allow today. Just keep trying to trust me with more than your body, Cherry. I swear I will never give you any reason to regret it.\u201d</p><p>Hearing that sincerity from such a dominant, ferocious man undid something inside her. Deep inside, she knew he was right, and that if she didn\u2019t want to be alone again, she was going to have to figure out how to close the door on their past and move forward.</p><p>Their waiter returned and smoothly replaced the fruit plate with her chicken before she could even see the access card on the table. Then he left Logan\u2019s fish in front of him.</p><p>\u201cHow does everything look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Logan said impatiently, clearly wishing the waiter would leave so they could finish their conversation.</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d The waiter reached on the cart behind him and produced a silver jug of iced tea. \u201cAccording to Xander, you\u2019ll need to leave in ten minutes. He left service-crew uniforms in your cabin. You\u2019ll have approximately five minutes to find Kantor\u2019s office on the top floor, then another five inside. Ten at most. Trash the uniforms when you\u2019ve finished. He\u2019ll be back for the card later this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you helping us?\u201d Tara couldn\u2019t help but ask. She still wasn\u2019t exactly sure it was smart to put her faith in Xander, despite Logan vouching for him. Trusting their darkly handsome waiter, whose name tag read CHAZ, wasn\u2019t any easier.</p><p>He produced a pepper mill with a bland smile. But his eyes were alive with hatred. \u201cLaken Fox had just become mine, and she returned here to be with me. Kantor was the last person known to see her alive, and his excuses are bullshit. I want that son of a bitch nailed to the wall.\u201d</p><p>Good answer.</p><p>As another waiter sidled by and stared, he removed all expression from his face. \u201cHave a good afternoon.\u201d</p><p>With that, he was gone. Tara immediately went into mission mode. \u201cEat what you can quickly.\u201d</p><p>They both shoved down a few bites of protein and vegetables. As the other guests filed out of the dining room, she lifted her plate aside with one hand and swiped her napkin beneath with her other. The little plastic card fell in her lap.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>AT exactly two o\u2019clock, Logan and Tara, dressed as maintenance workers in the outfits Xander provided, let themselves into the secure hallway on the top floor. He pulled his cap low over his face and pushed an empty trash can, just in case they were on surveillance. Cherry did the same, ensuring her hair was tucked beneath, as she shoved the vacuum over the garish, resort-style carpet.</p><p>The access card clicked, and they moved into Kantor\u2019s office. Logan looked around for surveillance equipment and didn\u2019t see anything obvious. Still, they had to be cautious.</p><p>Per the plan they\u2019d developed as they worked into the gray zipup maintenance jumpers, he moved immediately to the safe beneath the ornate rug of red and gold near the window. It opened up with the combination Xander provided.</p><p>Logan pushed aside a stack of cash and stared at the thick section of DVDs tucked inside. He flipped through them quickly. None had any sort of writing or markings, so he\u2019d have to put them back for now. He couldn\u2019t afford to take them and have them be missed.</p><p>Next, he found a set of accounting ledgers, which meant these were likely the real books, and Tara would probably find the doctored set in Kantor\u2019s desk. A quick skim proved this place brought in a more-than-decent take. But it was the pages devoted to \u201cproduct sales\u201d that caught his attention. Here, they recorded a staggering fucking fortune in the millions. There was no way their little shop of BDSM gear and other assorted perversions downstairs was bringing in that sort of money. The \u201cproducts\u201d they sold had to be human, but each of the ledger entries was marked with nothing more than a number. The first sale took place approximately six months ago. The latest was pending for Thursday.</p><p>Extracting a little camera, he took pictures of multiple pages, zeroing in on the most suspicious, then shoved the books back into the safe.</p><p>He checked his watch. \u201cFour minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready,\u201d Tara said.</p><p>Damn, he was proud of her. Despite this being her first mission, she was performing well under pressure. They could very well be risking their lives, and she didn\u2019t trust Xander, but she wasn\u2019t letting the stress get to her.</p><p>Logan poked his head into the safe again but found nothing more of interest. Locking up, he replaced the carpet on the hardwood floors, then went to Cherry\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cGot anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt took me a minute to hack into his computer, but I\u2019m in now and downloading everything onto a flash drive. I imagine it\u2019s all encrypted and password protected so that will take a while. Here.\u201d She shoved the desk key into his hand. \u201cLook around.\u201d</p><p>Without a word, Logan opened up the desk, poked around in drawers and files, not sure what he was looking for. In the back of the lateral filing cabinet, he found something long and rolled up. Logan spread them out across the desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the blueprints of this place. Shit, there\u2019s a dungeon under the resort, and not the kind we play in.\u201d</p><p>Tara pulled her gaze from the screen, her brown eyes saucer-wide. \u201cThey could be holding Darcy there. We need to get inside ASAP.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could be easier said than done. Let\u2019s talk to Xander, see what he knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my mission, not his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t he gotten us this far?\u201d</p><p>A little beep sounded and she pulled the flash drive out of the USB slot, her mouth pursed in anger. \u201cWe\u2019re not out of this office safely yet. For all we know, we\u2019ve walked into a trap.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, they heard footsteps in the hall. She bit her lip, then mouthed Kantor?</p><p>He shrugged, then motioned her under the desk. Tara put the computer to sleep, then shoved the vacuum into the corner, next to the trash can. They ducked down just as someone entered the room.</p><p>\u201cWho left this fucking trash can and vacuum? Lazy bastards . . .\u201d</p><p>A cell phone rang.</p><p>\u201cKantor,\u201d the voice barked, then paused. \u201cYou\u2019re sure he\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s brain raced and his instincts went on alert.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. I\u2019ll be down to the Pit to help you dispose of his body. And next time? I need better background checks on all incoming employees.\u201d</p><p>Tara pressed a hand over her mouth, clearly coming to the same conclusion Logan was. Had they somehow found out Xander helped them and killed him for it?</p><p>Just then, the office door opened again, and a woman stuck her head inside. \u201cSir, there\u2019s a kitchen fire. It\u2019s spreading quickly. We\u2019ve called the fire department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Kantor snarled. \u201cI\u2019ll call you back.\u201d</p><p>With that, he slammed out the door.</p><p>TWENTY minutes later, Tara and Logan were safely back in their room. Logan tried to call Xander twice as he checked the new remote Xander had arranged. But his phone went to voicemail both times. Panic started eating at Logan\u2019s gut. Other than his brother, Hunter, Xander was the best friend he had. He couldn\u2019t be dead, god damn it.</p><p>Cherry emerged from the bathroom, taking the elastic band out of her hair. She looked at him with concern in those sweet chocolate eyes, then made her way to him, kneeling in front of him, taking his hands in hers.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re worried.\u201d</p><p>Logan stared at the remote control.</p><p>\u201cWe can talk freely. I just checked the rest of the room.\u201d</p><p>He nodded miserably. \u201cHow can I not be concerned? I feel responsible. We had so little to go on with this case, and Xander seemed able to give us exactly the help we needed. But he isn\u2019t trained for this shit, and I should have remembered that.\u201d</p><p>Tara kissed his cheek and squeezed his fingers. \u201cYou know, this is one of the things I always loved about you, your ability to care. You were never too macho to be worried or help someone. Please don\u2019t let your worry eat at you. For all you know, he\u2019s laying low or found something else for us to check.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou believe he\u2019s on our side now?\u201d Logan wanted her to trust him so badly, the ache was a hollow craving deep inside him. He swallowed, fingering the delicate heart-shaped choker at her throat. Unlike the heart in her chest, this one he could touch easily, hold in the palm of his hand, protect and adore. She\u2019d give him this one, if he asked. He wished like hell that she\u2019d gift him with the one that mattered most.</p><p>\u201cObviously if they\u2019ve hurt him, he\u2019s not on their side, but we don\u2019t know that anything like that has happened.\u201d She sent him a compassionate smile that only made his chest tighten more. \u201cYou believe Xander tried to help us, and for your sake, I want you to be right.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. Her words hurt, but even though she couldn\u2019t quite trust, the fact that she was willing to comfort him meant so much.</p><p>No way was he letting this woman slip through his fingers again. When they left here\u2014if they left alive\u2014he\u2019d move heaven and earth to unmask the motherfucker threatening her and silence him forever.</p> <p>\u201cYou going to be okay?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>Compartmentalize. It was something he did well on missions. Having Cherry here was messing with his head some. He needed to focus on getting the job done.</p><p>\u201cFine. We\u2019ll see Chaz in a few hours. Maybe he knows what\u2019s happened to Xander.\u201d</p><p>Tara held up the access card they\u2019d used to sneak into Kantor\u2019s office. \u201cOr maybe he\u2019ll come by himself for this. In the meantime, I need to ship all the data we collected to Bocelli and let the analysts plow through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, if we tried ourselves, it would take days.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat we don\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t have days left with her, either. Two at most. Forty-eight hours was not a lot of time to mend broken trust and allay all her fears. If he had weeks or months\u2014years, even\u2014to prove his constancy and devotion, he\u2019d use them. But he had two fucking days before she might be out of his life again forever. Dominion had been his lifeline for years, but losing his membership and status there was nothing compared to losing Cherry. As a teenager, he\u2019d dealt with the loss of his mother. As a man, he wanted that tight family unit again. He wanted to create one with Tara. By not taking her birth control pill, it told him that at least some part of her subconsciously wanted that, too. What would it take for her to give him a chance?</p><p>She turned away to prepare for the data upload. Logan handed her his digital camera so she could upload those images, wishing he had the answer to his question.</p><p>With a sigh, he sat back on their bed and pulled out the photo he kept in his wallet of his family. This had been their last Christmas together. Hunter hadn\u2019t had his driver\u2019s license for long and had nearly killed everyone in the car on the way to the photographer\u2019s. At six, Kimber had been the only one whose life hadn\u2019t flashed before their eyes. They\u2019d all been fighting like dogs when they walked in\u2014then his mother had burst out laughing. Everyone else had joined in for one of those priceless moments of family harmony captured as the photographer had snapped the picture.</p><p>A few months later, his mother had sought a divorce. She\u2019d been murdered a year after that. His father had spent a decade and a half as an angry recluse. Hunter had been so bitter that Mom had left\u2014and Dad had let her. He really hadn\u2019t spoken much to either of them until Amanda Edgington had been cruelly murdered. By then, it had been too late.</p><p>Logan had never understood his brother\u2019s behavior. Whether she\u2019d remained married to his father, Amanda had always been and would always be his mother. He still missed her. She\u2019d had a soft spot for him, and he\u2019d milked it as a kid. Times like now, he also missed her sage council. He wished she could have spent more time with Tara, given him some insight to the female mind. In fact, the day he\u2019d found Amanda\u2019s body, Logan had gone to see his mother to tell her that he was in love.</p> <p>Everything in his life came back to the fateful day that had changed everything.</p><p>Logan rubbed his thumb over his mother\u2019s image. He hated the thought that, if he managed to convince Tara to trust him again with her heart, his mother wouldn\u2019t be there to see him get married, have children, grow middle-aged with the woman he loved. Another fucking hole in his heart.</p><p>As he stared at the photo, a bit of gold caught his attention. He pulled it closer to his face, staring hard. He wondered if his eyes were deceiving him.</p><p>They weren\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Tara said as she rose from the laptop, fingers clutching the heart pendant. \u201cData is uploading. It\u2019s going to take a while.\u201d</p><p>Now he knew why that little charm was so fucking familiar.</p><p>On wooden legs, his heart pounding, he rose and crossed the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Concern spread across her face.</p> <p>He swallowed, trying to moisten a suddenly dry mouth. When he got close enough, he nudged her hand aside, cradled her heart pendant in his fingers, and turned it over. Exactly where he expected to see it, Logan spotted a familiar little dent in the gold.</p><p>\u201cYou keep looking at that. Are you worried that Brad or some boyfriend gave it to me? It isn\u2019t like that. I\u2019ve had it for years. My stepfather gave it to me\u2014well, I found it, and he said that he\u2019d intended to give it to me\u2014to serve as a reminder to be careful with my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d he barked the question at her.</p><p>\u201cSh-Shortly before we broke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow shortly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night before.\u201d</p><p>Logan could barely control his rage. All this time, he hadn\u2019t understood . . . He still didn\u2019t know why\u2014but he\u2019d find out. At least he now he knew who. But one thing he knew as well as his own name: Tara could only be wearing his mother\u2019s necklace if Adam had ripped it off of Amanda\u2019s broken neck while killing her.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>THE enormity of his realization made Logan stumble back to the bed. Almost blindly, he sat, thoughts whizzing through his head. Maybe there was another explanation. Maybe the killer had taken it off his mother\u2019s neck not as a trophy, but for its monetary value. Maybe he\u2019d pawned it. And maybe Adam had simply purchased it.</p><p>Maybe. But that was a pretty big coincidence.</p><p>His mother\u2019s murder had been a crime of passion, not greed. That necklace wasn\u2019t worth more than a few hundred dollars and had been the only item missing from Amanda\u2019s apartment. The killer had left her old wedding rings, worth thousands more. The police\u2014along with his father\u2014had watched the local pawn shops for the pendant, but it had never appeared. Besides, upscale Adam had always loved his little princess. Why would he buy her a token at a pawn shop?</p><p>Of course, Adam Sterling hadn\u2019t actually given it to Tara; she\u2019d found it. And he\u2019d let her wear it. Had she stumbled onto Adam\u2019s trophy from the kill, then he made up a story about buying the necklace to remind her to guard her heart so Tara wouldn\u2019t get suspicious?</p><p>If that was the case, if Adam was the real killer, that also meant he\u2019d threatened to kill his own stepdaughter\u2014more than once.</p><p>But why? True, Adam had never liked him, had bullied him about leaving Tara alone almost from the beginning. He\u2019d ignored her stepfather. If Cherry hadn\u2019t wanted him, he would have respected her wishes, but he\u2019d refused to let Adam make that choice for her. Suspecting it would finally have an impact on Logan, had the asshole threatened Tara instead? Had he been afraid that Logan would see the necklace around Tara\u2019s neck and guess the truth? Why not just make up some other excuse so that Tara didn\u2019t wear it? It probably gave the egotistical bastard a sick thrill to know that his princess wore the key to solving the murder around her throat, and because he\u2019d split them up so effectively, Logan would never know. Fucking bastard!</p><p>Then came the biggest question: What motive would Adam have for killing his mother in the first place? She\u2019d been a good teacher, involved with her students\u2019 lives to the point that she\u2019d led a weekslong effort to find one of her runaway students.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Cherry darted to his side, wrapping an arm around his shoulder.</p><p>Logan looked into her worried face. What the hell was he going to tell her? She didn\u2019t trust him about Xander, so how could he possibly tell her that he suspected her own stepfather, the only stable parent she\u2019d really known, might be a killer?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t\u2014at least not now. Not only could he not prove anything, now wasn\u2019t the time to mess with Tara\u2019s head. They were here to find Darcy, stop the sex ring, see if they could nail the elusive owner of this house of kink gone wrong. He needed to strengthen his bond with Tara now, both to solidify their partnership on this mission and to build a foundation for their future. Accusing her stepfather of being a cold-blooded killer without adequate proof wasn\u2019t going to help his cause.</p><p>Scrubbing a hand over his face, he sighed and grasped for the first excuse he could think of. \u201cJust worried about Xander.\u201d</p><p>Tara frowned. \u201cThen why the twenty questions about my necklace?\u201d</p><p>She never had let much slip past her, but he wished she would now.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Bunny trail. Guess I worried that Brad had given it to you, and that you were wearing it because you still had feelings for him,\u201d Logan mumbled. \u201cI need to get my head on straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love Brad.\u201d</p><p>Inside, he rejoiced . . . until he realized that didn\u2019t necessarily mean that she was willing to admit that she loved him. And even if she did, now there was a whole new obstacle in front of them. Fuck. No way was he leaving Cherry alone with Adam again, but he also had no way of keeping them apart without telling her about his suspicions. Since he couldn\u2019t prove it and she didn\u2019t trust him, where would that leave him?</p><p>\u201cKnowing that makes me really happy, baby.\u201d He kissed her softly, hoping like hell it wasn\u2019t the last time. \u201cStay here. I\u2019m going to see if I can find Xander. Use the sat phone to check in with Bocelli.\u201d</p><p>Tara grabbed his hand. \u201cYou seem really upset. Please be careful.\u201d</p><p>Everything on her sweet face said that she cared\u2014deeply. He\u2019d never loved another woman in his life and knew that he never would. What the hell was he going to do if his suspicions were right?</p><p>\u201cYou be careful, too. Don\u2019t go anywhere. Don\u2019t open the door for anyone.\u201d</p><p>With her nod, Logan slipped out. At some point, he had to get a call out to his dad, tell him what he\u2019d discovered, see if someone on the Tyler P.D. would reopen his mom\u2019s cold case, get the latest threatening note he\u2019d received at Dominion into their hands. He needed to ask the Colonel if he could think of any reason that Adam would want Mom dead. And he needed to figure out when and how the hell he was going to approach Tara about this\u2014while keeping her safe.</p><p>Because, above all, that was his first priority.</p><p>TEN minutes after Logan\u2019s departure, a knock sounded at their door. Tara jumped, fearing that Jordan had been waiting for an opportunity to get her alone. He\u2019d been eerily absent since last night. Or</p><p>worse, that Kantor had somehow discovered that they\u2019d broken into his office and had come for retribution.</p><p>Taking a taper out of the decorative candlestick on the nightstand and cursing the fact that she\u2019d been unable to smuggle a weapon onto the island, she gripped the candlestick behind her back as she opened the door. But it wasn\u2019t Jordan or Kantor standing on the other side.</p><p>\u201cXander? You\u2019re okay.\u201d He looked mussed and slightly heavylidded but unharmed.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d He sauntered in.</p><p>\u201cWe overheard Kantor say they\u2019d killed a man and to screen the employees more carefully. When we got back and Logan couldn\u2019t find you, he freaked out.\u201d</p><p>The bad-boy Dom repressed a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s actually kind of sweet, but I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Clearly. But if Xander hadn\u2019t been their victim, who had?</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you answer your phone when Logan called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to occupy Marciela so she wouldn\u2019t notice that her access card was absent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOccupy?\u201d</p><p>A very wicked grin crossed Xander\u2019s face. \u201cDo you have it?</p><p>Dear God, he\u2019d slept with one of the maids to swipe her access card? Wincing at the thought, Tara set down the candlestick and fished the card out of her back pocket before handing it to him.</p><p>\u201cWere you going to hit me?\u201d He didn\u2019t look intimidated in the least.</p><p>\u201cIf I had to. All of today\u2019s shit has made me a little jumpy. Kantor almost found us in his office. If it hadn\u2019t been for that kitchen fire that sent him running . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to pay Alfredo his hundred bucks. Sounds like he performed on schedule.\u201d</p><p>That implication flattened Tara. \u201cYou paid someone to start that fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew Kantor was going to need a well-timed distraction.\u201d</p><p>Tara stared at Logan\u2019s friend. He\u2019d made the entire search not only possible, but run smoothly. They weren\u2019t out of danger yet, and until Bocelli\u2019s analysts had sifted through the data, they wouldn\u2019t know if their break-in had accomplished anything. But without Xander, they certainly wouldn\u2019t have had that opportunity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re done being suspicious?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt just\u2014Your reasons for helping didn\u2019t seem . . . obvious. It\u2019s not your problem or your fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a reason to not want women to be sold as sex slaves to monsters likely to abuse or kill them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hate to sound cynical, but most people would give a great big \u2018awww\u2019 and say that the girls would be in their prayers or tell us to nail the bastards responsible. They wouldn\u2019t go out of their way to help, much less uproot their whole lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can afford to do more. I don\u2019t have a job or the need for a paycheck holding me back.\u201d He wandered over to the plush easy chair in the corner. \u201cI don\u2019t have anyone who loves me worrying. Getting involved was easy and had minimal impact on my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re caught and they kill you.\u201d</p><p>Xander raised a dark brow. \u201cKantor\u2019s not stupid. He knows I come from a very wealthy family and that there would be a lot of questions if I disappeared or died here. He won\u2019t want that wrath raining down on his head. Now, will he make my life uncomfortable in the hopes that I go away? Sure. And I\u2019ll let him when you don\u2019t need my help anymore.\u201d</p><p>Wow, Xander had it all figured out. Tara had to give him credit. He seemed to be on the up and up. Perhaps she should have trusted Logan\u2019s instincts . . .</p> <p>\u201cI guess I was wrong. Sorry if I offended you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time someone has mistaken my motives.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut Logan is a really good friend\u2014one of the few I trust\u2014and you\u2019re the woman he loves. He\u2019d do anything for you, so I\u2019m going to do the same.\u201d</p><p>When he put it like that, Tara felt almost ashamed about how suspicious she\u2019d been. Ditto for how much difficulty she\u2019d given Logan since he\u2019d become her trainer for this mission.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s up with us, but I should probably thank Logan for all he\u2019s done to help me through this mission and educate me so I could stay safe. And as much as I was pissed off at the time, I should probably also thank Mr. Thorpe.\u201d</p><p>Xander frowned. \u201cMitchell can be a real asshole. Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking he\u2019s a nice guy. The FBI paid him to get you trained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but when I screamed my safe word, he must have known that I was more angry at Logan than genuinely afraid. Even though I all but begged him to give me another instructor, he didn\u2019t deviate. I wouldn\u2019t have done as well with anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>Looking distinctly uncomfortable, Xander leaned forward. \u201cThorpe didn\u2019t do that for you, sweetheart. He did it because Logan made him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? I can\u2019t picture Thorpe bowing to pressure from anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoms can be victims of their own rules sometimes. When you screamed your safe word, well . . . a rule is a rule, and he was going to reassign you until Logan came in and threw one of the club\u2019s own rules in his face, the prior claim clause. Mitchell didn\u2019t have a choice but to give in. He gave Logan seven days to either collar or marry you, or he\u2019d have to give up his membership.\u201d</p><p>Xander\u2019s words hit her like a blow to the chest. After the initial impact, a dozen thoughts crashed through her head: He\u2019d made a secret deal to stay with her. Because he truly wanted her? But why not just tell her about his \u201cprior claim\u201d? Why be underhanded?</p><p>They weren\u2019t sixteen anymore, and she desperately wanted to believe that Logan had entered into this agreement with Thorpe because he wanted to keep her safe, at the least. The fact that he\u2019d left her in high school to protect her proved that he cared about her well-being. But was it more than that? Had Logan put himself in the position to be her trainer, come hell or high water, because he\u2019d known that he could teach her what she needed to know? Or had Logan used the week Thorpe had given him as a way to keep her with him because he wanted to win her back? She didn\u2019t want to think he\u2019d kept the truth from her just to hurt her, not after all his tenderness and his avowals of love.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t said a word about any such bargain. He hadn\u2019t let on for a second of their time together that he had more on the line than his heart and their future.</p><p>\u201cShit, I shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201d Xander winced. \u201cForget I mentioned it. Damn it, you look pissed.\u201d</p><p>Yes, very much. He\u2019d plotted to change the course of her mission\u2014and maybe even her whole future\u2014without consulting her. Did he think that she was a pawn in some fucking game?</p> <p>But underneath, Tara was somewhat touched that he\u2019d risked his membership at a club that was vitally important to his psyche to either keep her safe or win her heart.</p><p>Xander stood. \u201cI think I\u2019ll leave now before he returns and realizes that I\u2019ve screwed the pooch. Go easy on him, huh? Bye!\u201d</p><p>Tara barely got her mouth open before Xander was out the door. She tried to talk herself out of this weird sense of both tenderness and betrayal. Did he really have anything but her best interests at heart? Probably not. But damn it, if she was as important to him as he swore, then why didn\u2019t the bastard just talk to her? Why did he continue making decisions without her input?</p><p>She might have let him top her in the bedroom, but there was no way she\u2019d let him top her in life. And as soon as he returned, she was going to make that absolutely crystal clear to him.</p><p>LOGAN dashed back to the suite he shared with Cherry, anxious to return. Since he\u2019d run into Xander and seen for himself that his buddy was in one piece, he prayed the same was true of her. Xander had said she was fine, but until Logan saw her, held her, he\u2019d worry.</p><p>Stuffing the key in the slot, he shoved the door open and found Tara pacing. Relief poured through him. Worrying about Xander had made him edgy, as had breaking into Kantor\u2019s office. Hell, the fact that Jordan hadn\u2019t pursued Tara all day even made him edgy. The slimeball had slobbered on himself, drooling all over Tara when they\u2019d arrived at the resort. Logan had been certain that he\u2019d soon issue them an invitation to the VIP room as a means of testing her out. But they hadn\u2019t seen or heard from Jordan since he\u2019d hurried away from their safety scene last night, and that was feeling mighty odd\u2014along with their formerly bugged remote. Xander had asked the maintenance guys to stash it in another guest room. Logan had to hope that no one noticed they were hearing someone else\u2019s conversations.</p><p>Something was definitely fishy. If the management here at Fantasy Key knew that Tara was FBI, it was in their best interest to lay low, not do anything to raise red flags and invite further investigation. But being stonewalled frustrated the hell out of Logan. Time was running out to rescue Darcy and capture these predators.</p><p>\u201cI found Xander,\u201d Logan said into the odd silence. \u201cHe\u2019s alive, though at the moment, I\u2019d like to kill him myself.\u201d</p><p>She nodded coolly. \u201cHe stopped by and picked up the access key.\u201d</p><p>Tara\u2019s mouth was a thin, angry line. She leveled a dark, brittle stare at him.</p><p>Logan frowned as he closed the distance to take her in his arms. She backed away. All his warning flares shot up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Cherry?\u201d</p><p>Fiery hair clinging to her shoulders, she paced, not bothering to hide her agitation. \u201cForget it. We don\u2019t need drama right now. I\u2019m working, and we\u2019re supposed to be saving Darcy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but if something is bothering you, I want to know about it. We\u2019ll communicate better if you do. Tell me.\u201d He reached for her hand.</p><p>Tara jerked away. \u201cBocelli said he\u2019d get back to us on the data. He\u2019ll have to do some digging on Jordan. Still no progress on the identity of the resort owner. That\u2019s not surprising. The FBI has been trying to untangle the legal paperwork to figure out who really owns this place, but it\u2019s like a labyrinth. Do you think he\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>All relevant stuff, and if she were anyone else, Logan would leap on the change of subject. But since he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her, if something was upsetting her, he wanted to get to the bottom of the issue and fix it.</p><p>\u201cIf he is and he\u2019s smart, he\u2019s posing as a guest or other employee. Otherwise, it\u2019s too incriminating. So our best shot at learning his identity is the information we pulled off Kantor\u2019s computer and the analysts back in Washington, D.C., wading through all the dummy corporations and DBAs until we find this guy. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s bugging you. Spit it out.\u201d</p><p>She paced, fists clenched. \u201cI don\u2019t think waiting is the answer. It\u2019s taking too long. Darcy\u2019s time is running short. I need to talk to Adam.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s blood ran cold. \u201cYour stepfather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She scowled, as if that was obvious. \u201cHe\u2019s former FBI, and I told him a bit about this case before we left so that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d He charged toward her. \u201cDoes he know that you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>Tara lifted her chin, daring his anger. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then admitted reluctantly, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Fuck! He\u2019d assumed in bringing Cherry to Fantasy Key that his mother\u2019s killer couldn\u2019t touch her here. But Adam Sterling was now a wealthy man with former FBI connections. If anyone could do her in under this kind of security, it would be Adam.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not calling him.\u201d</p><p>She bristled. \u201cDespite what you think or want, you can\u2019t tell me what to do. If I want to talk to my stepfather, I will.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, staring at her with a silent vow to do anything to enforce his will. No way was she giving that dangerous bastard more access to her or any more information that might help him to harm her. But he didn\u2019t want to put more wedges between them now, before she wholly trusted him.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. Bocelli wouldn\u2019t want you to. Neither do I. Technically, Adam is no longer FBI.\u201d It was a good excuse, thank God.</p><p>\u201cYou never have been, yet here you are.\u201d She scowled at him, mouth gaping open with confusion. \u201cWhat is your issue? Adam can help us. I told him about the case because he has so much experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell me this earlier? Why the hell not?\u201d</p><p>A blaze of fury suddenly darkened her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare go there. If one of us is keeping secrets, it\u2019s you. Or were you going to tell me about your little bet with Thorpe?\u201d</p><p>Logan closed his eyes. Fucking Xander. Why would he tell Cherry about that? She was taking it the wrong way. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a bet; it was a last resort. You\u2019re not a game to me, but Thorpe was going to assign you to another Dom. Enacting that club rule was the only way I could prevent that.\u201d</p><p>Tara didn\u2019t look moved. Instead, she crossed her arms over her chest and raised a ginger brow. \u201cExcept talking to me. If you had, we might have been able to work it out. If so, I would have told Thorpe that I didn\u2019t want anyone else near me.\u201d</p><p>As many times as he\u2019d tried to tell her about the reasons for their breakup, she was going to pin this on him? \u201cBaby, I could have talked to you all day. There was no fucking way you were going to give me an inch at that point. I threatened your safe little world and that heart you\u2019ve been trying so damn hard to protect from me.\u201d</p><p>A flush crawled up her fair skin. \u201cLook, you left me at sixteen because someone had threatened me. I get that. But instead of talking to me about it, you made the decision to leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kept quiet for your safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but you didn\u2019t learn. You waltzed back into my life and bet Thorpe that you\u2019d collar or marry me in a week, again without talking to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollar and marry, just to be clear. And I explained my reason to you. Do you need me to repeat it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you explained after I caught you, not before you made the deal. Why, so you\u2019d have extra time to ensnare me. Why not just come clean when you dealt with Thorpe?\u201d</p><p>Logan felt his ire mounting. He wasn\u2019t perfect, but he\u2019d always had her best interests at heart. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever made any secret of the fact that I love you and want a future with you. What I said to Thorpe is irrelevant between us.\u201d</p><p>Tara looked like she was about to cry, but blinked back tears. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t ask if that\u2019s what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still clinging to your pain, like it\u2019s a life jacket, so that you don\u2019t let yourself love me back. Please, baby, don\u2019t do that. I know I hurt you. I\u2019ll apologize every damn day if I have to. But I want you to push past the fear and think about our future. Deep down, you trust me with your body and your safety, or I wouldn\u2019t be here now. I have to believe that your heart can\u2019t be far behind.\u201d</p><p>She paled. Bull\u2019s-eye! Now if she\u2019d just stop being stubborn, picking fights, and admit how she felt, they could move forward. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo when does your deal with Thorpe expire?\u201d</p><p>He clenched his jaw. Where the hell was she going with this? \u201cThursday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn less than three days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re prepared to miss strutting down Dominion\u2019s halls in your leather pants, because if you think for one damn minute that I\u2019m going to stand here like a brainless twit while you decide my whole life without ever once asking me what I want, you\u2019re out of your fucking mind.\u201d</p><p>So quickly that she had no time to scramble away, Logan grabbed Cherry\u2019s wrist and pulled as he backed onto the bed and threw her facedown across his lap. Without pause, he slapped one firm cheek of her ass, barely covered by one of those little sheer dresses. She gasped, and before the sound even died, he smacked the other cheek.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like you throwing out f-bombs. Do it again, and I\u2019ll spank you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCherry, Cherry, Cherry . . .\u201d He sighed with regret.</p> <p>Even so, he couldn\u2019t deny that this feisty side of her had him revved up. She wanted this spanking\u2014wanted him\u2014but her fear and her pride wouldn\u2019t let her admit it. She was angry, and maybe she had every right to be. Maybe he should have handled his invocation of the club rule differently, told her in advance of his plans, and given her the opportunity to resolve it without involving Thorpe. But she would have only freaked out. She\u2019d still been engaged to Brad at the time. She hadn\u2019t been ready to hear that he wanted a lifelong claim on her.</p><p>But he\u2019d concede that maybe he should have told her sometime between then and now.</p><p>Because he\u2019d said he would, Logan whacked Tara\u2019s ass twice more and held down her squirming form, trying desperately not to think about how badly he wanted inside her.</p><p>Damn. He\u2019d bet she was dying to call him twenty kinds of asshole and let loose on him, but the spanking had curbed the worst of her tongue. They both needed to be a bit more calm.</p><p>The moment he let her up, she jerked to her feet, rage spitting from her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t do that again. I\u2019m not one of your club bunnies, waiting around for your discipline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t discipline you?\u201d He stood slowly, walking toward her, crowding her personal space, almost proud when she stood her ground. \u201cI came back into your life because I\u2019m a Dom. Guess what? I\u2019m still a Dom. I\u2019m always going to be one. And I\u2019m going to bet that, even though you\u2019re spitting mad, your pretty little pussy is dripping wet.\u201d</p> <p>She gasped in an offended breath. \u201cThat\u2019s low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut true.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, she cocked her head, tightened her little fists, and glared at him through eyes narrowed with purpose. Uh-oh. What the hell was going through her head now?</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I\u2019m wet. I admit it. Just because you get me hot doesn\u2019t mean that you get to decide the rest of my life. I won\u2019t let you use my desire against me.\u201d</p><p>Is that what she thought? Hell, he adored Cherry because she was smart and compassionate, kind. She showed the world a roaring tiger willing to fight for injustice and those weaker, but underneath that front, she was vulnerable.</p><p>No matter what he did, he managed to push her buttons. She put protective walls between them. Yeah, he could stand here and argue with her. He might actually win the battle. But he was in this fight to win the war. If that meant that he needed to back off and let her have more control, he\u2019d do his best to stifle his need to dominate and give it to her. Because at the end of the day, he wanted her by his side because she wanted to be there. Not because he\u2019d coerced her.</p><p>\u201cThen help me. I keep fucking this up, and that\u2019s not my intention. If you think I\u2019m trying to use your desire against you to decide your life, then take control. I\u2019ll step back. If, after this mission, you tell me to go away, then fine. I\u2019ll go away and I won\u2019t come back.\u201d</p><p>Tara recoiled, her brown eyes wide and startled. Her mouth gaped open, but silence followed for a long moment until she finally said, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut not until I\u2019m convinced that you know the difference between me trying to lead you around by your pussy and me trying to bond your heart to mine, Cherry. When I\u2019m sure you know exactly how much love you\u2019d be giving up, I\u2019ll give you all the space you want.\u201d</p><p>With an angry jerk he hoped to hell communicated that he meant business, Logan tore off his shirt.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>WITH unblinking eyes, Tara watched Logan peel the tight black T-shirt from his body, revealing an incredible work of masculine art to her slowly. Her helpless gaze caressed the bulges of his shoulders, lingered on his meaty biceps, devoured the tight slabs of his pectorals, widened at the sight of his rippling abdomen above low-slung jeans. And the sight of that tattoo crawling up his ribs in Japanese transfixed her. Though it had to have hurt like a bitch, it was oddly beautiful on his bronzed skin.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter how many times she looked at Logan. Each and every time, she melted. Her heart stuttered. Her blood warmed, while her fingers itched to touch him all over. Now his gaze snared her attention. Stark and midnight blue, that stare he locked on her rooted Tara to the spot with its intensity and savagery. He was like a powder keg. Tara had a suspicion that she\u2019d already set him off and that his fuse was burning down toward the inevitable explosion.</p><p>He reached for the snap on his jeans and flicked it open. Tara\u2019s gaze darted down nervously as anticipation sliced through her. She shivered, swallowed.</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t hurt me,\u201d she stated with a lift of her chin.</p><p>\u201cEver,\u201d he vowed. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to go easy on you, Cherry.\u201d</p><p>That fact was stamped all over his demanding stare. She backed up a step.</p><p>His low laugh resonated through her, daring, challenging\u2014sexy as hell. \u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d</p><p>No. Behind her a step, two at most, Tara knew she\u2019d find her back against a wall. But in front of her was two hundred pounds plus of determined male willing to do whatever necessary to make her whimper, beg, and surrender.</p><p>The prickly part of her nature reared up. He wasn\u2019t going to pleasure her into giving up her anger. At least not yet, damn it. She had a point.</p><p>Because sometimes the best defense was an offense, Tara crossed her arms over her chest and put on her best glare. \u201cWhy are you trying to intimidate me?\u201d</p><p>Logan shook his head. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m just trying to get you to keep still so that we can . . . chat. Believe me, I\u2019d rather not play games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. You are. I\u2019m trying to tell you how I feel and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you. You\u2019re pissed because I don\u2019t tell you everything. Got it. So now I\u2019m trying to communicate.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure you\u2019re ready, I am.\u201d</p><p>As angry as she was, as much as she felt a tinge of worry that she\u2019d pissed off the big, bad Dom inside him, she couldn\u2019t very well tell him that she wanted to know everything, then refuse to hear him. \u201cI can handle it and I\u2019m listening. Shoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKneel.\u201d</p><p>She raised a cool brow but her heart stuttered. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you weren\u2019t playing games. Don\u2019t start now. You heard what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019re playing domination games with me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIf you extend me trust, baby, I\u2019ll puke up every dirty little secret I have.\u201d</p><p>And all she had to do to hear them was kneel. That went against her independent grain. On the other hand . . . she had an image of him, towering, ruthlessly male, demanding, cradling her head in his huge palm as he guided her lips to all the hard inches of his thick cock and told her to suck. God, why did that arouse her?</p><p>No, she\u2019d play it his way for now, but as soon as she got on her knees, she wanted answers.</p><p>He trapped her gaze in his as she slowly went to one knee, then the other, then sat back on her heels, her palms sweating, and held her breath, feeling like a concubine waiting at her master\u2019s feet for his pleasure. And that feeling didn\u2019t bother her in the least.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d He touched a finger to her cheek, then reached for his jeans again.</p><p>She jerked away. \u201cDon\u2019t patronize me. Stop this head game you\u2019re playing and talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just communicating. Watch . . .\u201d</p><p>The gentle hiss of his zipper lowering filled the quiet room. Tara\u2019s heart began to careen crazily, and she sucked in a breath to calm herself. But as he lowered the denim over his hips, revealing the fact that he\u2019d been commando underneath and that each and every inch of him was velvety hard and standing straight up for her, she couldn\u2019t stop her gasp.</p><p>\u201cI want you to get a good look at this . . . Cherry.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. Logan had called her that a thousand times, but this time was somehow different.</p><p>Before she could question him, he reached to her side and yanked the desk chair beside her, bringing it close. He watched her with a dark stare.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have on the inside of your left thigh?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cA\u2014a birthmark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit back, lift your skirt, and spread your legs so I can see.\u201d</p><p>Tara paused. Not because she didn\u2019t want to, but because she did. \u201cHow is this getting us any closer to whatever truth you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>Logan raised a brow. \u201cRemember trust?\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, she complied, rocking onto her backside, easing the sheer skirt up her thighs, and parting her legs. Logan zeroed in on her pussy, and instantly she felt her folds go wet. As he crouched between her legs, her sheath tightened, spasmed.</p><p>Slowly, he glided his finger up her thigh to her birthmark. \u201cI never forgot this little round reddish mark of yours. That day in my bedroom that I touched it, tongued it, I decided it reminded me of a little cherry. After I\u2019d broken things off, that sweet spot was burned onto my brain. It killed me that I couldn\u2019t touch yours, so . . . See what I got.\u201d</p><p>Logan stood and lifted his left foot onto the chair. At first, she couldn\u2019t look past all the inches of his swollen, hungry cock and the swing of his heavy testicles. Then he pressed his finger to the inside of his left thigh. In the same spot in which she had her own birthmark, he\u2019d had something tattooed into his skin. She knelt, leaning in to peer closer, then realized exactly what it was.</p><p>Shock pinging through her system, she bounced her gaze up to his. \u201cA cherry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it the day I turned eighteen. I still loved you. I was drunk and alone and miserable, and the only thing I wanted was to brand myself with you.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Dear. God.</p><p>Shock reverberated down her system, jarring open the floodgates she\u2019d been hiding her emotions behind. They poured out in a warm gush that inundated her chest.</p><p>All these years between them, lost. She\u2019d been trying to muddle her way though and had been doing a lousy job. She\u2019d thrown herself into school, then into a career, all the while wearing her anger at him like armor. She\u2019d dated some, never quite sure why no one ever suited her, why she always felt restless and uncomfortable when other men touched her.</p><p>Now she knew. She\u2019d been fooling herself for over a decade. Finally, the truth was crystal clear.</p><p>Tears sprang to her eyes as she touched one finger to the little shiny red cherry on his muscular thigh, transfixed by the slightly paler skin here, the dark dusting of hair around it. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m telling you now. These are the last of my secrets, and I want you to know them.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes met again, and she felt the solid warmth and never ending flow of his love reaching out to her heart, thawing that terrible numbness she\u2019d shoved on herself in the hopes that she\u2019d never hurt again. His blue stare lasered in on her, gently but firmly letting her know that he wouldn\u2019t accept her hiding from him anymore. That suited Tara. She didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>She braced one trembling hand on his thigh, then reached up to finger the tattoo running from his hips, up his ribs, ending under his arm. \u201cAnd this?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed, unblinking as he met her gaze. \u201cJapanese for \u2018Tara forever.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Her eyes slid closed. Xander had told her days ago to find these on his body and ask him what they meant. She\u2019d been distracted. And if she was honest, a little afraid. Now . . .</p><p>Tears spilled down her cheeks. She didn\u2019t have to ask why he\u2019d done it, nor could she claim that she didn\u2019t understand. He loved her. He\u2019d said it. He\u2019d come here to help and protect her, instead of spending his leave with family and friends. He\u2019d imprinted that fact on his body, creating his own temple where he could worship her. In his own way, he\u2019d been largely faithful to her, especially over the last five years. During that time, she\u2019d deceived herself into believing that she\u2019d moved on with life and that she was okay. Logan had remained steadfast to his pain, not trying to deny the festering hurt, but rather incorporating it into his life, honoring what they meant to one another. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he brushed the tears from her cheeks, his tender caress wrenched her heart.</p><p>She blinked up at him, touched down to her soul. \u201cI d-didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to.\u201d He kicked his jeans aside, leaving himself naked, and helped her to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ve been on some of the most dangerous missions the navy has doled out in the last ten years. Iraq, Afghanistan, tons of third world shitholes. I never worried. I knew my role, knew I was good at my job. I went in, did what I needed to do, and got out. I even woke up in the desert once with a viper\u2019s fangs about six inches from my face. My heart may have raced a little then. But I was never truly afraid of anything until you came back into my life and I realized how much I still loved you. Knowing that you could utter one Shakespearian character\u2019s name and walk out forever scared me more than anything, ever.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip to hold in a sob, clutched his shoulders, and looked right into his eyes. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p> <p>Logan stepped close, eliminating her personal space and pressing his body against hers. His hands trembled as he grabbed her face. With his jaw clenched, his stare delved deep, past her eyes, right into her soul. \u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><p>The tears took over again, blurring her vision of Logan, but Tara felt him all around her, somehow inside her. She might not have any visible tattoos to remind herself of him, but he was indelibly imprinted on her heart. \u201cI love you. I don\u2019t think I ever stopped. I tried everything I could think of to cut you out of my heart.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cBut you were always there.\u201d</p><p>Pain tore across his face. \u201cThat night I came to your house a few years ago?\u201d</p><p>God, that night. \u201cAnd I slammed the door in your face. I\u2019m sorry. It was like you had a sixth sense. I was just getting together with Brad, thinking that maybe he\u2019d be different and that I could love him. We\u2019d planned to . . . spend that night together for the first time.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, wishing she didn\u2019t have to give him such a truth, but if he wanted it, Tara wouldn\u2019t hide.</p> <p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Seeing you, even for two seconds, flipped some sort of switch in me. As soon as I saw you, I finally felt the excitement, yearning, and need I\u2019d been trying to manufacture with someone else for years. It only took me a second to realize that you gave me everything I\u2019d been searching for, and you didn\u2019t even have to speak a word. I got angry. Then I panicked. I knew Brad would see it all over my face. So I slammed the door, told him that I wasn\u2019t feeling well, and sent him home.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her face closer, whispering against her lips. \u201cI wish to fuck I\u2019d had the courage to knock on your door each day of every single leave home.\u201d</p><p>Fresh tears scalded her cheeks. \u201cYou would have worn me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Cherry. I would have loved you. Christ . . .\u201d</p><p>Logan pulled her tightly against him, wrapping his arms around her, burying his head in her neck. Tara felt him everywhere, his heat all over her, his love running through her, his need simmering in her veins.</p> <p>Gently, she pulled away, then took his hand and led him to the bed. \u201cLove me now?\u201d</p><p>He yanked the dress from her body, then tumbled her down onto the mattress, covering her body with his. \u201cEvery day for the rest of your life, if you\u2019ll let me, Cherry. Marry me?\u201d</p><p>Tara thought her heart would explode. After everything they\u2019d been through, all the years and distance, life experiences and heartbreak, they were going to be together\u2014where they belonged.</p><p>Tears spilled over again as she nodded. \u201cI would love that more than anything.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s smile dazzled her, and the genuine warmth and happiness in his eyes was infectious. In that moment, Tara felt deep down that they\u2019d finally overcome everything. As soon as they finished this mission, they could plan a wonderful, perfect life together.</p><p>With one hand anchored on her hip and the other wrapped around her nape, Logan began sliding into her body, feeding her wet pussy one slow, hard inch at a time. The friction of his cock sinking into her clasping sheath charged a whirl of tingles through her, lighting up something that went heart deep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take good care of you, baby. And I\u2019ll always love you,\u201d he whispered against her mouth. \u201cIt may not have been the most romantic proposal you\u2019ve ever received, but it\u2019s the most sincere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d she whispered, then covered his lips with her own, tangling his tongue with hers as if she could drink in every part of him and keep him with her forever.</p> <p>As he pressed deeper, Tara\u2019s need to have all of him surged. She lifted and wriggled, head tossed back. Logan kissed her exposed throat and ground his hips to her, detonating a new flurry of sensation through her.</p><p>They weren\u2019t just joining bodies, and she knew it. Felt the tendrils of the fragile love they\u2019d both clung to over the years thicken and grow, curling around them with every sweet, slow glide deep inside her. With every thrust, she panted out her pleasure, then held her breath as he withdrew, waiting for more of the sweet ache to ramp up to the explosion she needed to feel all the way down to her soul.</p><p>\u201cWill you trust me, Cherry?\u201d His gaze pleaded with her, saying what he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know exactly what he sought, but in that moment, it didn\u2019t matter. Whatever he did\u2014whatever he wanted\u2014would give her pleasure.</p><p>\u201cYes. Always.\u201d</p><p>His smile of joy was almost blinding as he slowly kissed her, their lips and breaths entwined reverently. Then withdrew from her.</p><p>With a gentle nudge, he rolled her to her stomach, disappeared for a moment, then returned to the bed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to take this slow and gentle, baby. I only want to make you feel good. If you don\u2019t like anything, just tell me.\u201d</p><p>Tara had a pretty good idea what he wanted, and her heart skipped. \u201cHmm. You don\u2019t sound much like the badass Dom now.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and pressed a kiss to her shoulder. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve got a lifetime to unleash that side of myself on you, I can afford to take it slow. Trust me, you\u2019ll see the badass again. But right now, there\u2019s nothing more important than simply sharing this moment with you.\u201d</p><p>Joy welled up in her at his words. He wanted to connect them together in body now. In heart. They\u2019d soon do it legally, in the eyes of God and man. And someday, if they hadn\u2019t already, they\u2019d create life together. And live all their days side by side.</p><p>The fact that happiness\u2014that Logan himself\u2014was finally in her grasp made her urgent to have him now that he was finally, truly her man. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>His warm palm glided down her back, over the curve of her waist to cling to her hip. \u201cI want you to belong to me in every way. Will you let me try?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, she felt a cool drizzle of liquid slide in the crevice of her backside. Then he penetrated her there with one finger, silently telling her exactly what he sought.</p><p>Tara gasped as her body swallowed him up, clamped down, and sent jolts of sensation pinging all through her body. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d</p><p>The plug he\u2019d used on her previously had been sexy, awakened nerves she hadn\u2019t realized she possessed. But his fingers, with their warm skin and gliding movements, were something else altogether.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMore. Please.\u201d</p><p>Logan leaned across her back to whisper in her ear, \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>Then he withdrew completely, only to enter her ass again with two fingers, scissoring them apart, stretching her. This time, her body clenched, her skin burning. The utter intimacy of the act, as if he found every part of her worthy of attention, as if he loved and accepted every part of her and wanted to claim her wholly, encouraged her to take a deep breath, relax, and give him everything he wanted.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she cried out.</p><p>His fingers dug into her hip. \u201cEven now I can see your fair skin flushing, baby. There\u2019s nothing more beautiful than your acceptance. Can you take more?\u201d</p><p>For him, she could take anything. If it pleased him, if it brought them closer together, she\u2019d endure anything.</p><p>But this electric touch lighting up her whole body told her this wouldn\u2019t be something she\u2019d have to bear through, but a sizzling pleasure she could only hope to survive.</p><p>\u201cGive me everything, Logan.\u201d</p><p>He moaned against the sensitive skin of her neck. \u201cWhen you say it like that, Cherry\u2014God, it turns me on.\u201d</p><p>Tara felt that in the next moment when he pressed his hard cock against the cheek of her ass, then eased his fingers past her rosette again. One, then two . . . until he added a third. The burn intensified until her skin seemed to be on fire. She hissed in pleasure and thrust back, gyrating to impale herself deeper.</p><p>Logan stilled her with a firm grip on her hip. \u201cEasy, baby. We\u2019re taking this slow. I want this to go down as smooth as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon. Be patient.\u201d</p><p>She moaned in frustration, then cried out when he pressed his fingers deeper into her backside. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to drag out the ropes and discipline to make you behave?\u201d</p><p>Someday\u2014probably soon\u2014he would. Tara could picture herself bound helplessly to his bed while he tormented her body slowly, mercilessly, until she begged him to fill her anywhere, everywhere.</p><p>Today, she understood his need for a gentler approach. They were mutually acknowledging not only pleasure, but the bond of their love for one another. Every touch felt profound.</p><p>With firm, slow strokes, he thrust his fingers deeper into her backside, spreading tender kisses across her back. \u201cHow\u2019s that, Cherry?\u201d</p><p>Heavenly. She whimpered at those thick fingers inside her. She felt invaded and somehow conquered\u2014yet still loved. Logan was opening her up to one of the most intimate acts possible, yet with every word and deed, he treated her with care, mindful of her pleasure and pain. And there was a bit of both that blended together to saturate her with startling pleasure.</p><p>He stilled. \u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo good,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cWhen I get inside you, it\u2019s going to sting, maybe even hurt a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to give myself to you, please you.\u201d</p><p>Logan leaned across her back, wrapping his arm around her to caress her belly. \u201cThe beautiful submissive I\u2019ve always wanted inside the perfect woman I\u2019ll always love. I feel humbled.\u201d</p><p>Bliss exploded through her heart, then magnified as he glided his hand down her belly, settling it possessively over her mound. As one of his fingers slid between her slick folds, grazing her clit, Tara eased her head back on a slow groan.</p><p>Logan dropped his chin over her shoulder until they touched cheek to cheek. The rough coolness against the fever heating hers flared more need inside her, spinning a heavy ache all through her blood. She arched, melting into him.</p><p>\u201cI feel so desired,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>With a gentle withdrawal, Logan removed his fingers from her backside, then spread more lube over the tender area. He disappeared for a moment, and Tara listened to the sounds he made around the room\u2014the opening of a drawer, then ripping of cardboard, the clink of plastic. Vaguely, she wondered what he was doing, then decided it didn\u2019t matter. Whatever he did was for her greater pleasure, their heartfelt connection. Eyes still closed, she smiled as he made his way back to the bed and the mattress behind her dipped under his weight.</p><p>\u201cYou are desired, Cherry. I\u2019ve always wanted you.\u201d He aligned himself behind her, hand curled around her hip, and fit the bulbous head of his cock against her rosette. \u201cI will always want you.\u201d</p><p>A gasp replaced her reply as he eased into her, one slow torturous inch at a time. Her flesh stretched. The burn returned. Logan was not just longer, but thicker, and he paused when the tight ring of muscle there resisted his entry.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay, baby. Take a deep breath for me. That\u2019s it. Relax. Good girl. Now arch your back and push out.\u201d</p><p>She did so as he used his hands to spread her cheeks apart, opening her even wider just for him. As he pushed forward, she braced herself, willing him past the constriction to fill her deep.</p><p>\u201cDamn, this is so . . .\u201d He groaned. \u201cFuck, you\u2019re so tight. The sight of you taking me here is killing me. I want all of you. Relax for me a bit more. Keep pushing out. Yeah.\u201d The sound was a long moan.</p><p>Then with a last push that flared her full of searing pain, he slid past the fist-tight muscles and sank inside her.</p><p>A whole new explosion of sensations opened up to her, the deeper he sank. The burning no longer lit her skin, but fired her muscles, igniting her very core. Having him in her pussy was always a pleasure that she could barely put into words, but this felt somehow more intimate, their connection so wordless yet absolute. Everything about the hushed whisper of sheets blending with their mutual moans, in rhythm to their slow, synchronized thrusts felt sacred.</p><p>Finally, Logan slid completely home and wrapped one arm tightly around her, as if he never wanted to let go. \u201cWe\u2019ll take our time because I\u2019d never want to hurt you. I don\u2019t know how long I can hold out against this kind of pleasure, but I want you to feel utterly filled and fulfilled. So I need you to take everything I want to give you, Cherry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He flexed his hips, pressing in just a bit deeper, making her gasp. Making her need even more.</p><p>\u201cI will, Logan,\u201d she gasped. \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her tighter. \u201cThank you for your trust. Spread your legs a bit wider. Perfect.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, something cool and slick probed at the entrance to her pussy, then forged inside, up, up, up, filling her until she thought she\u2019d burst. Then a buzzing sounded between them\u2014and massaged every nerve lining the walls of her pussy.</p> <p>With Logan in her ass, her sex had less space to accommodate the vibrator, and Tara felt every twitch of both toy and man. He held the vibrator deep inside her, its flared tip against her cervix, the outer wings stroking across her swollen clit, as he slowly shoved deep inside her rectum in a slow glide that had her holding her breath.</p><p>The air smelled of her arousal. Her desperate moans began to fill the air as he awakened every sensation in her pussy, her ass, and those tingles tightened into an ache that sent her thrusting back against him in a silent plea for more.</p><p>Never had she felt anything so consuming. When she fell off this edge of need, it would be into a chasm of pleasure unlike any other because it involved her whole body, her whole heart. And the man she loved would go with her, well pleased with the knowledge that she would do anything with or for him because she trusted him completely.</p><p>Behind her, sweat broke out across his chest, mixed with the fine sheen of perspiration slicking her back. Again he plunged into her, driving harder. Urgency tightened his fingertips, which held her still and at his mercy while he fucked her with that vibrator and his thick, unrelenting cock.</p><p>Blood rushed into her clit and the nerves around her rosette\u2014everywhere he touched. The heartbeat surpassed her hard breathing in her head until all she could hear was the roar of her blood rushing. The sensations tightened, began to converge. Tara sobbed. Logan was going to overwhelm her, and she welcomed the chance to completely surrender. He would know then how totally she belonged to him and always would.</p> <p>\u201cYour back is flushing rosy,\u201d he panted. \u201cYour ass is so tight on me, baby. You ready to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d She barely managed to find the breath to sob out.</p><p>He shoved the vibrator in another quarter inch and pulled it right against the front wall of her pussy, so it pulsated against that sensitive spot behind her clit, even as the exterior wings feathered over the screaming little bud.</p><p>\u201cTake me!\u201d he shouted and plunged into her over and over as fast and deep as he could.</p><p>Sensations multiplied, unrelenting. Every ache he created in her pussy, clit, and ass all united to create one huge supernova that had her screaming and fisting the sheets, crying his name, as her body burst with the most white-hot, sublime pleasure she\u2019d ever experienced.</p><p>His breath heavy in her ear, he began to moan, short, frantic sounds as he pounded inside her with one long stroke after another. Then he loosed a long shout so anguished, it was as if pleasure had ripped it from his soul.</p> <p>\u201cCherry!\u201d</p><p>Tara took him, bucked with him. Still not finished with her first orgasm, it stretched into another as she felt the splash of his hot release inside her.</p><p>As their movements settled, stilled, he pulled the vibrator from her pussy and turned it off. The only sound in the room now was their harsh breathing as he collapsed to the bed on top of her, still buried deep in her ass.</p><p>\u201cYou are incredible,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She turned her head, and he kissed her temple, her cheek as she murmured, \u201cHey, you stole my line.\u201d</p><p>He palmed her head gently. \u201cI meant everything I said. I love you. I want to marry you.\u201d</p><p>Their lovemaking had suffused her with an inner glow already, but it brightened even more at his words. \u201cI meant what I said. I love you, too. I will marry you.\u201d She smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s get this job finished and get on with our lives.\u201d</p><p>GET on with our lives.</p> <p>That handful of words doused Logan with a bucket of water, robbing him of the most vivid euphoria he\u2019d ever experienced in Tara\u2019s arms. Every muscle had been relaxed, his mind cleared of all but happiness and the love that would fill their tomorrows. The getting on with this job part of her speech didn\u2019t disturb him. He looked forward to that. Getting on with their lives even more so.</p><p>But Adam Sterling stood between them. Again.</p><p>Fuck!</p><p>His mind jolting back online, he rose, padded to the bathroom, and started the shower. What the hell was he going to do? Thoughts chased each other in his head. Tell Tara his suspicions about Adam being his mother\u2019s killer because he\u2019d promised he\u2019d keep no more secrets from her? Or wait to tell her until he had something more than circumstantial evidence and a gut feeling? He\u2019d like to . . . but once they made their way off this island, Adam would be waiting. If the fucker had in fact killed Amanda and threatened his own stepdaughter multiple times, then Logan couldn\u2019t risk Tara being alone with him ever again.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt a soft hand on her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re already thinking pretty hard.\u201d</p><p>Tara was supposed to be focused on the mission now. This would only mess with her head. And cause a potential rift between them just as they were truly connecting. But he\u2019d lost her once because he hadn\u2019t come clean. History could have easily repeated itself today, if she hadn\u2019t been forgiving. Logan knew better than to risk it a third time.</p><p>The warm smile that curled her lips fell. \u201cSomething\u2019s really bothering you. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in, Cherry.\u201d He helped her into the shower, avoiding her concerned expression as he climbed in after her.</p><p>Closing his eyes, he took hold of her face and pressed his lips to hers reverently. He never wanted Tara to doubt his love for her again. Whatever he said, he did so out of caution and devotion . . . though she might not see it that way.</p><p>She pulled away. \u201cLogan, you\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p><p>He finally looked at her. \u201cI want you to listen to me with an open mind because I know what I\u2019m about to say will be hard for you to hear. Remember that I would never intentionally hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>Apprehension skittered across her face. \u201cO-Okay.\u201d</p><p>Logan clutched her against him, praying that she understood his good intentions and that this wasn\u2019t the last time he held her. \u201cYour stepfather killed my mother.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>TARA stared at Logan, her brain replaying his words over and over. They simply wouldn\u2019t compute. He had to be wrong. \u201cNo. That\u2019s not\u2014no.\u201d</p><p>She tried to thrash out of his embrace. The water from the hot shower should have made her skin slick enough to slip away.</p><p>Logan held tight. \u201cCherry, listen to me. That necklace you\u2019re wearing was my mother\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Adam gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said earlier that you found it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, in his car, but he said he\u2019d bought it for me.\u201d</p><p>With a shake of his head, Logan gripped her tighter. \u201cListen. He kept the necklace as a trophy from his kill. And you found it, so he told you he\u2019d bought it for you to ward off suspicions. But I know that necklace. My father had given it to my mother in a last-ditch attempt to tell her that he cared. She must have been wearing it when Adam killed her, since the police found a thin abrasion around her neck. The medical examiner said it was consistent with something thin and metallic being ripped from her neck. This necklace was the only item missing from the crime scene.\u201d</p><p>Tara flinched as she pictured Logan\u2019s mother dead\u2014and that he\u2019d been the one to find her. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t prove my stepfather took it. I\u2014if your dad bought it for your mom around that time, m-maybe my stepdad also bought one. If they were for sale at the mall or something\u2014\u201d</p><p>With a big hand, he grabbed hold of her pendant and turned it over. \u201cThis dent on the back, right here.\u201d He pointed. \u201cDid you ever notice it?\u201d</p><p>How could he know about that? \u201cYeah, after I\u2019d been wearing it for a while. I always assumed that I\u2019d accidentally slammed it in my jewelry box or set something on it.\u201d</p><p>Logan clutched it in his fist. \u201cMy sister\u2019s pet parrot bit it. I remember Mom crying when she realized the stupid bird had damaged the gold.\u201d</p><p>Stomach plummeting to her knees, Tara listened as the steamy water pelted her back in a hard sting. His accusations were even more merciless. Denial clawed down to her bones. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the exact same dent. Because it\u2019s gold, it\u2019s somewhat f-fragile and . . .\u201d</p><p>With a growl, he grabbed her shoulders. \u201cI know this is hard to accept, but I\u2019m telling the truth. My mother\u2019s necklace disappeared at nearly the same time you found one exactly like it, with the exact same damage. If your stepfather killed my mother, then he threatened to kill you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would never!\u201d Tara wrenched away. \u201cThat man took me in when he didn\u2019t have to. He raised me from the time I was twelve. He cared for me even before my mother died. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019d\u2014\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThreaten to kill you? If you wearing that necklace around me could implicate him as a killer and send him to prison from firstdegree murder for twenty to life, hell yeah, he\u2019d threaten you. Even before he killed my mother, he tried every way possible to separate us without success. But once you\u2019d found that, he had to step up his game to keep me from ever seeing it, Cherry. Or I would have known. Even if he\u2019d gotten rid of that necklace, he couldn\u2019t have me around in case some other tell gave him away.\u201d</p><p>Tara stared, blinked. She heard the words, heard the logic . . . but just couldn\u2019t wrap her head around the idea that Adam had killed anyone in cold blood or threatened to do the same to her. \u201cI\u2014it just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s hard to take in, but I\u2019m not making this up.\u201d He slammed a fist into the shower\u2019s tile wall. \u201cI\u2019m almost positive that the son of a bitch killed my mother. We all suspected that she\u2019d been seeing someone. Think back. Was Adam dating then?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, she searched her memory, but the shock made her hazy. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Adam dated quietly. I never paid attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe their relationship went sour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam had dated before and ended relationships amicably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so something else went wrong. But he killed her; I\u2019d bet my god damn life on that.\u201d</p><p>Tara wrapped her arms around herself and trembled under the hot spray. \u201cWhy are you dumping this . . . theory on me now?\u201d</p><p>He pressed tight lips together. \u201cI just figured it out today, and you don\u2019t want me keeping secrets from you.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, trying to absorb all the shock. \u201cYou were staring at my necklace.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and caressed her hair, fastened his hand around her neck. \u201cCherry, when this mission is over, I can\u2019t risk having you near Adam. He knows you\u2019ve been with me. The son of a bitch may make good on his threat to kill you. He won\u2019t risk me figuring out that he killed my mother.\u201d</p><p>God, his words were pressing in on her like a vise. She covered her face with her hands, still trying to process his accusation. He slung everything at her so damn fast. \u201cLogan . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start with that apologetic tone, Tara, like you\u2019re going to blow me off. I\u2019m asking for your trust, as your fianc\u00e9. As your Dom. I would never want to see you hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not trying to be malicious.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou believe what you\u2019re saying. But . . .\u201d</p><p>Logan looked like he was grasping for patience. \u201cPromise me this: don\u2019t put yourself in the position to be alone with him again until I can get this taken care of.\u201d</p><p>Taken care of? As in . . . \u201cYou\u2019re going to try to have him put away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he committed the crime, and I can prove it, yeah. He killed a woman who was barely forty and left three kids without a mother. Shouldn\u2019t he pay?\u201d</p><p>Tara blinked. If what Logan said was true, yes. \u201cAdam is former FBI. One of the good guys. He\u2019s not a killer.\u201d</p><p>Frustration crested over his features as he backed away. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait and see.\u201d</p><p>AS soon as they stepped from the shower, Logan was relieved to hear the sat phone chirping. At least it would give them both something else to focus on. He pressed down his disappointment. Her reluctance to believe him was a blade in his heart. All the trust he\u2019d been trying to build with her, where the fuck was that? Yes, he was asking for a lot, but she could at least try to believe him?</p><p>Tara charged over to the phone. \u201cJacobs.\u201d</p><p>Once she\u2019d given her security code, Logan could hear the male voice muffled on the other end. In between, she said a lot of \u201cyes, sir\u201d and finally, \u201cwe\u2019ll get on that.\u201d</p><p>Within three minutes, she pressed the button to end the call, then heaved a huge sigh. \u201cSome of the data has been processed. Still no identity on the mysterious owner of Fantasy Key. In all the files, he\u2019s simply referred to as \u2018Sire.\u2019 The analysts were able to find coded references on Kantor\u2019s computer about the slave auctions. The next one is set for Thursday at eleven p.m. The \u2018product\u2019 is being held in the Pit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Logan filtered through the information. \u201cThe \u2018product\u2019 being Darcy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She shivered, and Logan knew she feared for her friend. \u201cThe Pit likely being that dungeon under the resort we found on the blueprints. We need to get down there today, see if there\u2019s a way to break Darcy out. If so, I can talk to them about arresting Kantor, at least. His fingerprints are all over that computer and his user ID is attached to the files. He\u2019s guilty as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is, but I\u2019m sure the Feds want Sire. If we go in too soon with guns blazing, what are the chances we\u2019ll get him? He\u2019ll turn tail and run, then set up shop elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She tossed her head back and stared at the ceiling, uncertainty and anxiety clearly pressing down on her. \u201cBut I can\u2019t let Darcy be sold off\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Logan wished he could do more to set her at ease than talk. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can find someone who can identify Sire. If they don\u2019t know his name, I have to believe that if he\u2019s running a business, he\u2019s been here at some point. Someone must have seen his face or know his identity. I\u2019ll ask Xander to poke around. We\u2019ll do everything possible to nail this bastard.\u201d</p><p>She nodded absently, her mind already turning. In spite of the furious pace of the bombshells coming her way, his Cherry was doing her best to press forward. Again, his pride in her bravery, her intelligence brimmed over. As much as he wanted her blind faith, dealing with the shock of his accusations against Adam would take time; no one could be expected to believe that a beloved family member was a stone-cold killer without proof in a matter of minutes. But she would do anything and everything to both save Darcy and salvage the other mission objectives. Her first objective was to save her fellow agent. The FBI didn\u2019t leave their own behind. Then she had to catch a killer.</p><p>\u201cI think I have an idea.\u201d She bit her lip, still gelling her thoughts. \u201cBut I need to talk to Xander. We\u2019ll need his help.\u201d</p><p>Logan pulled out his phone. \u201cI\u2019ll call him now. We\u2019ll figure this out, baby. We\u2019ll get Darcy free.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d prove to her that her stepfather was a dangerous son of a bitch\u2014while keeping her well loved and safe. Somehow.</p> <p>TARA pushed fruit salad around her plate, avoiding Logan\u2019s glower.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cGot a better plan?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t, and she knew it. They\u2019d been over everything when they\u2019d consulted with Xander. They needed access to the Pit. They suspected that Kantor and Jordan had it. Kantor was damn hard to pin down, but Tara knew exactly how to get near Jordan, even if the dungeon master had been oddly stand-offish since their first day on the island. That man wanted her, and she could use it to her advantage.</p><p>Logan sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re pissing me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubt it will be the last time in our lives.\u201d She tried to smile at him.</p> <p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips together, and she knew he was thinking of all the danger, worrying about her, maybe even brooding about what would happen when she got home and saw Adam. Frankly, that worried her, too. It didn\u2019t seem possible that her stepfather was a killer . . . but Logan seemed so convinced. While he was trying to prove Adam guilty, maybe she could get the real story on the necklace and show Logan that someone else had murdered his mother. Her stepfather and her fianc\u00e9 were never going to be great friends, but she\u2019d like at least a little harmony on holidays, especially for the kids\u2019 sake.</p><p>She blinked. Kids. Wow. Thinking about having them with the man she\u2019d always secretly, deep down loved was magical, a sparkling fantasy she\u2019d never expected to come true. Logan would make a great husband and father. And she\u2019d get to share all the love, passion, and joy with him\u2014just as soon as she rescued Darcy and got off this damn island.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better eat, Cherry. You\u2019re going to need your strength.\u201d A sensual threat threaded his low, growled words.</p><p>She repressed a shiver. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to scare me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m stating a fact. And I want you wet.\u201d</p><p>Tara couldn\u2019t help it; her womb clenched. \u201cI\u2019d ask if all you think about is sex, but that would be a stupid question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re near, I give a full point-one percent attention to other concerns.\u201d</p> <p>He tried to grin, but it wasn\u2019t quite real. Her heart ached for him. She knew her lack of faith in him about his mother\u2019s killer upset him. It hurt her to disappoint Logan, but she needed time to work through this, prove Adam\u2019s innocence. Then they\u2019d talk it all out.</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything else?\u201d Chaz stopped by their table and began collecting their half-empty plates. \u201cDessert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me.\u201d The idea of eating anything else turned her stomach.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d Logan murmured.</p><p>Chaz regarded him with pale, tormented eyes against his olive skin. \u201cAt your three o\u2019clock, see the empty table.\u201d</p><p>Logan glanced out of the corner of his eye. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison, Laken\u2019s friend, was assigned to that table until her departure on Sunday. Jordan lured her to the VIP room last night. I haven\u2019t seen her since and I haven\u2019t been able to reach her.\u201d</p><p>Tara\u2019s blood froze in her veins.</p><p>\u201cHer room attendant is a friend of mine,\u201d Chaz went on. \u201cShe said Allison didn\u2019t sleep in her bed last night. Allison knew I was concerned after Laken\u2019s death, and she was completely freaked about her friend\u2019s murder. She wouldn\u2019t have left without telling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll look into it,\u201d Tara reassured.</p><p>With a tight nod, he turned and left.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet Kantor is also involved in Allison\u2019s disappearance,\u201d Logan muttered.</p><p>Tara nodded, holding in a curse. \u201cI\u2019m guessing he\u2019s the brains on site. He and Jordan probably needed more \u2018product\u2019 for Sire to replace Laken.\u201d</p><p>Logan grimaced. \u201cIf she\u2019d been sold before her death, yes. Allison already told me that she and Laken had bonded because they were both looking for the perfect Dom and didn\u2019t have a lot of family. So no one to miss her for days and days . . .\u201d</p><p>Not what Tara wanted to hear. \u201cTonight, as our plan goes down, keep your eyes and ears open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Logan nodded. \u201cBut I still don\u2019t like any of this.\u201d</p><p>Tara didn\u2019t either, but time was running short and with another woman gone, their options were frighteningly thin.</p><p>SOMEHOW, someway, Tara had to separate Jordan from his allaccess key card for her plan to work. No one was getting into the Pit without it.</p><p>She\u2019d offered herself up as the sacrificial sub, but it took Tara an hour to spot Jordan in the public dungeons, now dressed in leather pants. Amid the crack of whips and the cries of pleasure/pain, he tried to give off the all-American-hero vibe with his winning smile. He\u2019d spiced it up with a bit of badass, punctuated by the barbed-wire tattoo around one of his biceps and his gym-cut abs rippling between peeks of his black leather vest, sans shirt. But his eyes were cuttingly shrewd. Tara sensed this guy was seriously bent.</p><p>She shoved back the urge to shake as she wandered past him wearing next to nothing, putting on her best little-girl-lost face as she watched a middle-aged Dom tie his female sub up to a rack with a series of complicated knots that framed her breasts and thighs, rubbing her nipples or clit whenever the sub moved. Tara didn\u2019t have to fake her eyes widening.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Shibari, little sub. Japanese rope bondage. What are you doing wandering around here without your Dom? Did he leave you again?\u201d</p><p>Tara pretended to look down, clandestinely checking his belt for anything attached and his pockets for any flat areas.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir. He said he was going for water over thirty minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Disapproval poured off him, but he softened it with a caress of his finger down her cheek. Willing herself not to flinch as he settled his knuckle under her chin, Tara allowed him to lift her face.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand the treasure he has in such a sweet sub. You know, Tara, other Doms would welcome the opportunity to care for you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart picked up speed. Was this the first step in separating a vulnerable sub from her protector, pointing out his faults and trying to convince her that she could do better?</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t think he cares for me very much, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Jordan frowned, then held out his hand. \u201cCome with me. We\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>Crap! She couldn\u2019t go anywhere alone with him. Too dangerous. What if Logan and Xander couldn\u2019t follow?</p><p>Fearing that she\u2019d overplayed her hand, she cast her eyes down again. \u201cMaster Logan told me not to wander from this area.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hand. \u201cSo sweetly obedient. Such a shame . . .\u201d He sighed. \u201cThere is a sofa against the wall. That\u2019s not too far.\u201d</p><p>Tara breathed a sigh of relief. It was a bit shadowed for her comfort, but even without a weapon, she was well trained in self-defense. Logan and Xander could still see her. They\u2019d step in if anything went seriously wrong.</p><p>With a nod, she followed. He settled himself on the sofa, then patted his thighs. She hesitated.</p><p>Jordan scowled. \u201cI won\u2019t punish you\u2014yet. You merely look like a sub in need of comfort, and my job is to provide all guests on the dungeon floor what they need.\u201d</p><p>The slime was stretching the privileges attached with his authority, but she did her best to look understanding.</p><p>\u201cMaster Logan might paddle me if he sees me . . . but I could use cuddling.\u201d</p><p>Tara tried not to cringe as she climbed onto his lap and let him put his arms around her. Beneath her left buttock, she felt something flat and hard. With a wriggle, as if trying to get more comfortable, she scooted off the item, only to see a hook at his belt his vest had previously hidden. From there, a thin silver chain dangled that disappeared into the pocket of his leather pants. Bingo!</p><p>\u201cThank you for holding me, Sir,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cI was feeling very alone.\u201d</p><p>Probably a little too forward for someone she\u2019d bet liked to crush girls under his feet, but he took the bait enough and tightened his arms around her. She forced herself to go limp against his chest, swallowing down bile as she thrust her hands under his vest, near his waist. The move put her breasts right in his face, and Jordan didn\u2019t miss an opportunity to ogle.</p><p>Willing her hands not to shake, she thrust her breasts forward and slid her hand to the hook on his belt. She pretended a big sigh, which lifted her cleavage as she thumbed the hook off of his belt loop.</p><p>\u201cYou are very soft, little sub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sir.\u201d</p><p>She tried to think of something to prolong the conversation without arousing his suspicion. In case he suspected she was law enforcement, she couldn\u2019t ask for a tour of the VIP room or say that she\u2019d hoped to see him again. Instead, Tara took a softer approach.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t keep Master Logan\u2019s attention,\u201d she pretended to cry softly, wrapping her fingers around that thin little chain affixed to what she hoped was his access card in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cIt baffles me.\u201d He brushed the hair from her face. \u201cKantor asked me to steer clear of you, but I can\u2019t. You\u2019re a treat to be savored.\u201d</p><p>Tara froze. Why would Kantor do that unless he was suspicious? And why would Jordan tell her unless he was out of the loop? That was a puzzle to solve later.</p><p>For now, she wriggled again on his lap, trying to disguise the slow pull of the card from his pocket. It inched up, a corner sticking out, but with him sitting, she had no way to extract it cleanly.</p><p>She gave the prearranged gesture above Jordan\u2019s head. Within seconds, Logan\u2019s heavy footfalls came barreling toward them. With a glance over her shoulder, she saw him charging like an angry predator bent on tearing apart a lesser male for daring to infringe on his territory. She didn\u2019t think that terrifying expression was totally manufactured.</p><p>Tara scrambled off Jordan\u2019s lap. As he stood, she tugged the card free of his pocket. She yanked it behind her back, holding her breath as Jordan looked down with a puzzled expression. He\u2019d felt her free it. Shit!</p><p>At that moment, Logan came to her rescue, advancing on the dungeon master with blazing eyes and an accusatory finger. Jordan merely puffed out his chest and tried to look intimidating.</p><p>Per their plan, Logan shoved her behind his back. With a clandestine movement, she slipped the key card into his back pocket.</p><p>His posture remained in angry barbarian mode. If this wasn\u2019t an act, she suspected Logan would be forcing a big come-to-Jesus down the dungeon master\u2019s throat. This wasn\u2019t doing much for Logan\u2019s disinterested image.</p><p>\u201cNever put your hands on my sub again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was alone and needed reassurance. I provided it in your inattentive absence.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s entire back tensed. \u201cThe way I treat her is none of your business. Perhaps I was disciplining her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWere you?\u201d Jordan raised a brow.</p><p>\u201cNone of your business. Don\u2019t interfere again with my property. She needs a good punishment, and I\u2019ll give it to her.\u201d</p><p>Tara had to bite her lip to keep her jaw from dropping. Property?</p><p>As Logan whirled and dragged her toward a nearby St. Andrew\u2019s Cross, she didn\u2019t have to pretend too hard to drag her feet. Yes, this had been her idea . . . but that didn\u2019t mean she liked it.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t go tense on me, Cherry,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>All she had to do was trust him.</p><p>When they reached the cross, Logan stopped, adopted his most stern expression, eyes narrowed on her. \u201cWhy am I punishing you, slave?\u201d</p><p>Oh, his Dom voice. It should intimidate her a bit, but he just made her melty. \u201cF\u2014for wandering away from the spot you left me, Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p> <p>Tara did her best to look agitated and uncomfortable. Jordan hadn\u2019t followed, but he was watching. She felt his gaze crawling all over her. \u201cSitting in Master Jordan\u2019s lap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking the comfort you did not have permission to receive, yes. Face the cross.\u201d</p><p>She did as instructed, shivering inside.</p><p>\u201cStrip. Fold your dress neatly and hand it to me.\u201d</p><p>Taking her clothes off in public. Tara tried not to wince. Granted the cross leaned against a wall, so no one would see her breasts or her pussy. But the entire room would see her fleshy ass. Logan liked it, but she still felt ridiculously self-conscious showing a group of strangers the part of herself that she liked least.</p><p>\u201cSlave, you\u2019ve been given an order. Do it now, or I add more punishment.\u201d</p> <p>Blowing out a shuddering breath, Tara reached for the strapless dress and pulled it down. The elastic expanded over her breasts, collapsed again at her waist, flared over her hips, then slithered to the ground, leaving her completely bare.</p><p>Logan caressed her backside, lingering to cup the lower curve as he thumbed the slope. \u201cGod, I love your ass,\u201d he muttered for her ears only, then nudged her to the cross, forcing her to raise her arms.</p><p>All too soon, she was secured to the giant wooden X. Logan selected a whip from the nearby wall\u2014and she swallowed. They hadn\u2019t talked about how he\u2019d punish her. She\u2019d assumed he\u2019d find some soft crop or use his hand, but this whip was nearly as long as his entire body. With a flick of his wrist, he sent it flying through the air, testing its weight. Her heart drummed against her chest.</p><p>At the first snap, she jumped, gasped, then looked over her shoulder. Logan looked frighteningly proficient with the long whip as he sent it flying through the air again.</p><p>Tara closed her eyes. She could do this. Logan wouldn\u2019t really hurt her. All she had to do was trust him.</p><p>Jordan wandered closer.</p><p>On cue, Xander sauntered into the scene under the guise of dungeon monitor, just to the left of the cross, and gave her a reassuring nod when Jordan was watching Logan with the whip.</p><p>\u201cCount for me, slave,\u201d Logan demanded.</p> <p>Her entire body tensed as she waited for the first horrific blow.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Jordan demanded. \u201cThis is one of her soft limits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on it.\u201d</p><p>Jordan cleared his throat. \u201cEven so, we don\u2019t recommend discipline with a six-footer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than able to give my sub the punishment she needs. Stand aside,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be watching.\u201d Jordan glared in his direction. \u201cOne false move, and I\u2019ll step in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Xander whispered to her. \u201cIt\u2019ll hurt more if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Tara forced herself to exhale and release as much tension as she could. Then Logan struck.</p><p>He laid the whip directly across the fleshiest part of her ass. The leather almost caressed her. A slight sting followed, then gently dissipated, leaving behind the haziest of tingles.</p><p>She gasped. \u201cOne.\u201d</p><p>Before she\u2019d taken another breath, Logan brought the whip down again, this time cradling the tender undercurve of her buttocks. The strike was a bit harder, the sensation stronger. As before, as soon as the whip lifted away, a soft nip dissolved into a mellow glow.</p><p>To her shock, she wanted more.</p><p>Wriggling, Tara struggled against her bonds. She was supposed to hate this. For their plan to work, she had to publicly scream her safe word. Instead, Logan was only proving how wonderful he was at making her embarrassingly wet.</p><p>\u201cCount, slave. If I have to remind you again, we\u2019ll start at the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Pretty please.</p><p>She kept the thought to herself and forced a tremble to her voice. \u201cTwo. No more . . . Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d Xander whispered. \u201cSomeone\u2019s got really hard nipples. Did I ever tell you that I love the way you flush when you\u2019re aroused?\u201d</p><p>Tara shot him a dirty look, and she could tell he held in a laugh.</p><p>While she was distracted, Logan flicked the whip at her again, this time across the top of her ass to wind around her hip.</p><p>Okay, that actually stung more on the pain than pleasure side. She hissed, tensed, promised she\u2019d tell Logan off for that shit later.</p><p>Then the pain faded into a bevy of furious tingles dancing under her skin. Warmth sank into her muscles. The feel of it was nothing short of dazzling.</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d she panted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make these last two really count, slave. No complaints. You\u2019ve earned this punishment.\u201d</p><p>Tara nodded, trying to bring her breathing back under control, cool down the hot ache ramping her body up. Damn it, she\u2019d let herself get carried away in the moment with Logan, in the trust they were building. She was gleefully drowning in her love for him.</p><p>But his accusations against her stepfather were a shadow between them.</p><p>The thought had barely crossed her mind when Logan struck again with the rawhide, this time making a vertical strike down her right cheek. That blow more than stung prettily and brought the blood to the surface skin of her ass. It actually hurt.</p><p>Her entire body tensed. Whipping like that she didn\u2019t want, and he still had another lash to give her.</p><p>Panicked breathing set in again. Even though Logan was supposed to scare her, the fear started jacking up her system and messing with her head.</p><p>\u201cPretty welt,\u201d Jordan commented. \u201cI\u2019ll bet she looks good with a truly red ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She needs a matched set,\u201d Logan said loudly. \u201cMaybe a sore backside will keep her off other Doms\u2019 laps.\u201d</p><p>He cracked the whip in the air again, and fear became an icy-hot panic flaring through her veins. Tara knew in her head this was all for show, but her right cheek still throbbed, and they had a plan to set in motion.</p><p>\u201cRomeo!\u201d she screamed.</p><p>Logan ignored her and laid the whip vertically across her left cheek, not quite as hard as the previous lash, but enough to have her gasping again, \u201cRomeo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wimping out of this punishment, slave. I\u2019m not hurting you. You get one more for interrupting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Jordan said sternly. \u201cContinuing after the safe word is against club rules. Let your slave off the cross and provide proper aftercare or I\u2019ll see to her myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t interfere with my slave,\u201d Logan roared, then laid the whip across her thighs.</p><p>This was another gentle stroke, almost a caress, but Tara pushed past the pleasure and played her part with an Oscar-winning scream of pain and terror.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Jordan roared.</p><p>A scuffle and what sounded like a punch or two later, Xander left her side with a muttered, \u201cKeep him busy as long as you can.\u201d Then he was gone.</p><p>\u201cTake this asshole to Kantor\u2019s office and wait with him,\u201d Jordan said to Xander. \u201cI will see to the slave, then meet you there.\u201d Then he addressed Logan with a growl. \u201cMr. Flint, it will be my pleasure to personally escort you off the island.\u201d</p><p>Tara\u2019s heart pounded as Logan put up a staged struggle with Xander, whom he allowed to overpower him eventually. By the time Jordan released her from her bonds, the other two men were gone.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he whispered, her dress thrown over his arm. He sounded like he genuinely cared.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to pretend too hard to shake. The adrenaline was draining from her system, leaving her a shaky mess. Her legs nearly gave out, but Jordan was there, supporting her as he hurried across the floor, toward a locked door.</p><p>Tara wanted to resist going anywhere too private with him, especially naked, but her job was to distract him. Putting up a fight now would only either make him suspicious or angry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sore, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour first whipping?\u201d</p><p>She nodded as he eased the door open and helped her inside. As he flipped on the overhead light, a flare of white brilliance from the overhead bulb nearly blinded her. After a quick glance of a cot, a cabinet, and a small desk with a phone, she squinted her eyes shut against the brightness.</p><p>Jordan helped her to the cot, urging her onto her belly. He cupped the uninjured part of the right cheek of her ass, and she tensed. Having him touch her felt wrong.</p><p>\u201cThey really are pretty welts, but a bit painful until you get used to them. Let me doctor you up.\u201d</p><p>Pretty welts? Yuck. \u201cThank you, Sir.\u201d</p><p>She laid still and tolerated his ministrations, then docilely allowed him to enfold her in his arms. Kantor stopped in as soon as Jordan radioed. Tara told the manager her story haltingly, wasting as much time as possible. The longer she kept them occupied, hopefully the more time Logan and Xander had to investigate the Pit. She just hoped that Kantor didn\u2019t know her cover\u2014and kill her for it.</p><p>USING the access card Tara had swiped from Jordan, Logan let Xander grip his wrists behind his back and lead him into the Pit. Worry bit into his gut for Cherry. She was capable of taking care of herself, but naked, she had no weapon. No way to fight off Jordan if he decided to make a move\u2014or Kantor, if he chose to make her a \u201cproduct.\u201d</p><p>Just outside the door with a small square window, a guard inside a station, surrounded by radios and video monitors, questioned them via intercom, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Xander pressed the button and leaned in. \u201cJordan asked me to bring this troublesome one down here.\u201d</p><p>Assuming that Jordan had the authority to bring someone down here had been a gamble. But since the access card had gotten them down the elevator and into the long hallway, Logan had to assume his name would get them deeper inside the Pit.</p><p>\u201cA male prisoner?\u201d Logan heard the guard\u2019s scowl and suspicion.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s unruly.\u201d Xander sounded like he was straining to keep him subdued, so Logan played along with a little struggle. \u201cJordan wanted him separated from the rest before he hurt someone else. Help me out here.\u201d</p><p>Sending a prayer upward, Logan hoped that making a scuffle now would prevent the guard from calling for Jordan or other backup. So he thrashed again, pretending to fight Xander\u2019s hold.</p><p>Finally, the guard sighed and ordered gruffly, \u201cPut him in the second cage.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Xander opened the door, they wandered into a cold, humid cave\u2014with modern conveniences. Security cameras monitored all the movement inside. Low, recessed lighting shone softly from above, illuminating a row of ten rectangular silver cages, lined up one after the other. The first one held an unconscious brunette Logan knew wasn\u2019t Darcy. He prayed she was only sleeping. The rest of the cages sat empty.</p><p>Shit! Was he too late?</p><p>Logan itched to look around more, find out if there were hidden areas to the Pit, but it would have to wait a few minutes until Xander could get in place.</p><p>Yanking the door of the appointed cage open, Xander shoved Logan inside. As he pushed the door closed, which should have engaged the lock, he slid a piece of thick putty he\u2019d swiped from the maintenance folks over the mechanism.</p><p>\u201cJordan will be back for you,\u201d Xander warned loudly, then turned and headed to the guard station. All he could do now was wait for the charming bastard to work his magic.</p><p>He pretended disinterest as Xander jaunted up the stairs to the security booth. The guard, distrustful at first, refused to let him in. But within ten minutes, the uniformed man had opened the door and was yucking it up with Xander like they were old pals. While the guard was busy slapping his knee and chortling, Xander slipped some contraband narcotic painkiller he\u2019d stolen from the resort\u2019s medical facility into the guy\u2019s coffee.</p><p>In minutes, the guard was slumped against his desk, out cold.</p><p>Logan raced out of the cage. Xander met him halfway and handed him the key and a semiautomatic he\u2019d smuggled onto the island. \u201cHeads up. Ruben, the guard, says that Sire actually arrived on the island an hour ago. He\u2019s here, in the next room.\u201d</p><p>Seriously? Adrenaline charged his system into hyperdrive. Fuck, he wanted to nail this son of a bitch. After his mother\u2019s death, any prick who preyed on women deserved to be a dead prick, and Logan would be more than happy to help make that happen.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Xander raced to the sleeping brunette in the first cage. \u201cGo. I\u2019ll check her. Hit the office first and view the security feed. A few of the cameras point to a location I don\u2019t know. Hell, none of this \u2018Pit\u2019 area is familiar, but there\u2019s nasty shit going on wherever those cameras are pointing.\u201d</p><p>With any luck, he could catch a glimpse of Sire, maybe even get him on film.</p><p>With a nod, Logan turned and jogged past a wide steel door that made up almost an entire wall. The shiny shiver panel had a key swipe beside it.</p><p>From the other side, he heard a distinctly female scream.</p> <p>Logan\u2019s first instinct was to race in there and start kicking some ass, but he forced patience. It wouldn\u2019t help the woman to go in there half-cocked and unprepared for who- or whatever he had to fight. And give Sire any opportunity to escape.</p><p>With a quick jog to the security station, Logan shoved the slumped guard aside and stared at the rows of video monitors before him. There had to be three dozen total, covering angles all over the resort. He could see the dungeon where he\u2019d whipped Cherry earlier, but that station was in use by others now. Tara was nowhere in sight.</p><p>Tamping down his panic, Logan forced himself to breathe and stay focused on the plan, on finding Sire. He scanned the bank of three other monitors off to his right, one depicting an image with a corrugated-steel door in the background. Two submissives had been chained naked to the cave wall. The first, a blonde with short, wispy hair, was being whipped mercilessly with a crop. Darcy? Perhaps. From the back he couldn\u2019t tell. The other prisoner knelt at the feet of a dungeon monitor he recognized, tears streaming down her face. Her enhanced breasts bobbed as the bastard shoved his cock down her throat. When her tormenter stepped back for a moment, Logan got a good look at her face. Allison.</p><p>Xander raced into the booth. \u201cThe brunette says she\u2019s being punished by her Dom and doesn\u2019t want to be removed.\u201d</p><p>Logan bit back a curse. \u201cWe\u2019ll come back for her.\u201d</p> <p>He had to save the women clearly in peril and search for Sire before he worried about the other woman. Since he didn\u2019t see another male in the image, Logan feared Sire had already left, but he could hunt. Then he\u2019d find his way back to Tara. With the slaving mastermind roaming the island and her alone with the management, every minute they were apart was another minute that ratcheted up his fear.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Xander directed.</p><p>Just before he turned to leave the security booth, Logan glanced at the feed from inside the secured area of the Pit. A hidden door opened, and what he saw next made his blood freeze with sheer, blinding terror.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>LOGAN stared, his mind racing, trying to comprehend exactly what he was seeing. Holy son of a bitch!</p><p>Adam fucking Sterling, Tara\u2019s stepfather, stood ogling the two bound women as Allison had her mouth raped by a resort employee. The other sobbed, chained against the wall, her ass a throbbing red. The bastard barked something at her, and Logan damned the fact that he couldn\u2019t hear any audio with the images. But Adam spoke a universal language when he picked up the crop at the woman\u2019s feet and ruthlessly swatted her ass again. The poor girl\u2019s shoulders shook harder as she did her best to curl into herself and escape.</p> <p>\u201cC\u2019mon, man!\u201d Xander tugged on his arm. \u201cThe one in the suit could be Sire. We\u2019ve got to get in there and save the women before something bad happens to them.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, the pieces of the puzzle snapped into place. Before her death, his mother had organized a neighborhood effort to locate a missing teen. Sterling, with his law enforcement connections, would have had access to the investigation. Maybe Amanda had gotten too close to the truth. Since Adam had killed his mom so brutally, Logan knew the bastard was capable of most anything. That he was in the Pit, now fondling the \u201cproducts,\u201d told him that if the man wasn\u2019t Sire, he was up to his neck with the bastard in human trafficking. Rage screamed through Logan\u2019s brain, and he wanted to kill Adam Sterling.</p><p>And when Tara learned all of this . . . Logan almost hadn\u2019t wanted to be right about Tara\u2019s stepfather, for her sake. If his assumptions were right, Sterling\u2019s involvement in this sex ring, in Darcy\u2019s abduction, was going to absolutely crush her.</p><p>Cold fury swept over Logan as he pulled the semi-automatic from his waistband, checking the ammo clip. \u201cThe fucker in the suit is mine.\u201d</p><p>Xander studied him with a nod. \u201cI\u2019ll mop up the other one.\u201d</p><p>As soon as they rounded up these two, he\u2019d have to get to the sat phone, call the Feds, get them in here to start making arrests. They already had a small team waiting after conferring earlier today, so they could swoop in and arrest Kantor, Jordan, and Sterling\u2014if he was still alive.</p><p>\u201cAny other guards in there?\u201d Logan gestured to the cameras that captured Adam Sterling\u2019s face in crisp black and white.</p><p>Xander shook his head. \u201cThere were two earlier. Now I only see one.\u201d</p> <p>A lucky break, except that meant there was a handy exit inside that room. He had to hustle now.</p><p>Logan ran out of the guard station, Xander following on his heels. He grabbed the key card and swiped it through the device. Surprising them wasn\u2019t possible with the clanging metal door announcing their arrival, but he backed against the adjacent wall, gun drawn, hoping to draw the guard out. If they could take him out quickly, Adam Sterling would be all alone with Logan and his wrath.</p><p>As the door clattered up, and the dungeon monitor pulled out of Allison\u2019s mouth and wandered out of the cramped holding area, zipping up his leathers and looking mighty pissed. Xander glanced at Logan, who stood on the other side of the door and mouthed, Go.</p><p>With a nod, Xander pushed away from the side of the cave and met the other dungeon monitor. Logan peeked around the corner.</p><p>When he recognized one of his own in the uniform of the Fantasy Key dungeon, the guy relaxed slightly. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan sent me to check on things.\u201d</p><p>The other man raked a hand through his blond waves, blue eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re the new guy. When did he let you in on this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been here long.\u201d Xander leveled the statement at the other Dom as if it was obvious.</p><p>\u201cA few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I worked here for years before. Took a break for a bit, but I\u2019m back. Of course I know about all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He frowned. \u201cKantor didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKantor doesn\u2019t tell anybody shit.\u201d Xander rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d the other man agreed. \u201cLike we\u2019re not important. Without us, how would keep the pussy subdued long enough to make money on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. So, the girls are okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJordan is a suspicious asshole. I didn\u2019t fuck them. You tell him that.\u201d</p><p>Xander shrugged. \u201cLet me see for myself, and I will.\u201d</p><p>Logan listened, thankful again for his friend. Without him, this investigation would have taken much longer. Xander was a natural bullshitter and his connections had proven very useful.</p><p>The dungeon monitor scowled, then sighed. \u201cSee, they\u2019re here, mostly unharmed. Help me clear a space. Sire just left and said to make room for another last-minute delivery.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s blood ran cold. Another delivery? And Sire had left? It had to be Sterling. God, this was going to destroy Tara. But now everything made sense. Kantor and Jordan had backed away from Tara so fast because Sterling had told them she was FBI and to keep their distance. If her stay ended without incident, then Darcy would be sold, Sterling would be richer, and it would take the Bureau more time to amass another investigation. By then, Tara\u2019s stepfather could have hidden his tracks\u2014again.</p><p>Fuck! Logan clenched a fist. He had to get to Cherry before Adam did.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he getting the other girl?\u201d Xander asked.</p><p>The other guy shrugged. \u201cThe usual, I guess. Some slut dumb enough to come here with an inattentive Dom, and no one back home to care what happens to her. Help me move this body.\u201d</p><p>Body? Fighting the fear that he was too late to save Darcy, Logan shoved down his anxiety as Xander, walking beside the guy, stuck out a leg. The other man stumbled, and Xander grabbed his hair, shoving his forehead against the wall. The dungeon monitor slithered to the ground.</p><p>That obstacle cleared, Logan ran into the little room, hurdling over the fallen man to the two shackled women. He couldn\u2019t stay long, but he had to make sure they were okay\u2014and find out about that body.</p><p>Xander rescued Allison, swiping the keys from the unconscious man to unshackle her. As soon as he\u2019d finished, he tossed the keys to Logan, who hustled to the other woman. The second he got a look at her, even beneath her dirty face and red nose, he recognized Darcy from her picture.</p><p>\u201cAgent Miles?\u201d he prompted softly.</p><p>Her head came up as he released her wrists. She wiped her tears away. \u201cWho w-wants to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Logan Edgington, a Navy SEAL, here to rescue you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m Miles. Help me. They k-killed Robert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent York?\u201d Shock reverberated through him.</p><p>She pointed to a bundled blanket in the corner. Horror whitened her face, and she looked like she was torn between racing to the body and fearing to set her eyes on her dead coworker and boyfriend.</p><p>Darcy began sobbing. \u201cHe abandoned his assignment as Tara\u2019s pretend Dom because he knew it would never work. He took a job as a waiter to save me, but they discovered him.\u201d</p><p>And killed him. That\u2019s who they\u2019d been talking about when he and Cherry had broken into Kantor\u2019s office.</p><p>Logan made his way to the rumpled blanket and pulled it up, shielding Darcy\u2019s view with his own body. Sure enough, York had been double-tapped in the back of the head. Half his face was gone.</p><p>Grimacing, he covered the body again. Darcy began sobbing uncontrollably.</p><p>Logan went to her. \u201cYou\u2019re safe. More agents will be en route soon. I\u2019m here with your friend, Agent Jacobs.\u201d</p><p>Darcy\u2019s blue eyes widened. \u201cOh God, Tara is here? Her stepfather is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSire. I know. I\u2019ve got to go hunt him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuickly! I think he means to grab her and sell her with the rest of us\u2014tonight!\u201d</p><p>KANTOR stared at her through accusing eyes while Jordan fawned over her barely clad body. Tara held in her nausea and terror. The resort manager knew exactly who and what she was; Tara could see that all over his face. The dungeon master didn\u2019t have a clue.</p><p>Her heart broke into a gallop in her chest as she considered her possible methods of escape. They were absolutely limited, but she had to wait, give Logan and Xander as much time as possible to locate Darcy.</p><p>Surreptitiously, she stared at the clock on the wall. They\u2019d been holed up in here for nearly thirty minutes. She and Logan had agreed to rendezvous back at their suite at eleven, twenty minutes from now. She racked her brain to come up with some other distraction to keep the two men busy, but she\u2019d nearly overplayed her pitiful sub hand, dragged out her medical attention, and Kantor would never believe it if she came on to him. So now what?</p><p>The phone at the manager\u2019s belt rang. At the distinctive ring, a</p><p>smug grin uglied up his face, and he all but jumped to answer. \u201cYes.\u201d He paused, listen. \u201cYes, right away.\u201d</p><p>As Kantor slipped the phone back into its carrier, he smiled. \u201cJordan, take a spin around the Pit and check on things.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell no. What had just happened? Had someone caught Logan and Xander? Was that why he\u2019d looked so self-satisfied? Just in case, she couldn\u2019t let Jordan go down there and sound the alarm. And God knew that she had to avoid being alone with Kantor at all costs.</p><p>She clutched Jordan tighter and batted her lashes at him. \u201cDon\u2019t go! I\u2019d love to play, Sir. I would be more than happy to continue my submissive journey with someone as experienced as you.\u201d</p><p>Jordan\u2019s chest all but puffed up, and he turned Kantor. \u201cI\u2019ll take her with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your brains out of your dick and get the hell out,\u201d Kantor snarled.</p><p>Jordan released her and left with a scowl. Tara backed away from the manager.</p><p>\u201cNow, you\u2019ll come to my office with me,\u201d he demanded, gesturing impatiently.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>God, she wished she\u2019d been able to hide a weapon anywhere on her body. Now being in character was really going to come back to haunt her.</p><p>\u201cMy dungeon master may be fooled by a pretty face and a submissive disposition, but I\u2019m a businessman, not a Dom.\u201d</p><p>Then he pulled a Glock from the back of his waistband and pointed it at her. \u201cYou and I both know that you\u2019re here to bring me down. I won\u2019t let it happen. I didn\u2019t tell Jordan about you because he\u2019s a terrible actor. He would have given us away. Come with me now.\u201d</p><p>As he grabbed her wrist and pulled, Tara\u2019s mind raced. She had no doubt that if he got her alone, he\u2019d either kill her or sell her. No way was she going down without a fight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a moment, she dropped her gaze and her shoulders in defeat, let Kantor get comfortable with the thought that the little woman wasn\u2019t going to struggle. As soon as she drew closer, she shocked him with a knee to the balls, then delivered a round kick to his face. He stood as much as his aching testicles allowed and threw her a mean right cross. Tara bobbed out of the way, sent her left fist screaming into his jaw, then her right into his nose in a nasty one-two. When the impact of the blow shoved his head back, she charged, grabbing his salt-and-pepper waves, then slammed his forehead onto the desk beside him once, twice.</p><p>With a grunt, he fell to the floor.</p><p>Panting, her fists hurting like hell, Tara took a moment to shove Kantor under the desk, throw the blanket on the cot over him in case someone peeked in, then looked around for some rope or cuffs to secure him with, but found none. With time of the essence, she could only pick up his gun that had skittered across the floor, then shove her way into her sheer dress, which Jordan had left behind.</p><p>Turning off the light to the little room, she locked the door behind her and rushed out onto the dungeon floor. She had to find Jordan and occupy him before he reached the Pit. But she also had to get that backup out here pronto. The second Kantor woke, he\u2019d be screaming for her blood. Their cover would be blown, and they\u2019d be unable to go back to their room and contact Bocelli and the team for help. Outnumbered and outgunned, they\u2019d be toast.</p> <p>And Logan had no idea what was coming for him. There wasn\u2019t a moment to lose. She had to hope that Kantor would be out for a while.</p><p>Clutching the gun in the folds of her dress, she scanned the dungeon for Jordan, but he was nowhere to be found. Damn!</p><p>Running all the way to her room, taking stairwells and lessertraveled hallways in case Kantor came to, she finally reached her room. It was empty, and Logan\u2019s smell lingered here. Their intimacies hung in the air, and she prayed desperately that they both came out of this alive.</p><p>She dug out the sat phone and quickly placed her distress call. A male voice advised her that backup was en route and would be on the island within minutes.</p><p>Tara just prayed she could find Logan and that they lived that long.</p> <p>She stared at the bedside clock, anxiety eating into her gut. Logan should be back by now. But eleven rolled around and he didn\u2019t return, she called Xander\u2019s cell. No answer.</p><p>Anxiety became panic as Tara threw on a pair of harem pants in an earthy bronze and a matching bandeau top that covered her breasts but didn\u2019t conceal the rosy pink of her areolas. Very submissive, and she wondered where\u2014and when\u2014Logan had bought this stuff for her. She hoped like hell she got the opportunity to ask. At the moment, she was more thankful that the sheer pants, while showcasing her bare pussy, had pockets at each thigh. She slipped the gun into one, a can of pepper spray into the other.</p><p>As much as she wanted the shoes for running, she didn\u2019t dare tip off any of the other resort employees that anything was amiss. Instead, she left her previous costume on the bed. If Logan returned, he\u2019d know at a glance that she\u2019d been here and hopefully wait for her.</p><p>Cracking the door open, Tara peeked down the hall both ways. She didn\u2019t see Kantor. Pressing her hand to her nervous stomach, she stepped into the hall and around the first corner, toward the dark hall that led to the Pit\u2019s elevator.</p><p>Her hallway joined with another in a T, and as she passed it, she turned to see a familiar, out-of-place figure in a dark suit bearing down on her.</p><p>\u201cTara!\u201d</p> <p>She blinked and tried to reconcile his appearance. \u201cAdam . . . what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God, I found you.\u201d He pressed a hand over his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve been worried sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be here!\u201d She was on a mission, and he knew it. Why the hell would he turn up here and blow her cover?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Tara. It\u2019s over. Darcy has been recovered.\u201d</p><p>A warm rush of profound relief went through her. \u201cThank God! How did you find out?\u201d</p><p>Adam sent her a sheepish smile. \u201cI asked Bocelli to contact me once things were over. He knows how worried I\u2019ve been, so he gave me the green light to find you and take you home.\u201d</p><p>She held in a groan. As a former agent, Adam had to know that showing up here at the conclusion of her mission was, in short, embarrassing. If her own stepfather didn\u2019t think she could take care of herself, then no one who worked with her would believe she could, either.</p><p>But she\u2019d worry about that later. Darcy was okay, and that was more important than anything. Except . . . \u201cWho found her? And how? Were there other active agents on the island?\u201d And why hadn\u2019t she known about them?</p> <p>\u201cBocelli didn\u2019t give me details. I was just so grateful that he let me come and assure myself that you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Tara frowned. That sounded unusual. Bocelli wasn\u2019t old enough to be soft or sentimental. He struck her as a straight-up agent with a will of steel, so the man telling her stepfather that he could take her home right away, before debriefing? Really unusual. And she\u2019d just talked to someone from the ground team Bocelli had set up moments ago. None of them had said a word about the mission being over to her. How would Adam have been close enough to get the news and get here?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been so worried, and I\u2019m relieved that you\u2019re unharmed and well.\u201d</p><p>This felt like a bizarre dream, where things happened but none of the events were logical. She frowned.</p><p>\u201cPrincess?\u201d He walked closer and held out an arm, as if he meant to embrace her. \u201cCome with me, and I\u2019ll take you to Darcy.\u201d</p><p>Your stepfather killed my mother. Logan\u2019s words flashed through her head. Twenty minutes ago, she would have never believed it. She wasn\u2019t sure she believed it now. Her stepfather was former FBI\u2014one of the good guys, right? He\u2019d never exhibited a violent tendency. But his presence here didn\u2019t add up.</p><p>What reason would Adam have for lying to her?</p><p>Up the hallway, the sudden pounding of footsteps grabbed her attention. She turned to find Logan charging up the hallway, gun in hand, pointed at her stepfather.</p><p>Did Logan mean to subdue Adam or just shoot him?</p><p>\u201cTara!\u201d Fury poured from his eyes as he stopped a few inches from her and jerked on her arm. \u201cGet behind me.\u201d</p><p>She resisted. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t veer in the least, just lined Adam up in his pistol\u2019s sights. \u201cMove out of the way. Not only did this fucker kill my mother, he runs this place and tried to sell your friend, Darcy, to a Saudi oil sheik. Xander is with her now. She\u2019s a mess. Adam\u2019s minions \u2018disciplined\u2019 her within an inch of her life. He had Robert York killed as she watched. Baby, your stepfather is Sire.\u201d</p><p>Everything was happening too fast. Tara blinked, rooted in place, staring at her stepfather. Logan\u2019s allegations sounded so far-fetched, so surreal. She waited for Adam to vociferously deny them.</p><p>Her stepfather glared at Logan. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot to hurl at my head. You can\u2019t back that up. You just hate me because I tried to separate Tara from your bad influence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lying motherfucker.\u201d</p><p>Adam loosed a long-suffering sigh. \u201cAre you trying to hurt her again? Wasn\u2019t once enough? You brutally broke her heart and left her, then you walk back into her life and expect her to trust you\u201d\u2014he snapped his fingers\u2014\u201clike that? She\u2019s wiser to you now. This attempt to come between us . . . are you hoping to win her over, separate her from my support, then crush her again? Is this some sick game to you?\u201d</p><p>Tara sucked in a breath. She stung as if she\u2019d been slapped all over. Adam repeated all the secret worries she\u2019d harbored since Logan walked back into her life. He gave voice to her fears that she was nothing more than a trophy to him.</p><p>A glance at Logan showed the stark angles of his face set with determination, his mouth a grim line, and his eyes the iciest blue she\u2019d ever seen. He wouldn\u2019t look at her, didn\u2019t say a word against those accusations. Inside, her heart broke a little. She wanted to take her stepfather\u2019s arm, and sink into the familiar parental comfort he offered, ask him to take her to Darcy.</p><p>But a niggle of doubt tugged at her.</p><p>\u201cLogan, just . . . put the gun away.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re going to believe him?\u201d</p><p>Honestly, she didn\u2019t know. Neither man\u2019s story made sense. \u201cI\u2019m trying to sort it out, but I can\u2019t think when you\u2019re pointing that in his direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lowering the gun. Don\u2019t ask me to trust him. On surveillance monitors, I saw him in the Pit, watching some sadist take a crop to Darcy while she cried, and he just smiled, Tara. Smiled, like it was a sunny fucking day, then sliced her with the crop himself.\u201d</p><p>Tara flinched. Logan had seen that? Really?</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>Because that didn\u2019t make sense. But then Adam\u2019s presence here didn\u2019t make sense, either. Why had her stepfather been lying to her?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d She turned to her stepfather.</p><p>\u201cBesides Logan losing his sanity? I told you, princess. The mission is complete. Darcy\u2019s been found. You can come home with me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, Tara,\u201d Logan roared. \u201cYou should know by now that I love you and I\u2019d never hurt you again.\u201d He shifted his attention to Adam. \u201cI left her once\u2014because you threatened her life. I\u2019d blow you away before I let you touch a hair on her head. I know who and what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. A would-be murderer and criminal mastermind capable of a worldwide sex ring. Tara, does that really sound like me?\u201d</p><p>No, and that\u2019s what she struggled with. Though he had retired from the FBI, he seemed like a fairly easygoing guy. He went to church nearly every Sunday, was respectful to everyone he met. He\u2019d never had so much as a parking ticket.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t denied Logan\u2019s accusations, either.</p><p>\u201cCherry, he\u2019s trying to confuse you,\u201d Logan insisted. \u201cAsk yourself how many identities he assumed as a field agent for cases over the years, sometimes for weeks or months. Maybe the good suburban dad was just another cover so that no one would suspect his real activities. Please, baby, believe me and step behind me.\u201d</p><p>Her big, bad Dom was begging her. An angry scowl slipped across her stepfather\u2019s face, but he just shook his head, as if befuddled.</p><p>Glancing between the two men, Tara realized that it didn\u2019t matter if Adam had bullied her boss into letting him on the island or if Logan was mistaken in thinking that he\u2019d seen Adam on the video monitors. Whatever was happening here, she had to choose between them. Past or present? Head or heart? Her thoughts spun as she heard the mental clock ticking.</p><p>\u201cTara,\u201d Adam said with a sigh in his \u201cbe reasonable\u201d tone.</p><p>Logan gripped his gun tighter with one hand and held out his other to her. \u201cPlease. Let me keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Instinctively, the submissive in her didn\u2019t want to disappoint her Dom. The woman inside her responded, seeking the shelter of her man. The memories from earlier that day seared across her brain, the trust she had placed in Logan\u2019s hands and the gentle way he\u2019d worshipped her body, revered her. He\u2019d felt perfect entwined around her, packed tightly inside her. He\u2019d felt like home and tomorrow and all the things she craved. If all Logan wanted was some twisted revenge, he\u2019d given up the opportunity to avenge his mother\u2019s death with an easy kill. Instead, he\u2019d started explaining to her. Even if he proved to be wrong about Adam, he was the right man for her. If she failed to put her faith in him now, they would have nothing.</p><p>Heart beating wildly, she reached out to him, their fingers brushing, his a warm flare of warmth and strength.</p><p>Before he could take her in his arms, an arm curled around her waist and dragged her backward against a hard chest. She felt cold metal jammed up against her temple. It took her a moment to realize that her stepfather now captured her in his forceful grip and held a gun to her head.</p><p>\u201cAdam!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, you ungrateful bitch. I raised you, and you did what? Chose the guy who fucked you good over me.\u201d</p><p>Shock washed over her. Ice spread through her veins as she struggled against his hold. \u201cWhat are you doing? Let go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it, you motherfucker! Let go now,\u201d Logan yelled. \u201cOr I\u2019ll blow your head off.\u201d</p><p>Adam held firm, the gun biting into the soft skin of her temple. Tara realized that he was using her as a shield so that Logan couldn\u2019t take a clear shot. And Logan clearly knew it. Terror and frustration burned from his blue eyes. He stared down the gun at Adam like an avenger, his finger taut around the trigger, just waiting for any opportunity.</p><p>\u201cNot before I blow hers off first.\u201d Adam\u2019s arm moved from her middle to loop around her throat\u2014and squeezed her windpipe.</p><p>Tara choked. Before this, she would have never believed her own stepfather capable of hurting her. Now, she had no doubt he\u2019d do exactly as threatened. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she gasped out.</p><p>\u201cOnce my buddies in the Bureau told me that you\u2019d broken into Kantor\u2019s office, I knew it was only a matter of time before you figured everything out. You always did well with puzzles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d But Tara had the sinking feeling that she knew.</p><p>Her stepfather was everything Logan had claimed. Inside, the fury and betrayal swirled, beating deep. She thrashed and elbowed Adam in the stomach. He grunted but held firm.</p> <p>\u201cNice try, but I\u2019m much better at this game than you, princess. I played it for twenty years for the Bureau. I got a lovely watch and a very modest pension as a \u2018fuck you very much\u2019 from Uncle Sam. That wasn\u2019t going to do. I had the contacts to go into a very lucrative business for myself, so I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelling women and little girls against their will as sex slaves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop with the righteous indignation,\u201d he tsked. \u201cYou\u2019re young and you have twenty-plus productive, money-making years ahead of you. You couldn\u2019t possibly understand until you get older and your nest egg isn\u2019t enough to really live on. I wasn\u2019t about to suffer the rest of my days in the thoroughly middle class income bracket after risking my life over and over. These girls don\u2019t matter. Most come from poor families who can barely feed them. And the women . . . I\u2019m just giving them a permanent outlet for their kink.\u201d</p><p>She gasped, shock like a sledgehammer in her chest, pounding all the air out of her lungs.</p><p>Damn it, why hadn\u2019t she believed Logan sooner?</p> <p>Now, it might be too late. Because Tara knew for certain that Adam had no problem stepping over her dead body to get what he wanted.</p><p>Snaring Logan\u2019s gaze with hers, she let the thousand regrets pouring through her show on her face. She might not see him again or live long enough to say it, but she wanted Logan to know how sorry she was. She wished she could tell him one last time how much she loved him and to go on with life if something happened to her. No more hiding in clubs, denying himself the pleasure of laughter, passion, and love.</p><p>But she\u2019d run out of time to say anything.</p><p>\u201cAnother two days\u2014at most\u2014and you both would have known the truth,\u201d Adam said. \u201cKantor has been sloppy, and left too much of a paper trail to me. But I\u2019m not going down. I just need a little more money and the means to skip this country and live rich. I got both when I found a buyer for you, princess: a Russian businessman with my Swiss bank account numbers, a taste for sadism and redheads, and a private plane waiting to take me anywhere I want to go.\u201d</p><p>Terror staked its way through her heart. Adam meant every word of that.</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body,\u201d Logan vowed.</p> <p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s the best part. You\u2019re going to put your gun down and stand still like a good target, or I\u2019m going to instruct my Russian friend to make the rest of Tara\u2019s life as painful as possible.\u201d</p><p>Adam had deceived her, and lately she\u2019d dismissed his odd hours and phone calls as necessary for someone self-employed in the security business. But it was the activity necessary to make money from human trafficking. If he\u2019d betrayed her about everything else, he\u2019d do exactly as he threatened.</p><p>She had to keep him talking. The more time she could buy, the more likely she or Logan would think of some way out of this mess, or her FBI backup would find them.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you kill Logan\u2019s mother?\u201d she blurted.</p><p>At the question, Logan jerked as if he\u2019d been jolted with a live wire.</p><p>\u201cYou finally figured that out?\u201d Adam addressed Logan.</p><p>\u201cThe necklace,\u201d he choked out.</p><p>Adam nodded. \u201cThat chain was in my way when I was trying to slash her throat, so I yanked it off. I thought it was a fun little joke that Tara wore it. I knew I absolutely had to separate you then, but even before I killed your mother, I was never going to let you have Tara. I\u2019d already begun plotting ways to separate the two of you, you little prick. Your mother was just another nuisance to be dealt with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas she your girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Adam scoffed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have minded that. She was one fine-looking piece of ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to rip you apart, motherfucker,\u201d Logan vowed.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re going to shut up and die like Amanda did. She tried to do good when she found out about my business venture. I was just getting off the ground, and discovered the sweetest little fifteen-year-old runaway\u2014one of Amanda\u2019s students. For a few hundred thousand dollars, I found her a new master in Saudi. Your mother somehow caught on, and was about to blow the whistle. I couldn\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>So Adam had ended her life.</p><p>The truth crushed her, and she felt so terrible for Logan and all he\u2019d endured.</p><p>Suddenly, Kantor limped down the hall behind Logan, who stiffened when he heard the threat at his back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve finally arrived,\u201d Adam drawled.</p><p>\u201cYour bitch of a stepdaughter took me by surprise and beat my face into a table.\u201d He rubbed at the goose egg on his forehead.</p><p>Adam laughed, then tightened his hand on her neck. \u201cI\u2019ll let you repay her back in pain on the airplane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight, the little cunt. We just have to get rid of Romeo first.\u201d</p><p>The last puzzle piece snapped into place. That voice, the reason she\u2019d recognized it when she and Logan had first reached the resort\u2014he\u2019d called Adam hundreds of times over the years.</p><p>She gasped. \u201cKantor is an assumed name. You used to be FBI!\u201d</p><p>Kantor smiled, still massaging his forehead. \u201cAgent Stoltz, at your service. Took you long enough. Too bad for you that it\u2019s too late. Did you know that, before I left the Bureau, I was known as the Interrogator. For the last few years, they sent me to Guantanamo to extract information from the detainees. You and I are going to have a lot of fun.\u201d The he pressed his gun to the back of Logan\u2019s head. \u201cWeapon down, and I\u2019ll make this quick and painless.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, he lowered the gun to his side. Tara pressed her lips together as terror spiked through her blood and her heart raced. This couldn\u2019t be happening. But she and Logan were outnumbered and outgunned. And she had only herself to blame. If she\u2019d listened to Logan sooner, if she\u2019d trusted what he was trying to tell her . . . if she\u2019d tried harder to retract the shield around her heart, this would have all turned out differently.</p><p>Now, Logan was going to die for her mistake.</p><p>Tara refused to let that happen without a fight.</p><p>\u201cNow put it on the ground,\u201d Kantor instructed.</p><p>Locking gazes with Logan, she tried to communicate silently to be ready for anything. He tensed and lifted his chin like he understood.</p><p>Suddenly, she went completely limp in Adam\u2019s grasp. Unprepared to hold her dead weight, he stumbled forward and lost his grip on her. As she went down, Tara shoved her elbow in his balls. Predictably, he grunted and doubled over. Then she reached in her pocket, grabbing the gun she\u2019d stashed there, and pointed it straight at Adam with one hand. With the other, she surprised him by misting the pepper spray in his eyes. As he coughed and struggled, she kicked his weapon out of his hand.</p><p>Behind her she heard the blast of a gun, and whirled with a shriek to find plaster flying from the wall beside Logan\u2019s head. Kantor had grabbed the barrel of Logan\u2019s gun and shoved up, forcing Logan\u2019s finger away from the trigger. With his other hand, Kantor was lining up his kill shot.</p><p>Tara didn\u2019t blink, didn\u2019t hesitate; she pulled the trigger. The bullet hit Kantor right between the eyes.</p><p>Logan turned back to her, and his eyes grew impossibly wide, fixed behind her. She whirled to see Adam with a wicked blade raised, coming straight for her.</p><p>She threw herself against the side wall, then gained her stance to fire. But there was no need. A heartbeat later, Logan squeezed off three rounds. The first two hit him right in the heart, the third dead between the eyes, each shot\u2019s retort deafening in the low-ceilinged hallway.</p><p>Adam slithered down, dead before he hit the ground.</p><p>Then she stood alone with Logan, their enemies vanquished. The enormity of the night hit her immediately. The adrenaline racing through her blood began to drain, making her cold and shaky. He stood, staring at her, not moving, not speaking. A look of such anguish crossed his face that Tara\u2019s heart wept for him.</p><p>She ran to him and threw herself in his arms, praying that he could still love her, even though she\u2019d waited so long to trust and believe him. If Logan let her, she\u2019d spend the rest of her days making it up to him.</p><p>He hesitated, breathing so hard, his entire body so tense. Tara stiffened. Did he resent her? Had she killed his affection?</p><p>\u201cLogan?\u201d she touched his arm, her eyes searching his wild blue stare.</p><p>Finally, he wrapped two steely arms around her, dragged her body against his, and buried his face in her neck, their hearts beating as one. \u201cThank God you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>A long moment later, he pulled back enough to stare straight into her eyes, and she was shocked to find her tears mirrored in his.</p><p>As she opened her mouth to ask him why, Bocelli came running down the hall, gun drawn with a team of agents at his back. And Darcy, wrapped in a blanket, brought up the rear, hair matted, cheeks smudged, ankles and wrists bruised and screaming red.</p><p>\u201cOh my God! Are you all right?\u201d Tara asked her friend.</p><p>Darcy nodded mutely, shivering.</p><p>There was no way Tara could not hug her. Darcy sobbed on her shoulder, and Tara let her cling. No doubt, her friend had been through a terrible ordeal, but she vowed to be with her during every step of her recovery, both mentally and physically.</p><p>Bocelli broke them apart, then gently cupped Darcy\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve seen Tara is okay, cooperate with medical, Miles. That\u2019s an order.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and allowed an agent to take her away.</p><p>Her boss turned back to her. \u201cGood work, Jacobs. We\u2019ve already arrested Jordan, the little slime.\u201d Then he spotted Adam\u2019s body, and a scowl passed over his face. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>Tara gave him a shaky nod. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine, sir.\u201d</p><p>He took her by the elbow. \u201cLet\u2019s go, so you can tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>Bocelli nudged her forward, and she looked back to find Logan watching, staring. With all the evidence and the carnage, she knew it would be long hours, maybe even days, before she saw him again. She wished she knew what the hell he was thinking. Logan was glad she was still in one piece, but as long as it had taken her to really listen and trust him . . . could he still love her?</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>LOGAN paced outside the quaint white gazebo at one of the parks in Tyler, Texas, as the small crowd chatted, awaiting his brother and sister-in-law\u2019s vow renewal. Hunter and Kata had been married one year today. The sun was shining and the birds were singing. He was damn happy for them both.</p><p>But misery tore at his insides. The ceremony started in ten minutes, and Tara hadn\u2019t yet appeared.</p><p>Kata\u2019s saucy blond friend, Hallie, winked at him. Whether flirting or trying to cheer him up, he didn\u2019t know and he didn\u2019t care. And yeah, he could probably be more gracious, but it was fucking hard when his heart was breaking. The rest of his life stretched out as bleakly as the twelve years before, with only one brief week of paradise between.</p><p>And now, paradise was gone.</p><p>He replayed those events on Fantasy Key in his head, over and over. Tara had eventually trusted him, come to see that he was right about her stepfather. Hell, they\u2019d saved one another\u2019s lives that day. She\u2019d trusted him with her safety, her body. Even her heart . . .</p><p>Or so he\u2019d thought.</p><p>Was she angry that he\u2019d killed her stepfather? Sterling had been a crappy excuse for a human being and deserved to be six feet under. The world was better off without him. With a few bullets, Logan had erased him. But Adam had been a father figure to her for many years\u2014the only one she\u2019d had. The fact that he was a class-A scumbag didn\u2019t mean Tara had been ready to see him dead. Or have her fianc\u00e9 put him there.</p><p>Or did that last battle at Fantasy Key put him into the ex category again?</p><p>Logan clutched the box in his pocket, looking again and again toward the parking lot, willing her to show up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to wear out the grass if you keep pacing over the same spot.\u201d</p><p>Logan turned. Hunter looked happy, far more relaxed than he\u2019d ever been before marriage. He was happy for his brother\u2014but he wanted that for himself.</p><p>\u201cIs it time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost. Don\u2019t worry; she\u2019ll show.\u201d</p><p>Logan had to face facts. \u201cShe won\u2019t. I\u2019ve been calling and texting for two days. Not a single reply other than \u2018We\u2019ll talk soon.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cTara will make good on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe too much has happened.\u201d Logan paced again.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the only thing that\u2019s too much is your worrying.\u201d</p><p>Just then, Kata wandered over, looking absolutely gorgeous in a white sundress that was cleavage central. Her sable hair was piled in an upswept do with baby\u2019s breath. A simple veil hung halfway down her back. She glowed with happiness, all but floating into her husband\u2019s arms, who cuddled her close and pressed a tender kiss on her lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi, honey. Did I tell you that you look absolutely stunning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d She sent him a saucy grin. \u201cBut feel free to say it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look stunning. How soon can we ditch this party and, um . . .\u201d</p><p>She slapped his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019ll be later. If you\u2019re not good, much later. Caleb and my mom are calling this their first \u2018official\u2019 date. We have to stay and chaperon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. C\u2019mon, my dad will be on his best behavior.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cI\u2019m not sure my mom will. I think she has it bad for your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, we should let the grown-ups have their fun so we can go off and have our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to hear this.\u201d Logan was tempted to shove his fingers in his ears and tune out.</p><p>Kata laughed, then faced her husband. \u201cHumor me, huh? This is the wedding we didn\u2019t have for our friends and family.\u201d</p> <p>Hunter turned sober. \u201cI was teasing you, honey. Of course. I know how important it is to you that your brother is here. And . . . when it\u2019s time for the honeymoon activities, I\u2019ll be really excited.\u201d</p><p>Logan winced. \u201cTake your sucking face and whatever else privately, huh?\u201d</p><p>With a laugh, Kata kissed his cheek and walked toward Hallie, acting as one of her bridesmaids. Kimber, their sister, had agreed to stand in as the other. In the background, Kimber\u2019s husband Deke juggled their son, little Caleb, currently trying to scramble from his dad\u2019s hold and test his newfound walking skills. Hunter followed the others, laughing at the baby\u2019s antics.</p><p>\u201cYou sound grouchy,\u201d a familiar voice said. He whirled to find Xander and scowled.</p><p>\u201cI only invited you so you can help me get really drunk if Tara doesn\u2019t show. I don\u2019t need your shit.\u201d</p><p>Xander laughed. Yeah, he was always freaking amused when someone else\u2019s balls were on the chopping block.</p> <p>\u201cI heard you on the phone with Thorpe the other day. He wants your membership card?\u201d</p><p>Another sore spot with Logan. Tara didn\u2019t yet wear his collar, and he couldn\u2019t prove that she\u2019d agreed to be his wife. If she\u2019d get her sweet ass over here, he\u2019d take care of that. If she didn\u2019t . . . \u201cI told him to shove his membership up his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely grouchy. Really, Logan. Hunter is right; she\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, then where has she been for two fucking days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but trust me, she loved you then, and she loves you now. You just have to know that, no matter what happened in the past, she\u2019s opened her heart to you again.\u201d</p><p>God, how badly he wanted to believe that.</p><p>Fuck this. Even if Tara didn\u2019t show today, he would come after her on his next leave. And his next. And every single one after that, each and every day, until he wore her down. Because he wasn\u2019t living his life without the one woman who meant more to him than every sunrise, every moment of life, every single breath.</p><p>Logan let out a deep, shaky breath. \u201cThanks, man.\u201d</p> <p>Xander slanted a teasing glance at him. \u201cYou think I\u2019m full of shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a friendly bet? Fifty bucks.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at his watch. Two minutes before the ceremony. She wasn\u2019t coming. And she\u2019d be facing a really pissed off SEAL at her door as soon as this shindig was over.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Unfortunately, it would be the easiest money he\u2019d ever made.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Xander smiled broadly. \u201cPay up.\u201d</p><p>With a lift of his chin toward the parking lot, he clapped Logan on the back.</p><p>He whirled\u2014and his heart jumped into his throat. Fuck me, she\u2019s here.</p><p>Blood rushed and roared through his body, most of it leaving his brain and settling into his cock when he saw her in a gorgeous dress in a shimmering gold, its thin spaghetti straps clinging to her pale, lightly freckled shoulders. He didn\u2019t think she was wearing a bra. She flashed him a shy smile, her eyes peeking out from behind her bangs.</p><p>Hell, if she was wearing a bra, he could get it off in a few seconds with a little privacy. Her panties, too.</p><p>Tara slowed as he jogged toward her. She stopped a good two feet away. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>That was it? Just \u2018hi\u2019?</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming. Are you okay?\u201d Damn, he didn\u2019t know what else to say.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou said that you wanted me here, so I wasn\u2019t going to miss it.\u201d</p><p>Hope wrenched at his heart, but there was still a long way between showing up to his brother\u2019s vow renewal and wearing his ring. For all he knew, she\u2019d come out of pity\u2014or guilt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d He took her hand, pulled her closer, gratified when she didn\u2019t pull away. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you. I\u2019m sorry about . . .\u201d God, he could be here all day apologizing for his multitude of sins\u2014everything from shooting Adam to being a complete pervert. \u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes as she drifted near, but her face tightened, her pouty lips trembling. Damn it, she was going to cry.</p><p>\u201cCherry . . .\u201d</p><p>Covering her mouth with her hand, she tensed and sniffled. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019ve missed you s-so much. I owe you my life. And I\u2019m so sorry that it was almost too late before I believed y-you. I spent so many years trying to convince myself that I hated you.\u201d She drew in a shuddering breath.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t pissed at him?</p><p>\u201cGet it all out,\u201d he encouraged. As long as she was talking, he was listening.</p><p>\u201cI knew better. I never got over you. But when confronted with a choice, when I knew that you would never deceive me again, I didn\u2019t let go of what I thought was the truth and just believe you. I know trust in any relationship is really important, but in a BDSM rel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He wanted to take her in his arms so badly, but feared she\u2019d only back away until they\u2019d hashed it all out. \u201cTrust is important, but I shattered yours completely years ago. You had a long time to live with that betrayal. You had no way of knowing that I\u2019d never stopped loving you. I\u2019m willing to take whatever time we need to build the trust back up.\u201d</p><p>She sobbed again, and this time he did pull her close, right against his chest. Damn, it felt so good to have her against him, and he cradled her head against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBut you needed me to believe you, and I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to believe me,\u201d he corrected. \u201cI needed you to come through, and you did. If you want to talk about it, I\u2019m here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the last few days getting myself in order. I\u2019ve had my debriefing, and psych has checked me out. Darcy was released from the hospital this morning, and I got her settled back at her place. She misses Robert, but she\u2019s going to be okay. I finished making Adam\u2019s burial arrangements. I also quit the FBI. I\u2019m not cut out for fieldwork, and my relationship with Adam hasn\u2019t helped my reputation at the bureau. I\u2019ll take my analysis experience elsewhere. And during all that, I\u2019ve worried that I ruined everything between you and me.\u201d</p><p>Hope settled into his chest, making it light until he felt like he could soar.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about what you think I feel or could happen. Just answer me one question, Cherry: Do you trust me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019ll never doubt you again.\u201d She did her best not to sob.</p><p>He thumbed away her tears. \u201cGood girl. He was your stepfather, so I know it must be hard. I wanted him to have to stand up for his crimes, face the families of his victims and pay. Shooting him wasn\u2019t my plan. But I couldn\u2019t let him hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry he hurt you.\u201d She caressed his cheek, thumbed his dark brow. \u201cThat he killed your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had nothing to do with that,\u201d he assured. \u201cNow tell me, what do you want next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to spend my life with you. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Relief and delight poured through him, a warm fall of abiding devotion and a yearning to grow old with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry he took so many years away from us,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re together now.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a watery smile, shades of joy lighting up her face this time. \u201cYeah . . .\u201d</p><p>Logan dragged her over to a nearby folding chair and fished in his pocket as he pulled Tara into his lap. \u201cCherry, baby, I loved you at sixteen. I love you now. I\u2019ll love you always. This was my mother\u2019s.\u201d He opened the box and showed her Amanda\u2019s engagement ring.</p><p>She gasped and started crying again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be honored if you\u2019d be my wife. Will you belong to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She nodded as fresh tears streamed down her cheeks. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Tara threw her arms around his neck, and he curled her into his embrace, burying his face in her neck. They\u2019d overcome so much, grown back together, and were stronger for it. Now, they only had to pick a date and a time and state their vows before God and their loved ones, and he would hold her for the rest of their days.</p><p>Around them, people started clapping, and his brother rushed over to give him a hearty handshake. As he tried to get his shit together and not bawl like a baby, he slid the engagement ring on Tara\u2019s finger. She gave him the most beautiful smile. It lit up his heart.</p><p>\u201cWhen can we get married?\u201d The idea of waiting another six months for his next leave didn\u2019t thrill him, but he knew it took more than ten minutes to plan a wedding. Damn it, he didn\u2019t need all the pomp; he just needed Tara.</p><p>\u201cThe sooner the better.\u201d She put his hand on her flat belly, then bit her lip and smiled again. \u201cJust in case.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit! He hoped that their love had taken root in her womb and would soon give them a child. If he had his way, the first of several.</p><p>\u201cHow does a quick trip to Vegas sound?\u201d he asked, grinning. \u201cLike tonight?\u201d</p><p>In the background, his father groaned, and Hunter just laughed.</p><p>Tara kissed his lips soundly. \u201cIt sounds perfect.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
